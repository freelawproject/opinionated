The wife appeals the denial of her request to move with the parties\u2019 children to another part of the Commonwealth and challenges the equal distribution of the marital estate in the judgment, as well as the award of \u201cshared legal and physical custody\u201d of the children. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>We vacate and remand the portions of the judgment regarding relocation, but affirm the distribution of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\"><em>Background. </em>In 2006, the wife filed a complaint for divorce after twenty years of marriage. The couple has three children. At the time of trial in July, 2008, the oldest was sixteen years old; the middle child was twelve years old; and the youngest was eleven years old. The children all live with the wife in West Boylston. The husband lives and works nearby in Worcester. An earlier trial on custody matters occurred in December, 2007. In January, 2008, a Probate and Family Court judge denied the wife\u2019s request to move with the children to Scituate.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">In September, 2008, a Probate and Family Court judge entered a judgment on all of the divorce matters. First, with respect to custody, the judgment ordered, \u201cThe parties shall have shared legal and physical custody of the three minor children of the marriage\u201d; \u201cThe children shall reside with the Wife\u201d; and \u201cThe Husband shall have the right to visit the minor children at reasonable times, as agreed upon by the parties.\u201d Second, the judgment ordered the husband to pay to the wife $1,000 per week in child support and $600 per week in alimony. Finally, the judgment split the marital estate in half, with each party keeping assets valued at $1,864,321.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>A trial judge\u2019s findings of fact will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. <em>Barboza </em>v. McLeod, 447 Mass. 468, 469 (2006). The reviewing court will give due regard to the judge\u2019s assessment and determination of the credibility of the witnesses in making such findings. See <em>Custody of Eleanor, </em>414 Mass. 795, 800 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">I. <em>Relocation. </em>The wife filed a pretrial motion seeking permission to move with the children to Scituate, located seventy-five miles east of West Boylston. The judge applied G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 30, governing removal from the Commonwealth, and rejected the wife\u2019s petition. The wife challenges this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">A. <em>Legal principles. </em>As a preliminary matter, we note that G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 30, governs removal of children from the Commonwealth and does not address relocation within the Commonwealth. We apply out-of-State removal principles to instate moves, however, not routinely, but in cases \u201cwhere the relocation would evidently involve significant disruption of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>noncustodial parent\u2019s visitation rights and the parents cannot agree.\u201d <em>D.C. </em>v. <em>J.S., </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 351, 355-356 (2003). We observed in that case that \u201cthe consideration and evaluation of the visitation and other custodial conditions for the child that would result from relocation to a distant part of the State will resemble those applied to removal beyond the State boundaries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355. See <em>Tammaro </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, 16 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 254, 262 n.13 (2010) (noting that \u201ceven where a parent does not seek to leave the Commonwealth, we have suggested\u201d that the considerations \u201cwill resemble those applied to removal beyond the State boundaries\u201d), quoting from <em>D.C. </em>v. <em>J.S., supra </em>at 355. While the defendant suggests that the law is unsettled, we reiterate that out-of-State considerations informing G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 30, also apply to situations such as the one before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 30, provides that a minor child of divorced parents who has resided in Massachusetts for at least five years, if too young to consent on his or her own behalf, may not be removed from the Commonwealth without the consent of both parents \u201cunless the court upon cause shown otherwise orders.\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 30. \u201cThe purpose of the statute is to preserve the rights of the noncustodial parent and the child to maintain and develop their familial relationships, while balancing those rights with the right of the custodial parent to seek a better life for himself or herself in another State or country.\u201d <em>Wakefield </em>v. <em>Hegarty, 61 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 772, 775 (2006), citing <em>Yannas </em>v. <em>Frondistou-Yannas, </em>395 Mass. 704, 712 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">If the party seeking removal is the sole physical custodian of the children, then the judge must consider the request under a two-prong test set forth in <em>Yannas, supra. </em>First, the judge must consider \u201cwhether there is a good reason \"for the move, a \u2018real advantage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wakefield, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Yannas, supra </em>at 711. \u201c[T]he \u2018real advantage\u2019 test is grounded on the \u2018realization that after a divorce a child\u2019s subsequent relationship with both parents can never be the same as before the divorce . . . [and] the child\u2019s quality of life and style of life are provided by the custodial parent.\u2019 . . . Although the best interests of the children always remain the paramount concern, [b]ecause the best interests of a child are so interwoven with the well-being of the custodial parent, the determination of the child\u2019s best interest requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>that the interests of the custodial parent be taken in account.\u201d <em>Yannas, supra </em>at 710, quoting from <em>Cooper v. Cooper, 99 </em>N.J. 42, 54 (1984). See <em>Cartledge </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 577, 579-580 (2006). To satisfy the real advantage test, the custodial parent must demonstrate \u201ca good, sincere reason for wanting to remove to another jurisdiction\u201d and \u201cthe soundness of the reason for moving, and the presence or absence of a motive to deprive the noncustodial parent of reasonable visitation.\u201d <em>Yannas, supra </em>at 711. \u201c[A] supportable finding that there is no \u2018real advantage\u2019 to the custodial parent from the contemplated move ends the analysis.\u201d <em>Pizzino v. Miller, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 870 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Second, if the \u201creal advantage\u201d test is satisfied, the judge must consider whether the move is in the best interests of the children; thus \u201cconsideration must be given \u2018to whether the quality of the child\u2019s life may be improved by the change (including any improvement flowing from an improvement in the quality of the custodial parent\u2019s life), the possible adverse effect of the elimination or curtailment of the child\u2019s association with the noncustodial parent, and the extent to which moving or not moving will affect the emotional, physical, or developmental needs of the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 870-871, quoting from <em>Yannas, supra </em>at 711. \u201cAssuming the judge\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous, we review [the] determination of the best interests of the children only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>447 Mass. 177, 184 (2006), citing <em>White </em>v. <em>Laingor, </em>434 Mass. 64, 68 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">If the party seeking removal shares physical custody with the other parent, then the \u201c \u2018best interest\u2019 calculus pertaining to removal is appreciably different from those situations that involve sole physical custody. . . . Where physical custody is shared, a judge\u2019s willingness to elevate one parent\u2019s interest in relocating freely with the children is often diminished. No longer is the fortune of simply one custodial parent so tightly interwoven with that of the child; both parents have equal rights and responsibilities with respect to the children. The importance to the children of one parent\u2019s advantage in relocating outside the Commonwealth is greatly reduced.\u201d <em>Mason, supra </em>at 184-185. \u201cThe advantage to the moving parent becomes merely a relevant factor in the over-all inquiry of what is in the child\u2019s best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>interests.\u201d <em>Wakefield, supra </em>at 776, citing <em>Mason, supra </em>at 185-186.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In sum, <em>Yannas </em>and <em>Mason, </em>standing at two different ends of the custody spectrum, present two models for the relocation calculus. See <em>Prenaveau </em>v. <em>Prenaveau, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 131, 139 (2009) (\u201cThe main distinction between the analyses set forth in the two cases comes down to the weight that should be assigned to the benefits that relocation would provide the parent seeking the move\u201d). How a custody arrangement is categorically defined will trigger which of the two models is implicated. That being said, we should note that such categorizations, which are utilized inconsistently, can obscure more than they illuminate. See <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Virusso, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 326, 329 n.9 (2007). As we have noted approvingly, \u201c[t]erms such as legal and physical custody are eschewed by the [American Law Institute], which instead utilizes terminology descriptive of the various, discrete parenting responsibilities and functions, \u2018recognizing] that different types of involvement in the child\u2019s life are relevant in different ways to the various allocation issues.\u2019 \u201d <em>Abbott, supra, </em>quoting from ALI Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution \u00a7 2.03 comment g (2002). It thus follows that even where the party seeking to relocate is characterized as the sole physical custodian, it is appropriate that the decisional calculus consider the functional responsibilities and involvement of each parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">B. <em>Shared or sole physical custody. </em>Here the trial judge found that the wife and husband shared physical custody and applied the \u201cbest interests\u201d standard in denying the wife\u2019s petition to relocate within the Commonwealth. The wife challenges the finding that the parents shared physical custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">\u201cShared physical custody contemplates that \u2018a child shall have periods of residing with and being under the supervision of each parent . . . assuring] . . . frequent and continued contact with both parents.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mason, supra </em>at 182, quoting from G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31. Sole physical custody \u201cgenerally reflects that the children reside with only one parent \u2018subject to reasonable visitation by the other parent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mason, supra, </em>quoting from G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31. Our cases make clear that, in the context of spousal relocation, the label we attach to custodial status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>results from a factual inquiry. See, e.g., <em>Wakefield, supra </em>at 776; <em>Abbott, supra </em>at 329 n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In <em>Mason, </em>the court held that the parents had \u201cjoint physical and legal custody\u201d where during the marriage both parents took the part of a primary caretaker and after separation the \u201cparents divided physical custody of the children approximately equally.\u201d <em>Mason, supra </em>at 178-179. By contrast, a parent has sole physical custody where the parent \u201chas been exercising the clear majority of custodial responsibility.\u201d <em>Abbott, supra </em>at 330, quoting from ALI Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution \u00a7 2.17(4)(a). <em>ha. Abbott, </em>we applied the \u201creal advantage\u201d standard to the wife\u2019s request to move out-of-State where the son lived primarily with her but also visited with the father on a regular basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Here, as in <em>Abbott </em>and unlike in <em>Mason, </em>the children reside with the wife in her home, subject to reasonable visitation with the father. The children spend the majority of their evenings with the wife and spend every other weekend and one night per week with the husband. Furthermore, the judge found that the wife has \u201cunquestionably been more of a traditional \u2018custodian\u2019 in terms of the supervision of the children and all that entails.\u201d Finally, in the divorce judgment, the judge ordered that the children would reside with the wife with the husband having the right to visit at reasonable times, as agreed upon by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">In sum, although the judge characterized the custody arrangement as \u201cshared legal and physical custody,\u201d because the substance of the order places the children under the primary responsibility of the wife, and because as a functional matter that has indeed been the wife\u2019s responsibility, we conclude that the wife had sole physical custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">C. <em>Real advantage analysis.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We review the judge\u2019s decision in light of our conclusion that the wife has sole physical custody of the three minor children of the marriage. The wife testified that her marital difficulties caused her to see a psychotherapist. She testified that she sought to leave West Boylston, a small town of 6,000 people, because she felt uncomfortable living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>near and running into (once a week) the woman with whom the husband had been having a romantic relationship.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She said that she felt \u201chorrible\u201d when she encountered this woman. She wanted to locate to Scituate because she believed that there would be a support network which could help restore her emotional health. The wife testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">\u201cIt\u2019s been very emotional and very difficult. I\u2019m essentially a sad person, and I think my only chance to be happy again, and the only chance for my children to see me as a happy person, is to move to Scituate. ... I think it would be like seeing the sun again. I think I would have a new lease in life. It would be a fresh start. I would have new enthusiasm for life. I would have new energy for life and for my children. I would be . . . surrounded by people who have been exceptionally supportive and who love me, and who love my children. I think it would make a huge, huge impact on my life and the life of my children \u2014 positive impact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The judge noted that the move would accomplish the wife\u2019s goal of not having contact with the woman with whom her husband was having a relationship, but concluded that, under step one of the \u201creal advantage\u201d analysis, she failed to present sufficient evidence demonstrating a \u201creal advantage\u201d to her in moving with the children to Scituate. The judge found that \u201c[wjhile there are individuals in the Scituate area with whom [the wife] has long-standing relationships and [who] would provide her emotional and even child-related support, it is also the case that [the wife] has no particular personal, family or professional roots in Scituate.\u201d The judge also pointed out that the wife did not offer any specificity as to her professional plans as an attorney with \u201cno employment investigation other than to receive Probate and Family Court fee-generating appointments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">\u201cThe focus at this stage [of the real advantage determination] is on the reasoning of the custodial parent.\u201d <em>Dickenson </em>v. <em>Cogswell, </em>66 Mass. App. 442, 448 (2006). Relocating in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>avoid painful emotional encounters and to develop emotional support is a sincere reason, and we are unable to say that it is not a good reason \u201cfor the purposes of requiring the full balancing of interests set out in the second, and most important, part of the analysis required by <em>Yannas.\u201d Dickenson, supra </em>at 448. It is undisputed that a parent\u2019s happiness can affect the quality of parenting. We are also mindful of the wife\u2019s interest in developing a support network that could help her emotionally during this difficult period in her life, especially considering that she has no roots in the West Boylston area, where her husband grew up. We also note that there is no evidence that the wife seeks the move in order to deprive the husband of access to his children. See <em>Pizzino </em>v. <em>Miller, 61 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 873. Indeed, to the contrary, the judge found that the husband and wife \u201cdo a commendable job of making arrangements about their children.\u201d The wife stated that she would be willing and able to make sacrifices including driving the children to and from Worcester in order to allow the husband to maintain his good relationship with the children. The wife has demonstrated a \u201creal advantage\u201d to her in relocating.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">D. <em>Best interests analysis. </em>Regarding the second <em>Yannas </em>prong, the probate judge first considers the effect of removal on the child\u2019s interests. Even if a move is advantageous to the custodial parent, that \u201cdoes not mean that it is automatically in the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Yannas </em>v. <em>Frondistou-Yannas, </em>395 Mass. at 711. Here, the judge found that the children had many friends in the Worcester area and were engaged in a wide variety of activities, and that a relocation would negatively affect those relationships and activities. Further, the children regularly spend time with their paternal grandparents and aunt, and relocation would diminish that beneficial contact. The judge also found the wife had not provided any detail or evidence regarding the comparative quality of the Scituate schools relative to the West Boylston school system which the children were attending. Regarding the interest of the father, who is the noncustodial parent, the judge found that he (like the wife) is \u201can excellent and involved\u201d parent, playing an active and regular role in the children\u2019s lives. The judge found that the wife\u2019s move with the children to Scituate would significantly disrupt the husband\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>visitation rights. The judge found that a drive from West Boylston to Scituate would take seventy-five minutes without traffic and that the husband \u2014 whose business requires his presence in Worcester \u2014 would not be able to participate in the children\u2019s extracurricular activities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Regarding the interests of the wife, as set forth above, the judge found no \u201creal advantage\u201d to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Turning to the balancing of interests, because the judge \u201cfound . . . erroneously that the proposed move offered no real advantage to the mother, he . . . gave no weight to any real advantage to her in his calculus regarding the children\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Pizzino, supra </em>at 875. We cannot conclude that this erroneous treatment did not influence his findings regarding the children\u2019s best interest. \u201c[Cjonsideration of the position of the custodial parent does not disappear after it is concluded that there is a real advantage to her in moving. Rather, there must be continued consideration of the quality of life of the custodial parent for the simple reason that her quality of life has a direct and immediate impact on the welfare of the children.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>While the father here is an involved and caring parent, the judge\u2019s findings and emphasis on disruption of visitation reflect \u201ca <em>Mason-like </em>approach to removal,\u201d to the diminution of \u201cthe mother\u2019s [effective] role as sole physical custodian.\u201d <em>Katzman </em>v. <em>Healy, ante </em>589, 595-596 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Accordingly, we remand for a redetermination of the best interests of the children. On remand, the judge should also determine the extent to which the wife\u2019s unhappiness in West Boylston affects her children. In assessing the impact of a move on the children, the judge should further determine the views of the children either directly or through the appointment of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>guardian ad litem who could evaluate their expressions of preference in light of each child\u2019s age and maturity. Moreover, on remand the judge should more fully assess the practical implication of a move on the father\u2019s visitation, including further subsidiary findings regarding alternative visitation proposals which the judge stated were \u201cmore practical.\u201d We note that the judge\u2019s determinations on remand should include relevant evidence of events that transpired after the entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">II. <em>Property distribution issues. </em>The wife argues that the judge erred in distributing the marital estate by failing to consider cash distributions from her family as contributions to the marital estate. She also argues that he abused his discretion by giving the husband a disproportionate amount of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">With regard to the division of marital property, \u201c[a]ny conclusions the judge makes will be reversed only if \u2018plainly wrong and excessive,\u2019 but the judge\u2019s findings and rulings must make clear the reasons for these conclusions.\u201d <em>deCastro </em>v. <em>deCastro, </em>415 Mass. 787, 792 (1993), quoting from <em>Redding </em>v. <em>Redding, </em>398 Mass. 102, 107 (1986). General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 34, inserted by St. 1975, c. 565, provides that the trial judge \u201cmay assign to either husband or wife all or any part of the estate of the other.\u201d This \u201cincludes property acquired prior to the marriage.\u201d <em>Baccanti </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>434 Mass. 787, 792 (2001). Also, \u201c[i]nherited assets . . . may comprise part of a marital estate for purposes of possible division under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34.\u201d <em>Ruml </em>v. <em>Ruml, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 500, 511 (2000). \u201c[A]n equitable, rather than an equal, division of property is the ultimate goal of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Massa, </em>431 Mass. 619, 626 (2000). Specifically, the purpose of an equitable division of marital property is to compensate each party for their contributions to the marriage. <em>Heacock </em>v. <em>Heacock, </em>402 Mass. 21, 24 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Based on the record, the judge did not clearly err in finding \u201c[t]he parties\u2019 parents all contributed in significant but approximately equal amounts to the parties\u2019 acquisition of the marital estate.\u201d Although the wife contends that the evidence showed that the wife\u2019s family contributed close to two million dollars in distributions from family assets toward the acquisition of the marital estate, our review of the record demonstrates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>the ultimate destination of money she received in distributions was not proven.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Moreover, pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, the judge acted within his discretion in dividing the marital estate, including premarital assets, equally. See <em>Baccanti, supra </em>at 792-793. There are \u201cno hard and fast rules\u201d governing this allocation. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 626. The judge\u2019s finding that the parties and their respective families contributed equally to the marital enterprise is supported by the record. Furthermore, considering the statutory factors including the length of the marriage and the division of responsibilities in the divorce judgment \u2014 and the judge\u2019s order that the husband pay six hundred dollars per week in alimony \u2014 the wife has not shown that the equal distribution of the marital assets constituted an abuse of discretion. See <em>Child </em>v. <em>Child, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 77 (2003) (judge must consider \u201cthe length of the marriage, the conduct of the parties during the marriage, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the provisions of the judgment relating to the division of assets are affirmed, but the provisions relating to custody and visitation, as well as the order on the wife\u2019s request for relocation, are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-9\"> Although the judge determined that because there was a shared custody arrangement the <em>Mason </em>standard applied, he also analyzed the removal issue under the two-part <em>Yannas </em>test implicated by sole physical custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The wife also testified that she and the woman had been friends at one time, but that the woman and the husband began their relationship prior to the marital break-up.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The judge found: \u201cPlaintiff proposes to have the children spend one night a week with the defendant; she would drive them to Worcester the night before and pick them up the next morning to bring them to school. This would involve about a three hour round trip by her twice in twelve hours, and two hour and a half trips for the children in that time period. It would take each of them out of their school and extracurricular activities one afternoon/ evening each week. (Plaintiff also proposes alternating weekend trips which are more practical.) The Court is of the opinion that plaintiff is unrealistic in this proposal. In addition to the concerns just described, plaintiff would have to get up and leave Scituate about four-thirty in the morning weekly on the return day. Plaintiff was candid that she is not a morning person. It is unclear what impact the early morning ride would have on the children.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b639-8\">First, while the wife testified that some of the money went into the parties\u2019 joint checking and savings accounts that were used for investments and IRAs, she also testified that most of the money went into college funds for their children.
