The complaint in this case was originally filed by Dattilo, individually and as assignee of the rights of Anthony Caban. While the matter was pending in this court, counsel filed a suggestion of death of Dattilo and moved that Linda Gore, ancillary administratrix of the plaintiff\u2019s estate, be substituted as the plaintiff in this matter. We take notice of the suggestion of death, and we allow the motion to substitute. We refer to the original plaintiff, Angelina Dattilo, throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b547-9\">Katzmann, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aas\">Following a bench trial, a Superior Court judge found that the defendant, Arbella Mutual Insurance Company (Arbella) had committed unfair insurance practices both against the plaintiff, Angelina Dattilo, and its insured, Anthony Caban. The judge awarded Dattilo damages under G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D, both directly, as a (third-party) claimant, and as an assignee of Caban\u2019s rights against Arbella. Arbella now appeals. Dattilo cross-appeals, claiming error in the calculation of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">A. <em>Background. </em>We recite the facts from the judge\u2019s findings and the uncontradicted evidence before him, reserving recitation of certain facts as they become relevant to the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">1. <em>The accident and demand for settlement. </em>On August 30, 1998, while driving in Florida, Dattilo, then approximately seventy-five years old, was seriously injured when her car was struck by a car driven by Caban. Other parties with serious injuries included two passengers in Caban\u2019s car. A third passenger had less serious injuries. Caban was insured by Arbella. At the time of the accident, he maintained an insurance policy with liability limits of $20,000 per person and $40,000 per accident. There were thus four injured parties who could make claims on that money.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">Soon after the accident, through a family friend, Dattilo retained Florida counsel, Anthony Christian. On September 14, 1998, Attorney Christian wrote to Arbella, informing it that he represented Dattilo and requesting coverage information. An Arbella claim representative responded promptly by requesting a medical records authorization.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>During September, Attorney Christian conducted an investigation, including reviewing the police report, a liability report from his private investigator, and Dattilo\u2019s physician\u2019s operative report detailing her injuries, surgery, and medical bills. Based on his investigation, Attorney Christian determined that Caban was one hundred per cent at fault for the accident and that Dattilo\u2019s injuries exceeded the policy limits. On September 28, 1998, Attorney Christian sent a letter (the demand letter) to Arbella detailing Caban\u2019s liability for the accident and Dattilo\u2019s injuries, enclosing selected medical records and receipts totaling over $25,000, and demanding that Arbella tender the $20,000 policy limits within thirty days, i.e., on or before October 29, 1998. The demand letter provided that, upon tender of the proceeds, Dattilo would release Caban and Arbella from all liability and would agree to indemnify Arbella for any outstanding liens on the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">By the time the demand letter was sent, Arbella had conducted its own investigation, and liability and damages were reasonably clear. Caban had admitted that he was at fault, and Arbella\u2019 s investigator had ruled out any contributory negligence on the part of Dattilo. It was also reasonably clear that the damages exceeded by at least $100,000 the per person policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">During the thirty-day period following the demand letter, Arbella made no written response, and each side attempted only intermittently to speak with the other over the phone. On the final day of the thirty-day period, an Arbella adjuster left a callback voice mail on Attorney Christian\u2019s phone, and he attempted twice that day to return the call but only reached the adjuster\u2019s voice mail. During this thirty-day period, Arbella did not communicate the demand letter to Caban.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Upon expiration of the thirty-day period, on November 2, 1998, viewing Arbella\u2019s lack of response to the demand letter as a rejection of the offer, Attorney Christian, on behalf of Dattilo, filed suit against Caban in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>When Arbella belatedly notified Caban on November 10, 1998,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that he was exposed in excess of his policy limits, it stated, \u201c[W]e have been presented with a bodily injury claim\u201d but did not mention that a demand letter had been sent to Arbella on September 28, 1998; indeed, Arbella stated that \u201ca formal demand has not been received.\u201d Moreover, Arbella did not mention the offer of settlement provided in Dattilo\u2019s September letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">On February 22, 1999, five months after the demand letter had been sent, a different Arbella adjuster responded in writing to the demand letter, advising Attorney Christian that Arbella was then attempting to determine what claims the other injured persons (passengers in Caban\u2019s car) might have, in order to attempt to structure a global settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In a letter dated April 21, 1999, seven months after the demand letter had been sent, Arbella offered the $20,000 policy limits to Dattilo without any conditions other than provision of a release. Dattilo rejected the offer after consultation with Attorney Christian, who, in replying to the offer, wrote, inter alia, that the \u201crelease of all claims\u201d demanded as a condition of the offer was \u201crather presumptuous under the circumstances.\u201d Around the same time, Arbella settled with one other claimant and determined that the others did not intend to pursue their claims. On April 29, 1999, Arbella sent Caban another notice concerning Dattilo\u2019s claim, identical to the notice previously sent on November 10, 1998. See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">2. <em>Settlement with Caban. </em>On November 6, 2000, in Florida, Dattilo reached a settlement (the settlement agreement) with Caban whereby a stipulated judgment was to be entered against Caban for $450,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Caban assigned to Dattilo his rights against Arbella for unfair settlement practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The parties intended in the settlement agreement to shield Caban from personal liability for the $450,000 damages by including a provision whereby Dattilo agreed not to execute against Caban on the stipulated judgment. Arbella knew of the negotiations related to the settlement agreement and waived in writing any claim against Caban for noncooperation under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">B. <em>Procedural history. </em>Although the c. 93A demand letter and response do not appear in the record appendix, materials in the record on appeal indicate that on September 23, 2002, Dattilo sent a c. 93A demand letter to Arbella in the amount of $1.4 million, and Arbella responded with an offer of $23,966.16. On October 25, 2002, Dattilo, individually and as assignee of the rights of Caban, filed suit in Superior Court against Arbella seeking compensatory damages, as well as multiple damages pursuant to c. 93A, arising out of its allegedly unreasonable failure to settle. After a jury-waived trial held in April, 2007, the judge found that Arbella had engaged in \u201cunfair claim settlement practices\u201d under G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), and G. L. c. 93A by failing to effectuate a prompt and equitable offer of settlement, failing to notify Caban of the settlement offer, and misrepresenting to Caban that a formal demand had not been received.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A judgment entered for Dattilo, dated July 26, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In a corrected judgment dated September 19, 2007, the judge awarded Dattilo $1,007,342.58. The award consisted of (a) $670,000 in compensatory and multiple damages, (b) $313,728.77 for prejudgment interest, (c) $23,194.40 in costs, and (d) $419.41 in interest on the costs from the date of judgment (July 26, 2007) to the date of the corrected judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The judge reached his compensatory and multiple damages figure by adding $430,000 (the amount of the settlement agreement over and above the $20,000 per person policy limits) (the excess judgment or assigned claim damages); plus $200,000 (Dattilo\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, doubled); plus $40,000 (the per person policy limit Arbella failed to pay when it did not respond to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>settlement demand in October, 1998, doubled) (the direct claim damages). The prejudgment interest award of $313,728.77 was calculated based on a single damages amount of $550,000. The judge used this single damages amount because he declined to double the damages on the assigned claim or the prejudgment interest on those damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">On appeal, Arbella argues principally that the corrected judgment should be reversed because the judge erred in (a) not explicitly considering the reasonableness of Attorney Christian\u2019s conduct in sending the demand letter or the fact that Caban was difficult to reach, (b) awarding prejudgment interest on the assigned claim damages, and (c) finding that Arbella acted wilfully and knowingly in its statutory violations, and thus doubling the award of attorney\u2019s fees and damages on the direct claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Dattilo cross-appeals, arguing that the judge erred by not doubling the damages on the assigned claim, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">C. <em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Unfair claim settlement practices, </em>a. <em>Statutory framework. </em>Arbella challenges the judge\u2019s finding that it engaged in unfair claim settlement practices. \u201cWe will not disturb a judge\u2019s findings of fact in a c. 93A claim unless those findings are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>424 Mass. 413, 420 (1997). General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 2(a), inserted by St. 1967, c. 813, \u00a7 1, makes it unlawful to engage in \u201c[ujnfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d Section 9(1) of G. L. c. 93A, as amended through St. 1979, c. 406, \u00a7 1, provides a cause of action for \u201cany person whose rights are affected by another person violating the provisions of [G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9)].\u201d General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7 3, inserted by St. 1972, c. 543, \u00a7 1, bans \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance,\u201d which include \u201cunfair claim settlement practice[s].\u201d G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9). \u201cThose claiming injury by virtue of an insurance practice prohibited by G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9)(/), may sue under G. L. c. 93A.\u201d <em>Bolden </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor Caf\u00e9 of Worcester, Inc., </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 56, 59 n.8 (2000), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), sets forth the acts and omissions comprising \u201cunfair claim settlement practice^] \u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u00a7 3.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As pertinent here, c. 176D provides that an insurer will be liable when it \u201c[f]ail[s] to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications with respect to claims arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>under insurance policies,\u201d G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9)(\u00a3&gt;); \u201c[f]ail[s] to affirm or deny coverage of claims within a reasonable time after proof of loss statements have been completed,\u201d G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9)(e); or \u201c[m]isrepresent[s] pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to coverages at issue,\u201d G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9)(a). In addition, in circumstances where liability is reasonably clear,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the insurance company must act to \u201ceffectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims.\u201d G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9)(/).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The statute protects the interests of both claimants and insureds against unfair insurance claim settlement practices. With respect to claimants, it was \u201cenacted to encourage the settlement of insurance claims . . . and discourage insurers from forcing claimants into unnecessary litigation to obtain relief.\u201d <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>424 Mass. at 419. See <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>434 Mass. 556, 562 (2001) (purpose of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3, is to \u201cremedy a host of possible violations in the insurance industry and to subject insurers committing violations to the remedies available to an injured party under G. L. c. 93A\u201d). General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9)0), in particular, aims to \u201cdeal with the conduct of some insurers that stymied those with bona fide claims from obtaining fair settlements in a reasonably prompt time.\u201d <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., supra at </em>562.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The statutory scheme also recognizes that encouraging the prompt settlement of claims protects the insured. \u201cThe insurer has a duty to its insured. If it does not fulfill that duty, it may violate G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), and be liable to its insured.\u201d <em>Lazaris </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>428 Mass. 502, 506 (1998). See <em>Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co., </em>417 Mass. 115, 120 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">While the insurer has a duty to respond promptly to demands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>by a claimant and to effectuate prompt settlement, it also has an obligation to protect the interests of its insured, and to guard against bad faith claims. When an insurer unfairly fails to settle, the interests of the injured party and the insured may align. See, e.g., <em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>American Mut. Ins. Co., </em>389 Mass. 85, 93-95 &amp; n.8 (1983).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Compare <em>Campione </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>422 Mass. 185, 192-193 (1996) (assignment of claim against insurance brokers). An injured party may always file suit against the insured tortfeasor and obtain a judgment for damages regardless of the insurance policy limits. If the insurer violated the law in failing to settle for the policy limits, then the insurer will be liable to the insured for the damages exceeding the policy limit. This is based on the insurer\u2019s having breached a duty to the insured by causing the claimant to pursue and obtain the excess damages claim against the insured. In such circumstances, it is not uncommon for the insured to settle with the claimant, especially in cases where liability is clear, and then assign to the claimant his or her rights to sue the insurer for the unfair claim settlement practice. See generally <em>DiMarzo, supra', Campione, supra </em>at 190-191.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">b. <em>Analysis. </em>In light of these principles, the judge did not err in concluding that Arbella had engaged in unfair settlement practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">i. <em>Dattilo. </em>Arbella waited five months to respond to Attorney Christian\u2019s demand letter, only then advising Attorney Christian that it was ascertaining other potential claims by injured passengers in Caban\u2019s car; it was seven months before Arbella proposed a settlement. The judge\u2019s finding that Arbella violated G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), by failing to make a prompt and equitable offer of settlement was not clearly erroneous. \u201cAn insurer has a duty ... to respond to settlement offers within policy limits by the deadline prescribed in the offer . . . provided that the time allotted for acceptance is reasonable. What constitutes a reasonable time depends upon the circumstances of the particular case. Whether an insurer has acted in bad faith by failing to settle a claim within the time limits unilaterally imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>by a plaintiff is a question for the finder of fact.\u201d 14 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 203:15, at 203-25 (3d ed. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Arbella\u2019s experts testified that the thirty-day demand letter presented a reasonable time in which to demand a settlement response. Moreover, even if more time were needed to make a settlement offer, Arbella had an obligation to at least respond and inform the claimant\u2019s attorney as to the status of the claim. Although Arbella counters that its delay was occasioned by the logistics of seeking a global settlement with various claimants, that purported reason was not communicated to Attorney Christian or to Dattilo. In any event, even if that issue were a reasonable basis for delay in making a settlement offer, it did not excuse Arbella\u2019s failure to respond to the initial demand in a prompt manner. See, e.g., 14 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 203:15, <em>supra </em>at 203-25 to 203-26 &amp; n.5, citing <em>Grumbling </em>v. <em>Medallion Ins. Co., 392 </em>F. Supp. 717, 721 (D. Or. 1975), aff\u2019d, 545 F.2d 686 (9th Cir. 1976) (insurer\u2019s failure to respond to time-limited offer with a fifteen-day deadline until fifteen days after the deadline passed amounted to bad faith). Nor do we find persuasive Arbella\u2019s claim that Dattilo\u2019s failure to provide a medical authorization excused its failure to respond; the judge found that Arbella was in possession of sufficient medical bills to conclude that damages would exceed the policy limits, and had indeed later made a policy-limits offer without requiring medical authorizations. Similarly unavailing is Arbella\u2019s contention that its concerns about the need for a Medicare lien release warranted delay. The judge did not err in finding that Arbella failed to communicate this to Dattilo.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">ii. <em>Caban. </em>Arbella\u2019s impermissible delay in responding to the demand letter was compounded by its failure to notify Caban of the settlement offer. Moreover, when Arbella\u2019s letter belatedly notified Caban on November 10, 1998<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (after the expiration of Dattilo\u2019s September 28 offer, and after she had filed suit against Caban in Florida on November 2, 1998), that he was exposed to any excess of policy liability, it misinformed him, in violation of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9)(a), that \u201ca formal demand has not been received.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Peckham </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number><em>Co., </em>895 F.2d 830, 835, 840 (1st Cir. 1990). See also generally 14 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 203:16 (3d ed. 2008). That misrepresentation reinforces the picture of a pattern of bad settlement practice. And where, as here, the insured\u2019s liability was clear within days, and damages clearly exceeded the policy limits, Arbella\u2019s tactic of delay constituted a violation of its obligation \u201cto effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 176D \u00a7 3(9)(f). See <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>424 Mass. at 419; <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>434 Mass at 562. See also, e.g., 14 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 206:28, at 206-44 n.37 (3d ed. 1999), citing <em>Lozier </em>v. <em>Auto Owners Ins. Co., </em>951 F.2d 251 (9th Cir. 1991). In sum, Caban was harmed not just by Arbella\u2019s failure to inform him of the demand and settlement offer but also by Arbella\u2019s dilatory response to Dattilo\u2019s legitimate demand for settlement that predictably led her to spurn Arbella\u2019s late tender and seek an excess judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>423 Mass. 366, 372 (1996) (no prejudice from six-month delay in responding to insured\u2019s claim letter where no showing of bad faith and insurer had no duty to defend).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">iii. <em>Claimant\u2019s conduct. </em>Arbella contends the judge committed legal error by failing to consider whether Attorney Christian\u2019s motive for sending the September 28 demand letter was to manufacture a bad faith insurance claim. We disagree. This issue was squarely presented during the trial. Attorney Christian testified that he did not have a bad faith claim \u201cin mind\u201d when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>he sent the demand letter or when he filed Dattilo\u2019s tort action against Caban on November 2, 1998. He made his demand shortly after the accident to put Dattilo \u201cfirst in line\u201d to demand coverage before other claimants injured in the accident asserted their demands, potentially exhausting the policy limits. Indeed, Arbella\u2019s own expert, Michael Cusack, testified that he \u201cpresume[d that] a reasonable lawyer would do [this]\u201d and that he had no \u201cquarrel with\u201d the timing of Attorney Christian\u2019s demand. Arbella\u2019s claims supervisor, Timothy Horgan, similarly testified that the thirty-day deadline was reasonable. Attorney Christian and Dattilo testified that had Arbella timely tendered the $20,000 policy limits, Dattilo would have accepted it. The judge\u2019s ruling \u2014 that Attorney Christian\u2019s demand warranted a response, that Arbella was obligated under G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), to respond to the demand, and that Arbella violated \u00a7 3(9) by failing to promptly respond \u2014 constituted an inherent and implicit rejection of Arbella\u2019s claim that the demand letter was an illegitimate attempt to manufacture a bad faith claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In any event, we note that Attorney Christian\u2019s alleged tactics did not, as a matter of law, relieve Arbella of its duty to respond to a demand when liability was clear and damages exceeded the policy limits. Where liability has become reasonably clear, we have recognized that, consistent with the purpose of G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), to protect claimants and encourage settlements, \u201c[a]n insurer\u2019s statutory duty to make a prompt and fair settlement offer does not depend on the willingness of a claimant to accept such an offer.\u201d <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>434 Mass. at 567, citing <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Choukas, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 196, 200 (1999), overruled on other grounds by <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>438 Mass. 529, 533 n.7 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">In <em>Choukas, </em>although the insured\u2019s liability was \u201creasonably clear,\u201d the insurer failed to tender a settlement offer, defending its failure by pointing out that the claimant\u2019s attorney would have rejected it. We held that a claimant\u2019s conduct is not relevant to the insurer\u2019s duty (\u201cIn these circumstances, [the claimant\u2019s] attorney\u2019s settlement tactics did not relieve [the insurance company] of its statutory duty to attempt to effectuate a prompt, fair settlement of [the] claim and therefore tender an offer to reach that goal\u201d). 47 Mass. App. Ct. at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The cases cited by Arbella from other jurisdictions are not binding and show only that, when liability is unclear, the conduct of a claimant may be considered in assessing whether an insurer engaged in an unfair claim settlement practice by unreasonably delaying settlement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Here, like in <em>Choukas, </em>and unlike the cases cited by Arbella, liability was clear, and the claimant provided sufficient information to determine liability. Furthermore, like the insurer in <em>Choukas, </em>Arbella cannot successfully claim that its failure to communicate is excused by the conduct of the claimant\u2019s attorney.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In sum, as has been discussed, none of the justifications proffered by Arbella excuses the insurer\u2019s failure to promptly respond to Dattilo, or to promptly inform Caban of Dattilo\u2019s demand and settlement offer. The judge therefore did not clearly err in finding that Arbella engaged in unfair claim settlement practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">2. <em>Damages and interest. </em>In reviewing the computation of damages and the potential for multiple damages, we note that here there are two claims \u2014 a direct claim arising from the wrong done to Dattilo, the tort plaintiff; and an assigned claim that arises from the wrong done to Caban, the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">On the direct claim, the judge found that Dattilo directly suffered damages resulting from Arbella\u2019s violation of c. 176D in committing an unfair settlement practice, and awarded her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>$20,000 (Caban\u2019s policy limit, which was never paid) and the lost interest on that amount from October 25, 2002 (the date the complaint was filed against Arbella), to the date of judgment, July 26, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">On the assigned claim, the judge found that Dattilo\u2019s damages as assignee of Caban\u2019s rights as an insured consisted of the $450,000 set forth in the Florida stipulated judgment, minus the $20,000 awarded Dattilo under Caban\u2019s policy. In making this award, the judge found that the settlement agreement underlying the stipulated judgment was noncollusive and the amount agreed to by Caban in the settlement agreement was \u201creasonable.\u201d The judge also awarded Dattilo prejudgment interest on this amount from October 25, 2002, to July 26, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Finally, the judge found that Arbella\u2019s actions in violation of c. 93A were \u201cwilfully reckless, and, in that sense, intentional.\u201d Accordingly, the judge doubled the damages and interest on the direct claim and awarded Dattilo double her legal fees and expenses. However, citing <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>424 Mass. at 424, the judge declined to double the damages on the assigned claim, concluding that the stipulated judgment did not constitute a \u201cdecision by a court\u201d and thus could not form the basis for multiplication of damages pursuant to c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">On appeal, Arbella argues that the judge erred in finding that its actions were wilful and reckless and in awarding prejudgment interest on the assigned claim damages. In her cross appeal, Dattilo argues that the damages on the assigned claim should have been doubled.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">a. <em>Multiplication of damages, </em>i. <em>Wilful and knowing. </em>General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3), provides, inter alia, that damages awarded thereunder shall be doubled or tripled upon a finding that the c. 93A violation was \u201cwillful or knowing.\u201d In the instant matter, the judge, citing <em>Kattar </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>433 Mass. 1, 16 (2000), found that on both claims, \u201cwhile probably not malicious, Arbella\u2019s failure to settle when liability and damages were reasonably clear and failure to . . . respond to [Attorney] Christian\u2019s demand for a number of months, constituted more than mere negligence, but were wilfully reckless, and in that sense, intentional.\u201d The judge thus doubled Dattilo\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees through trial and the damages and interest on the $20,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>direct claim (the per person limit in Caban\u2019s insurance policy that, as we have noted, was never paid).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Arbella asserts that the facts do not establish \u201crecklessness\u201d and argues that the judge\u2019s reliance on <em>Kattar </em>was misplaced.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We conclude that regardless of whether Arbella\u2019s conduct is characterized as \u201creckless,\u201d the facts were sufficient to support a finding that Arbella \u201cknowingly\u201d engaged in unfair or deceptive conduct. An insurer knowingly violates c. 93A and c. 176D when liability is reasonably clear yet it still fails to settle within a reasonable time. See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 748, 756 (1996) (affirming a finding that the insurer knowingly violated c. 93A where the insurer \u201chad reason to know of its liability for [the claimant\u2019s] claim under its insurance policy with [the insured] several months prior to its receipt of [the claimant\u2019s] G. L. c. 93A demand letter, yet it failed to settle [the claimant\u2019s] claim or tender its policy at that time or for more than a year thereafter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">A person \u201c \u2018acts knowingly\u2019 with respect to a result if \u2018he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Computer Sys. Engr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Qantel Corp., </em>571 F. Supp. 1365, 1374 (D. Mass. 1983), quoting from ALI Model Penal Code \u00a7 202(b) (1962). \u201cA judge need not make an <em>express </em>finding that a person wilfully or knowingly violated G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, as long as the evidence warrants a finding of either.\u201d <em>Service Publications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Goverman, </em>396 Mass. 567, 578 n.13 (1986) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">There is ample evidence in the record to support the finding that Arbella acted knowingly. The record shows, and it is uncontested, that Arbella knew that liability was reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>certain by the time it received the demand letter from Attorney Christian. What is more, Arbella knew that the delay in making a prompt and reasonable settlement offer, let alone the failure to even make contact with Attorney Christian for five months, would have subjected its insured, Caban, to a possible excess judgment. Because the record is clear that Arbella knowingly acted in an unfair and deceptive manner amounting to a wilful and knowing violation of c. 93A, there was a sound basis for at least double damages. See <em>Kattar </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>433 Mass. at 15-16, and cases cited; <em>Auto Shine Car Wash Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Nice \u2018N Clean Car Wash, Inc., </em>58 Mass.

L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3), the $430,000 damages award on the assigned claim should have been doubled.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3), inserted by St. 1969, c. 690, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">\u201c[I]f the court finds for the petitioner, recovery shall be in the amount of actual damages or twenty-five dollars, whichever is greater; or up to three but not less than two times such amount if the court finds that the use or employment of the act or practice was a willful or knowing violation of . . . section two [of c. 93A] . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">In 1989, the Legislature added the following sentence to \u00a7 9(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">\u201cFor the purposes of this chapter, the amount of actual damages to be multiplied by the court shall be the amount of the judgment on all claims arising out of the same and underlying transaction or occurrence, regardless of the existence or nonexistence of insurance coverage available in payment of the claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">See St. 1989, c. 580, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">Pointing to the 1989 amendment to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>trial judge ruled on the assigned claim that those damages were not subject to multiplication, as the settlement agreement did not constitute a \u201cjudgment\u201d under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3). He specifically quoted <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, supra, </em>for the proposition that, \u201c[wjhen a case has been settled outside the courtroom, there is no \u2018judgment\u2019 on which to base the multiple damage calculus. . . . [T]he term \u2018judgment\u2019 ... is founded on a decision by a court, not an award of an arbitrator.\u201d 424 Mass. at 424-425, quoting from <em>Bonofiglio </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>411 Mass. 31, 37 (1991), <em>S.C., </em>412 Mass. 612 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). The judge concluded that, in this case, \u201cthere was no trial and no \u2018decision by a court,\u2019 but only a stipulated judgment entered by the court pursuant to a settlement.\u201d Dattilo argues that the judge erred in concluding that the damages on the assigned claim did not constitute a judgment that could be multiplied under c. 93A. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Informing our conclusion is the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Drywall Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>ZVI Constr. Co., </em>435 Mass. 664 (2002), where the court interpreted G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, as amended by St. 1989, c. 580, \u00a7 2, noting that \u201c[t]he same provision was added to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3) [, by] St. 1989, c. 580, \u00a7 1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668 n.3. There, the court rejected the argument that because an arbitration award is not a \u201cjudgment,\u201d it is thus excluded from multiplication. Rather, the court permitted an arbitration panel to multiply the actual damages suffered by the plaintiff, distinguishing <em>Bonofiglio </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., supra, </em>and <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, supra. </em>The court explained that \u201cthe central holding in [those cases] was that, where multiple damages are sought under G. L. c. 93A based on \u2018claims arising out of the same and underlying transaction,\u2019 those claims must be determined in the same proceeding with the multiple damages claims.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> 435 Mass. at 668. Furthermore, the court observed that \u201c[t]he use of the word \u2018judgment\u2019 in \u00a7 11 is merely contextual, referring to all damages that, in the aggregate, may be multiplied by a court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>a wilful or knowing violation of \u00a7 11.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669. Here, Dattilo\u2019s assigned claim, which the judge properly determined to be reasonable and noncollusive, was \u201cdetermined in the same proceeding with the multiple damages claim.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 668. As such, they are \u201cclaims arising out of the same and underlying transaction or occurrence.\u201d G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3). Therefore, like the actual damages in <em>Drywall Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>ZVI Constr.

L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, the judge awarded prejudgment interest on the $430,000 assigned claim damages from October 25, 2002, until the date of judgment, July 26, 2007. Arbella argues that the judge erred by making this award. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\u201cInterpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review de novo.\u201d <em>Devine </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Westport, </em>66 Mass.

General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6B, provides that the clerk of the court shall add interest to damages from the date of the complaint to the date of judgment.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The purpose of prejudgment interest is \u201cto compensate a damaged party for the loss of use or the unlawful detention of money.\u201d <em>McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 717 (1990), quoting from <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Electro Switch Corp., </em>402 Mass. 385, 390 (1988). See <em>Bernier </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>380 Mass. 372, 388 (1980); <em>Salvi </em>v. <em>Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Dept., </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 596, 609 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Arbella argues that Caban (in whose shoes Dattilo stands as assignee) suffered no \u201closs of use\u201d of the assigned claim damages award for purposes of c. 231, \u00a7 6B, because he was shielded from personal liability pursuant to the settlement agreement. That argument ignores the import of the assignment of the claim. We have noted our agreement with the trial judge\u2019s finding that Arbella violated Caban\u2019s rights and subjected him to the $430,000 in excess judgment damages. If Caban had filed the complaint against Arbella, instead of assigning his bad faith claims to Dattilo, Caban would be entitled to prejudgment interest on the excess judgment damages. Dattilo\u2019s entitlement to prejudgment interest on the full amount of the damages flows directly from the valid assignment of claims from Caban. It is thus clear, in light of the trial judge\u2019s proper determination that the $430,000 settlement agreement between Dattillo and Caban was reasonable and noncollusive, that the award of prejudgment interest was also proper. See, e.g., <em>Salvi </em>v. <em>Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Dept., supra. </em>We therefore find no error in the judge\u2019s award of prejudgment interest on the assigned claim damages from October 25, 2002, until the date of judgment, July 26, 2007.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>D. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the matter is remanded for modification of the corrected judgment by doubling or tripling of the $430,000 excess judgment award pursuant to c. 93A, in accordance with this opinion.

The judge found that Arbella engaged in an unfair claim settlement practice by failing to disclose the settlement offer to Caban. Arbella, in response, points to evidence that Caban was difficult to reach. See, however, <em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>American Mut. Ins.

In any event, other evidence presented at trial showed that Arbella was able to provide information to and receive information from Caban during the relevant time period. Compare <em>ibid. </em>&amp; n.16. Furthermore, as we have noted, when Arbella did communicate with Caban regarding his potential liability, it failed to inform him of the demand letter and the offer of settlement. The judge did not clearly err in implicitly concluding that Caban\u2019s conduct did not affect Arbella\u2019s actions \u2014 failing both to respond to the demand letter and to notify Caban of its contents.

App. Ct. 639 (1993), erred by concluding that Arbella had improperly delayed because of its unjustified insistence that a release be provided by Dattilo as a prerequisite for settling her demand. As Arbella notes, <em>Thaler </em>was overruled by <em>Lazaris </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>428 Mass. at 504, which held that an insurer does not violate G.

The record supports the judge\u2019s finding that Arbella made no objection to Dattilo\u2019s demand letter based on the letter\u2019s proposal that a check be issued prior to a signed release, and did not attempt to negotiate a different procedure for exchange of the release and payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b560-8\">In <em>Kattar </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>433 Mass. at 16, the Supreme Judicial Court held that \u201ca finding of \u2018wilful\u2019 conduct within the meaning of c. 93A is satisfied where the defendant has acted recklessly.\u201d See <em>Still </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>423 Mass. 805, 812-813 (1996) (\u201cdecisions construing the multiple damages provisions of G.

Co., </em>438 Mass. at 532 &amp; n.6 (following <em>Bonofiglio, supra, </em>and <em>Clegg, supra, </em>in declining to allow court in separate c. 93A trial to multiply damages awarded in underlying arbitration, but acknowledging that if the c. 93A claim itself had been submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator could have awarded multiple damages pursuant to <em>Drywall, supra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b563-5\">As to the assigned claim, in order to justify the amount of the settlement and recover the excess damages from Arbella as assignee of Caban\u2019s claim against Arbella, Dattilo was required to establish the reasonableness of the settlement amount. See 2 Windt on Insurance Claims and Disputes \u00a7 6:29 (5th ed. 2007). See also <em>Glenn </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>247 Kan. 296, 318 (1990), and <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Bertram, </em>88 N.J. 347, 368 (1982), cited with approval in <em>Campione </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>422 Mass. at 193. Thus, Dattilo was required to come forward with evidence of her likelihood of success on the merits of her claim against Caban and the likely verdict range should she recover against him. Dattilo was also required to demonstrate that the judgment against Caban was a foreseeable consequence of Arbella\u2019s unfair claims settlement practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Dattilo carried her burden at trial, putting on medical evidence, the police report from the accident, and testimony from the attorneys who represented the parties during the settlement negotiations about their investigations and conclusions about the case. Caban\u2019s attorney testified that after reviewing the medical records, deposition transcripts, accident report, and police report, he concluded that \u201cunfortunately my client was going to be 100 percent responsible for this accident.\u201d He based this conclusion on the fact that Caban \u201c[wjent through a stop sign, did not have the right of way, and he had pled guilty to a DUI. And he admitted to all of this in his deposition.\u201d Caban\u2019s attorney further testified that Dattilo\u2019s medical bills were approximately $50,000, that she was hospitalized for over three weeks, and that she needed twenty-four hour care. Thus, here, the c. 93A trial, like the arbitration proceeding in <em>Drywall, supra, </em>provided a single proceeding in which to determine both the underlying assigned claim and any multiple damages on that claim. Cf. <em>Campione, supra </em>at 193 (to prevail at trial on assigned claim, plaintiff would have to establish both facts concerning the assigned claim, as well as those in the underlying case). (We note that, while <em>Campione, </em>like our case, involved the pretrial assignment of a tortfeasor\u2019s claim to the tort plaintiff, unlike the instant matter, in which the assignment concerned an insured\u2019s claim against his insurer for breach of its duty to settle claims fairly, see 2 Windt, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 6:29, in <em>Campione, supra </em>at 193, the assigned claim discussed was for negligence against a noninsurer, the assignor\u2019s insurance broker. Accordingly, the nature of the required proof was different.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\">While the judge found otherwise, we would note that, given its ordinary meaning, it may be that the entry of the settlement agreement as a judgment on a Florida court docket constituted a \u201cjudgment.\u201d See <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Standard Guar. Ins. Co., </em>630 So. 2d 179, 182 (Fla. 1994) (stipulation functional equivalent of an excess judgment). See also <em>Thibbitts </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>405 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>222, 226 (1989) (\u201cA consent judgment is essentially a settlement agreement that is entered as a judgment\u201d); <em>Bonoflglio </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>411 Mass. at 37-38, citing Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(a), 365 Mass. 820 (1974) (defining \u201cjudgment\u201d and \u201cfinal judgment\u201d). However, whether the Florida settlement agreement is characterized as a judgment is not determinative for purposes of the c. 93A action. Rather, as we have noted (see note 18, <em>supra), </em>what is material is that the judge here made a determination of the reasonableness of Dattilo\u2019s damages on the assigned claim that was separate and apart from the settlement agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The matter before us is distinguishable from <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, supra, </em>where the Supreme Judicial Court declined to multiply damages that had been determined based on a pretrial settlement. There, there was no assigned claim, as the insured tortfeasor and the injured plaintiff reached a settlement, and significantly, unlike in our case, the insurer paid the policy limits on the eve of trial. In declining to multiply the damages award, the <em>Clegg </em>court observed, \u201cThe multiple damages provided under c. 93A are punitive damages intended to penalize insurers who unreasonably and unfairly force claimants into litigation by wrongfully withholding insurance proceeds. As part of the statutory scheme meant to encourage out-of-court resolutions, the statute does not punish settling insurers by placing the entire settlement award at risk of multiplication.\u201d 424 Mass. at 425. Here, in contrast, the insurer paid neither the policy limits nor any excess judgment prior to the trial on the assigned claim. Therefore, our decision today is consistent with the court\u2019s rationale in <em>Clegg.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Because we have concluded that the trial judge did not err in determining that Arbella\u2019s violations of c. 93A were knowing and wilful (see our discussion in part C.2.a.i., <em>supra), </em>the damages on the assigned claim must be multiplied. The only question to be determined on remand will be whether the damages on the assigned claim should be doubled or tripled. See c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3). See generally <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Arbella Mut. Ins. Co., </em>426 Mass. at 686, quoting from <em>Yeagle </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 650, 655-656 (1997) (\u201c[T]here is a distinction in c. 93A \u2018between violations that consist of unfair or deceptive acts or practices, simpliciter, and those that are knowing or wilful or actuated by bad faith. The former are sanctioned by compensatory \u201csingle\u201d damages. Damages for the latter more serious violations are avowedly punitive \u2014 and can be very heavily so when the [1989] amendment [to c. 93A] applies\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b565-6\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6B, as amended through St. 1982, c. 183, \u00a7 2, provides, in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\u201cIn any action in which a verdict is rendered or a finding made or an order for judgment made for pecuniary damages for personal injuries to the plaintiff or for consequential damages, or for damage to property, there shall be added by the clerk of court to the amount of damages interest thereon at the rate of twelve per cent per annum from the date of commencement of the action even though such interest brings the amount of the verdict or finding beyond the maximum liability imposed by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Furthermore, we note the judge\u2019s correct conclusion, not challenged by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>either party, that the prejudgment interest calculation is properly based solely on the \u201ccompensatory component\u201d of the award, and not on any multiple damages.
