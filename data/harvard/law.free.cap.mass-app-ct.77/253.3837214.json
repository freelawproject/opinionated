At issue is the propriety of the judge\u2019s attempt to minimize the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">Following trial in District Court, a jury found the defendant guilty of indecent assault and battery on a person over fourteen years of age.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant argues that (1) the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>erred in not allowing defense counsel to reference testimony concerning the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct in his closing argument; (2) the evidence was insufficient to permit an instruction about the victim\u2019s incapacity to consent; and (3) the judge\u2019s use of the word \u201cunconscious\u201d in the jury instructions on the element of consent was improper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">As the judge acted within her discretion to exclude reference to the prejudicial testimony that would have been inadmissible under the rape shield law, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\"><em>Facts. </em>On March 16, 2007, after a night of drinking together at a bar called the Poirier Post, the defendant sexually assaulted the victim, a thirty-two year old resident of New Bedford. After the victim reported the assault, the defendant was arrested and charged with one count of aggravated rape, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22(a), and one count of sodomy, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 34. These charges were reduced to two counts of indecent assault and battery on a person over fourteen years of age, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The theory of the Commonwealth was that the defendant planned in advance to sexually assault the victim, who was a friend of his girl friend, Laurie. Throughout the course of the evening, in the presence of Laurie, the defendant put his arm around the victim and touched her hair and legs on numerous occasions. When she told him not to touch her, the defendant responded, \u201cit\u2019s okay, Laurie doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d While playing pool at the bar, the defendant twice rubbed his groin area up against the victim\u2019s \u201cback and [her] butt.\u201d When the victim again told the defendant not to touch her, he responded, \u201cI like it when you\u2019re feisty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Laurie and the defendant bought the victim multiple drinks, and she had approximately \u201cfour or five drinks [and a] couple of shots\u201d that night. The victim testified that while she had been at the bar previously with the defendant, he did not normally buy her drinks.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Following a conversation in the bathroom with Laurie, the victim told another patron of the bar that she did not feel comfortable leaving with the defendant and Laurie.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>that at the time she felt \u201c[v]ery groggy\u201d and \u201cheavy\u201d and went to the bathroom again and put cold water on her face. She testified, \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure why I wasn\u2019t feeling right,\u201d indicating that she felt \u201c[v]ery disoriented. Sort of dizzy. Not like I normally would have on a Friday night with . . . just the alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The victim then testified that, after leaving the bathroom, the next thing she remembered was \u201cbeing in the back of Laurie\u2019s car,\u201d driven by the defendant; she realized that they were driving to the house of Laurie or the defendant rather than her own. The victim did not remember leaving the bar, and in the car, she \u201cbegged them to take me home.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The victim next remembered \u201cwaking up cold and naked with my own vomit all over me, with a deer head hanging over my head.\u201d She called out for Laurie, feeling \u201cdizzy\u201d and \u201cheavy\u201d in a way she had never felt before, explaining that her body \u201cwas like jello.\u201d She testified, \u201cI knew that I had been raped. ... I was tom and I was bmised and I was shaking.\u201d She had bruises on her hips, which \u201clooked like they had been someone\u2019s hand prints holding me, making me stay.\u201d When she found Laurie in the house, the victim testified that Laurie did not seem at all surprised to see her standing naked in her condition. Laurie brought her to the bathroom, where the victim observed \u201ca sink filled with . . . dildos and . . . vibrators\u201d that were wet. While in the shower, the victim was \u201cstill feeling horribly . . . groggy and sore. So, so sore ... my vaginal area was in so much pain ... [as well as] my mouth. My anus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">At trial, the Commonwealth called Craig Lincoln, the bartender at the Poirier Post on the night of the assault. On cross-examination, when asked by defense counsel to describe the interaction between the defendant and the victim at the bar, Lincoln testified that \u201c[i]t seemed flirtatious. But that was just the way [the victim] was anyways.\u201d On redirect, the prosecutor asked Lincoln to clarify what he meant by describing the victim as a flirtatious person, and Lincoln testified that \u201c[s]he seemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>to be very flirtatious with a lot of people . . . myself included .... She made advancements at me a few times . . . she would always come to the comer of the bar and ask me to go in the back room with her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">On recross, defense counsel asked Lincoln to expand on his testimony regarding the victim\u2019s advances, and Lincoln testified, \u201c[s]he asked me to go in the back room [for] sexual favors . . . she said that she would give me a blow job.\u201d Lincoln further testified that this had happened \u201cthree or four times\u201d within a period of six months and that, on one occasion, \u201cshe came up behind me into the back room and said there\u2019s nobody here, um, let\u2019s just do it.\u201d Inexplicably, the prosecutor did nothing (other than initially delve into the area).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Lincoln\u2019s testimony went unaddressed until the jury charge conference, wherein the prosecutor stated, \u201cI think I made a mistake in the course of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s . . . testimony, when . . . he testified that the victim propositioned him for sex and offered to give him blow jobs.\u201d The prosecutor then opined that the evidence was improperly admitted and that an objection should have been lodged, and requested that the judge instruct defense counsel not to reference the testimony in closing argument. In response, the judge replied that the testimony \u201cwould\u2019ve been inadmissible under [the] rape shield [statute],\u201d but allowed defense counsel time to evaluate whether there was any basis to allow reference to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Following the break, defense counsel declined to further address the issue, and the judge forbade both counsel from referring to the evidence, finding that \u201cits prejudicial [ejffect outweighs its probative value and in looking at the statute, that is a determination for the judges to make [sz'c] and I\u2019m making that determination.\u201d She further noted, \u201cI understand it came in without objection but I don\u2019t think that that then removes . . . the prohibition of such evidence under the statute. And I don\u2019t want to compound what I view really as an error by allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>argument relative to that evidence.\u201d When the prosecutor asked whether she would be \u201cpermitted to attempt to rehabilitate with respect to those statements\u201d in her closing argument, the judge stated, \u201cfrankly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that should\u2019ve come out and I don\u2019t even want it even . . . highlighted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues that since the testimony concerning the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct was elicited spontaneously and without objection by the Commonwealth, defense counsel should have been able to use the testimony in his closing to impeach the victim. He suggests that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to object and the judge\u2019s failure to strike the testimony indicated that the testimony was not prejudicial, and that, once it was elicited, he should have been allowed to argue it.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>We need not belabor the point that the evidence was introduced in contravention of the rape shield statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At issue is the broader question of how a judge may react when improper evidence is introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u201cThe judge\u2019s function at any trial is to be \u2018the directing and controlling mind at the trial, and not a mere functionary to preserve order and lend ceremonial dignity to the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sapoznik, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 236, 241 n.4 (1990), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>381 Mass. 90, 118 (1980). \u201cAt times during the course of any trial ... it may become necessary for a judge to intervene although there has been no objection to the admissibility of certain evidence . . . [and] the judge is not required to sit idly by while counsel for either side questions a witness in an effort to obtain an answer which could be the basis of either a motion for mistrial or a claim on appeal that prejudicial matters were brought to the attention of the jurors.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See generally Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Lincoln\u2019s testimony concerning the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct was inadmissible. Ideally, there should have been immediate action on the part of the prosecutor or the judge sua sponte when the line was crossed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Regardless, the damage having been done, the judge acted within her discretion to prevent a further violation by precluding any reference by either side to the improper testimony in the closing arguments.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>As the judge acted within her discretion in prohibiting reference to testimony concerning the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct, no error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-15\">The first count, on which the defendant was found guilty, alleged that the defendant touched the vagina of the victim with his penis. The defendant was found not guilty on a second count, touching the victim\u2019s anus with his penis. We note that the defendant\u2019s deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profile matched the DNA profile of sperm cells taken from the victim\u2019s vagina, but no sperm cells were recovered from her anus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-10\">In light of the facts that are described in detail below, the two latter arguments are insubstantial. No more need be said.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b282-11\">We were informed at oral argument that the charges were reduced to allow the District Court to retain jurisdiction over the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b282-12\">The victim was prepared to testify that the reason for her discomfort was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the conversation she had with Laurie in the bathroom in which Laurie asked the victim to have sex with the defendant. The judge ruled this statement was hearsay and did not allow its introduction. We offer no comment on the propriety of the ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b283-12\">A defense motion in limine, see Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 103(a)(3) (2010), was allowed, prohibiting the victim from testifying that she thought she had been drugged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b284-8\">This is surprising given that prior to trial, the judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine to exclude reference to any alleged sexual activity with individuals other than the defendant. Though the transcript is not completely clear, defense counsel indicated that he did not intend to offer any <em>such </em>evidence, and appeared to acknowledge that it would not be admissible \u201c[ujnder rape shield [statute].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, inserted by St. 1977, c. 110, \u201c[e]vidence of specific instances of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct . . . shall not be admissible except evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct with the defendant or evidence of recent conduct of the victim alleged to be the cause of any physical feature, characteristic, or condition of the victim; provided, however, that such evidence shall be admissible only after an in camera hearing on a written motion for admission of same and an offer of proof. If, after said hearing, the court finds that the weight and relevancy of said evidence is sufficient to outweigh its prejudicial effect to the victim, the evidence shall be admitted; otherwise not.\u201d See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 412.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\">We note that all parties \u2014 the judge, prosecutor, and defense counsel \u2014 share a responsibility in such situations. Ordinarily, a judge need not intervene sua sponte. However, he or she is well advised to at least request a sidebar when a well known statutory law is seemingly being violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b286-8\">It matters not that the testimony was not struck from the record and the jury instructed to disregard it. In other contexts, cases have observed that sometimes it may be preferable to refrain from drawing attention to prejudicial evidence as opposed to striking it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DelValle, </em>443 Mass. 782, 791 n.11 (2005) (\u201cthe less said the better\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 117, 126 (2003) (\u201cmore harm than good\u201d). It was within the judge\u2019s discretion to handle the situation as she did. Indeed, in this situation, the judge may well have had the discretion to strike the evidence, even at this late stage of the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
