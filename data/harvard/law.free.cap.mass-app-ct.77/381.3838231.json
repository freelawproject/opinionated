Here, a confidential informant (Cl) repeatedly<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> purchased drugs (once by way of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>controlled purchase) from the defendant, Sammy Young, always within <em>walking </em>distance of the defendant\u2019s apartment. It is difficult to discern, on this record, where else other than his apartment the drugs that the drug dealer peddled could have been stored. As such, we reverse the allowance of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><em>Background. </em>The Commonwealth appeals from the decision of a Superior Court judge allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress cocaine, cash, and other drug-related evidence seized by police officers during a search of the defendant\u2019s apartment. Charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and a drug offense within a school zone, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized from his apartment pursuant to a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Following the hearing, the judge allowed the motion, concluding that \u201c[wjithout a sufficient nexus between the defendant\u2019s drug-selling activity and the defendant\u2019s residence, the affidavit in support of the warrant to search this location was not supported by probable cause.\u201d A single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s application for leave to proceed with an interlocutory appeal, and the case was transferred to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">On appeal, the Commonwealth argues that (1) the information in the affidavit was sufficient to permit a reasonable inference that the defendant kept a supply of drugs in his apartment, and (2) the search was proper because the apartment could reasonably have been expected to contain the marked currency used in the drug transaction. As the affidavit established a sufficient nexus between the defendant\u2019s drug-selling activity and his residence to justify a search of the apartment, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\"><em>Facts. </em>\u201c[Ojur inquiry as to the sufficiency of the search warrant application always begins and ends with the \u2018four comers of the affidavit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Day, </em>440 Mass. 296, 297 (2003), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Villella, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 426, 428 (1995). The affidavit presents the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>During the last week of July, 2007, the affiant, Detective Bryan Nadeau,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> spoke with the Cl<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who provided information regarding the sale of \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine by a resident of 177 Tripp Street, second floor, in Fall River. Nadeau was told that the Cl had been buying crack cocaine from a man known as \u201cSam.\u201d The Cl described Sam as a heavy set black male in his late thirties, approximately six feet tall, weighing approximately 275 pounds, with short black hair and a scruffy beard. The information provided by the Cl was subsequently verified by police.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">According to the Cl, Sam lived with his girlfriend at 177 Tripp Street, on the second floor of a multi-apartment dwelling with stairs and a small porch leading to the front door that faced Charles Street. Detective Nadeau discovered from utility records and from the Fall River police department\u2019s in-house record system that the second-floor apartment at 177 Tripp Street was registered to Candy Young, the daughter of Sammy Young, the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Detective Nadeau conducted a surveillance of 177 Tripp Street and observed a male matching the description of the defendant leaving the building. Detective Nadeau also showed a picture of the defendant to the Cl, who confirmed that he was the same \u201cSam\u201d from whom the Cl had been buying the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"ALe\">The Cl explained that he or she obtained crack cocaine by calling the defendant\u2019s cellular telephone number and ordering a specific amount of the drug. The defendant would then instruct the Cl to meet him at a certain location within walking distance of 177 Tripp Street, where they would complete the drug sale.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Detective Nadeau then arranged for the Cl to transact a controlled drug purchase with the defendant. Before the purchase, the Cl was searched, revealing neither drugs nor contraband on the Cl\u2019s person. Detective Nadeau gave the Cl \u201ca recorded amount of U.S. currency\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and drove him to the area of 177 Tripp Street, where Detective James Elumba had parked his unmarked vehicle so as to have a view of the front door. The Cl called the defendant\u2019s cellular telephone number and ordered an amount of crack cocaine. As before, the defendant instructed the Cl to meet him at a certain location within walking distance of 177 Tripp Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Detective Nadeau kept the Cl under surveillance at the prearranged location, while Detective Elumba watched the defendant leave the front door of 177 Tripp Street and walk toward the location where the Cl was waiting. Moments later, the defendant met the Cl at the designated location. Detective Nadeau observed the Cl hand the defendant an amount of currency, and the defendant hand the Cl an indiscernible item. When the defendant and the Cl parted in opposite directions, Detective Elumba kept the defendant in sight, and watched him reenter 177 Tripp Street. The Cl then gave Detective Nadeau \u201ca yellowish, rock-like substance\u201d in a \u201cknotted plastic bag,\u201d packaging Nadeau recognized to be consistent with that of crack cocaine. Again, the Cl was searched and found to have no additional drugs or contraband. The Cl related that the Cl gave the defendant the currency in exchange for crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Based on this information, approximately seventy-two hours later, on August 1, 2007, Detective Nadeau submitted an affidavit alleging that there was probable cause to believe that crack cocaine, drug paraphernalia or instrumentalities, and monies and records derived from illegal drug sales were concealed at 177 Tripp Street, second floor. The search warrant issued on the same date, and was executed subsequently.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>Sufficiency of the affidavit. </em>To establish probable cause, an affidavit must contain \u201cspecific allegations, or particularized information based on police surveillance or otherwise, that would permit a reasonable inference that the defendant likely kept a supply of drugs in his apartment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>453 Mass. 438, 442 (2009). \u201cThe basic question for the magistrate, when evaluating an affidavit supporting an application for the issuance of a search warrant, is whether there is a substantial basis on which to conclude that the articles or activity described are probably present or occurring at the place to be searched.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spano, </em>414 Mass. 178, 184 (1993), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 370 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u201cThe information in the affidavit must be adequate to establish a timely nexus between the defendant and the location to be searched and to permit the determination that the particular items of criminal activity sought reasonably could be expected to be found there.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 56, 59 (2007), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eller, 66 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 564, 565 (2006). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>413 Mass. 823, 829 (1992) (affidavit contained facts sufficient \u201cto permit the issuing magistrate to determine whether the drugs could reasonably be expected to be located in the defendant\u2019s apartment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u201cAll reasonable inferences which may be drawn from the information in the affidavit may also be considered as to whether probable cause has been established.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>430 Mass. 710, 712 (2000). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hardy, 63 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 210, 213 (2005) (magistrate could infer from informant\u2019s statements and police surveillance that defendant kept drugs in his apartment); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Luthy, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 102, 107 (2007) (reasonable to infer from visual surveillance of defendant leaving his residence after coordinating sale by way of cellular telephone that on at least one occasion defendant distributed illegal drugs from his address). See also Grasso &amp; McEvoy, Suppression Matters Under Massachusetts Law \u00a7 8-1, at 8-3 (2010 ed.) (\u201cThe determination of nexus may be the result of inferences from facts set forth in the affidavit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u201c[T]he nexus between the items to be seized, and the place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>to be searched need not be based on direct observation . . . [but] may be found in \u2018the type of crime, the nature of the . . . items, the extent of the suspect\u2019s opportunity for concealment, and normal inferences as to where a criminal would be likely to hide [evidence of the crime].\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Cinelli, 389 Mass. 197, 213, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 860 (1983), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lucarz, </em>430 F.2d 1051, 1055 (9th Cir. 1970). \u201cAn inference drawn from circumstantial evidence \u2018need only be reasonable and possible; it need not be necessary or inescapable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>423 Mass. 863, 868 (1996), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>373 Mass. 329, 341 (1977). However, \u201c \u2018[information establishing that a person is guilty of a crime does not necessarily constitute probable cause to search the person\u2019s residence\u2019 [or] . . . probable cause to expect that drags will be present in a home ... by the fact that the defendant lives there.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>453 Mass. at 441, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cinelli, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u201cWe-give considerable deference to the magistrate\u2019s determination, . . . and even \u2018the resolution of doubtful or marginal cases . . . should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harmon, 63 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 456, 460 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ger-main, </em>396 Mass. 413, 418 (1985). \u201cFurthermore, the affidavit should be read as a whole, not parsed, severed, and subjected to hypercritical analysis.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Day, </em>440 Mass. at 301, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>413 Mass. at 827. \u201c[T]o pass muster, an application need not establish to a certainty that the items to be seized will be found in the specified location, nor exclude any and all possibility that the items might be found elsewhere. The test is <em>probable </em>cause, not certainty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Here, the affidavit furnished a sufficient nexus between the defendant\u2019s drag sales and his apartment to justify a warrant to search his residence at 177 Tripp Street. When the defendant arranged drag transactions with the Cl, he specified a location in close walking proximity of his address. During the controlled purchase, police observed the defendant leave the front entrance of his building after receiving a telephone call from the Cl, and noted his arrival moments later at the designated location. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>walked from his apartment at 177 Tripp Street directly to the designated location, sold the Cl crack cocaine, and then walked immediately back to his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The defendant\u2019s routine of walking directly from his apartment to the point of sale, and returning to his apartment immediately following the sale, raised a reasonable inference that he kept a cache of drugs in his apartment at 177 Tripp Street, which served as a base of operations for drug sales that he conducted within walking distance of his residence. The affidavit also established probable cause to believe that the defendant\u2019s apartment contained monies<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> derived from drug sales. Prior to the controlled purchase, police supplied the Cl with \u201ca recorded amount of U.S. currency,\u201d which the Cl then delivered to the defendant in exchange for crack cocaine. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 665, 669-670 (2008) (where informant was given money with recorded serial numbers and defendants directly returned to residence after selling drugs within seventy-two hours of affidavit, magistrate had substantial basis for concluding monies from illegal sales were probably in residence or on persons of defendants). After the drug sale concluded, police continued to keep the defendant under surveillance until he reentered 177 Tripp Street. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Luthy, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. at 108 (reasonable for magistrate to infer that defendant, who remained under surveillance between drug sale and return home, \u201clikely brought the fruits of his transaction into the house\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The facts of the instant case are similar to but ultimately distinguishable from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>453 Mass. at 442, wherein the Supreme Judicial Court held that a single police observation of the defendant driving from his apartment to a location where he sold an unspecified amount of cocaine to an informant, without any particularized information linking the defendant\u2019s criminal activity to his residence, failed to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>probable cause for a warrant to search the defendant\u2019s apartment. Here, the affidavit provided a substantial basis to permit a reasonable inference that the defendant conducted sales outside his residence from a cache of drugs kept in his apartment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Unlike <em>Pina, </em>the defendant did not make use of a vehicle, where he could have stored the drugs. Instead, the defendant always selected a locale within walking distance of 177 Tripp Street to conduct drug sales. During the controlled purchase, police observed him walking from his apartment directly to the location where he sold crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Additionally, during the controlled drug transaction, the defendant received a recorded amount of currency from a police informant, and after the transaction, he immediately walked back to his apartment carrying the recorded proceeds from the drug sale. These facts, as set forth in the affidavit, were sufficient to permit an issuing magistrate to determine that drugs and monies derived from the sale of drugs could reasonably be expected to be located in the defendant\u2019s apartment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alcantara, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 591, 594 (2002) (where police observed controlled purchase, \u201cit was reasonable to infer for purposes of probable cause that [the defendant] probably kept the drugs he sold in his apartment,\u201d because his usual method of operation was to deliver drugs at location remote from his apartment); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. at 213 (reasonable to infer that defendant stored drugs in his home when he was under constant police surveillance, making it unlikely that he obtained drugs from another location).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>On the facts asserted, the police had a substantial basis on which to conclude that drugs, money from the controlled purchase, and records were kept at the defendant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\n<em>Order allowing motion to suppress reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-15\">According to the police affidavit, the Cl provided \u201cinformation regarding the sale of crack cocaine at 177 Tripp Street, second floor,\u201d including that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Cl \u201chas been buying amounts of crack cocaine from [the defendant]\u201d by ordering drugs by way of cellular telephone and meeting the defendant \u201cat a certain location within walking distance in the area of 177 Tripp Street\u201d to conduct the transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Detective Nadeau, of the Fall River police department\u2019s vice unit, has been with the police force for approximately seven years. He has received specialized training in drug identification and has participated in numerous drug investigations, undercover surveillance operations, controlled drug purchases, and the execution of more than sixty search warrants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\">The Cl previously provided information to the Fall River police department leading to seizure of crack cocaine and marijuana, and to ten arrests, nine of which resulted in convictions, and the tenth of which was then pending in court. The Cl\u2019s veracity and reliability are not being challenged here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Detective Nadeau\u2019s investigation also revealed that the defendant had in the past been charged with \u201cPossession to Distribute a Class B Substance (cocaine)\u201d in the Fall River Division of the District Court Department in July, 2003, and with distributing a class B substance in the South Boston Division of the Boston Municipal Court Department in September, 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b411-12\">It is unclear from the record whether the designated locale was always the same place, or whether the locale varied from one transaction to the next. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>the affidavit, Detective Nadeau described the locale as \u201ca certain location, within walking distance in the area of 177 Tripp Street.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b412-9\">It is unclear whether this phrase means that the currency was marked or whether the police recorded only the amount of currency given to the CI.

App. Ct. 290, 300 (2009) (\u201cHere, the magistrate could infer that [the defendant] kept business records [including cellular telephone bills chronicling the transactions] and that the most likely storage place for them was his residence\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\">While the affidavit does not indicate that the defendant sold drags from his apartment, or that the informant entered 177 Tripp Street, such lacunae are not important in this case, as the defendant\u2019s pattern of selling drags outside his residence permits the inference that he kept a supply of the drags he sold in his apartment.
