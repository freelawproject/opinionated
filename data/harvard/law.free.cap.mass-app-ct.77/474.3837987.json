L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, and one count of being lewd, wanton, and lascivious in behavior, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, for an incident that occurred on the Smith College campus. We are asked to consider whether public masturbation, without exposure of the defendant\u2019s genitalia or buttocks, is punishable under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16. Because we hold that it is not, we reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior only, and affirm his conviction of being lewd, wanton, and lascivious in behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><em>Background. </em>The jury would have been warranted in finding the following facts. On February 15, 2007, a student at Smith College, a women\u2019s college in Northampton, was crossing the street at an intersection near the campus. She noticed a dark green van, which she described as being the same model as her parents\u2019 car, a Dodge Caravan, parked awkwardly and holding up traffic in a crosswalk on the other side of the intersection. As the student approached the car, she noticed the driver was moving \u201chis arm and hand ... up and down against his groin.\u201d He appeared to be masturbating; however, she did not observe that either his genitals or buttocks were exposed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The victim continued walking toward the car so that she could describe it and the man to campus security officials. At the trial, she described the driver as a white male between the ages of thirty-five and forty with sandy brown hair, glasses, and a mustache. He was staring in her direction and appeared to be trying to make eye contact with her; he also spoke to her but she did not pay attention to what he said. She said that she was \u201cshocked and alarmed\u201d and immediately went to the campus center to report the incident to the campus police. At trial, she did not identify the defendant as the man she saw.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Five days later, on February 20, 2007, a second student was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>walking in the middle of the Smith College campus when she observed a middle-aged white male sitting in his car, masturbating, with his exposed penis in his hand. His car was parked in the crosswalk and he was looking in her direction. She called the campus public safety office to report the incident and the license plate number of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Shortly afterwards, a campus police officer observed a brown sedan with the same license plate number. The officer testified that the driver of the car he observed was a white male in his mid-forties or early fifties who appeared to have graying hair and a beard. Information from the Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) indicated that a brown sedan with that license number was owned by the defendant, Raymond L. Blackmer, III. At the trial, the officer identified the defendant as the man he had seen, although he also described differences in his appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Armed with a name, the campus police obtained a photograph of the defendant wearing glasses and a mustache, and included it in a photographic array shown to the second victim. At first, she did not recognize any of the photographs, but as she was leaving, \u201csomething clicked\u201d and she identified the defendant\u2019s photograph as that of the man she had seen. (At trial, she did not make an identification of the defendant.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The campus police then searched the RMV database using the defendant\u2019s surname and discovered a Joyce Blackmer in a nearby town who owned a green Plymouth Voyager that had at one time been registered to a Raymond Blackmer, Jr. The police officer testified at trial that other than \u201csome grill work,\u201d a Plymouth Voyager looks no different from a Dodge Caravan, the vehicle that the first victim had described from the incident on February 15.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aq5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The defendant pleaded guilty to one count of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, for the second, February 20, incident, and was sentenced to two and one-half to three years in prison. For the events of the first, February 15, incident, he was indicted on one count of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and one count of being a lewd, wanton, and lascivious person in behavior, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After a jury trial, the defendant was found guilty of both charges.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant challenges the judge\u2019s denial of his motion for a required finding of not guilty and alleges several other errors in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cIn reviewing the denial of a motion for a required finding, we must determine \u2018whether the evidence, in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth ... is sufficient ... to permit the jury to infer the existence of the essential elements of the crime charged [beyond a reasonable doubt] . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>453 Mass. 413, 427 (2009), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">a. <em>General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 16: open and gross lewdness and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>lascivious behavior. </em>The language of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, does not define \u201copen and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior.\u201d However, \u201cdecisional law requires proof of five elements to support a conviction, i.e., that the defendant (1) exposed genitals, breasts, or buttocks; (2) intentionally; (3) openly or with reckless disregard of public exposure; (4) in a manner so \u2018as to produce alarm or shock\u2019; (5) thereby actually shocking or alarming one or more persons.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 258, 260-261 (2008), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kessler, </em>442 Mass. 770, 773 &amp; n.4 (2004). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ora, </em>451 Mass. 125, 127 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In this case, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty and instructed the jury that the first element that the Commonwealth was required to prove in establishing a violation of \u00a7 16 was that \u201cMr. Blackmer engaged in lewd and lascivious behavior. What is meant by lewd and lascivious behavior is conduct which involves touching of the buttocks or genitals, for the purposes of sexual arousal, gratification, or offense; <em>or </em>conduct which involves exposing one\u2019s genitals or buttocks to one or more persons\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury instruction thus added to the established definition an additional theory of guilt, one where the defendant touches his genitals or buttocks \u201cfor the purposes of sexual arousal, gratification, or offense.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The Commonwealth argues that the instruction was appropriate in light of the language in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>439 Mass. 492, 495 (2003), stating that \u201cexposure of genitalia is not an essential element of the crime of open and gross lewdness.\u201d In <em>Quinn, </em>the court held that exposure of the buttocks, combined with the other elements listed above, was sufficient to sustain a conviction for open and gross lewdness, <em>ibid., </em>and certain language in <em>Quinn </em>appears to leave open the question whether unexposed masturbation may also be punished under \u00a7 16. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>439 Mass. at 501 n.15. In addition, the <em>Quinn </em>court\u2019s citation to <em>State </em>v. Maunsell, 170 Vt. 543, 547 (1999),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> could also suggest that unexposed masturbation would constitute open and gross lewdness in Massachusetts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>439 Mass. at 497 &amp; n.10, 501 n.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Nevertheless, all the other case law on the issue, including, as the defendant notes, cases decided subsequent to <em>Quinn, </em>indicates the necessity of exposure by the defendant of some body part to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 16. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265, 271 (1983) (defendant convicted of open and gross lewdness for driving down a public way, masturbating with penis exposed); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>439 Mass. at 498 (\u201cA woman approaching a group of school children suddenly opening her blouse to expose her breasts may alarm or shock just as a man masturbating in a passing automobile might\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kessler, </em>442 Mass. 770, 772-773 &amp; n.4 (2004) (utilizing Instruction 5.42 of the Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court [1988]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ora, </em>451 Mass. at 126 (\u201cconviction under the statute requires the display of nudity to be intentional, done in a manner to produce alarm or shock, and actually producing alarm or shock\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Despite the Commonwealth\u2019s contention, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perretti, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 36 (1985), is not to the contrary. In <em>Perretti, </em>we held that there was probable cause to arrest the defendant for open and gross lewdness where \u201che was standing at a rear, uncurtained, apartment window, at an early morning hour, with his trousers open, wearing no underwear, and his hands at his groin.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41. In the first place, those facts permit an inference that the defendant was intentionally exposing his genitals at the time of his arrest. Second, the issue in <em>Perretti, supra, </em>was whether those facts were sufficient to provide probable cause for arrest for the offense, not whether they were sufficient to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Finally, the Commonwealth argues that the defendant\u2019s public, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>unexposed masturbation, which shocked and alarmed the victim, was punishable conduct under \u00a7 16 in light of the legislative goal of G. L. c. 272 to create a \u201ccomprehensive and integrated approach\u201d to the related offenses set out in its provisions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 116 (1980). In fact, however, the opinion in <em>Sefranka </em>makes it clear that the statute prohibiting the behavior that the Commonwealth was able to prove here was the \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious persons\u201d provision of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. As construed in <em>Sefranka, </em>that provision prohibits \u201cthe commission of conduct in a public place . . . when the conduct committed . . . involves the touching of the genitals, buttocks, or female breasts, for purposes of sexual arousal, gratification, or offense, by a person who knows or should know of the presence of a person or persons who may be offended by the conduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. at 117-118. Thus, unlike in \u00a7 16, exposure of the relevant anatomy is not required under \u00a7 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty on the charge of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior under \u00a7 16 should have been allowed. His conviction on the charge of lewd, wanton, and lascivious behavior under \u00a7 53 is clearly supported by the evidence, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nebel, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 318-319 (2003), and he does not contend otherwise, except as described below.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">b. <em>Identity. </em>The defendant also argues that the judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> based on the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to prove that the man in the green van on February 15, seen masturbating by the first victim, was the defendant who had committed \u2014 and pleaded guilty to \u2014 the act alleged to have occurred on February 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">As a preliminary question, we first consider the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>contention that the \u201cbad act\u201d evidence relating to the incident five days later was improperly admitted in the trial of the earlier incident. Then we turn to whether the Commonwealth sufficiently identified the defendant present in the courtroom as the person who committed the lewd, wanton, and lascivious behavior on February 15, the behavior for which he was on trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">1. <em>Bad act evidence. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine, to admit evidence of the act of February 20 to establish a pattern of conduct and the defendant\u2019s identity for the February 15 event, was allowed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant sought to exclude the evidence at trial, arguing, as he does here, that it was more prejudicial than probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u201cGenerally, evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior misconduct may not be admitted to show bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged. . . . Such evidence may be admitted, however, for other, permissible purposes, including, for example, to \u2018show a common scheme, pattern of operation, absence of accident or mistake, identity, intent, or motive.\u2019 . . . Where such evidence is relevant, the judge must determine that its probative value on the issue outweighs the undue prejudice that may flow from it. . . . The decision to admit the evidence of prior bad acts is committed to the sound discretion of the judge, whose determination will be upheld absent palpable error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montez, </em>450 Mass. 736, 744 (2008), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224 (1986). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7\u00a7 403, 404(b) (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Evidence of bad acts is admissible to show identity, if \u201cthe [later] events and the circumstances of the crime charged have such similarities as to be meaningfully distinctive. . . . There must be a uniqueness of technique, a distinctiveness, or a particularly distinguishing pattern of conduct common to the . . . incidents to warrant the admission of evidence of [subsequent] bad acts as tending to prove that the defendant was the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>who committed the crime charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delong, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 528, 534 (2004), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kater, </em>432 Mass. 404, 414 (2000). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>428 Mass. 455, 459 (1998) (\u201cThus the judge was correct to rule that the crimes in question were sufficiently similar to each other and distinct in nature to be admitted as evidence of modus operandi\u201d), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrero, </em>427 Mass. 65, 71 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Here, after weighing the written submissions and the arguments at the nonevidentiary hearing on the motion in limine, the judge made careful findings and allowed the Commonwealth to offer evidence of the defendant\u2019s \u201csubsequent bad act\u201d to establish \u201cthe defendant\u2019s modus operandi and pattern of conduct, and his identity as the person who was in his vehicle masturbating\u201d on February 15. Based on the anticipated trial evidence (which was not disputed), \u201cthe judge properly could conclude that the relevant and probative value of [the defendant\u2019s subsequent bad act] was very high, and that any potential for undue prejudice could be minimized by a limiting instruction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montez, </em>450 Mass. at 746, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">As indeed shown at trial, the two incidents were extremely close in time, only five days apart; they occurred within a very short distance from each other, on different streets of the same all-female college campus; and in each instance the defendant stopped his car in or right next to a crosswalk, while masturbating and trying to make eye contact with his young women victims. \u201cThese numerous similarities were sufficient to show a distinctive pattern or scheme and, hence, warrant admission of the evidence of the [subsequent act] as tending to identify the defendant as the person who committed the [act] at issue.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delong, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. at 535, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrero, 427 </em>Mass. at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Finally, we note that the judge gave a forceful limiting instruction, one that the defendant concedes was \u201ccomprehensive,\u201d at the close of the evidence, before closing arguments, and again in her final instructions to the jury, explaining the narrow purpose for which the jury could consider this evidence. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>2. <em>Identification. </em>The defendant also argues that there was insufficient proof that he was the man in the green van on February 15, even if we include the \u201cbad act\u201d evidence, as we must (see note 11, <em>supra). </em>\u201c[I]t is basic law . . . that an essential element to be proved by the Commonwealth is that the individual who appears before the court as the defendant is the same person who is the subject of the indictment or complaint then on trial and the same person referred to in the evidence. Proof of the identity of the person who committed the offense may be established in a number of ways and \u2018[i]t is not necessary that any one witness should distinctly swear that the defendant was the man, if the result of all the testimony, on comparison of all its details and particulars, should identify him as the offender.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davila, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 511, 512 (1984), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 33, 36 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Price, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 280, 283 (2008); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 44, 45 (2009) (proof of identity must be beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The Commonwealth is entitled to the reasonable inferences that a jury may draw from its evidence on identification, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>378 Mass. 680, 686 (1979), and the inferences drawn by the jury need only be \u201creasonable and possible,\u201d not \u201cnecessary or inescapable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>402 Mass. 482, 487 (1988), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casale, </em>381 Mass. 167, 173 (1980). Evidence of a defendant\u2019s guilt may be primarily or even wholly circumstantial. See <em>Corson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>428 Mass. 193, 197 (1998). Where \u201cconflicting inferences are possible, it is for the jury to determine where the truth lies, for the weight and credibility of the evidence is wholly within their province.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>443 Mass. 770, 779 (2005), citing <em>Cramer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>419 Mass. 106, 110, 111 n.2 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. at 676-678, there was sufficient proof of the defendant\u2019s identity as the offender in the February 15 incident. The jury were able to see the defendant in the courtroom and to hear the description given by both victims and the police officer. In addition, they could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>reasonably infer that the defendant was somehow related to Joyce Blackmer and Raymond Blackmer, Jr., and that he was driving her van during the incident on February 15. Taken altogether there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to determine that the defendant was the offender in the February 15 incident as well as the February 20 incident. His motion for a required finding of not guilty was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We reiterate the requirement that, in order to sustain its burden of proof for a conviction under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, the prosecution must establish, in addition to the other elements enumerated in <em>Quinn </em>and described above, that \u201cthe defendant exposed his or her genitals, buttocks, or breasts to one or more persons.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>439 Mass. at 501. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ora, </em>451 Mass. at 127. As a result, regarding so much of the indictment that charges this defendant with open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior on February 15, 2007, the judgment is reversed, the verdict is set aside, and judgment shall enter for the defendant. On the indictment charging the defendant with being a lewd, wanton, and lascivious person in behavior under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The evidence would not have permitted the jury to conclude that the defendant was undressed to any particular degree. In the only testimony on the point, the victim stated that \u201cas far as [she] kn[e]w,\u201d the man \u201cwasn\u2019t nude from the waist down\u201d; that \u201c[she] didn\u2019t see a belt buckle open[,] ... a man\u2019s fly open[,] . . . buttons[,] . . . zippersfi] . . .

The defendant objected and the judge overruled the objection. The Commonwealth concedes that ruling was error but argues that the error was harmless. We agree. The officer had no basis for giving this opinion; however, the jury would have understood that the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of the case was that the Plymouth Voyager registered to Joyce Blackmer was used in the incident on trial. In all the circumstances of this case, the fact that the officer voiced the theory during his testimony was harmless error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u201cA man or woman, married or unmarried, who is guilty of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than three years or in jail for not more than two years or by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars.\u201d G.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, 439 </em>Mass. 492, 501-502 &amp; n.16 (2003), citing Instruction 5.42 of the Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\">In that case under Vermont\u2019s open and gross lewdness statute, which is similar to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, the defendant was convicted for masturbation through his pants without exposing his genitals to the victim. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>439 Mass. at 497 &amp; n.10, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Maunsell, </em>170 Vt. at 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\">AIthough the defendant\u2019s written motion for a required finding referenced only the charge under \u00a7 16, his oral motion was sufficient to move for a required finding of not guilty on both charges, including the \u00a7 53 charge, based on the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to prove his identity. Even had the defendant failed to move for a required finding on the \u00a7 53 charge, we would still review the evidence on identity to determine whether the defendant\u2019s conviction rested on insufficient evidence and thus inherently resulted in a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 140 n.8 (2001), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGovern, </em>397 Mass. 863, 867 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Even if the evidence regarding the February 20 incident were improperly admitted, we would include that evidence in our sufficiency analysis. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiBenedetto, </em>414 Mass. 37, 45-46 (1992); <em>Kater </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>421 Mass. 17, 18 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Generally such evidence is referred to as \u201cprior bad acts\u201d evidence, but \u201c[t]he principles are the same whether the bad acts are prior or subsequent\u201d to the acts charged. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brusgulis, </em>406 Mass. 501, 502 n.l (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
