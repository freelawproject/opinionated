Herrick\u2019s application for a superannuation retirement. ERRB denied Herrick\u2019s application on the ground that he had forfeited his right to a pension due to \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d as provided in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A magistrate in the Division of Administrative Law Appeals (DALA) upheld that decision. The Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB) affirmed in a divided decision, the majority stating that \u201cthe behavior attendant to Herrick\u2019s resignation was moral turpitude,\u201d and finding that the phrase \u201cwithout moral turpitude\u201d could not have been intended by the Legislature to be confined to \u201cremoved or discharged\u201d employees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On cross motions for judgment on the pleadings, a Superior Court judge reversed on the ground that CRAB (and the other entities before it) had committed an error of law in their interpretation of c. 32, \u00a7 10(1). The judge also disagreed with the alternative ground argued by ERRB that Herrick\u2019s pension was forfeited by operation of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4). Notwithstanding that this contention was raised for the first time in Superior Court, the judge considered it, nonetheless, for the sake of completeness. Because we agree that the statute in question does not permit the forfeiture of Herrick\u2019s pension, the denial of his application for superannuation retirement benefits was error and must be reversed. Thus, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\"><em>Background. </em>Briefly, at the time of his retirement, Herrick worked as a maintenance mechanic and custodian for the Wen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>ham Housing Authority (Authority), and through that employment (and prior employment with the town of Hamilton) was a member of ERRB. On May 1, 2003, Herrick was charged with sexually assaulting his daughter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That same day he resigned his position with the Authority and, on May 6, 2003, submitted an application for voluntary superannuation retirement pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On May 15, 2003, he pleaded guilty to two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child and was sentenced to two and one-half years in jail, eighteen months of which to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">On June 27, 2003, ERRB denied Herrick\u2019s application for retirement benefits. Herrick appealed from that decision. A hearing was conducted by a DALA magistrate on July 1, 2004, resulting in a decision affirming ERRB\u2019s decision. Herrick then appealed from that decision to CRAB, which affirmed the denial of Herrick\u2019s pension application, in a two-to-one decision. Herrick then sought timely judicial review in Superior Court, where both parties filed motions for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>This case presents an issue of statutory construction. The standards of law applicable to the issue before us were recently summarized in <em>Tabroff </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd.., </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 131, 133-134 (2007), quoting from <em>Retirement Bd. of Taunton </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 914, 915 (2002) (citation omitted): \u201cMassachusetts courts give great deference to decisions of administrative agencies. An administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute has long been relied on by Massachusetts courts \u2018because of the agency\u2019s experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Nuclear Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Mgmt. Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 211 (1995), quoting from Celia, Administrative Law &amp; Practice \u00a7 747 (1986) (\u201cA State administrative agency in Massachusetts has considerable leeway in interpreting a statute it is charged with enforcing\u201d). While the court recognizes that reasonable interpretations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>statutes by agencies are entitled to deference, \u201c[a]n erroneous interpretation of a statute by an administrative agency is not entitled to deference.\u201d <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Executive Office of Communities &amp; Dev., </em>411 Mass. 599, 606 (1992). \u201cDeference is not abdication. It does not permit a detectable \u2018error of law\u2019 by the agency.\u201d <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 203, 209 (2009), quoting from <em>Heineken U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 567, 572 (2004). \u201cIf an agency interpretation were to collide with the plain meaning of a statute, the agency view would have to give way.\u201d <em>Anheuser-Busch, supra </em>at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">\u201cWe should not disturb an administrative agency\u2019s decision unless we determine \u2018that the substantial rights of any party have been prejudiced\u2019 based on one of the reasons set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). The deference normally accorded to an administrative agency\u2019s decision is no longer appropriate when that agency commits an error of law, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c), or its decision is unsupported by substantial evidence, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(e).\u201d <em>Tabroff, supra </em>at 134 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\"><em>G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(1). </em>We turn first to the scope of the statute\u2019s qualifying phrase \u201cwithout moral turpitude.\u201d Herrick contends that it applies only to the situation where a member of a public retirement system is \u201cremoved or discharged.\u201d The basis on which ERRB denied Herrick\u2019s pension application, a determination with which CRAB agreed, is that the phrase \u201cwithout moral turpitude\u201d modifies all applications for retirement, including those submitted after a member resigns. In a comprehensive and well-reasoned decision, the Superior Court judge disagreed with this interpretation, applying general principles of statutory construction and grammatical rules; she concluded that the qualifier \u201cwithout moral turpitude\u201d applied only to those removed or discharged from employment, not to all other antecedent phrases in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">As expressed in <em>Collatos </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>396 Mass. 684, 686 (1986) (citations omitted), \u201c[a] statute designed to enforce the law by punishing offenders, rather than simply by enforcing restitution to those damaged, is in the nature of a penal statute. Forfeiture of property ... is punitive.\u201d \u201cPenal statutes must be construed strictly \u2018and not extended by equity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>or by the probable or supposed intention of the legislature as derived from doubtful words; but that in order to charge a party with a penalty, he must be brought within its operation, as manifested by express words or necessary implication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686-687, quoting from <em>Libby </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H.R.R., </em>273 Mass. 522, 525-526 (1930). \u201cWe examine the statute, therefore, particularly mindful that its words are not to be stretched to accomplish a result not expressed.\u201d <em>Collates, supra </em>at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">\u201cA fundamental tenet of statutory interpretation is that statutory language should be given effect consistent with its plain meaning and in light of the aim of the Legislature unless to do so would achieve an illogical result.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001). Agency expertise or policy preference cannot alter the plain meaning of unambiguous statutory language. See especially <em>M.H. Gordon &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>371 Mass. 584, 588-590 (1976) (courts cannot acquiesce in expedient enlargement of administrative authority or jurisdiction unsupported by statutory terms). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vickey, </em>381 Mass. 762, 767 (1980) (\u201ca basic tenet of statutory construction is to give the words their plain meaning in light of the aim of the Legislature, and when the statute appears not to provide for an eventuality, there is no justification for judicial legislation\u201d). \u201c[W]hen the meaning of a statute is at issue, the initial inquiry focuses on the actual language of that statute. \u2018Where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Land Bank Commn. </em>v. <em>Board of Assessors of W. Tisbury, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 27 (2004), quoting from <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of S. Hadley, </em>423 Mass. 283, 285 (1996). \u201cA statute is plain and unambiguous if \u2018virtually anyone competent to understand it, and desiring fairly and impartially to ascertain its signification, would attribute to the expression in its context a meaning such as the one we derive, rather than any other; and would consider any different meaning, by comparison, strained, or far-fetched, or unusual, or unlikely.\u2019 \u201d <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard, supra </em>at 28 n.4, quoting from <em>New England Med. Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>381 Mass. 748, 750 (1980). \u201cA fundamental and well-established principle of statutory interpretation \u2018is that a statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fleet Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>448 Mass. 441, 448 (2007), quoting from <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). See <em>Sullivan, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Turning, then, to the words of the statute, as the judge observed: \u201c[t]he \u2018rule of the last antecedent\u2019 holds that, unless there is something in the subject matter, dominant purpose, or language of the statute that requires a different interpretation, \u2018qualifying phrases are to be applied to the words or phrase immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to others more remote.\u2019 <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Boston Wyman, Inc., </em>410 Mass. 1005, 1006-1007 (1991), quoting [from] <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ven-Fuel, Inc., </em>758 F.2d 741, 751 [(1st Cir. 1985)]. ... \u2018It is the general rule of statutory as well as grammatical construction that a modifying clause is confined to the last antecedent unless there is something in the subject matter or dominant purpose which requires a different interpretation. . . . According to (this rule) of constmction a proviso or an exception is also presumed to be confined to the last antecedent.\u2019 <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Brookline Rent Control Bd., </em>385 Mass. 228, 230-231 (1982) (citations omitted).\u201d Thus, since the antecedent phrases of the statute are separated from the qualifier by commas, the qualifier applies only to the immediate antecedent within the same phrase that was not separated from \u201cwithout moral turpitude\u201d by a comma.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The logic of her interpretation becomes apparent when the use of the phrase \u201cwithout moral turpitude\u201d is examined in connection with the two means, provided by \u00a7 10(1), under which a member may be qualified to retire: (1) \u201cafter completing twenty or more years of creditable service,\u201d and (2) \u201chaving attained age fifty-five.\u201d In relation to the former, the situation when a member\u2019s \u201coffice or position is abolished\u201d is immediately antecedent to the phrase \u201cwithout moral turpitude,\u201d but abolishment of position is clearly unrelated to moral turpitude. This conclusion is compelled when compared to the latter \u201cage fifty-five\u201d retirement, since the phrase \u201cremoved or discharged from his office or position without moral turpitude on his part,\u201d is followed by the phrase \u201cor any such member whose office or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>position is abolished,\u201d a situation that does not require that it be \u201cwithout moral turpitude,\u201d as such condition is not included. See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Similarly, the judge\u2019s interpretation that the phrase \u201cwithout moral turpitude\u201d relates only to \u201cremoved or discharged\u201d is supported by her comparison of \u00a7 10(1) with \u00a7 10(2)(\u00bfti/2). As she points out, the latter section, which pertains to an application for retirement benefits from a member who resigns after ten years of service, does not contain the phrase \u201cwithout moral turpitude.\u201d That \u201cwithout moral turpitude\u201d was intended to modify only \u201cremoved or discharged\u201d is also evident from G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(2)(a), inserted by St. 2002, c. 184, \u00a7 46, which states that \u201c[t]he retirement board shall require the employer of any employee applying for a termination retirement allowance to certify in writing, under the pains and penalties of perjury, that one of the following circumstances applies: (1) that the employee has failed of nomination or re-election, (2) that the employee has failed of reappointment, (3) that the employee\u2019s office or position has been abolished, or (4) that the employee has been removed or discharged from his position without moral turpitude on his part.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The Superior Court judge\u2019s decision cited, and was consistent with, the only authority on point, two opinions from the Attorney General which recognized that retirement under the threat of removal is not the equivalent of removal or discharge under c. 32, \u00a7 10(1) or \u00a7 10(2). See Opinion of the Attorney General, Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 134-135 (1963); Opinion of the Attorney General, Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 172-174 (1977). Moreover, such an interpretation is consistent with a view supported by decisions of both the Supreme Judicial Court and this court, albeit in dicta. See <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy. Retirement Bd., </em>397 Mass. 734, 739 (1986) (\u201cthere are laws of the Commonwealth which preclude the payment of retirement benefits to certain public employees who are discharged or convicted for misconduct in office. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10[1] [1984 ed.]\u201d); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Taunton, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 614, 619 n.6 (1983) (\u201c[w]e note . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>that the \u2018moral turpitude\u2019 provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(1), do not apply since the plaintiff was not \u2018removed or discharged from his office\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\"><em>Threatened removal. </em>ERRB contends additionally that Herrick\u2019s pension can be forfeited because his resignation, seen as occurring under threat of removal, amounts to constructive removal. Technically, this misapplies the concept of constructive discharge to the facts of this case since Herrick\u2019s motivation to leave his employ was not due to actions of the employer. <em>GTE Prod. Corp. </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>421 Mass. 22, 34-35 (1995). More broadly, however, ERRB seeks to extend the meaning of \u201cremoved or discharged\u201d to be able to reach members who retire under a cloud, in the face of possible or likely removal or discharge for reasons of criminal prosecution for offenses of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Addressing a similar question, the Attorney General opined \u201cthat the term \u2018removal or discharge\u2019 is not so broad that it sweeps within the ambit of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(2)(c), a resignation arguably tendered to forestall removal. It is a basic maxim of statutory construction that the words of a statute are to be read in accordance with their common and approved usage and are not to be stretched beyond their fair meaning in order to rationalize a particular result. The words \u2018removal\u2019 and \u2018discharge\u2019 connote an affirmative act by one\u2019s employer and have a common usage significantly different from the word \u2018resignation,\u2019 which implies an act by the employee. Indeed the difference between the terms is apparent in the terms of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10, in which the words \u2018removal or discharge\u2019 and \u2018resigns\u2019 are repeatedly used to describe different situations. Since words used in different portions of a statute are ordinarily given the same meaning throughout, it would be an anomaly of statutory construction to extend the scope of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(2)(c), to include resignations as well as removals, when they are made distinct by the immediately preceding language of \u00a7 10.\u201d Opinion of the Attorney General, Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 173-174 (1977) (citations omitted). The same rationale can be applied to \u00a7 10(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">To hold otherwise, and to permit \u201cremoved or discharged\u201d to be stretched to accommodate the kind of \u201cconstructive\u201d removal suggested by ERRB, would permit it to inquire into, evaluate, and weigh reasons that motivated the retirement of a member. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Such an interpretation would invite decisions based not upon an identifiable record of proceedings that lead an employer to an objectively discernible removal of its employee, but instead upon subjective criteria that are prone to a range of ills that objective criteria are designed to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">As suggested by the judge, ERRB\u2019s reliance on <em>DeLeire </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (1993), is misplaced. There, the member was suspended from his position and sentenced to prison prior to his attempted resignation. Accordingly, the position was considered vacant by operation of G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 30, and such \u201cremoval\u201d or \u201cdischarge\u201d was plainly with \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d Here, however, Herrick, resigned and applied for retirement prior to his conviction. Moreover, significant to the holding in <em>DeLeire, </em>but distinguishable from the case at bar, was the operation of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25, which precludes payment of retirement benefits to certain suspended employees, and the court\u2019s holding that the letter of resignation submitted in that case was not sufficient to end the employee\u2019s suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\"><em>G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4). </em>ERRB also argues that forfeiture of Herrick\u2019s pension is required pursuant to the provision of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), which prohibits a member, \u201cafter final conviction of a criminal offense involving violation of the laws applicable to his office or position,\u201d from receiving a pension. Herrick contends that his conviction was for an offense that did not apply to his position. In consideration of the cases that have interpreted \u00a7 15(4), we decide that this subsection does not apply to the circumstances of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Similar to c. 32, \u00a7 10(1), \u00a7 15(4) has been held as penal in nature, thus strictly construed. <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>423 Mass. 1, 3 n.3 (1996). In <em>Gaffney, supra </em>at 4-5, the court stated that \u201c[t]he substantive touchstone intended by the General Court [when it enacted G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4),] is criminal activity <em>connected with </em>the office or position. Yet it is also apparent that the General Court did not intend pension forfeiture to follow as a sequelae of any and all criminal convictions. Only those violations <em>related to </em>the member\u2019s official capacity were targeted. Looking to the facts of each case for a <em>direct link </em>between the criminal offense and the member\u2019s office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>or position best effectuates the legislative intent of \u00a7 15(4).\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) In <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Bulger, </em>446 Mass. 169, 180 (2006), quoting from <em>Gaffney, supra </em>at 4, the court further described its decision in <em>Gaffney </em>as not limiting the application of \u00a7 15(4) to violations of \u201c \u2018highly specialized crimes addressing official actions\u2019 or even criminal conduct committed \u2018in the course of [official] duties,\u2019 but encompass[ing] \u2018criminal activity connected with the office or position.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">EERB contends that Herrick\u2019s sexual assault convictions are directly linked to his job as a custodian for the housing project because he had access to keys to the individual units. While the offenses in question are ones of moral turpitude,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the record does not show that the offenses were connected with Herrick\u2019s official capacity, nor does there appear to be the type of direct link intended by the Legislature, especially since the statute is construed narrowly because of its penal nature. <em>Gaffney, supra </em>at 3 n.3. Unlike the facts in <em>Gaffney, </em>or those in <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Justices of the Quincy Div. of the Dist. Ct. Dept., </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 612, 616-617 (2006) (forfeiture under \u00a7 15[4] upheld when a city inspector was convicted of breaking and entering into city hall and stealing from his personnel file), <em>S.C., </em>452 Mass. 517 (2008), a case relied upon by ERRB, the facts here do not present a connection or direct link to Herrick\u2019s official position; without intending to minimize the offense, we observe that it was not committed upon anyone who was employed by or who resided at the public property, nor did it occur there. This lack of connection to Herrick\u2019s position is significant, notwithstanding the recognition in <em>Gaffney, supra </em>at 3, that G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(4), was enacted \u201cfor an intermediate level of pension forfeiture in a broader array of circumstances\u201d in reaction to the decision by the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Collatos, </em>396 Mass. at 687-688. In <em>Collatos, supra, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court construed G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15(3A), to be limited by its plain terms to pension forfeiture for conviction of offenses under the listed State statutes, and not to reach a Federal cognate conviction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nonetheless, a direct link between the public position and the offense for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>the member is convicted must be shown, a connection which has not been shown here.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The pension forfeiture statute at issue is a penal provision that must be strictly construed, and when construed as such, it does not support ERRB\u2019s interpretation of the statute or permit the denial of Herrick\u2019s application for superannuation retirement benefits. Therefore, the denial of the application was erroneous. We must affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Section 10(1), as amended through St. 2000, c. 123, \u00a7 24A, provides: \u201cRight to Superannuation Retirement Allowance.

We cannot presume that the statutory language was an inadvertent oversight by the Legislature, nor may we provide a gloss to the statute that prevents this outcome from reoccurring. We agree with the observations by the judge below, and by two Attorneys General, that if such an outcome was not intended, its remedy lies with the Legislature. See <em>Vickey, </em>381 Mass. at 767 (\u201cwhen the statute appears not to provide for an eventuality, there is no justification for judicial legislation\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
