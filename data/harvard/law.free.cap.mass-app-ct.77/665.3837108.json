Asserting claims of breach of fiduciary duty and unfair and deceptive practices in violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, the plaintiff-buyer, Jonathan M. Zang, filed a complaint against NRT New England Incorporated doing business as Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage (Coldwell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Banker), contending that it had violated its duties as an escrow agent by refusing to disburse a portion of the buyer\u2019s deposit to the buyer\u2019s agent and instead paying itself moneys in contravention of the principals\u2019 explicit written instructions in the agreement creating the escrows. The buyer appeals from a decision of a Superior Court judge denying his motion for summary judgment and allowing summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Coldwell Banker. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\"><em>Background. Factual history. </em>On January 4, 2006, Neil Bradford (seller) and Coldwell Banker executed an \u201cExclusive Right to Sell Agreement\u201d (the listing agreement) to sell his condominium on Phillips Street in Beacon Hill (property). The listing agreement required the seller to pay Coldwell Banker \u201ca fee for professional services of 5% of the gross sales price\u201d and authorized Coldwell Banker to \u201cpay all commissions payable no later than the closing date\u201d and \u201cretain any deposits held in escrow and apply said deposits against commission due.\u201d The listing agreement further provided that \u201cColdwell Banker\u2019s usual and customary practice is to compensate cooperating brokers acting as a buyer\u2019s agent in the amount of 2.5% of the contract price . . . .\u201d Zang was not a party to that contract, and he would never become a party to that contract. On January 20, 2006, Zang called, had his first direct communication with the seller about the property, and attended an open house two days later. Alan Fincke, a sales associate affiliated with Coldwell Banker\u2019s Boston office, was present. On January 25, 2006, after contacting Fincke, Zang again viewed the property and submitted an offer to purchase the property, which was originally listed at $1,349,000, for $1,200,000. Zang provided a $1,000 check to hold the offer, which Coldwell Banker accepted but did not deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">After three days, negotiations reached an impasse because Coldwell Banker rejected Zang\u2019s request that it reduce its commission in order to close the gap between Zang\u2019s final offer and Bradford\u2019s counteroffer of $1,225,000. Zang then retained William Wendel of the Real Estate Caf\u00e9 as his agent (buyer\u2019s agent) to represent him in further negotiations. In exchange for his services, the buyer\u2019s agent agreed to be compensated for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>services at an hourly rate of one hundred dollars (minimum fee of $3,000) and to rebate to Zang any commission he received from the seller in connection with the purchase of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">On January 28, 2006, responding to an offer to purchase the property that had been transmitted to Coldwell Banker by the buyer\u2019s agent on behalf of Zang, Coldwell Banker\u2019s sales agent Fincke stated in a recorded voicemail message to Zang: \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019ve shared with [the buyer\u2019s agent], but since he is a fellow agent and is presumably expecting to receive a full fifty percent commission for the mere writing of an offer, I thought he should understand that he may have a great deal of difficulty collecting any commission at all from Coldwell Banker.\u201d A few minutes later, Fincke telephoned Zang again and in another recorded voicemail message asked whether \u201cyou think that it\u2019s really fair that [the buyer\u2019s agent] should come in at this late date and capture half of the commission. The listing agent [Coldwell Banker real estate agent Natalia Volkova] will be expecting her half of the commission because she has the relationship with the seller, and she deserves that, and she\u2019s marketed the property, and what does Alan [Fincke] get for all of his work? Nothing. But, you know, I guess that\u2019s money in your pocket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Eventually, the parties reached an agreed-upon sales price of $1,225,000, and they executed a purchase and sale agreement on February 6, 2006. Coldwell Banker did not sign the purchase and sale agreement. Section 7 of the purchase and sale agreement provided, in pertinent part, that Zang would make a deposit of $122,500<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (ten per cent of the purchase price), with the balance of the full purchase price to be paid at closing. Section 21 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">\u201cAll deposits made hereunder shall be held in escrow by Coldwell Banker as escrow agent subject to the terms of this agreement and shall be duly accounted for at the time for performance of this agreement. In the event of any disagreement between the parties, the escrow agent may retain all deposits made under this agreement pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>written instructions mutually given by the SELLER and the BUYER.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Section 19 of the purchase and sale agreement (the fee-splitting provision) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">\u201cA broker\u2019s fee for professional services of 5% of the purchase price (i.e., $61,250.00) is due from the SELLER and is to be split evenly between Coldwell Banker (SELLER\u2019S agent) and Real Estate Caf\u00e9 (BUYER\u2019S agent), the Broker(s) herein, and is to be paid at closing from SELLER\u2019S proceeds, if and only if closing occurs and deed is recorded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">In short, the seller\u2019s net sales proceeds were to be reduced by $61,250, of which $30,625 was to be paid to the buyer\u2019s agent at closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">On February 6, 2006, Zang delivered a check for $121,500 to Coldwell Banker via the buyer\u2019s agent and the seller\u2019s agent. One day after the purchase and sale agreement was signed, Coldwell Banker deposited Zang\u2019s initial $1,000 deposit check (dated January 28, 2006), and one day later deposited Zang\u2019s subsequent check of $121,500. Coldwell Banker\u2019s \u201cEscrow Funds Form\u201d indicates that as of February 7, 2006, it held in escrow a total of $122,500 (the deposit), equal to ten percent of the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Concerned in the days following the execution of the purchase and sale agreement that Coldwell Banker, through its agents, appeared to indicate its intention to contest the fee-splitting provision, Zang sent a G. L. c. 93A demand letter on March 1, 2006, to Coldwell Banker seeking assurance that the fee-splitting provision would be honored. Coldwell Banker did not respond prior to the closing thirty days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">On March 31, 2006, the sale closed. The parties had not altered the instruction to Coldwell Banker in the purchase and sale agreement regarding the disbursement of the deposit, and in fact, the HUD-1 settlement statement signed at the closing reflected and reiterated those instructions, mutually instructing Coldwell Banker as escrow agent to disburse $30,625.00 of the seller\u2019s sale proceeds to the buyer\u2019s agent. Coldwell Banker disbursed a check to the seller in the amount of $61,250, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>representing fifty percent of the deposit. However, Coldwell Banker retained the other fifty percent and refused to pay two and one-half percent to the buyer\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">On August 13, 2007, Zang filed a complaint against Coldwell Banker alleging breach of fiduciary duty and violations of G. L. c. 93A, both derived from Coldwell Banker\u2019s refusal to disburse the deposit as instructed in writing by its principals. Coldwell Banker answered and asserted no counterclaims. In August, 2008, Zang moved for summary judgment, and Coldwell Banker cross-moved. On January 28, 2009, after a hearing, the judge denied Zang\u2019s motion for summary judgment and allowed Cold-well Banker\u2019s motion. The judge announced his decision orally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\u201cI think that there are two contracts here that each set out obligations. I do not think that . . . Zang and Bradford [the seller] had the power to affect a contractual relationship entered into previously between . . . Bradford and Coldwell Banker. I think that the principal obligation of a so-called escrow agent under a conventional real estate residential purchase &amp; sale agreement is to distribute money of the buyer only if the real estate closing is, generally speaking, a successful one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">\u201cColdwell Banker\u2019s obligations to the parties, the buyer and the seller, as an escrow agent. . . were fully discharged when a deed passed from [the seller] to . . . Zang, when . . . Zang accepted title, and when Coldwell Banker distributed one-half of the escrowed amount or one-half of the deposit, more accurately speaking, to the seller as seller\u2019s proceeds. The other one-half of the deposit was earmarked and always understood to be earmarked as a broker\u2019s commission. There, although the parties to the buy/sell may have agreed to share it, as they did, one of the parties to that contract had a previously binding contract not to do so. I don\u2019t see any remedy that . . . Zang has against Coldwell Banker.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Zang then moved for reconsideration, which the judge denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\"><em>Discussion. </em>We review the allowance of a motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>Miller </em>v. Cotter, 448 Mass. 671, 676 (2007). Under the familiar standard, summary judgment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>properly granted only when, if the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, \u201call material facts have been established and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Kitras </em>v. <em>Zoning Administrator of Aquinnah, </em>453 Mass. 245, 251 (2009), citing Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), as amended, 436 Mass. 1404 (2002). \u201cAny doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact are to be resolved against the party moving for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">\u201cAfter the execution of the contract of sale, a broker\u2019s role often involves holding the down payment or deposit made by the purchaser. Sometimes a broker seeks to hold the deposit as assurance that it can be used as a fund from which a commission can be paid.\u201d Burke, Law of Real Estate Brokers \u00a7 1.11 (3d ed. Supp. 2009). This case represents such a situation. Cold-well Banker played a dual role in this transaction \u2014 as seller\u2019s agent and as escrow holder. Zang argues there is no genuine issue of material fact that Coldwell Banker as escrow holder breached its fiduciary duty by failing to pay Zang\u2019s agent two and one-half percent at the time of closing. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">\u201cAn escrow agreement consists of the delivery of money ... by one party and a promise by the other to hold it until the performance of a condition or the happening of a certain event.\u201d <em>Matter of Hilson, </em>448 Mass. 603, 613-614 (2007). See Eno &amp; Hovey, Real Estate Law \u00a7 28.25 (4th ed. 2004). The escrow agent need not sign an escrow agreement in order to be bound by the instructions of the principals to the transaction. See <em>Matter of Hilson, supra </em>at 614 (example of the rule that an escrow holder need not sign a written escrow agreement in order to assume the fiduciary obligations of an escrow agent); <em>Kaarela </em>v. <em>Birkhead, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 410, 413 (1992) (\u201cThe deposit of . . . escrow funds constitute\"] an acceptance of the escrow arrangement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">An escrow agent owes a fiduciary duty to both parties to the escrow agreement. See <em>Discipline of Two Attorneys, </em>421 Mass. 619, 626-627 (1996). See also Restatement (Second) of Agency app. \u00a7 14D Reporters\u2019 Notes at 60 (1958) (\u201cAlthough the escrow holder is not the agent of either of the parties, he is a fiduciary of both of them\u201d). See generally <em>Gulf Petroleum, S.A. </em>v. <em>Collazo, </em>316 E2d 257, 261 (1st Cir. 1963) (bankruptcy trustee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>\u201cis to be regarded as holding the so-called escrowed funds in trust under the terms of the agreement and not for general creditors\u201d), cited in <em>Childs </em>v. <em>Harbor Lounge of Lynn, Inc., </em>357 Mass. 33, 35 (1970). The escrow agent\u2019s duty is to \u201ckeep the deposit; he could not dispose of it without the express or implied authority of the depositor.\u201d <em>Kaarela </em>v. <em>Birkhead, supra </em>at 412.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The escrow agent, therefore, must strictly follow the instructions of the parties to the transaction. See <em>Greater Boston Real Estate Bd. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Real Estate Brokers &amp; Salesmen, </em>405 Mass. 360, 362 n.5 (1989) (\u201cAs a matter of law, a broker who acts as an escrow holder, like any escrow holder, \u2018is bound to act in strict compliance with the terms of the escrow agreement\u2019 \u201d), quoting from <em>Schmid </em>v. <em>National Bank of Greece, </em>622 F. Supp. 704, 710 (D. Mass. 1985), aff\u2019d, 802 F.2d 439 (1st Cir. 1986). See also <em>Claussen </em>v. <em>First Am. Title Guar. Co., </em>186 Cal. App. 3d 429, 437 (1986) (\u201cThe duties of a depositee . . . are created and measured by the instructions of the depositor. By accepting the deposit and by acquiescence in the instructions the depositee undertakes to perform according to the terms thereof\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Here, when Coldwell Banker accepted the $122,500 from Zang and deposited that sum in its escrow account, it assumed the fiduciary duties of an escrow agent. Coldwell Banker was required to act in accordance with the parties\u2019 unambiguous instructions. The purchase and sale agreement between the buyer and seller, together with the confirmatory HUD-1 settlement statement, provided unambiguous instructions to Coldwell Banker that it must pay two and one-half percent of the purchase price to the buyer\u2019s agent. Furthermore, Coldwell Banker retained the deposit despite knowing more than one week prior to the signing of the purchase and sale agreement that Zang intended for Coldwell Banker to pay two and one-half percent of the purchase price to the buyer\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Coldwell Banker argues that it is not bound by the terms of the purchase and sale agreement because it did not sign that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>agreement. The uncontested facts establish, however, that Cold-well Banker\u2019s agents were on notice of the potential dispute more than one week prior to the signing of the purchase and sale agreement and Coldwell Banker nonetheless accepted the buyer\u2019s deposit. As has been noted, the purchase and sale agreement provided, \u201cAll deposits made hereunder shall be held in escrow by Coldwell Banker as escrow agent subject to the terms of this agreement . . . .\u201d After the parties executed the purchase and sale agreement, including the fee-splitting provision, Coldwell Banker placed the full deposit from the buyer into its escrow account, bringing the total amount that it held in escrow to $122,500. Although Coldwell Banker did not sign the purchase and sale agreement, it did accept and hold the deposit made to it by the buyer pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement with knowledge of the dispute. Therefore, the terms of the purchase and sale agreement applied to Coldwell Banker as escrow agent. See <em>Kaarela </em>v. <em>Birkhead, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. at 412-413. See also <em>Haufler </em>v. <em>Zotos, </em>446 Mass. 489, 499 (2006) (escrow agent \u201cassented to the escrow agreement on behalf of [his principal] by holding the deeds, mortgage, and sum of $5,000 in escrow until the deadline specified in the escrow agreement had passed\u201d), citing <em>Kaarela </em>v. <em>Birkhead, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">If Coldwell Banker disputed the terms under which it held the escrow, it should have negotiated different terms in the purchase and sale agreement and expressly made its escrow obligations subject to the terms of the listing agreement. If Coldwell Banker did not think that it could respect the parties\u2019 instructions for the escrow, it should have declined to hold the funds in the first place. In any event, once it assumed its fiduciary responsibility with respect to the funds, if it believed that moneys should not be split with the buyer\u2019s agent, it should have pursued a corrective avenue<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rather than engaging in self-help and disbursing the disputed funds to itself. Compare <em>National </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>Starch &amp; Chem. Co. </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 906, 907 (2004) (after both the seller and buyer demanded full amount of moneys held in escrow, \u201c[n]ot surprisingly, the escrow agent refused to release the funds to either party\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Coldwell Banker argues that pursuant to the rules of the Multiple Listing Service the buyer\u2019s agent was not the \u201cprocuring cause of the sale\u201d and that he was not entitled to any commission. We recognize that \u201c[a]bsent a written agreement to the contrary, a real estate broker is entitled to a commission only if the broker is the efficient and predominating cause of subsequent transaction between the parties.\u201d <em>Cantell </em>v. <em>Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos, Inc., 55 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 550, 555 (2002), citing <em>Julius Tofias &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>John B. Stetson Co., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 392, 395 (1985), citing <em>Kacavas </em>v. <em>Diamond, </em>303 Mass. 88, 91 (1939). However, we need not determine whether the buyer\u2019s agent here was the \u201cefficient and predominating cause\u201d because Coldwell Banker\u2019s obligation and liability arises out of its duties as a fiduciary under the escrow agreement, the terms of which were contained in the purchase and sale agreement and the HUD-1 settlement statement. See <em>Discipline of Two Attorneys, </em>421 Mass. at 627 (\u201cself-dealing . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>such as an escrow holder\u2019s unauthorized collection from escrowed funds of a debt owed by a party to the escrow agreement\u201d violates \u201cfiduciary duty to that party to the escrow agreement\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cold-well Banker breached its duty in deciding unilaterally how escrowed funds would be allocated.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Because the undisputed facts show that Coldwell Banker failed to follow the unambiguous escrow instructions issued by the principals at the time of closing, there exists no genuine issue of material fact that Coldwell Banker breached its fiduciary duty by refusing to pay two and one-half percent of the purchase price to the buyer\u2019s agent. For the foregoing reasons, the orders allowing Coldwell Banker\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying Zang\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the claim for breach of fiduciary duty are reversed. The judgment entered in behalf of Coldwell Banker dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint is reversed, and a new judgment shall enter in favor of Zang on the claim against Coldwell Banker for breach of its duties as escrow agent. We remand for further proceedings on the claim alleging unfair and deceptive practices in violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\">This amount included the $1,000 previously paid plus $121,500 paid on the date of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Self-dealing by the escrow agent, i.e., \u201ccollection from escrowed funds of a debt owed by a party to the escrow agreement, would be a breach of duty.\u201d <em>Grand Pac.
