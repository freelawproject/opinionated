L. c. 152, \u00a7 48, is at issue in this appeal. Despite the objections of the injured employee, who made it known he no longer wished to enter into the proposed lump sum settlement with the insurer, the administrative judge ordered him to do so. This was error, as was an order of a judge of the Superior Court dismissing the employee\u2019s complaint on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>jurisdictional grounds, Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), 365 Mass. 754 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\"><em>Background.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On May 3, 2006, Michael Opare suffered lower back injuries as a result of having been hit by a forklift during the course of his employment with Bunzl USA (Bunzl), and made a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, in accordance with G. L. c. 152 (act). With counsel, Opare and Bunzl\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier, Sentry Insurance Company (Sentry or insurer), participated in proceedings before the department.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In March of 2008, the parties negotiated a lump sum settlement. They submitted the proposed settlement document to an administrative judge for her review and approval pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">At an initial conference, the administrative judge deferred approving the parties\u2019 agreement, citing an error respecting a particular medical expense reflected on the settlement document. The judge requested the parties to correct the same before resubmitting it to her for approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">In the interim, Opare had misgivings as to entering into the proposed settlement. His change of heart stemmed from the fact that the results of a recent magnetic resonance imaging indicated that his back was \u201cin a worse condition\u201d than he had thought. This led Opare to doubt whether his entering into a lump sum settlement with the insurer was truly in his best interest. Through counsel, Opare notified the insurer and the administrative judge that he no longer wished to enter into the settlement. The insurer objected, and the administrative judge requested the parties to appear before her at a hearing on April 15, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>At that hearing, Opare\u2019s counsel offered up the parties\u2019 signed settlement document, which was defaced with the word \u201cVOID\u201d handwritten across its face page. Counsel gave a recital of the reasons why his client no longer wished to conclude the settlement with the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Over Opare\u2019s counsel\u2019s objection, the administrative judge \u201capproved\u201d the lump sum settlement, binding both Opare and the insurer to its terms. The settlement called for a net lump sum payment of $20,000 to Opare in return for redeeming the insurer\u2019s liability for all future weekly benefit payments to him. Opare then filed an action in the Superior Court, alleging the department had infringed his due process rights by binding him to the settlement absent his consent. He sought a declaration that the lump sum settlement was null and void, and requested that his c. 152 claims be \u201creinstated\u201d to enable him to prosecute the same through the administrative process before the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The Superior Court judge, in dismissing Opare\u2019s complaint pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), ruled the court lacked jurisdiction for the reason that Opare had failed to exhaust administrative remedies. We review that conclusion de novo. See <em>Indeck Maine Energy, LLC </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Energy Resources, </em>454 Mass. 511, 516 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\"><em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Jurisdiction. </em>Central to c. 152\u2019s statutory scheme is the Legislature\u2019s command that the department have oversight responsibility over lump sum settlements in order to ensure that any such settlement is \u201cin the claimant\u2019s best interest.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48, as amended by St. 1991, c. 398. Once the department gives its approval of the parties\u2019 lump sum agreement pursuant to \u00a7 48, \u201cfurther inquiry\u201d of the merits of the controversy must be had in Superior Court. <em>Perkins\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 294, 299 (1932). See <em>LaFleur </em>v. <em>C.C. Pierce Co., </em>398 Mass. 254, 257 (1986).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This settled rule answers the jurisdictional issue here. <em>O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Case, </em>258 Mass. 205, 209 (1927).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Abandoning its contrary position advanced before the Superior Court judge,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the department now belatedly admits Opare was under no obligation to pursue this dispute further on the administrative stage. It was error for the judge to rule otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">b. <em>Merits. </em>The validity of a lump sum agreement concluded under c. 152 requires more than an \u201coffer\u201d and \u201cacceptance\u201d by the signatories. Under \u00a7 48, \u201ca lump sum agreement shall not have been perfected until and unless approved\u201d by the department \u201cas being in the claimant\u2019s best interest.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Conlon </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>299 Mass. 528, 532 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">In the present case, there was no \u201cagreement\u201d accepted and consented to by both parties pending before the department\u2019s administrative judge at the April 15, 2008, hearing. Given Opare\u2019s informed decision not to go forward with the settlement, reached with the advice of counsel, it hardly can be said the lump sum settlement was in his best interest. It is enough to say that Opare had weighed his options and, with the aid of his legal counsel, ultimately decided to pursue his workers\u2019 compensation case to a conclusion through the claims procedure available under c. 152. That the administrative judge elected to override Opare\u2019s choice and \u201capprove\u201d the agreement was in excess of her authority under c. 152. See <em>Sterling\u2019s Case, </em>233 Mass. 485,489-490 (1919).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Section 48\u2019s requirement of department approval of a lump sum agreement necessarily contemplates a negotiated settlement, to which all parties have willingly and knowingly agreed to be bound, consistent with the stated terms and conditions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That did not come to pass here. Ignoring this fundamental principle, the department argues Opare ought to be barred from pursuing an action in Superior Court because he has not alleged the lump sum settlement was a product of fraud or mutual mistake; while the latter two equitable grounds may form the basis for an aggrieved party\u2019s action to nullify or modify an approved \u00a7 48 lump sum agreement, the department\u2019s contention presupposes the existence of an enforceable settlement \u201cagreement\u201d in the first instance. Its supposition is at odds with Opare\u2019s underlying complaint, the factual allegations of which the department expressly accepted as being true, in the context of its rule 12(b)(1) dismissal motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">It is evident that there was ultimately no \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d between Opare and the insurer. Common sense and logic compel us to conclude, consistent with \u00a7 48\u2019s plain and unambiguous language, that at the April 15, 2008, hearing, no \u201cagreement\u201d was before the administrative judge to approve \u201cas being in [Opare\u2019s] best interest.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cWhen an employee is of full age the department can award a lump sum payment only in unusual cases where the parties agree. The employee and the insurer have the right to determine by contract the disposition to be made of the compensation claim, subject to the approval of the department, and the board cannot compel one of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>without his consent to accept such a lump sum payment.\u201d <em>Osborne\u2019s Case, </em>257 Mass. 532, 534 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The same is true here.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The administrative judge had no authority to impose a lump sum settlement on an employee who, for good faith reasons related to his then present medical condition, decided, with the advice of counsel, not to settle for a lump sum to be paid by the insurer.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Compare <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Telesector Resources Group, Inc., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 227, 233 (1996) (\u201cThere is nothing in the statute [\u00a7 15 of c. 152] itself to support the proposition that the Legislature has given a judge the authority to bind parties to settlement terms to which they have not agreed\u201d). To allow such a practice would eviscerate the \u201cbeneficent design\u201d behind the act. <em>Walker\u2019s Case, </em>453 Mass. 358, 361 (2009). \u201cThis is not a time nor an occasion for this court or an administrative board to reverse the fundamental concepts of our workers\u2019] compensation act.\u201d <em>Bursey\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 702, 707 (1950).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed, and the matter is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>remanded to the Superior Court for the entry of a judgment in favor of Opare,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> declaring that the approved \u00a7 48 lump sum settlement is null and void, and ordering that his statutory workers\u2019 compensation claims be reinstated before the department so that Opare may seek a resolution through the administrative claims process.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\">The facts are drawn from the complaint and the records of the department proceedings reproduced in the record appendix on appeal. For purposes of reviewing the rule 12(b)(1) dismissal order, we accept as true the factual allegations contained in the complaint as well as any favorable inferences reasonably drawn therefrom. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Chief Justice for Admn. &amp; Mgmt. of the Trial Court, </em>448 Mass. 15, 20-21 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Sentry paid Opare temporary total incapacity benefits (G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34) before filing a request with the department in January of 2007 to discontinue benefit payments. Subsequently, a conference order of the department directed Sentry to pay Opare temporary partial benefits (G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35), based on a prescribed earnings and weekly wage rate. Sentry\u2019s appeal from the conference order led to Opare being examined by an impartial medical examiner (IME). The IME concluded Opare\u2019s injuries (then presented) were not causally related to his May, 2006, workplace accident. Settlement negotiations ultimately ensued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 19, as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 107, clearly provides that a party to any agreement under this chapter, \u201c[e]xcept as provided by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10B, . . . may file a complaint with the superior court to vacate or modify such agreement on grounds of law or equity.\u201d See <em>Hansen\u2019s Case, </em>350 Mass. 178, 180 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b569-9\">In <em>O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Case, supra, </em>the court held: \u201cAfter an agreement has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>approved by the department, and acted upon, any party in interest may and should present that agreement to the Superior Court for a decree of reformation or cancellation, if such a decree would be justified on the facts had the agreement been made in a suit heard and determined in that court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b570-11\">In a submission to the Superior Court judge, the Attorney General\u2019s office, on behalf of the department, argued that Opare had failed to exhaust administrative remedies, a failure that, it said, deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. The Attorney General now \u201cagrees with Opare that he may seek judicial review of the lump-sum settlement without resorting to further process within the Department.\u201d In deciding the jurisdictional issue presented by a rule 12(b)(1) motion, a judge (and reviewing court) may consider documents and other materials outside the pleadings. <em>Audoire </em>v. <em>Clients\u2019 Security Bd., </em>450 Mass. 388, 390 n.4 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b570-12\">This statutory duty is performed by an administrative judge or administrative law judge. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48. \u201cThe determination of a lump sum [settlement] calls for a careful scrutiny of the evidence, the exercise of sound judgment and good practical sense, so that the amount will be as near as possible to the present value of all the compensation payments which the employee would be entitled to receive in the future.\u201d <em>Paltsios\u2019s Case, </em>329 Mass. 526, 529 (1952). The approval process under \u00a7 48 is designed to serve that exacting inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b570-13\">\u201c[T]he agreement is not approved unless the formal approval be also a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>legal approval and within the jurisdiction conferred on the Industrial Accident board by the act.\u201d <em>Sterling\u2019s Case, </em>233 Mass. at 490.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\">To be distinguished is the situation where a minor employee sustained a work-related injury. Under the pre-1985 version of \u00a7 48, the department could approve a lump sum agreement without the employee\u2019s prior consent. See Na-son, Koziol, &amp; Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 23.5, at 258 (3d ed. 2003). (We do not decide whether the department can still so act under the current version of \u00a7 48.) At the other end of the spectrum, the death of a claimant does not displace the authority of the department to review a lump sum agreement. See <em>Bertocchi\u2019s Case, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 561, 562-564 (2003); <em>Donovan\u2019s Case, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 566, 567-570 (2003). See also <em>Lopes\u2019s Case, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 227, 229 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b571-9\">This case is unlike the situation in <em>Ferreira </em>v. <em>Arrow Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 633, 635 (1983), where an insurer sought to nullify a settlement after it was signed and presented to a single member of the department who had recommended it for approval after a conference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\">In <em>Levesque </em>v. <em>State Rd. Cement Block Co., </em>21 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 39, 40 (2007), the department\u2019s reviewing board considered the ramifications of a claimant\u2019s \u201cchange of heart\u201d insofar as she had communicated her \u201cdesire to litigate,\u201d rather than settle her claim. A settlement had already been \u201ctentatively approved\u201d by an administrative judge. <em>Ibid. </em>The insurer and employer asked the administrative judge to declare the case settled and approve the agreement. The judge refused, reasoning, \u201cGiven the fact that the claimant in this matter has indicated that she is no longer satisfied with the terms of the settlement, I can not therefore in clear conscience enforce the lump sum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43 n.12. The judge indicated that \u201c[t]he matter will proceed in its normal course.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40. The reviewing board refused to entertain the employer\u2019s \u201cinterlocutory\u201d appeal of the judge\u2019s ruling denying enforcement of the proposed agreement. The judge\u2019s reasoning for refusing to enforce the \u201ctentatively approved\u201d lump sum settlement in <em>Levesque </em>rings true for the present dispute before us. Here, it is uncontroverted that the administrative judge did not \u201capprove\u201d the proposed lump sum agreement before Opare expressed his unwillingness to settle his claims for reasons related to his medical condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\">This follows from the fact that a claimant and insurer are not in the general marketplace of contractual agreements governed by common-law principles of contract formation, but rather in an intensely regulated system in which the department oversees the best interest of the claimant. See <em>Conlon </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>299 Mass. at 531-532.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Though not cited by the parties, we are mindful of the rule in <em>Tewksbury </em>v. <em>Fellsway Laundry, Inc., </em>319 Mass. 386, 389 (1946), and <em>Joseph </em>v. <em>Tata, </em>339 Mass. 600, 603 (1959): a bargained for written release, executed as part of a settlement of a claim for personal injuries, cannot be avoided on grounds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>mistake even if the parties had misapprehended the unknown consequences (stemming from the injury) that arose after the release was signed. That rule is not applicable here because there was ultimately no enforceable \u201cagreement\u201d available for approval by the administrative judge. <em>Tewksbury </em>involved a situation where the \u201cconsequences\u201d of a given \u201cinjury turned out to more serious than expected\u201d by the parties, as opposed to the distinguishable circumstance in <em>LaFleur </em>v. <em>C.C. Pierce Co., </em>398 Mass. at 259, involving \u201ca separate condition\u201d that \u201cexisted and yet was unknown to the parties at the time of the [lump sum agreement].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>LaFleur, supra </em>at 260, the Supreme Judicial Court held that a release may be avoided on grounds of mutual mistake, and determined that there was a material issue of fact whether the contracting parties had intended \u201cto release claims for injuries existing but not known to them at the time of the agreement.\u201d See <em>Leblanc </em>v. <em>Friedman, </em>438 Mass. 592, 596-597 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Based on our holding, we need not reach Opare\u2019s due process claims. The parties\u2019 submissions do not offer an explanation why the insurer was not named as a party to the Superior Court action. This issue, if need be, may be addressed by the Superior Court judge, prior to the entry of any final judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\">It is regrettable the underlying litigation has been unduly time-consuming and (we would expect) not inexpensive to the parties. It cannot be gainsaid that the Attorney General represents the Commonwealth as well as the agency who requests her appearance. The Attorney General \u201calso has a common law duty to represent the public interest.\u201d <em>Secretary of Admn. &amp; Fin. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>367 Mass. 154, 163 (1975) (Tauro, C.J.). When the situation warrants it, \u201cthe Attorney General may refuse to prosecute an appeal where, in [her] judgment, an appeal would not further the interests of the Commonwealth and the public [she] represents.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Petricca Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 392, 401-402 (1994) (Brown, J., concurring). The workers\u2019 compensation act was designed by the Legislature in order not \u201cto promote, but to decrease the opportunity for unnecessary litigation.\u201d <em>Nichols's Case, </em>217 Mass. 3, 5 (1914). See <em>Lee </em>v. <em>International Data Group, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 110, 116 (2002). It is difficult to conceive how the government\u2019s position in this case has advanced the interests of the Commonwealth and the public.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
