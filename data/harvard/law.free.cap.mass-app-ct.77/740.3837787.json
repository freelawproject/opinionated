In a memorandum and order pursuant to Appeals Court rule 1:28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>we vacated and remanded a Probate and Family Court custody order that transferred \u201csole legal and physical custody\u201d of two young children from their mother to their father because \u201cthe judge\u2019s findings in support of his order . . . [were] sparse, and therefore [did] not support his order.\u201d <em>Loebel </em>v. <em>Loebel, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 1118 (2008). Prior to the issuance of the memorandum and order, a single justice of this court had stayed the judge\u2019s original custody order.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">After the case was remanded, the judge refused the mother\u2019s request to expand the record to provide evidence of what had occurred during the intervening one and one-half years and dismissed her complaint for modification of the original order. He issued a new order, supplemented only by additional facts from the original guardian ad litem\u2019s report. We again, vacate the custody order and order a new hearing to focus on the children\u2019s then current best interests, and affirm the dismissal of the mother\u2019s complaint for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">1. <em>Procedural background. </em>The parties were married in July of 2002. Their older son was bom in March, 2003. The mother filed a complaint for divorce on grounds of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage in January, 2004, while she was pregnant with the couple\u2019s second child. By agreement of the parties, the mother was temporarily granted sole legal and physical custody, with visitation for the father and an order for him to pay child support. In December of 2004, after the birth of their second child, the divorce matter was continued while the parents attempted to reconcile.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The reconciliation attempt was unsuccessful, and the parties separated again in March, 2006. On March 16, 2006, the mother sought and received a restraining order, pursuant to G. L. c. 209A, against the father; the father was ordered to stay away from the mother\u2019s residence and not to contact her, except during visitation exchanges. That order was extended three times by the trial judge in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The last order was issued on March 14, 2007, over one month after trial and eight days before the divorce judgment; the order continued in effect until March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>14, 2008. A guardian ad litem (GAL) had been appointed in April of 2006 to investigate issues of legal custody, physical custody, visitation, parenting planning, access to the children, anger management issues of both parents, and the mother\u2019s desire to relocate to Cape Cod.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">After a two-day trial in early February of 2007, the judge issued a judgment of divorce nisi and on March 22, 2007, issued his findings of fact. The judge awarded sole legal and physical custody to the father, allowing visitation for the mother from Thursday through Sunday, except one weekend per month when the children would remain with their father.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">As noted above, the mother appealed the order changing custody, a single justice of this court stayed that portion of the judgment, and we then vacated and remanded the custody order for \u201cfurther proceedings.\u201d <em>Loebel </em>v. <em>Loebel, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 1118 (2008). We concluded that it was \u201cnot entirely clear from the findings how the judge balanced the positive and negative findings of both the mother and father in determining the best interests of the children.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">After remand, on November 5, 2008, the mother, acting pro se, asked the judge to hold a new hearing to reexamine the status of the parties at that time. She pointed out that two and one-half years had passed since the original guardian ad litem investigation and that the children had been three and two years old at that time. In the interim, the children had begun kindergarten and preschool while living with her. At the same time, she argued that the father had never presented a parenting plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>or an explanation of how the children would be cared for while he worked. Counsel for the father argued that this court\u2019s opinion left it to the trial judge to decide whether another hearing was necessary; counsel himself thought it unnecessary, and in any event, he was planning to withdraw from representing the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The judge\u2019s response to these arguments was not completely clear.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">\u201cI\u2019m going to do this. I\u2019ll issue an Order today. I\u2019ll set the matter for a further hearing and I\u2019ll invite each side to submit and I\u2019ll specify what I believe that to consist of which I would submit would be a legal argument from either side so I\u2019ll give you an hour or so to submit what you contend are the additional findings that the Court should make in support of your position and if you contend, if either side contends that there is a need for additional evidence to be taken or additional actions to be done other than that you\u2019re to submit that to the Court prior to that date and I\u2019ll deal with that. That\u2019s how I\u2019m going to respond.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">When the mother asked the judge to repeat that, he responded, \u201cI can\u2019t because I\u2019m just making it up as I go along.\u201d He then told the parties that if they wished to submit proposed additional findings on the existing record, he would take them or \u201c[i]f you contend that there\u2019s some other additional action that you think the Appeals Court directed this Court to do you\u2019re to notify the Court of what that is. Otherwise, I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d He never permitted the mother to argue why a new hearing should be held and he issued a written order ten days later giving the parties thirty days to submit proposed findings based only upon the existing record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">On December 10, 2008, the judge denied without further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>hearing the mother\u2019s motion to expand the record, and without explanation, he also denied her motion to relocate to Franklin, a town closer to the father and his parents. On December 16, 2008, the mother filed a complaint for modification, listing eight changes in circumstances,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and seeking joint legal and physical custody. In January, 2009, the judge issued an amended judgment of divorce nisi and additional findings to support the sole legal and physical custody award to the father. He also allowed the father\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for modification on the grounds that, at the time of the complaint for modification was filed, the original judgment had been vacated by this court; thus, there was no outstanding judgment to modify.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The mother\u2019s second appeal argues that the denial of her motion to expand the record, and the affirmation of the award of custody to the father, was an abuse of discretion. Additionally, she argues that the judge\u2019s dismissal of her complaint for modification absent an evidentiary hearing was erroneous. A single justice of this court denied her second request to stay the custody order.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">2. <em>Facts. </em>When the parties were first married, in July of 2002, they lived in Sturbridge, close to the father\u2019s family. The father worked as a construction foreman in Easthampton. The mother worked as a technical writer until their first child was bom, at which point she became a stay-at-home mother. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>the mother filed for divorce in January, 2004, she moved to South Easton to live with her mother while the father lived with his family in Hadley. The mother moved to Plainville in June, 2004. During their brief reconciliation period, the family lived together in Palmer, which was approximately thirty miles from the father\u2019s work. After their second separation, the mother moved to Falmouth while the father initially remained in Palmer.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In the judge\u2019s original findings, he wholly adopted the findings from the GAL\u2019s report, with the exception of her recommendation, which was for joint legal and physical custody.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Despite the fact that he had himself three times extended the G. L. c. 209A abuse prevention order, by implication finding that the father presented a likelihood of physical harm to the mother, the judge found that the mother did not establish a pattern of abuse by the father, merely isolated incidents of profane language in the presence of the children, which she embellished to \u201cpaint herself as a victim of systematic domestic violence.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rejecting the GAL\u2019s recommendation for shared custody, the judge ruled that it was not appropriate given \u201cthe <em>recent </em>history of the parties\u201d and their \u201ctoxic\u201d relationship (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The judge then granted sole legal and physical custody to the father, finding that he was the more stable and reliable parent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>although he acknowledged that \u201cboth parents are deeply and genuinely committed to their children.\u201d In particular, the judge found that the mother\u2019s relocation to Cape Cod was not in the best interests of the children as it impeded their ability to maintain a relationship with their father and was \u201cvindictive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">After remand, the judge made additional findings, based only on the evidence that had been before him in 2006, to justify his custody award to the father. He found that sole legal custody for the father was appropriate because of the \u201cflawed level of communication\u201d between the parties, including the mother\u2019s move to Falmouth without first informing the father, despite his previous requests for her not to move. The judge\u2019s findings relating to physical custody focused particularly on the mother\u2019s above move,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> without the judge\u2019s permission, finding that taking the children away from their father and his family was detrimental to the children. He dismissed the mother\u2019s reasons for moving, including a subsidized housing approval and a desire to remain close to her own family.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Despite the fact that the mother had always been the primary caretaker of the children, who were then five and four, and that she was a stay-at-home mother with ample free time to spend with them, the judge found that physical custody for the father was appropriate because they \u201cthrived\u201d with their father. In response to the mother\u2019s argument that the father was a construction foreman who had always worked very long days and weekends, the judge said only, \u201cDespite Father working full-time, he will still be able to effectively parent the children. He is a foreman and has sufficient seniority to tailor his work hours to spend time with the children .... When the Father\u2019s work schedule conflicts with spending time with his children, his parents will also assist him in raising the children as he currently lives with his parents at their spacious bed and breakfast.\u201d The paternal grandmother\u2019s schedule of working as a chemist, a foster parent, and a bed and breakfast manager was not thought to be an impediment to this arrangement. See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>3. <em>Child custody. </em>We agree with the mother that it was an abuse of discretion to deny her an opportunity to present new evidence on remand in order for the judge to address adequately the best interests of these children two years after the original order.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">\u201cWhen determining child custody awards in general, or modifications of custody awards based on changed circumstances, the guiding principle always has been the best interests of the children. . . . \u2018The decision of which parent will promote a child\u2019s best interests is a subject peculiarly within the discretion of the judge.\u2019 Discretion allows the judge when determining the best interests of children, to consider the widest range of permissible evidence, including the reports and testimony of a court appointed investigator or G.A.L., evidence of the history of the relationship between the child and each parent, evidence of each parent\u2019s present home environment and over-all fitness to further the child\u2019s best interests, and the judge\u2019s own impressions upon interviewing the child privately in chambers.\u201d <em>Ardizoni </em>v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738 (1996), quoting from <em>Bak </em>v. <em>Bak, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 616 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The judge\u2019s findings in a custody case \u201cmust stand unless they are plainly wrong,\u201d <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merida, </em>428 Mass. 182, 191 (1998), or \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>447 Mass. 177, 186 (2006). \u201cHowever, we will not sustain an award of custody \u2018unless all relevant factors in determining the best interests of the child have been weighed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Custody of Kali, </em>439 Mass. 834, 845 (2003), quoting from <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merida, </em>428 Mass. at 191. \u201c[A]n ultimate conclusion needs a foundation in the record supported by \u2018ground-level facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Prenaveau </em>v. <em>Prenaveau, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 131, 142 (2009), quoting from <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>383 Mass. 232, 240 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">When we remanded the case originally, we vacated the custody order based on the sparse support found in the judge\u2019s findings. Although we did not explicitly order a new hearing, the judge was charged with assessing the best interests of these children and in order to do so, he had the responsibility \u201cto consider the widest range of permissible evidence\u201d available at the time he was mating the renewed determination. <em>Ardizoni </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. at 738. When the original order issued, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>children were four and over two years old; they remained with their mother during the approximately one and one-half years that the case was on appeal \u2014 arguably a significant and eventful time in a child\u2019s life.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In fact, the mother\u2019s complaint for modification detailed a number of changed circumstances in both the children\u2019s and parents\u2019 lives \u2014 an indication that an evidentiary hearing, and perhaps a second GAL investigation, was necessary to gauge the best interests of the children at that time. See <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 821 (1981), where this court reversed a custody decision and remanded the case for further proceedings, observing, \u201cAs more than a year has elapsed since the original hearing and circumstances may have changed in the meantime, such proceedings shall include the hearing of additional evidence if either party or the judge so elects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Further, \u201cphysical force within the family is both intolerable and too readily tolerated, and ... a child who has been either the victim or the spectator of such abuse suffers a distinctly grievous kind of harm.\u201d <em>Custody of Vaughn, </em>422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996). In <em>Custody of Vaughn, </em>the court reversed a custody award to a \u201cfather who had committed acts of violence against the mother\u201d because the trial court \u201cfailed to make detailed and comprehensive findings of fact on the issues of domestic violence and its effect upon the child as well as upon the father\u2019s parenting ability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596, 599, quoting from <em>R.H. </em>v. <em>B.F., </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 29, 40 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">In this case, the same judge repeatedly extended an abuse prevention order against the father, while reporting in his findings in support of the divorce judgment that the mother\u2019s reports of abuse were not credible. In addition, both the GAL\u2019s recommendations and the judge\u2019s supplemental findings refer to the need for psychological evaluations for both parents, and yet nothing in the judge\u2019s findings indicates whether these evaluations were performed or what their results were. The contradictory findings relating to the presence of domestic violence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>what, if any, effect it had on the children also support our reversal of the custody order and remand for an evidentiary hearing. Cf. <em>Custody of Zia, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 244, 245-246 (2000). (\u201c[T]he judge\u2019s voluminous findings demonstrate consideration of myriad factors and circumstances relevant to the child\u2019s best interests. . . . [I]t [is] apparent, on review of the findings as a whole, that the judge considered the question of abuse and was of the opinion that the present case presented no history or pattern of domestic violence that would preclude an award of custody to the father\u201d). See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The custody order is vacated and the case is remanded for a new hearing, focusing on the children\u2019s then current best interests. Pending such further proceedings, custody is to remain with the father, subject to the current visitation schedule. On remand, it may be, as the dissent suggests, that the best interests of these children are served by the present arrangement in their father\u2019s sole custody, or at least, by not disturbing that arrangement now that it is in place. It may be that there is no basis for concern about domestic violence, despite the restraining order that the judge issued. Nevertheless, any custody determination should be based upon all of the admissible evidence at the time of the hearing, including any psychological reports and any circumstances, including particularly the nature of the parents\u2019 relationship and their ability to cooperate in parenting that may have changed since the original order in March, 2007.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">4. <em>Complaint for modification. </em>The mother also argues that the complaint for modification was erroneously dismissed as she sought to modify both the custody and the visitation portions of the judgment and listed several substantial and material changes in the complaint. \u201cGeneral Laws c. 208, \u00a7 28, authorizes the court to \u2018make a judgment <em>modifying its earlier judgment </em>as to the care and custody of the minor children of the parties provided that the court finds that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and the judgment of modification is necessary in the best interests of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>the children.\u2019 \u201d <em>R.S. </em>v. <em>M.P., </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 798, 802-803 (2008) (emphasis supplied). \u201cChanged circumstances are those that occur <em>subsequent to the judgment </em>of divorce or subsequent to a prior modification.\u201d <em>Pizzino </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 872 (2006) (emphasis supplied). Technically, there was no final judgment to modify at the time that the modification complaint was filed since it was filed after this court had vacated the original custody order and before the trial judge issued an amended judgment. Therefore, there was no error in dismissing the complaint for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The portion of the judgment ordering sole physical and legal custody to the father is vacated, and the matter is remanded on the issue of custody for a new hearing to focus on the children\u2019s then current best interests in accordance with this opinion. Pending such proceedings, custody is to remain with the father subject to the current visitation schedule. The judgment dismissing the mother\u2019s complaint for modification is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\">In his first extension, the judge eliminated the no contact and stay away portions of the original order but then, twelve days later, reinstated those portions of the order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The father was ordered to pay $200 weekly in rehabilitative alimony, through December, 2007, and maintain medical and dental insurance for the children and the mother. The remaining proceeds from the sale of the marital home went to the father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b770-9\">We also stated, \u201cThe judge noted that \u2018the most significant \u201cthird party\u201d support system the children have is the paternal grandparents located closer to the husband\u2019s home and work.\u2019 The undisputed facts, however, show that the father works in construction, typically until 6:30 or 7:00 p.m. Therefore, it is clear that the father will need assistance with child care. The judge\u2019s findings do not reveal the extent to which the father\u2019s [parents] can assist with child care and also do not demonstrate how the best interests of the children would be better served by their receiving child care from their grandparents, or from some other source of child care, rather than from their mother.\u201d <em>Loebel </em>v. <em>Loebel, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b771-9\">We recognize that pro se litigants in a contentious divorce proceeding can try the patience of even the most painstaking and long-suffering judge. Nevertheless, this mother believed, at the beginning of the hearing, that this court\u2019s decision had given her a new opportunity to support her argument for custody of her children. Her inability to articulate in the moment the precise procedural vehicle to obtain such a hearing should not have ended the matter. See <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Lynn Hous. Authy., </em>450 Mass. 626, 637 n.17 (2008), quoting from Judicial Guidelines for Civil Hearings Involving Self-Represented Litigants \u00a7 3.2 (2006) (\u201cThis court has recognized that self-represented litigants must be provided \u2018the opportunity to meaningfully present their cases\u2019 \u201d). Particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>in a case such as this, one that relates solely to child custody, some care should be taken to see that a litigant is fairly heard. See <em>Adoption of Imelda, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 354, 365-366 (2008). We note that, eventually, the judge did make a further award of attorney fees to permit the mother to obtain counsel \u2014 <em>after </em>he had foreclosed her opportunity to expand the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\">The alleged change in circumstances were: (1) the children had continued to reside with her and she was their main caretaker for day-to-day needs; (2) the children were only visiting with their father every other weekend and on holidays; (3) at the time of the trial neither child was in school and now the eldest was in kindergarten and the youngest was in preschool; (4) reports were available from both the children\u2019s teachers and their pediatrician on their positive progress; (5) the mother had made efforts to encourage a positive relationship between the father and children and to include the father in their activities; (6) the mother made plans to move to Franklin to reduce the travel time between the two households; (7) the father continued to make child support payments in the amount of $325 per week; and (8) the parties had made progress in their ability to communicate and to keep one another informed of matters related to the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The GAL recommended the children be placed in the joint legal and physical custody of their parents, the children residing with their mother from Sunday evening through Thursday evening and visiting their father Thursday evening through Sunday evening. She also recommended that a parent coordinator be appointed to \u201cmediate decision making between the two parents\u201d and to make recommendations about mental health services for the parents once they obtained psychological evaluations. Finally, she found that it was \u201cnot in the best interests of the [children] to be moved farther away from their father and that the move from Palmer, Ma. to Falmouth, Ma. creat[ed] a very significant barrier to the [children\u2019s] opportunity to be parented by their father.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\">The judge also stated, \u201cThe wife in fact provoked many of the incidents between the parties.\u201d In support of his conclusion that there was no domestic violence, he wrote \u201cone factor cited by the GAL is that most victims of domestic violence are reluctant to talk about it, while the wife was comfortable in doing so.\" Neither the judge\u2019s findings nor the portion of the GAL\u2019s report contained in the record appendix explains the expertise of the GAL on domestic violence matters. Nor is it clear how she arrived at this interesting, but unsupported, conclusion about the willingness of domestic violence victims in general to discuss their abuse. One might well conclude that even a reticent victim would be willing to discuss safety issues with a GAL who would be making recommendations about her children\u2019s custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Seven of the judge\u2019s nineteen findings on physical custody relate to the mother\u2019s move to Falmouth. We note that a move by itself, from one location within the State to another, even without the court\u2019s permission, should not be the sole basis for a custody determination. See <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 816 n.5 (1981); <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Maney, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 261 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b776-7\">One example of how circumstances had changed is that the original visitation order, which gave the children visits with their mother from Thursday night until Sunday did not take into account the fact that the older child had started school and the younger preschool by the time of the remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Although the judge\u2019s promptness in adjudicating this case upon remand from the single justice was admirable, in light of views expressed during those proceedings, we think that a fresh look is appropriate, and accordingly direct that the matter be considered by a different judge on remand from this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b778-7\">Kantrowitz, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-b\">(dissenting).

On October 29, we issued an Appeals Court rule 1:28 decision that vacated so much of the order as it pertained to custody and remanded the case because it was \u201cnot entirely clear from the findings how the judge balanced the positive and negative findings of both the mother and father in determining the best interests of the children.\u201d <em>Loebel </em>v. <em>Loebel, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 1118 (2008). Nowhere in our order did we require the judge to reopen or expand the record on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">The trial court received our remand order on November 5, and within a week, on November 14, the judge issued an order allowing the parties to submit proposed findings by December 12 based on the existing record. Both parties submitted such findings, and on January 2, 2009, the judge issued his additional findings to provide support for his original decision granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>father sole legal and physical custody of the children. In doing so, the judge acted quickly and diligently in responding to our order.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">While I share the majority\u2019s view that the better route may have been for the judge to reopen the record, I disagree that his decision to base his additional findings on the existing record was an abuse of discretion, particularly given the language in our order. Contrast <em>Hale </em>v. Hale, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 821 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Furthermore, it is somewhat unclear what an expanded record would have revealed. The best picture, as noted at oral argument, comes from the mother\u2019s complaint for modification, filed on December 16, 2008, wherein eight \u201cchanges in circumstances\u201d were presented,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> any of which the judge could have discounted. Additionally, the judge had already denied the mother\u2019s motion to expand the record on remand on December 10, 2008 (which has not been included in the record appendix before this court), but presumably presented a similar rationale as to why the additional findings on remand should incorporate new evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Given the mother\u2019s complaint for modification and motion to expand the record, the judge had to be well aware of what the expanded record would have looked like, and was within his discretion to refuse to reopen the evidence, absent instructions from this court to do otherwise. The judge did what we told him to do. Finding an abuse of discretion under these circumstances is improper. Accordingly, I would affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\">See <em>ante </em>744 n.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b779-9\">While I believe that the judge\u2019s discretion controls the outcome here, I note that the children have been in the father\u2019s custody since February of 2009, and, as conceded by the mother\u2019s counsel at oral argument, are doing well in his care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b779-10\">Additionally problematic is the mandate of the majority that the matter go before another judge. See <em>A.H. </em>v. <em>M.P., </em>447 Mass. 828, 838 (2006) (\u201cAbsent clear error, we will not substitute our weighing of the evidence for that of a trial judge who had the opportunity to observe the witnesses and form conclusions about their credibility, even if our weighing of the evidence might have differed from that of the judge\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
