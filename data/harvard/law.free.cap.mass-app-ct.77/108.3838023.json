L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(4). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\"><em>Background. </em>In 2001, Findlay, a carpenter doing business as <em>Jog </em>Construction Company (Jog), first purchased a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy (policy) from Liberty Mutual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Insurance Company (Liberty Mutual). The real estate management company that managed the properties where Findlay worked as a contractor required that he present a workers\u2019 compensation policy for his business prior to working. A \u201cPartners, Officers and Others Exclusion Endorsement,\u201d attached to the policy, specifically excluded Findlay himself from coverage. Because Jog had no payroll of covered employees, the premium for the policy was the minimum. At that time, no provision under Massachusetts law allowed Findlay, a sole proprietor, to be considered an employee of his business under the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to 2002, a person self-employed as a sole proprietor could not be deemed an \u201cemployee\u201d of the sole proprietorship because the Act \u201c[could not] be supposed to have contemplated any such combination of employer and employee status in one person.\u201d <em>Ryder\u2019s Case, </em>341 Mass. 661, 665 (1961), quoting from Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 54.31.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Findlen </em>v. <em>Taunton, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1041, 1042 (1982) (partnership not required to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance for its partners); <em>Chute </em>v. <em>Charles Chute Painting Co., </em>11 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 239, 241-242 (1997) (applying rule of <em>Ryder\u2019s Case </em>to sole proprietor).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In 2002, the Legislature overturned the rule in <em>Ryder\u2019s Case, supra. </em>The statute now reads, in pertinent part, that \u201c[f]or the purpose of this chapter, a sole proprietor at his option . . . shall be an employee. A sole proprietor . . . may elect coverage by securing insurance with a carrier.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(4), sixth par., inserted by St. 2002, c. 169. Setting out specific procedures for sole proprietors to affirmatively elect to be treated as employees, the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) promulgated a regulation implementing the 2002 amendment shortly after its enactment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 8.07 (2002) (regulation).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>On September 25, 2005, Findlay severely cut his hand with a saw while on the job. Between the time of the statutory amendment and the accident, Findlay (who had not been notified of the amendment by Liberty Mutual) had renewed his policy several times in substantially the same form.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the accident, he filed a claim for benefits under the policy, which Liberty Mutual denied. In 2007, the department held a hearing limited to the issue of Findlay\u2019s coverage as an employee under the policy. The AJ found that Findlay failed to notify Liberty Mutual that he sought to be covered as an employee, so the policy did not cover him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The AJ dismissed Findlay\u2019s claim. Findlay appealed to the board, which affirmed the AJ\u2019s decision. He now brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cPursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2), we review a decision of the . . . board under the standards of the Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 <em>\\A(J){a)-(d), </em>(/), and (g). We may set aside or modify the decision of the . . . board if the decision is, among other things, \u2018[bjased on an error of law,\u2019 \u2018[mjade upon unlawful procedure,\u2019 or \u2018[ajrbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haslam\u2019s Case, </em>451 Mass. 101, 106 (2008), quot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>ing from G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c), <em>(d), (g). </em>\u201cWhere a statute is involved, \u2018[although \u201c[t]he interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with primary responsibility for administering it is entitled to substantial deference,\u201d ultimately the \u201cduty of statutory interpretation is for the courts.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Carpenter\u2019s Case, </em>456 Mass. 436, 439 (2010), quoting from <em>Moss\u2019s Case, </em>451 Mass. 704, 709 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In affirming the AJ, the board concluded that Findlay cannot be considered a covered \u201cemployee\u201d under the Act because he failed to comply with the department\u2019s regulation requiring self-employed sole proprietors to take affirmative steps in writing on company letterhead to elect to obtain coverage as an employee of the sole proprietorship under the Act. See 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 8.07(2)-(4); note 4, <em>supra. </em>Findlay does not dispute his failure to comply with the regulation, but argues that he meets the \u201cunambiguous\u201d statutory definition of a covered \u201cemployee\u201d and that the regulation conflicts with \u00a7 1(4) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">a. <em>Application of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(4), and regulation. </em>Every employer in the Commonwealth, subject to certain exceptions not applicable here, is required to self-insure or obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance for their employees. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25A; <em>Sellers\u2019s Case, </em>452 Mass. 804, 812 (2008). In the latter case, an employee injured on the job will be entitled to claim benefits from the workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier. See, e.g., G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34, 34A, 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">As a prerequisite to any determination of benefits, an injured claimant must show that he or she is a covered employee. An \u201cemployee\u201d is defined, subject to certain exclusions, as \u201cevery person in the service of another under any contract of hire.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(4). In certain situations, such as this case, the injured person is self-employed, i.e., a sole proprietor. As we have noted, the controlling provision of the Act provides that \u201c[f]or the purpose of this chapter, a sole proprietor at his option . . . shall be an employee. A sole proprietor . . . may elect coverage by securing insurance with a carrier.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(4), sixth par. Findlay argues that despite his noncompliance with the regulation, he meets the statutory definition of a covered \u201cemployee\u201d and is therefore entitled to coverage under the policy. Citing the general proposition that the Act \u201cis to be construed broadly to include as many employees as its terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>will permit,\u201d <em>Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 774,776 (2005), quoting from <em>Warren\u2019s Case, </em>326 Mass. 718, 719 (1951), Find-lay focuses on the second sentence of \u00a7 1(4), sixth par., and argues that he \u201celect[ed] coverage\u201d as an \u201cemployee\u201d because he is a sole proprietor who \u201csecur[ed] insurance with a carrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">At the outset, we note that \u201c[a] court will not declare a regulation void unless its provisions cannot, in any appropriate way, be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Student No. 9 </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>440 Mass. 752, 763 (2004). Moreover, heightened deference is accorded to an agency\u2019s contemporaneous interpretation of an enactment. See <em>Biogen IDEC MA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>454 Mass. 174, 187 (2009). Here, as we have noted, it is undisputed that Findlay did not comply with the regulation. Even if the statute were unclear \u2014 and we assume for the sake of discussion that it is \u2014 Findlay cannot show that the regulation is in conflict with the statute. As such, his claim that he is entitled to coverage has no merit. See <em>Pulsone </em>v. <em>Public Employee Retirement Admn. Commn., </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 791, 796-798 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Regarding the statute, the issue before us is whether the language of the Act reasonably can be read to require a sole proprietor, to be covered as an employee, to make an affirmative election in the form of notice to the insurer that personal coverage is sought.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201c [I]f the Legislature has not directly addressed the issue and the statute is capable of more than one rational interpretation, we proceed to determine whether the agency\u2019s interpretation may \u2018be reconciled with the governing legislation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Biogen IDEC MA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>454 Mass. at 187, quoting from <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 633 (2005). For the reasons set forth below, the statutory language can be read consistently with a legislative determination to require a self-employed sole proprietor to secure coverage with an insurer specifically as an employee of the sole proprietorship in order to obtain personal benefits from the insurer under a workers\u2019 compensation policy. In short, the department did not act unreasonably in interpreting the Act in a manner requiring that Findlay make an affirmative election with Liberty Mutual to be treated as an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>First, we note that none of the parties here disputes that the Legislature changed the law in order to allow sole proprietors to be included as covered \u201cemployees.\u201d However, Findlay\u2019s construction, even if otherwise rational, may run counter to the \u201cgeneral principle of statutory interpretation . . . that \u2018every word in a statute should be given meaning,\u2019 . . . and no word is considered superfluous.\u201d <em>Lopes\u2019s Case, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 227, 229-230 (2009), quoting from <em>Boone </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>451 Mass. 192, 196 (2008). Findlay\u2019s interpretation would result in a self-employed individual being covered as an employee of the sole proprietorship merely by buying insurance as an employer, even where the sole proprietorship has hired other employees, without making an affirmative election to be treated as an employee. Such an interpretation, while not irrational, sits uncomfortably with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25A, which requires sole proprietors to provide for workers\u2019 compensation payments for their employees, and arguably would render superfluous the language in \u00a7 1(4) providing that a sole proprietor \u201cat his option\u201d shall be an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Findlay\u2019s reading would appear to make coverage of sole proprietors as employees mandatory instead of voluntary. This interpretation would transform G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(4), sixth par., into a requirement that all sole proprietors who secure workers\u2019 compensation insurance of any kind be deemed covered employees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, it is illuminating that when the Legislature decided to make coverage of employees mandatory under the Act, it did so using directive language not present here. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(4), third par. (unequivocally providing that \u201c[s]tudents participating in a work-based experience as part of a school-to-work program who receive personal injuries arising out of and in the course of such participation at or with particular employers, <em>shall, </em>for purposes of this chapter, be deemed employees of such employers\u201d [emphasis added]), inserted by St. 2002, c. 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Finally, it is instructive that in other statutes the Legislature has used the phrase \u201cat its option\u201d in order to provide for the voluntary exercise of exceptions to a general rule. See, e.g., G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 58 (\u201cRegional cultural councils shall consist of an equal number of members to be appointed from each city or town within the consortium in the manner herein described. The regional cultural council may adopt, <em>at its option, </em>a proportional membership consistent with the population of each municipality\u201d [emphasis added]), as amended by St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7 203; G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 22 (\u201c [Governmental unit <em>at its option </em>may, but shall not be required to, appropriate additional monies for use by the retirement board in carrying out the purposes of section [G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5B]\u201d [emphasis added]), as amended by St. 1996, c. 306, \u00a7 36; G. L. c. 62E, \u00a7 <em>4(d) (\u201cAt its option, </em>[a financial] institution may, within thirty days of the end of the first quarter of every calendar year, submit to the Commissioner [of Revenue] a report of the name, record address, social security number and other identifying data of each person maintaining an account at such institution\u201d [emphasis added]), as appearing in St. 1993, c. 460, \u00a7 12. Cf. <em>Harding </em>v. <em>DeAngelis, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 455, 457-458 (1995) (consulting intestacy statute in determining a definition in wrongful death statute). Here, as a practical matter, it does not escape our notice that the department\u2019s interpretation leaves no room for doubt among those who broker and issue insurance about what coverage is being sought by a sole proprietor in a given instance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">b. <em>Equitable estoppel. </em>Findlay makes an equitable claim that Liberty Mutual had a duty, which it breached, to notify him of his potential right to coverage under the changed law and thus should be estopped from denying coverage. The board concurred with the AJ\u2019s conclusion that the department does not have authority to consider Findlay\u2019s estoppel claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Both the board and the AJ relied on <em>Hayes\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. 447, 452-453 (1965), in which the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the board\u2019s refusal to consider a claimant\u2019s request to estop the insurer from denying benefits under the policy. In that case, the court held that the claimant could not be deemed an \u201cemployee\u201d under the Act, and that \u201cfull performance of the conditions of the [A]ct are essential prerequisites to the jurisdiction of the board, and ... its authority and the statutory limitation upon the exercise of it cannot be enlarged, diminished or destroyed by express consent or waived by acts of estoppel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453, quoting from <em>Levangie\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 213, 217 (1917). Findlay attempts to distinguish <em>Hayes\u2019s Case </em>by arguing that there the claimant\u2019s estoppel argument failed because he fell into a class of persons then excluded from the Act. We fail to see how this distinguishes the claimant in that case from Findlay.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Here, like the claimant in <em>Hayes\u2019s Case, </em>Findlay does not meet the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of the Act and he does fall into a class of persons excluded by the Act \u2014 sole proprietors who fail to elect to be insured as employees. Furthermore, like the claimant in <em>Hayes\u2019s Case, </em>Findlay seeks to estop the insurer from denying coverage under the policy, even though the department\u2019s jurisdiction \u2014 defined by statute \u2014 would be exceeded based on his failure to qualify as an \u201cemployee.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Findlay also cites <em>Donovan\u2019s Case, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 566, 568 (2003). In that case, the status of the claimant as an employee was not in dispute and the insurer never challenged the applicability of the Act. There, we held that the board did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>exceed its jurisdiction by applying equitable estoppel to enforce a lump sum settlement agreement that the insurer had agreed to sign but did not sign. <em>Id. </em>at 569. Here, unlike the claimant in <em>Donovan\u2019s Case, </em>Findlay fails to meet the definition of employee and the Act does not apply to him. Furthermore, in <em>Donovan\u2019s Case, </em>we expressly continued to recognize \u201cthe limits of the doctrine of estoppel with respect to the statutorily defined authority of an administrative agency such as the [department].\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>citing <em>Hayes\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 452-453.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In sum, the AI and the board did not err by concluding that the department lacked jurisdiction to hear Findlay\u2019s claim that Liberty Mutual is estopped from denying coverage. Because the department\u2019s statutorily defined jurisdiction covers claims brought under the Act by \u201cemployees\u201d only, and because Find-lay does not meet the definition of an \u201cemployee,\u201d the department has no authority to grant Findlay\u2019s request for equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\n<em>Decision of reviewing board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Whether Findlay may be considered an employee of the real estate management company under the Act is not at issue in this litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\">See now Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 76.05[2] (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The amendment was approved on July 25, 2002. See St. 2002, \u00a7 169. A nonemergency act, it became effective ninety days later, on October 23, 2002. See <em>Vittands </em>v. <em>Sudduth, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 515, 518 &amp; n.7 (1996). The department promulgated the regulation on December 6, 2002, and has not amended it since.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\">First, the regulation states that \u201ca sole proprietor . . . may elect to be an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>employee and obtain coverage under a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy.\u201d 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 8.07(1). Second, a sole proprietor \u201cmust submit a written request directly to the carrier\u201d in order to be considered a covered \u201cemployee,\u201d and \u201cmust reaffirm in writing their right of inclusion as an employee . . . annually and prior to the renewal date of the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 8.07(2). Third, the regulation sets the effective date of coverage for the sole proprietor as an employee based on when the carrier receives the \u201cwritten request from the sole proprietor,\u201d and that the \u201cwritten requests must be on company letterhead and signed by the sole proprietor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 8.07(3). Fourth, as \u201csole proprietors ... are required to provide workers!\u2019] compensation insurance coverage for their employees\u201d and a sole proprietor is \u201cgiven the option\u201d to be a covered employee, \u201c[i]f a sole proprietor . . . obtains a workers]\u2019] compensation insurance policy without specifically electing coverage as described in 452 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 8.07 for the sole proprietor ... the sole proprietor . . . shall not be covered under that policy.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 8.07(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The parties stipulated that \u201cLiberty Mutual . . . never sent any notices, correspondence or other documents to . . . Findlay, either as Employee or Employer, or his broker concerning the [amendment].\u201d They also stipulated that Liberty Mutual never sent any such documents to any agent, broker, or insured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The AJ also found that \u201c[t]he coverage would have required the payment of a substantial additional premium.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The validity of the specific notice requirements in the regulation, such as a writing and use of company letterhead, is not before us here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The Legislature could have chosen amendment language unambiguously creating an \u201copt out\u201d scenario, where a sole proprietor is considered a covered employee under the policy unless he affirmatively drops his personal coverage at his option. Findlay does not specifically argue that the language actually chosen has this effect, nor would we find that contention to have merit. Find-lay\u2019s argument is essentially that he was automatically covered by genetically buying the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b142-6\">We note that workers\u2019 compensation schemes from other jurisdictions, while necessarily involving different statutes, reflect an analysis of the sole proprietor-employee issue that is consistent with the outcome here. See, e.g., <em>Dreiling </em>v. <em>Custom Builders, </em>756 N.E.2d 1087, 1089-1090 (Ind. Ct. App. 2001); <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Twin City Fire Ins. Co., </em>143 Md. App. 637, 640-645 (2002); <em>Junge </em>v. <em>John D. Morgan Constr. Co., </em>118 N.M. 457, 462-464 (Ct. App. 1994). See generally Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 76.05[l]-[2] (2009) (workers\u2019 compensation in context of partnerships).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The AJ also essentially found that, even if Liberty Mutual had a duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>notify Findlay of his right to obtain personal insurance, Findlay would not have done so. He found that Findlay, even knowing of its availability, had not elected such coverage after the industrial accident, despite having returned to similar employment; that Findlay continues to be covered by the same type of policy as before the accident; and that Findlay\u2019s insurance broker would not have advised personal workers\u2019 compensation coverage because for the added cost better coverage was available through a disability policy. The AJ considered the cost of the personal workers\u2019 compensation coverage (\u201ca substantial additional premium\u201d) a factor in finding Findlay not credible when testifying he would have obtained the coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Findlay may seek to press his equitable claim against Liberty Mutual (and perhaps claims against his insurance broker) in an appropriate court. Even were he to succeed there, that would not broaden the jurisdiction of the department, which is circumscribed by statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
