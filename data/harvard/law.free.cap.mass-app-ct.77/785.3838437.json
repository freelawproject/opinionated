The city claims that the arbitrator interpreted and applied the contract in a way that exceeded his powers. We disagree and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\"><em>Background. </em>The basic facts found by the arbitrator are not disputed. The city has a property and construction management department that consists of eight separate divisions, two of which are the capital construction division (construction division) and the municipal police department (police division). The police division is responsible for protecting all city buildings. In the late fall of 2005, the city decided to eliminate all armed officers from the police division and merge their functions into those of the Boston police department. That decision resulted in a number of layoffs not only of armed officers but of other police division support personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">In place at the time was a collective bargaining agreement (agreement) between the city and the union that contained a number of provisions dealing with layoffs. Insofar as here material, one of those provisions stated that permanent employees were to be laid off in accordance with the provisions of G. L. c. 31, which requires that permanent employees \u201chaving the same title in a departmental unit\u201d be laid off in accordance with seniority. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 39. Another provision stated, again in material part, that \u201c[n]on-permanent employees (including provisional[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] and temporary employees) with more than six months seniority shall be designated for lay off prior to permanent employees in their job classifications in their department. Such non-permanent employees shall be designated for lay off by inverse order of seniority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Article XV, \u00a7 6, of the agreement dealt with \u201cbumping rights,\u201d that is, the right of one employee to \u201cbump\u201d into another position under certain circumstances, including the right to bump another employee out of the targeted position. Insofar as \u00a7 6 applied to employees who had been designated for layoff, two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>provisions are of particular importance and lie at the heart of the present controversy. Section 6(A)(ii) provided that permanent employees had \u201cthe right provided by G. L. c. 31 to bump into a lower graded job classification within the department.\u201d Alternatively, under \u00a7 6(A)(iii), a permanent employee was permitted to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">\u201cbump laterally into a vacancy within the same job classification or an equally graded job classification that the employer has determined the employee seeking to bump laterally to be capable of performing the duties and responsibilities of the position.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Joan Forbes-Ozella, a tenured civil service employee who worked as a grade MM-7 senior administrative assistant in the police division, was one of the employees selected for layoff as a result of the merger. Her duties included budgeting, managing the account related to paid details on which the armed officers worked, and analyzing monthly crime reports. Dorothy Baxter, a provisional employee who had been hired effective July 19, 1999, was a grade MM-7 program analyst in the construction division. Baxter\u2019s duties included working on various projects for the Boston public schools, assisting with construction reimbursements generated by installation of an Internet infrastructure, and working as a member of the capital planning team for the Boston school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Faced with an imminent layoff, Forbes-Ozella elected to bump Baxter and, as a result, moved from the police division to the construction division, where she began performing the duties Baxter had performed. Baxter, in turn, was laid off. Baxter grieved her layoff and, supported by the union, claimed that the agreement only permitted lateral bumps, i.e., bumps into the same grade, when the target position was vacant. Although Baxter\u2019s position was in the same grade, the union argued that her position was not vacant at the time Forbes-Ozella exercised her bumping rights and, thus, she had no right to displace Baxter.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">The city disagreed, and the matter proceeded to arbitration under the agreement\u2019s arbitration provisions. The arbitrator agreed with the union\u2019s position and made an award stating that Forbes-Ozella had no contractual right to bump Baxter because Baxter\u2019s position was not vacant. As a result, he ordered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>city to \u201creinstate Baxter to her former position . . . and make her whole for all lost wages and contract benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The city appealed the arbitrator\u2019s decision to the Superior Court, where it made the two principal arguments it presses here. The first is that the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the bumping rights provision of the agreement would require the city to violate the seniority layoff provisions of the civil service laws. The second is that, even if the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the agreement were appropriate, the reinstatement award violated a term of the agreement providing that an arbitrator \u201cshall make no award that grants any appointment [or] reappointment . . . of any member of the bargaining unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">After a hearing on the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment, a judge of the Superior Court issued a thoughtful memorandum of decision ordering allowance of the union\u2019s motion and entry of judgment affirming the award. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>Judicial review of an arbitration award is narrowly confined. See G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11(a). As the Superior Court judge observed, a court is bound by the arbitrator\u2019s findings and rulings \u201ceven if they appear erroneous, inconsistent, or unsupported by the record at the arbitration hearing,\u201d quoting from <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>435 Mass. 54, 61 (2001). \u201cCourts inquire into an arbitration award only to determine if the arbitrator has exceeded the scope of his authority, or decided the matter based on \u2018fraud, arbitrary conduct, or procedural irregularity in the hearings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990), quoting from <em>Marino </em>v. <em>Tagaris, </em>395 Mass. 397, 400 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">The arbitrator\u2019s conclusion that Forbes-Ozella had no right to bump Baxter suffers from none of those defects. It is undisputed that, at the time Forbes-Ozella exercised her bumping rights, Baxter in fact occupied the position into which Forbes-Ozella decided to bump. Literally speaking, therefore, the position was not \u201cvacant\u201d at the time, and the agreement permits lateral bumping only into vacant positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">The city agrees that an employee cannot laterally bump into an occupied position but contends that it created a vacancy by electing to lay Baxter off once Forbes-Ozella elected to bump <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>into her position. Indeed, the city maintains that its decision to lay Baxter off was required by statute, by rule, and by the agreement itself. For the statutory requirement, the city points to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 39, which states that employees <em>\u201chaving the same title </em>in a departmental unit\u201d shall be laid off in accordance with seniority. The rule was promulgated by the Human Resources Division, which administers the civil service law in the Commonwealth, and provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-5\">\u201c[w]hen one or more employees must be separated from positions <em>in the same title and departmental unit </em>due to lack of work, lack of money or abolition of position, all persons filling positions provisionally in the designated title must be separated first, followed by all persons filling positions in temporary status in the designated title, before any civil service employees holding the designated positions in permanent status shall be separated from such positions\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">(emphasis supplied). Personnel Administration Rules PAR. 15 (2003). The portion of the agreement on which the city relies states that provisional employees like Baxter \u201cshall be designated for lay off prior to permanent employees <em>in their job classifications </em>in their department\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">The problem with the city\u2019s argument is the arbitrator\u2019s finding that the term \u201cjob classification\u201d as used in the agreement and the term \u201ctitle\u201d as used in the statute and the personnel administration rule have the same meaning and there was \u201cnothing in the record to show that the positions of Senior Administrative Assistant and Program Analyst are considered part of the same \u2018job classification\u2019 within the meaning\u201d of Article XV, \u00a7 4(A)(ii). In other words, neither the civil service laws nor the collective bargaining agreement required the city to lay off or discharge Baxter before laying off Forbes-Ozella, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>two did not have the same title or job classification. As the city had no other valid reason to lay off or discharge Baxter,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> there was no vacancy in Baxter\u2019s position into which Forbes-Ozella could bump. Allowing her to do so, therefore, violated Baxter\u2019s rights under the agreement. The arbitrator\u2019s conclusion lies well within the expansive area that is immune from judicial review of arbitration awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\"><em>Herlihy </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 835 (1998), on which the city relies, does not require a different result. Herlihy, who was employed by the Department of Mental Health (DMH) as a psychologist III in a mental health facility in Bourne, attempted to bump into a similar position at a hospital in Worcester when his position, and all others like it, were eliminated at the Bourne facility. <em>Id. </em>at 836. DMH prohibited him from doing so, stating that, under regulations it had promulgated, bumping rights were limited to positions within the Bourne facility itself. <em>Ibid. </em>We ultimately disagreed, holding that the DMH had defined too narrowly the units within which bumping could occur, in the process displacing essential provisions of the civil service laws codified in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 39. <em>Id. </em>at 839-840. Here, however, the arbitrator did not find that Forbes-Ozella was barred from bumping across departmental units. Instead, he found that Baxter and Forbes-Ozella did not occupy the same job classification or title and that, as a consequence, Forbes-Ozella had no right to bump Baxter under the agreement or under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The arbitrator\u2019s conclusion that there was no vacancy in Baxter\u2019s position at the time Forbes-Ozella exercised her bumping rights and that the city wrongfully removed Baxter in order to make room for Forbes-Ozella dictates the outcome of the city\u2019s next contention, namely that the arbitrator\u2019s reinstatement award violated the term of the agreement providing that the \u201carbitrator shall make no award that grants any appointment, reappointment, promotion or termination of any member of the bargaining unit.\u201d In making the award, however, the arbitrator reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>\u201cTraditional arbitral remedies attempt to place employees in the position they would have been in if there was no contract violation, absent some limitation on the arbitrator\u2019s authority. Here, Article X[, \u00a7] D of the parties\u2019 agreement restricts arbitrators from appointing or re-appointing employees. However, the Union here is not asking that I appoint or re-appoint Baxter to a position, which is within the contractual discretion of the City. Rather, it asks that I make Baxter whole by directing that the City place her back where she was before the contract breach, which is analogous to reinstating an employee who has been terminated without just cause. Therefore, I conclude the appropriate remedy here is an order that the City reinstate Baxter to her former Program Analyst position or an equivalent position in the PCMD and make her whole for all wages and contract benefits she lost because the City permitted Forbes-Ozella to bump into her position.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">We think that the arbitrator\u2019s reasoning is a permissible view of what the agreement permits and what it forbids. The alternative would be either that the agreement offered no protection against wrongful termination or that the only remedy for wrongful discharge was an order requiring the city to continue to pay the discharged employee the salary he or she would have received if no discharge had occurred. The former reading is hardly reasonable in view of the comprehensive job-protection provisions the agreement contains and the latter would amount to a hugely wasteful expenditure of public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\"><em>Everett </em>v. <em>Teamsters, Local </em>380,18 Mass. App. Ct. 137 (1984), which is relied on by the city, is not to the contrary. In that case, a provisional employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement did not contest his layoff but disputed instead the city\u2019s failure to recall him to a position for which he was qualified when that position opened. Agreeing with the employee, an arbitrator ordered the city to recall the employee. We ordered the award vacated, observing that \u201c[b]y law, once a provisional employee is laid off, the provisional appointment ends.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139. Thereafter, the employee could not occupy any position in the city unless the city made a new appointment. Here, by contrast, the arbitrator ruled that Baxter was never properly laid off and, as a consequence, the city\u2019s effort to lay her off did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>in fact terminate her provisional appointment. The reinstatement award, therefore, did not require the city to appoint or reappoint her to a job she already held.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-8\">As used in the agreement, the term \u201cprovisional employee\u201d had the same meaning the term had in the civil service laws. Under the civil service laws, a provisional employee is an employee appointed to a position when no civil service list of persons eligible for appointment to the position has been created through normal civil service processes or when a list created through the normal processes contains less than three names and, in either case, certain other criteria are met. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-8\">The city also argues that if there is any inconsistency between the civil service laws and the agreement, the provisions of civil service laws control because G. L. c. 31, in which those laws are codified, is not a statute listed in G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>1(d), </em>as one that a collective bargaining agreement can supercede. With that proposition, the union voices no disagreement. Indeed, Article XV, \u00a7 3, of the agreement explicitly states that the agreement\u2019s layoff provisions are to be \u201cread to conform to\u201d G. L. c. 31, a statement reiterated in slightly different form in Article XV, \u00a7 <em>6, </em>pertaining to bumping rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The city advances no other reason and none appears in the record. There was no organized layoff plan for the construction division in which Baxter worked, and employees, like Baxter, who had completed a six-month probationary period, could not be discharged without \u201cjust cause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
