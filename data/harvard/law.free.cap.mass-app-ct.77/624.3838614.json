We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>From the evidence at trial, the jury were entitled to find the following. On March 2, 2005, Everett police Officer Richard Connor and Middlesex County Deputy Sheriff Meaghan Leary, both working undercover, entered a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Boston. The defendant and Dwayne Gillum also entered the restaurant, and Gillum told the undercover officers to sit down at a small table. Moments later, the defendant sat down at a table behind them. Connor told the defendant that he had forty dollars, and the defendant responded, \u201cMy boy will hook you up.\u201d The defendant walked over to Gillum, and both men returned together and sat down. The defendant said, \u201cGive me the money.\u201d Connor gave two twenty dollar bills (with prerecorded serial numbers) to the defendant, who handed them to Gillum. Gillum in turn gave a plastic bag to the defendant, who handed it to Connor. The defendant and Gillum left the restaurant in different directions and were arrested by Boston police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>officers shortly thereafter. In his right hand, Gillum still held the forty dollars given to him by Connor. The plastic bag contained two pieces of \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. Connor and Leary identified both the defendant and Gillum at the time of their arrests. The drug transaction was also recorded by the McDonald\u2019s security cameras, and the recording was later played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Gillum pleaded guilty to two charges of distribution of cocaine, distribution in a school zone, and conspiracy. The defendant summonsed Gillum to testify as a defense witness during the defendant\u2019s jury trial on the drug distribution and school zone charges. The defendant anticipated that Gillum would offer testimony that would contradict the Commonwealth\u2019s version of what transpired at the McDonald\u2019s restaurant. Gillum was appointed counsel, who informed the judge that Gillum would invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. The judge held an in camera hearing at Gillum\u2019s counsel\u2019s request and determined that Gillum had a valid Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">2. <em>Fifth Amendment issue. </em>The defendant claims the judge erred in holding a hearing in camera to determine the validity of Gillum\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege claim. Instead, he argues that the judge should have conducted a particularized inquiry in open court to determine the validity of Gillum\u2019s claim of privilege and that such an inquiry should have been done on a question-by-question basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The Fifth Amendment\u2019s privilege against compulsory self-incrimination provides that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. 5. See <em>Kastigar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 444-445 (1972); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 511(b) (2010). Where a witness is called to testify but invokes the privilege against self-incrimination, the witness will not be forced to testify unless it is \u201c <em>\u2018perfectly clear, </em>from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, . . . that the answer[s] <em>cannot possibly </em>have such tendency\u2019 to incriminate (emphasis in original).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>423 Mass. 496, 502 (1996), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Funches, </em>379 Mass. 283, 289 (1979). The \u201cprivilege extends not only to [a witness\u2019s] answers that would in themselves support a conviction, but also to those that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>442 Mass. 779,785 (2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">When a witness, directly or through counsel, informs the judge that he would exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the judge is required to \u201cmake an informed determination whether the witness has established a real risk that his testimony could possibly tend to incriminate him.\u201d <em>Pixley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>453 Mass. 827, 832 (2009). Usually, this can be accomplished by the disclosure of information to the judge in open court. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin. </em>423 Mass. at 504. In exceptional circumstances, the information made available to the judge in open court will not be adequate to permit the judge to assess the validity of the asserted privilege. When this is the case, the judge may conduct an in camera hearing with the witness and the witness\u2019s counsel at which the witness will be required to disclose enough additional information to permit the judge to make the determination. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra. Pixley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 833; Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 511(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Here, through his counsel, Gillum informed the judge that he would exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege. With this notice, the judge made a limited inquiry of the prosecutor as to what crimes Gillum had been convicted of for his role in the incident at the McDonald\u2019s restaurant on March 2. The prosecutor informed the judge of the various crimes to which Gillum had pleaded guilty, and noted that an indictment which alleged a school zone violation had been dismissed. When the judge began to inquire as to which charges Gillum could still be placed in jeopardy, and could therefore claim a Fifth Amendment privilege, Gillum\u2019s counsel requested that further inquiry be conducted in camera. The judge agreed and conducted a <em>Martin </em>hearing. The defendant claims, in essence, that the judge jumped the gun by conducting an in camera inquiry without first attempting to gather more information in open court to permit her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>make the \u201cinformed decision\u201d about the claim of privilege. Even if this is true, based on our review of the transcript and what was later revealed in open court, as we explain below, we fail to see how the defendant suffered any prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Having reviewed the transcript of the in camera hearing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we conclude that the hearing itself was properly conducted and that the witness had a valid claim of privilege. In considering whether the privilege against self-incrimination is validly asserted, the judge must consider \u201c \u2018the possible incriminatory potential of each proposed question, <em>or </em>area\u2019 which may be explored (emphasis in original).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>442 Mass. at 785, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>423 Mass. at 502. In the course of the in camera hearing, two different areas of Gillum\u2019s potential criminal exposure were explored. One was accepted as a real risk and the other rejected. The judge further explored the possibility of permitting a question-by-question inquiry of Gillum, but concluded that the Commonwealth\u2019s cross-examination was where the danger for Gillum existed. The judge properly was concerned about the real possibility of having to strike Gillum\u2019s direct testimony if Gillum exercised the privilege on cross-examination, and having to declare a mistrial. Given these concerns and the undisclosed information we have reviewed, it was not an abuse of discretion for the judge to conclude that Gillum had a valid claim to the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">After the in camera hearing, the judge announced that Gillum had a valid claim to the privilege. She further explained that she explored the possibility of conducting a question-by-question inquiry in order to provide the jury with some of his testimony. In the end, the judge determined that such an inquiry would not insulate Gillum from answering incriminating questions on cross-examination, and that an invocation of the privilege on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>cross-examination would require that his direct testimony be struck and perhaps result in a mistrial. Despite this, the defendant claims that it was abuse of discretion for the judge not to conduct the question-by-question inquiry. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The Supreme Judicial Court has clarified that a <em>Martin </em>hearing need not be conducted on a question-by-question basis. Rather, particularized questioning is only one manner to evaluate the assertion of the privilege; it may also be evaluated with respect to an \u201carea\u201d of questioning to be explored. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>442 Mass. at 785. A question-by-question inquiry was not necessary in the instant case because, as in <em>Freeman, </em>the judge properly ascertained the areas to which Gillum was refusing to testify. Had the judge allowed Gillum to refuse to answer the prosecutor\u2019s questions, his testimony would have been struck, and a mistrial risked.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Turning to what was revealed in open court, which is where the defendant claims the inquiry should have taken place in the first instance, we determine that the information obtained was also sufficient to demonstrate that Gillum had a valid claim to the privilege against self-incrimination. The prosecutor informed the judge that, should Gillum testify, he intended to explore on cross-examination Gillum\u2019s history of drug dealing, how he has used other people to distance himself from the drug transactions, and how he has used the defendant on March 2, and other occasions, for that same purpose. The judge correctly noted that Gillum \u201cwould have a Fifth Amendment privilege with respect to those kinds of questions.\u201d Indeed, it was not \u201cperfectly clear\u201d from the intended line of cross-examination, which included an inquiry regarding his past participation in uncharged crimes, that Gillum was mistaken as to his potential to incriminate himself by answering the questions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>423 Mass. at 502. At the very least, his responses would be capable of furnishing a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute him in the future. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>442 Mass. at 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Given what was ultimately revealed to the defendant in open court, he was not prejudiced by the occurrence of the in camera hearing. If any harm occurred, it was suffered by Gillum, who was required to divulge incriminatory information in order to allow the judge to verify the privilege claim. In the end, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>defendant has no standing to challenge the proceedings involving Gillum\u2019s assertion of the privilege. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morganti, </em>455 Mass. 388, 404 (2009). To the extent the defendant could claim any residual harm in the presentation of his defense without Gillum\u2019s testimony, that harm was trumped by Gillum\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drumgold, </em>423 Mass. 230, 247-248 (1996) (a witness\u2019s valid assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege against selfincrimination trumps a defendant\u2019s right to call the witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">3. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of distribution of cocaine in a school zone where the evidence did not establish that UHS was a secondary school. We disagree. \u201cWhen analyzing whether the record evidence is sufficient to support a conviction, an appellate court is not required to \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Velasquez, 48 Mass. App. Ct. 147, 152 (1999), quoting from <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartnett, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 467, 475 (2008). Rather, the relevant \u2018question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), quoting from <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>supra.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 752, 757 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The defendant was convicted under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, of distribution of cocaine within 1,000 feet of the real property of a secondary school. This statute provides for enhanced penalties for controlled substance violations near, among others, \u201csecondary schools.\u201d However, \u00a7 32J does not provide a definition of what constitutes a \u201csecondary school.\u201d Where a statute does not define its terms, we give them \u201ctheir usual and accepted meanings, as long as these meanings are consistent with the statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977). The Supreme Judicial Court has noted that the legislative intent of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, is to make \u201cevery school and surrounding community safe from the destructive impact of drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>trafficking and drag abuse.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>442 Mass. 118, 124-125 (2004). In <em>Bell, </em>the court concluded that the jury charge should employ dictionary definitions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the jury would be warranted in finding the alternative education program at issue<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was a secondary school within the meaning of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">In the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence was more than sufficient for the jury to have found that UHS is a secondary school within the meaning of the statute. Detective Lynch, who was familiar with the school, testified that it was a public \u201csecondary school.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laro, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 556, 559 (2007). Lynch also testified that high-school aged students attended classes (including history and biology) at UHS, the building held administrators and teachers, he had been inside the UHS building, he had sat in on classes while they were being taught, and he was related to a Boston public school teacher whom he had seen teaching in the building. From this evidence, we conclude that a rational jury could find that the UHS was a secondary school. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casale, </em>381 Mass. 167, 173 (1980) (\u201cinferences drawn by the jury need only be reasonable and possible and need not be necessary or inescapable\u201d). From the standpoint of common sense, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 30, 32 (1976) (\u201c[w]hether an inference is warranted or is impermissibly remote must be determined, not by hard and fast rales of law, but by experience and common sense\u201d), the evidence illustrated many of the trappings of such a school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>that justified that inference. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>442 Mass. at 123-126. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laro, supra </em>at 557-558 (officer who was familiar with the school testified that it was a parochial school, attended by children carrying school books and transported to the school by school buses and parents, provided sufficient evidence that the building in question was an elementary school); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 236, 245 n.11 (2002) (that a school was an elementary school could be inferred from a police officer\u2019s testimony that it was attended by children between ages five and ten, including the officer\u2019s godchildren, and that he used to work there as crossing guard).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">4. <em>The \u201cbuy money. \u201d </em>At trial, the Commonwealth offered in evidence a photocopy of the money the undercover officers used to purchase drugs from the defendant. For the first time on appeal, the defendant claims that the testimony by the officers regarding the \u201cbuy money\u201d should have been excluded because it was prejudicial. Because the defendant lodged no objection to the now claimed error, we review only to determine whether the testimony at issue created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Specifically, the defendant claims that he was prejudiced by Officer Beath\u2019s testimony concerning the \u201cbuy money\u201d because the money itself was not produced at trial. There is no merit to this claim. Here, the \u201cbuy money\u201d was photocopied before it was put back into circulation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kee, </em>449 Mass. 550, 551-558 (2007) (no error in permitting testimony regarding \u201cbuy money\u201d where neither the actual bills, nor a photocopy of the money, were entered in evidence). In any event, as in <em>Kee, </em>the defendant failed to meet his threshold burden of showing a reasonable possibility that the actual bills used in the controlled purchase and seized from the defendant would have helped his case. <em>Id. </em>at 554-555. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dinkins, </em>440 Mass. 715, 718 (2004); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Narea, </em>454 Mass. 1003, 1004 (2009). Because there was no error, there was no risk that justice miscarried.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">5. <em>Admission of the certificate of drug analysis. </em>Finally, the defendant claims that the admission of a certificate of drug analysis without the testimony of the analyst who performed the tests violated his right to confrontation protected by the Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Amendment. We agree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. 2527, 2532 (2009). In light of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. 350, 359-360 (2010), we need not determine the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s objection to the certificate, and we review to determine whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Here, a certificate of analysis, confirming the substance sold was cocaine, was entered into evidence through testimony from Sergeant Detective Maffeo. The analyst who performed the testing did not testify. As in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>the police officers here did not testify to any expertise or training in chemical analysis, they were not qualified as experts to proffer an opinion that the substance was in fact cocaine,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> no field tests of the drugs were conducted, there was no testimony as to the effect the substance had on anyone ingesting it, and none of the testifying officers was involved in generating the certificate used at trial. See <em>id. </em>at 364-365. \u201cThis is not a case where the facts independent of the drug certificate [] overwhelmingly prove the nature of the substances sold to the undercover police . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367. \u201cNothing about the defendant\u2019s theory of the case relieved the Commonwealth of its burden of proving every element of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loadholt, </em>456 Mass. 411, 433 (2010). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>456 Mass. 378, 381 (2010). The admission of the certificate was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In regard to the distribution of cocaine, and for doing so in a school zone, the judgments are reversed and the verdicts are set aside. In regard to being a habitual criminal and the conviction of second offense distribution, the judgments are reversed and the findings are set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The defendant\u2019s conviction of conspiracy to violate the drug laws, in violation of G.

That risk is assessed by the judge, and the privilege must be asserted with respect to particular questions, or areas which the prosecution might wish to explore. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Prior to his direct appeal in this court, the defendant petitioned a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County, pursuant to G.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>423 Mass. at 504-505. The single justice denied the petition. On appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the denial of the petition and held that \u201cneither the defendant nor defense counsel is entitled to disclosure of the impounded transcript; only the Justices of the Appeals Court may examine its contents, if necessary, to decide the merits of the defendant\u2019s appeal.\u201d <em>Pixley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>453 Mass. at 828.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The court noted several definitions of \u201csecondary school\u201d: \u201c \u2018a school more advanced in grade than an elementary school and offering general, technical, vocational, or college-preparatory courses,\u2019 Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 2051 (1993); \u2018a school intermediate between elementary school and college and usu[ally] offering general, technical, vocational, or college-preparatory courses,\u2019 Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 1060 (1989); \u2018[a] school that is intermediate in level between elementary school and college and that usually offers general, technical, vocational, or college-preparatory curricula,\u2019 The American Heritage Dictionary 1630 (3d ed. 1996).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>442 Mass. at 124.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The school in <em>Bell, supra </em>at 119-120, ABCD University High School, provides classes for approximately one hundred \u201cat-risk\u201d students from Boston-area high schools.
