(Bartlett), was liable for an abuse of process, deceit, negligent misrepresentation, and a violation of G. L. c. 93A. In response, Bartlett filed a motion to dismiss alleging that the claims were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>compulsory counterclaims that Keystone was required to plead in a prior collection action that Bartlett had brought against Keystone. Bartlett also filed a special motion to dismiss pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H (the \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d statute), arguing that Keystone\u2019s suit was in retaliation for Bartlett\u2019s collection action.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In his memorandum of decision on both motions, the judge determined that Keystone\u2019s action constituted compulsory counterclaims in the earlier law suit brought by Bartlett. The judge also denied Bartlett\u2019s special motion to dismiss pursuant to \u00a7 59H. Both parties appealed. This appeal poses the questions whether allegations arising from the prior litigation must be pleaded as compulsory counterclaims, and whether an abuse of process and other related claims can survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute. We have determined that the judge did not err, and affirm the order and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\"><em>Background. </em>On April 4, 2005, Jeremy Petrosso was a truck driver for Keystone, a freight company. On that afternoon, Petrosso collided with a guardrail on the westbound side of Route 2 in Fitchburg, while attempting to avoid hitting an animal in the road. The force of the collision caused the truck to straddle and run over a portion of the guardrail. A passerby informed Trooper Stephen McDonald, who was working a detail nearby, of the accident. When he reached the accident site, McDonald observed \u201ca few yards of curled up guardrail just pulled up.\u201d After determining that there were no injuries, McDonald guided Petrosso off the guardrail and directed him toward a side street to wait for the investigating officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Trooper Jeanne Gannon received a report of the accident while at the Leominster barracks. She responded and reached the accident scene within minutes. She took a statement from Petrosso and issued him a citation for a marked lane violation because he failed to control his vehicle and keep it on the road. She also conferred with McDonald about what he observed, but did not measure the damaged guardrail until the following day, April 5, 2005. By her measurement, the accident caused approximately 200 feet of guardrail to be tom up from the ground and flattened.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">On the day of the accident, Gannon reported the damage in a log kept at the barracks with the on-duty desk officer. That dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>age report was in turn reported to the Massachusetts Highway Department (department). An employee from the department went to the accident scene and completed a form titled, \u201cSCOPE OF WORK TO BE PERFORMED TO REPAIR INSURED DAMAGE TO HIGHWAY APPURTANCES\u201d (scope of repair form), based upon his observations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bartlett, a private contractor, was next on the rotating list of companies prequalified under the department\u2019s accident recovery program to repair the guardrail. The department contacted Bartlett, requested that it repair the guardrail, and provided Bartlett with the scope of repair form. Bartlett made the necessary repairs and, in lieu of direct payment, the department assigned whatever claim it might have against Keystone to Bartlett.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Bartlett forwarded to Keystone an invoice for $23,762.72 for the repairs. The invoice characterized twenty-seven percent of the amount owed as representing overhead, nine percent as profit, and an additional $1,500 of the total as an emergency response fee. Keystone, unhappy with the amount, engaged Custard Insurance Adjusters, Inc. (Custard), to investigate the accident and review the invoice. Preliminarily, Custard opined that the invoice amount was outside the range of fair market value for the amount of repairs completed by Bartlett.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Custard conducted a site inspection, with a Bartlett employee in attendance. Through this inspection Custard observed that significant alterations had recently been made to the entire scene, consisting of additions in the length of refurbished guardrail and requiring equipment in addition to the equipment needed to repair the guardrail in the original claim. As a result of these alterations, Custard had difficulty accurately evaluating the actual cost of the claimed repair work.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Having been informed of these difficulties, Keystone communicated Custard\u2019s conclusions to Bartlett and requested supporting documentation from Bartlett for its claim. Keystone specifically requested documentation supporting the amount of the overhead, the profit, and the emergency fee charged. In essence, Keystone inquired why Bartlett charged twice the amount that Custard determined that the repair job would cost on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>open market. In response to Custard\u2019s observations and opinion, and Keystone\u2019s inquiries concerning the bill, Bartlett filed a small claims action in the District Court seeking the full invoice amount of $23,762.72, plus court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Soon thereafter, Bartlett sent correspondence to Custard that offered to reduce the bill to $21,877. The new figure represented a reduction of approximately eight percent from the original figure. As a result of its market research, however, Custard had determined that the value of Bartlett\u2019s repair work was $12,909.15.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, Bartlett\u2019s settlement offer remained seventy percent higher than Custard\u2019s estimated repair value. Custard had reached this amount by assuming that the linear measurement of damage had been accurately asserted by Bartlett, and that such emergency repairs should have cost thirty dollars per foot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Keystone rejected Bartlett\u2019s settlement offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Keystone sought to remove the small claims action to the District Court civil docket and made a demand for a jury trial. The District Court judge allowed that motion. Keystone served Bartlett with various document requests, including photographs, receipts, invoices, payroll records, and time sheets for Bartlett employees and for the relevant police detail. The photographs provided by Bartlett in response were inconsistent with the collision having caused hundreds of linear feet of damage. The invoices from Bartlett\u2019s supplier totaled $3,237.77 for the materials required to complete the repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In March of 2007, the parties filed a joint pretrial memorandum, in which Keystone advanced alternative theories in its defense: first, that Petrosso was not negligent in hitting the guardrail because he swerved to avoid hitting an animal in the road; second, that Bartlett misrepresented the extent of the damage caused by the accident, misrepresented that the damage resulting from the accident resulted in an \u201cemergency response,\u201d and grossly overstated the cost of repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>In late 2007, during discovery, the parties deposed nine individuals. As discovery progressed, Keystone amassed more evidence indicating that Bartlett had employed fraudulent billing practices when it generated Keystone\u2019s invoice. First, during the deposition of Trooper Gannon, it came to light that the guardrail remained in a damaged state a full day after the April 4, 2005, accident. Gannon deposed to the fact that she measured the damaged guardrail on April 5, 2005. This evidence was in direct contradiction to Bartlett\u2019s allegation that it had a crew work overnight to complete the repairs in immediate response to the accident, and shed doubt on the propriety of its charging Keystone a $1,500 emergency response charge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, at the deposition of Bruce Willens, an employee of the department, Keystone learned that it was the department\u2019s policy to allow ten percent for overhead and ten percent for profit when it paid prequalified contractors directly, in contrast to the twenty-seven percent for overhead and nine percent for profit Bartlett charged Keystone.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Keystone filed a motion to amend its answer and file a counterclaim against Bartlett pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. Bartlett opposed that motion, arguing that Keystone\u2019s delay in bringing the motion caused it prejudice,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that Keystone\u2019s c. 93A claim, even if timely brought, should be dismissed under the anti-SLAPP statute. The District Court judge denied Keystone\u2019s motion. After trial on January 16, 2008, the jury returned a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>verdict finding Petrosso not negligent and, therefore, Keystone not Hable to Bartlett for the cost of the repairs. Judgment entered in that action on January 28, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">After obtaining a favorable verdict and judgment in the District Court, Keystone filed a four-count complaint in Superior Court, alleging abuse of process, negligent misrepresentation, deceit, and violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. Bartlett responded by filing a motion to dismiss on May 27, 2008, pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), arguing (a) that Keystone\u2019s complaint contained only claims that were compulsory counterclaims in the District Court action under Mass.R.Civ.P. 13(a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1405 (1996); (b) that Keystone\u2019s claims were precluded by the doctrine of res judicata; and (c) that Keystone otherwise failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On that same date, Bartlett also filed a special motion to dismiss pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. Keystone filed its opposition to those motions, with accompanying memoranda, on that date as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The Superior Court judge allowed Bartlett\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to rule 12(b), denied its special motion to dismiss pursuant to \u00a7 59H, and entered a judgment of dismissal against Keystone. In his memorandum and order on both motions, the judge agreed with Bartlett that Keystone\u2019s complaint consisted of compulsory counterclaims in the prior lawsuit, but disagreed with Bartlett insofar as it asserted that Keystone\u2019s suit concerned Bartlett\u2019s petitioning activities alone. Keystone filed a notice of appeal, challenging the rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, and Bartlett filed a cross-appeal contesting the denial of its \u00a7 59H special motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\"><em>Keystone\u2019s appeal. </em>Rule 13(a) requires that \u201c[a] pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim for relief the court has power to give which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim . . . .\u201d The rule embodies the principle that \u201c[a]ll claims arising out of the same facts should be heard, where possible, in the same proceeding.\u201d <em>Columbia Chiropractic Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trust Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass. 60, 63 (1999). Thus, \u201cfailure to plead a compulsory counterclaim bars a party from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>bringing a later independent action on that claim.\u201d <em>Mancuso </em>v. <em>Kinchla, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 558, 563 (2004). See <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Canton Inst, for Sav., </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 186, 187 (2002) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">To be compulsory, a counterclaim need not rest on precisely identical facts or pose identical allegations. <em>Mancuso, supra. </em>In fact, \u201c[f]or purposes of determining whether a counterclaim is compulsory or permissive, the word \u2018transaction\u2019 \u2018should not be construed narrowly or technically, but should be construed in a sense to effectuate the settlement in one proceeding of controversies <em>so closely connected </em>as appropriately to be combined in one trial in order to prevent duplication of testimony, to avoid unnecessary expense to the parties and to the public, and to expedite the adjudication of suits\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original). <em>National Lumber, supra </em>at 188, quoting from <em>Volpe Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Trustees of Tufts College, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 38, 40 (1973). In short, \u201cthere [must be] such a \u2018logical relationship\u2019 between . . . [Keystone\u2019s] claims and [Bartlett\u2019s original] claim. . . that the former clearly should have been added as compulsory counterclaims to [Keystone\u2019s] answer. . .\u201d <em>Mancuso, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Here, the prior litigation consisted of an attempt by Bartlett to collect its debt as assignee from the Commonwealth. Keystone\u2019s subsequent complaint concerned Bartlett\u2019s billing practices in reaching a figure for that debt. In defending the original claim, Keystone not only denied liability for the debt, but also raised the impropriety of those billing practices as a defense. See <em>PGR Mgt. Co., Heath Props, </em>v. <em>Credle, </em>427 Mass. 636, 639 (1998) (opining \u201c[d]efenses and compulsory counterclaims are part and parcel of the underlying case and are adjudicated as part of that case\u201d). Keystone also attempted, unsuccessfully, to amend its answer to add a counterclaim identical to count IV of its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">There can be little question that those claims should have been adjudicated in the prior lawsuit. The judgment of dismissal must stand because \u201c[principles of judicial economy, as well as the avoidance of inconsistent results, suggest that all claims [relating to the disputed debt should have] be[en] joined in a single action.\u201d <em>National Lumber, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">On appeal, Keystone asserts that only through discovery did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>it learn of Bartlett\u2019s malfeasance and, therefore, the claims embodied in its dismissed complaint do not fit within the scope of the rule. In other words, Keystone argues that it did not have evidence to support those claims \u201cagainst [the] opposing party\u201d \u201cat the time of serving the pleading,\u201d i.e., its answer, upon Bartlett. Mass.R.Civ.P. 13(a). Though in the abstract this argument has some appeal, on this record, it cannot prevail. See <em>Dindo </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>451 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1971) (reversing dismissal where record failed to establish whether litigant knew of existence of right to counterclaim). The undisputed facts belie the notion that Keystone was unaware of Bartlett\u2019s questionable billing practices at the time of serving Bartlett with its answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">First, Custard had already formed its opinion that the invoiced amount was approximately twice fair market value. Custard supplied Keystone with this expert, though preliminary, opinion prior to the initiation of Bartlett\u2019s suit. Second, Keystone propounded discovery targeting Bartlett\u2019s billing practices, which, as referred to above, provided evidence of Bartlett\u2019s billing malfeasance. Finally, in the parties\u2019 joint pretrial memorandum, filed before the completion of discovery, Keystone expressed its expectation that \u201cthe evidence [will] show that [Bartlett] grossly overstated the damages and costs of repairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">It is settled law in this Commonwealth that a plaintiff \u201cmay not raise a claim in [a subsequent c]ourt which was available as a defense in [a prior] action.\u201d <em>Yentile </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 214, 216 (1988). Thus, even assuming that Keystone had not discovered Bartlett\u2019s billing misdeeds until late into pretrial litigation, the fact that it proffered such evidence in its defense of the collection claim forecloses its right to bring a separate action later based upon that same misconduct. Accordingly, we discern no error in the judgment of dismissal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\"><em>Bartlett\u2019s cross-appeal. </em>In its cross-appeal, Bartlett asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>that the motion judge abused his discretion in denying its motion to dismiss pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Bartlett argues that this ruling must be reversed because Keystone\u2019s claims were in retaliation for Bartlett\u2019s collection action for the repairs to the roadway and protected by the statute. Therefore, the matter must be remanded for an assessment of its attorney\u2019s fees in accordance with \u00a7 59H. \u201c[B]ecause resolution of the issue bears on [Bartlett\u2019s] claim for attorney\u2019s fees under the antiSLAPP statute . . we consider it.\u201d <em>Giuffrida </em>v. <em>High Country Investor, Inc., </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 225, 243 (2008). We, therefore, must determine whether Keystone\u2019s complaint alleging abuse of process, deceit, negligent misrepresentation, and deceptive business practices pursuant to G. L. c. 93A would survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute. We have determined that it would and we affirm the denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">We begin our anti-SLAPP analysis by determining whether the common-law tort of abuse of process as raised here would survive the \u00a7 59H motion. The Supreme Judicial Court has applied a constitutional construction to \u00a7 59H in a manner that will not \u201c alter[] procedural and substantive law in a sweeping way.\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 167 (1998). See <em>Benoit </em>v. <em>Frederickson, </em>454 Mass. 148, 156-157 (2009) (Cordy, J., concurring) (opining that an interpretation of \u00a7 59H that would abolish malicious prosecution or abuse of process \u201cwould ... be constitutionally suspect\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The tort of abuse of process is comprised of the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>elements: \u201c(1) \u2018process\u2019 was used; (2) for an ulterior or illegitimate purpose; (3) resulting in damage.\u201d <em>Vittands </em>v. <em>Sudduth, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 401, 406 (2000), quoting from <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 557, 558 (1988). The tort has been described as usually involving a \u201cform of coercion to obtain a collateral advantage, not properly involved in the proceeding itself, such as the surrender of property or the payment of money.\u201d <em>Vittands </em>v. <em>Sudduth, supra, </em>quoting <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 439, 442 (1985). While the process may have been properly obtained, its misuse constitutes the conduct that is the basis of the tort for which liability is imposed. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 682 comment a (1977). \u201cThere is, in other words, a form of extortion\u201d in the abuse of process. <em>Cohen, supra </em>at 442, quoting from Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts \u00a7 121, at 898 (1984) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We must interpret and apply the anti-SLAPP statute and our case law in such a way as to continue to permit, where appropriate and consistent with the intent of \u00a7 59H, claims of abuse of process as delineated by the Massachusetts common law. See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 850, 854-857 &amp; n.9 (2005). At the first stage of the \u00a7 59H procedure, as set out in <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra </em>at 167, Bartlett must demonstrate that Keystone\u2019s allegation of abuse of process is \u201c \u2018based on\u2019 the petitioning activities <em>alone </em>[i.e., Bartlett\u2019s claim for payment for the repairs] and ha[s] no <em>substantial </em>basis other than or in addition to [that] petitioning activity].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 167-168 (emphasis added). For the purposes of a \u00a7 59H motion, Bartlett\u2019s motive in initiating its petitioning activity is irrelevant at this stage. <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. 113, 122 (2002). \u201cThe focus solely is on the conduct complained of, and, if the <em>only </em>conduct complained of is the petitioning activity, then there can be no other \u2018substantial basis\u2019 for the claim.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">To survive an anti-SLAPP motion, <em>Office One </em>and its progeny require a showing of conduct separate and independent from the petitioning activity. Such separate conduct, as discussed above, will always be evidence of ulterior motive for the petitioning activity. We understand <em>Office One </em>to mean, therefore, that allegations of an ulterior motive unsupported by conduct independent of the petitioning activity are irrelevant to the first stage analysis. We are required to determine then whether Bartlett has established that there is no conduct on its part other than filing the claim. Since such independent conduct will always be evidence of an ulterior motive, and is also necessary to support an abuse of process claim, the fact that the conduct demonstrates motive is not contrary to <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>and <em>Office One. </em>The rule enunciated in <em>Office One </em>is a simple and practical test intended to prevent a bald, potentially unfounded accusation of improper use of petitioning activity to survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute. To hold that evidence of improper action, separate and distinct from the exercise of petitioning activity, is necessary as a threshold requirement simply means that attribution of a motive, alone, is never sufficient. Considering the foregoing standard, properly understood, we believe that Bartlett failed to meet its threshold burden.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>In this cross appeal, Keystone argues that its abuse of process claim and its other claims were not made exclusively in response to Bartlett\u2019s collection action but were primarily the result of Bartlett\u2019s \u201cexcessive billing and knowing overstating [sic] of repair costs.\u201d Keystone argues that its claims were based primarily on Bartlett\u2019s administrative misconduct both prior to and subsequent to the commencement of Bartlett\u2019s collection action, which independently demonstrated its ulterior motive and was not solely based on its use of process, and we agree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Here, Keystone supported its claim of abuse of process by alleging improper conduct by Bartlett before, after, and separate from Bartlett\u2019s petitioning activity. In fact, Keystone engaged Bartlett in Bartlett\u2019s petitioning activity, for the purpose of determining both its own liability and, if appropriate, a fair measure of damages. The facts of this case demonstrate that Bartlett filed its collection action in the District Court immediately after being notified of Keystone\u2019s growing concerns over its billing practices and the specific amount billed. Bartlett\u2019s offer of settlement to Keystone was mailed after Bartlett\u2019s collection action was filed, and the offer remained almost twice Custard\u2019s estimated fair market value of Bartlett\u2019s repair work. This tactic is arguably consistent with an attempt by Bartlett to coerce payment of its inflated bill before Keystone could complete its research into the appropriateness of that bill. Contrary to Bartlett\u2019s contention that Keystone was objecting to its use of legal process, Keystone actually moved the collection action to the District Court\u2019s civil docket for a jury trial. Keystone\u2019s action, using the petitioning activity initiated by Bartlett, sought to determine whether Petrosso had been negligent and, if so, a determination of the actual damages. The jury found that Petrosso had not been negligent and, therefore, did not need to determine a fair estimate of damages. Far from objecting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>the use of legal process, Keystone attempted to use that same process to determine its liability and, if liable, the fair cost of the repair work.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Unlike previous reported cases mandating dismissal of abuse of process claims, the conduct complained of here is not solely Bartlett\u2019s petitioning activity. See, e.g., <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 523-524 (2002); <em>Wenger </em>v. <em>Aceto, </em>451 Mass. 1, 5-6 (2008); <em>Benoit </em>v. <em>Frederickson, supra </em>at 153. There existed a <em>\u201csubstantial </em>basis\u201d for these claims other than the petitioning activity. See <em>Fabre, supra </em>at 524, quoting from <em>Duracraft Corp., supra </em>at 167 (holding \u201c[a] special motion to dismiss will not succeed against a \u2018meritorious claim[] with a <em>substantial </em>basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities implicated\u2019 \u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Keystone\u2019s abuse of process complaint is not predicated solely on what it considered to be Bartlett\u2019s ulterior motive in filing the collection action. It also is predicated on Bartlett\u2019s administrative misconduct prior to and subsequent to filing the collection action. Compare <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, supra </em>at 524 n.10. There is ample evidence in the record to support Keystone\u2019s claim. The abuse of process claim is, therefore, more than a bald and unfounded accusation and withstands the special motion to dismiss pursuant to \u00a7 59H.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Similarly, the counts for deceit, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of G. L. c. 93A are grounded in Bartlett\u2019s alleged billing misconduct and not in the fact that it sued for payment. These causes of action were not based solely on Bartlett\u2019s petitioning activity but were \u201cin response to\u201d the petitioning activity and were in the form of claims that were compulsory counterclaims in the prior lawsuit. Bartlett, as the special movant, did not meet its threshold burden under G.

However, . . . [Bartlett\u2019s] opposition to [Keystone\u2019s] motion to add such counterclaims does not render [Bartlett\u2019s] claim that the counterclaims were compulsory disingenuous; that the counterclaims were compulsory does not compel [Bartlett] to acquiesce in their untimely assertion.\u201d But see <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Consalvo, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 192, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>199 (1994) (holding \u201c[djenial of [defendant\u2019s] attempt to file a counterclaim coming . . . after [plaintiff\u2019s] petition . . . had been scheduled for trial, was within the discretion of the . . . judge\u201d). We further note that, although Keystone obtained a favorable verdict from the jury, it had the right to appeal the order of the District Court judge denying its motion to amend its answer to add counterclaims, yet failed to exercise that right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b340-13\">\u201cGeneral Laws c. 231, \u00a7 59H, protects the \u2018exercise of [the] right of petition under the constitution of the United States or of the [C]ommonwealth,\u2019 by creating a procedural mechanism, in the form of a special motion to dismiss, for the expedient resolution of so-called \u2018SLAPP\u2019 suits.\u201d <em>Office One, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 Mass. 113, 121 (2002). See also <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 Mass. 327, 331-333 (2005) (discussing the history of \u00a7 59H and the types of petitioning activity that the Legislature sought to protect).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b340-14\">See also <em>Matter of the Discipline of an Attorney, </em>442 Mass. 660, 673 (2004) (\u201c[w]e recognize that, because the Massachusetts anti-SLAPP statute \u2018makes no provision for a plaintiff to show that its own claims are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>frivolous,\u2019... the statute could be misused to allow motions for expedited dismissal of nonfrivolous claims in contravention of the Legislature\u2019s intent. To address this concern, we adopted a construction of the statute that would prevent dismissal of suits raising \u2018meritorious claims with a substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities implicated\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The Supreme Judicial Court added a significant observation in its discussion of the legislative meaning of the phrase \u201cbased on\u201d when it observed that the phrase did \u201cnot mean \u2018in response to\u2019 although claims and related pleadings filed in court may be classified as petitioning activities, plaintiffs are not thereby immunized from counterclaims filed in response to the claim.\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp., supra </em>at 168 n.20. This does not mean that counterclaims are automatically permitted to survive a \u00a7 59H challenge. See, e.g., <em>Giuffrida </em>v. <em>High Country Investor, Inc., </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 225,243-244 (2008). However, neither is it to say that counterclaims, relating in part to a plaintiff\u2019s petitioning activity, are automatically dismissed in the same context. Obviously counterclaims not directly concerning petitioning activity should not be subject to a \u00a7 59H challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In addition to evidence developed through discovery and Custard\u2019s expert analysis detailed above, more evidence of billing irregularities was developed at trial. At trial Bartlett called eight witnesses and Keystone called three. Keystone cross-examined Bartlett employees on the issue of its billing practices and, through this impeachment, obtained evidence of billing irregularities. For example, on cross-examination, an employee of Bartlett, Richard Maguire, conceded that he had not depreciated the value of equipment, based on its age, in reaching a figure for the overhead charged to Keystone. During another exchange, Maguire admitted that Bartlett charged Keystone for twelve hours of overtime for a State trooper working the relevant safety detail, when he had only worked ten hours of overtime according to Bartlett\u2019s internal payroll documentation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Regardless whether some opinions might be read to describe abuse of process, in dictum or not, as turning on conduct occurring chronologically \u201csubsequent\u201d to the issuance of the process, see <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 519 n.3 (2002); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>62 Mass.

If ulterior motive lies at the heart of the tort, then logically any conduct that might evidence such a motive should be considered.
