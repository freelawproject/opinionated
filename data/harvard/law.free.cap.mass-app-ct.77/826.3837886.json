L. c. 201, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge found the father unfit to parent his daughter, concluded that she should remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>in the care and custody of her guardian, and ordered monthly visitation with the father. The father challenges the judge\u2019s finding of unfitness and her findings concerning his daughter\u2019s bond with the guardian. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts from the judge\u2019s well supported findings. On May 20, 1998, Cheyenne was bom in Springfield. The mother had become pregnant during a brief relationship with the father.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The father moved to Puerto Rico during the mother\u2019s pregnancy. Cheyenne\u2019s maternal great-aunt assumed responsibility for the child soon after she was bom and became her permanent guardian in 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">In 2004, the father returned to Springfield. In 2005, he identified himself as Cheyenne\u2019s father to the guardian and expressed his wish to become acquainted with the child. The guardian agreed to a visit before Christmas. During that visit, Cheyenne did not talk to the father, although she interacted with his two sons.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The father requested more visits, but the guardian informed him that Cheyenne refused to see him and asked the father to confirm his paternity. In early 2006, deoxyribonucleic acid testing and a resulting adjudication established his paternity. The father promptly filed a petition to vacate Cheyenne\u2019s guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Soon afterward, the father and the guardian entered into an agreement for five visits to begin in February, 2006. Generally, the visits went poorly. On the first occasion, Cheyenne hid under the table and refused to interact with him. During other visits, she engaged reluctantly with the father. In April, 2006, the father and the guardian entered into mediation, during which the father met five more times with Cheyenne. Some of these visits were positive.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">In May, 2007, Dr. Victor Carbone, a licensed psychologist, visited with the father, the guardian, and Cheyenne for a parenting evaluation. Although he observed little interaction between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>the father and daughter, Carbone recommended visitation. The father and the guardian entered into an agreement for weekly visits. Six or seven visits occurred, during which Cheyenne\u2019s reluctance to interact with the father continued. During one visit, Cheyenne refused to leave the guardian\u2019s vehicle, repeatedly locked its doors, and hid under the seats when they arrived at the father\u2019s home. On another visit, she again refused to leave the guardian\u2019s van. Consequently, Carbone recommended suspension of the visits and family therapy for the father and Cheyenne. Before the suspension, one more visit occurred, during which the father took Cheyenne with his children to have pictures taken: although Cheyenne gladly sat with the children, she refused to have her picture taken with the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The parties began family therapy in late 2007. The father secured the therapist. Over the course of six sessions with that therapist, Cheyenne became upset, moody, stressed, and angry. Carbone provided a list of other therapists.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parties met with some of them. Cheyenne did not respond well to the process. At Carbone\u2019s suggestion, family therapy ceased until Cheyenne\u2019s personal therapist determined that she was ready to benefit from it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The judge credited Carbone\u2019s opinion (1) that no established relationship existed between Cheyenne and the father, despite the father\u2019s efforts to bond with her; (2) that she did not want to live with him and wanted to see him less frequently; (3) that she resisted discipline and coercion<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; (4) that the father\u2019s transitional plan called for a complete change to Cheyenne\u2019s life and reflected his forceful style of parenting; (5) that the father\u2019s transitional plan would not improve his relationship with Cheyenne and that removal of her from the guardian\u2019s care would cause her great trauma; and (6) that, because Cheyenne did not yet trust the father, his attempts to acquire custody of her caused fear and further distrust of him. Furthermore, Cheyenne herself stated to the judge that she did not want to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>live with the father and that she preferred to continue living with the guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Upon these findings, the judge ruled that the father was unfit to parent Cheyenne and that it served her best interests to remain in the care and custody of the guardian. The judge ordered monthly visitation with the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\"><em>Analysis. </em>The father contends (1) that the judge improperly found him unfit by reason of his failure to pursue his custodial rights until 2005; and (2) that the judge inadequately substantiated her findings of a \u201csecure attachment\u201d between the guardian and child and of a harmful impact upon Cheyenne from removal of the guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Under G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 5, \u201cin a dispute between a person seeking to become a child\u2019s guardian and a legal parent of a child, custody belongs to the legal parent, unless the parent is found to be unfit.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>R.D. </em>v. <em>A.H., </em>454 Mass. 706, 711 (2009). While the \u201ccritical inquiry\u201d in custody disputes is a finding of parental unfitness, a determination of the \u201c \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 is the touchstone of the analysis.\u201d <em>Guardianship of Estelle, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 575, 579, 580 (2007), quoting from <em>Adoption of Nancy, </em>443 Mass. 512, 515 (2005). The tests of parental unfitness and the child\u2019s best interest \u201care not separate and distinct but cognate and connected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, quoting from <em>Petition of the New England Home for Little Wanderers to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, 367 </em>Mass. 631, 641 (1975). Put differently, parental unfitness \u201cis a standard by which we measure the circumstances within the family as they affect the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The burden of proof rests with the guardian to establish the father\u2019s unfitness by clear and convincing evidence. See <em>R.D. </em>v. <em>A.H., supra </em>at 712. On appellate review, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>we determine whether the trial judge abused her discretion or committed a clear error of law. <em>Adoption of Elena, </em>446 Mass. 24, 30 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Contrary to the father\u2019s first contention, the judge did not ground her finding of unfitness upon the father\u2019s earlier failure to exercise his custodial rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge carefully considered a variety of factors concerning the father\u2019s parental fitness for Cheyenne\u2019s needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Massachusetts law has long recognized the relativity of parental fitness. A parent may be fit to raise one child but unfit to rear another. See <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>278 Mass. 547, 553 (1932); <em>Petition of the Department of Public Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>383 Mass. 573, 589 (1981). No evidence indicated any deficiency in the father\u2019s performance as a parent to his two sons and his stepdaughter. The fitness of a particular parent will hinge upon both \u201cconsideration of that parent\u2019s willingness and ability to care for the child, as well as the effect on a child of being placed in the custody of that parent.\u201d <em>Guardianship of Estelle, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. at 581. In this instance, the judge assessed the father\u2019s parenting style as aggressive, strict, and authoritarian. That parental mode, she determined, would be ineffective and detrimental because Cheyenne was currently a defiant child resistant to discipline. With justification, she concluded that the father would be presently unable to parent Cheyenne.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The judge found also a lack of any bond between the father and Cheyenne. Even after three years of visits, mediation, and family therapy, she continued to resist the father\u2019s role and preferred not to live with him. The judge acknowledged the father\u2019s efforts to establish a bond with Cheyenne but accurately found them unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">The judge weighed the role of the guardian. She found that the guardian had provided little or no assistance to the forma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>tion of a relationship between the father and daughter. However, the guardian\u2019s behavior had never advanced to active obstruction of the father\u2019s efforts to bond with his daughter. Cheyenne had lived with the guardian for ten years and had developed a firm bond with her. See <em>Guardianship of Estelle, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. at 581 (bonding of a child with a caretaker, while not dis-positive, is a factor of weight in the ultimate balance of custody determinations). The judge concluded, upon the basis of Car-bone\u2019s expert testimony, that Cheyenne would \u201csuffer severe psychological trauma\u201d if she were forced to leave the care and custody of the guardian. See <em>Bezio </em>v. <em>Patenaude, </em>381 Mass. 563, 575 (1980) (a parent could be found unfit if returning custody to the parent is seriously detrimental to the welfare of the child).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Finally, the father argues that the judge failed to make sufficiently detailed findings of the bond between Cheyenne and the guardian. See <em>Adoption of Katharine, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 30-31 (1997) (where the bond between a child and her caretaker would be a decisive factor, findings must address the nature of the harm to the child from severance of that bond). The findings of the absence of a bond between the father and the daughter were ample. They reinforced the main finding of the father\u2019s particular unfitness to parent Cheyenne.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Clear and convincing evidence supports the judge\u2019s determination that the father, while \u201ca good father to his two sons,\u201d does not presently fit the role of the father to Cheyenne. The unfitness results from a parenting style (authoritarian) in conflict with the child\u2019s habitual behavior (defiant) and from the continuing absence of a bond between father and daughter. The presence of a bond between the child and her longtime guardian and the likely trauma to her of its severance further define the child\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">The judge has provided for potential change. Her final orders require monthly visitation by the father, permit his sons and stepdaughter to accompany him, provide him with access to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>information of Cheyenne\u2019s health, school performance, and individual therapy, and authorize the eventual resumption of family therapy upon the recommendation of the individual therapist. The judge ruled correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b854-16\">General Laws c. 201, \u00a7 5, was repealed by St. 2008, c. 521, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 44.

It was not, however, the ground of her ultimate finding of unfitness. The judge\u2019s subsidiary finding was not improper. S<em>ee Adoption of Jenna, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 739,744 (1992) (\u201cAlthough . . . stale information cannot be the basis of current unfitness, prior parental conduct is deemed relevant in assessing the parent\u2019s capacity and ability to care for the child\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b859-8\">We emphasize that in this case the totality of these factors creates the determinations of unfitness and best interests. The clash of an authoritative parental practice with a child\u2019s opposition is not, by itself, the determinant of unfitness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
