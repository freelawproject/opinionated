L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, and indecent assault and battery on a child, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. On appeal, he contends that the erroneous admission of multiple first complaint testimony requires reversal of his convictions. He also argues that the judge erred by allowing the Commonwealth to bolster the victim\u2019s credibility with a prior consistent statement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts the jury reasonably could have found, reserving certain details of the trial for later discussion. The victim, whom we call Marie,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was eight years old when she, her younger sister, and their mother moved in with the defendant, who had offered them a place to stay in exchange for providing assistance to his mother, who was recovering from heart surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The girls slept on an air mattress on the floor of the defendant\u2019s bedroom, and their mother slept either on the air mattress or in the bed with the defendant. On four to five occasions, when Marie and the defendant were alone in the bedroom, the defendant moved onto the air mattress next to her, touched her vaginal and buttocks areas over her pants, rubbed against her, and put his legs over her legs. The sexual assaults continued over a period of months. One night, while her mother and sister were asleep beside her on the air mattress, Marie awoke to the defendant attempting to pull her pants down. Marie left the bed and went to the bathroom across the hall, locking the door behind her. The defendant managed to unlock the door and entered the bathroom. Once inside, he pulled down Marie\u2019s jeans and underpants, grabbed her by the waist, and turned her around so that her back was to him. Then, as Marie testified, the defendant put his penis into her \u201cbutt.\u201d Marie was crying, and the defendant told her not to reveal the rape to anyone and threatened to hurt her mother if she did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Marie believed the defendant\u2019s threat and for three years did not disclose that the defendant had raped her. Several nights after the rape, however, she protested when her mother told her that it was time to go to bed. She began to cry and resisted going into the bedroom because the defendant had already retired for the night. When her mother insisted, Marie revealed that the defendant \u201ctouched me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Marie\u2019s mother and the defendant\u2019s mother, who had overheard the conversation, confronted the defendant, who denied touching Marie. One or two days later, the family moved out of the defendant\u2019s apartment and returned to Marie\u2019s maternal grandmother\u2019s home, where the family had lived previously. None of the sexual abuse was reported to the police until 2005 when, after seeing the defendant\u2019s photograph on television, Marie told her grandmother that the defendant had raped her. The grandmother informed her daughter, Marie\u2019s mother, who contacted the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The defendant did not testify at trial. His trial strategy was to undermine Marie\u2019s testimony through cross-examination, suggesting that she had fabricated the allegations because she wanted to move out of the defendant\u2019s home and return to live with her grandmother. He also cross-examined Marie with prior inconsistent statements from her testimony before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">2. <em>First complaint evidence. </em>At the beginning of the trial, the judge held multiple hearings on the defendant\u2019s motion in limine, which sought to exclude evidence that Marie told her grandmother (or anyone else) about the rape. The defendant argued that because the testimony did not relate to the indecent assault and battery, it was not admissible under the first complaint doctrine. An additional basis for excluding testimony about Marie\u2019s conversation with her grandmother, the defendant claimed, was to avoid any risk that the jury would learn that the reason his photograph had appeared on television was because he was a registered sex offender.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">The judge denied the motion on two grounds. First, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>reasoned that the challenged testimony related to a wholly different offense from the indecent assault and battery and, therefore, did not constitute first (or fresh) complaint evidence. Second, she concluded that the Commonwealth was entitled to explain the three-year delay in reporting the rape. Ultimately, the judge ruled that Marie could be asked whether she had a conversation with her mother or grandmother \u201cas a result of seeing the defendant on television,\u201d but the content of those conversations was excluded. The judge explained her ruling by stating, \u201cI think the Commonwealth does have a right to explain to the jury that this young girl did not just regurgitate this information in a vacuum, so I think it puts things into perspective, and so that is my ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">At trial, Marie testified in accordance with the judge\u2019s ruling. She described the indecent touchings that occurred on the air mattress, recounted the details of the rape, and responded affirmatively to questions posed by the prosecutor that she disclosed the rape in 2005. She provided no details of her conversations about the rape, confining herself only to the fact that such conversations had occurred after she saw the defendant\u2019s photograph on television.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">On cross-examination, defense counsel led Marie through a timeline of her disclosures to her mother, her grandmother, and the police. The prosecutor had not asked Marie a single question about the content of her statement to the police. Defense counsel, on the other hand, had Marie read her statement to herself and then questioned her extensively about it, pointing out discrepancies between the statement and her testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Marie\u2019s mother also testified within the parameters set by the judge. As the designated first complaint witness, she recounted what Marie told her about the indecent touchings. With respect to the rape, however, she testified only that in 2005, she had a conversation with Marie in which she learned \u201cadditional information,\u201d and that \u201cas a result\u201d of that conversation, they went to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>The defendant contends that the testimony of Marie and her mother about Marie\u2019s report that she had been raped violated the first complaint doctrine set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217 (2005), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>denied, 546 U.S. 1216 (2006) See also Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 413 (2010). The defendant did not object to the additional complaint evidence at trial. Nonetheless, he asserts that his objection was preserved because he asked the judge to preserve his rights when she delivered her ruling.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The problem with this argument is that the judge did not respond to the request or otherwise indicate that the defendant\u2019s rights were preserved at that time. At a later point, defense counsel sought reconsideration of that portion of the ruling relating to Marie\u2019s testimony that she had seen the defendant on television.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the judge indicated that she would not change her ruling, defense counsel objected and asked if his rights were preserved. The judge responded, \u201cVery much so. Anything else?\u201d to which defense counsel answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, this exchange was not sufficient to preserve an objection to the entire ruling. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whelton, </em>428 Mass. 24, 25-26 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dargon, </em>457 Mass. 387, 393-394 (2010); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 103(a)(1) (2010). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kee, </em>449 Mass. 550, 553 n.5 (2007). Accordingly, we must decide if the challenged testimony was properly admitted and, if not, whether it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>438 Mass. 290, 297 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">2. <em>Marie\u2019s testimony. </em>Relying primarily on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>a case decided after the defendant\u2019s trial, the defendant argues that the admission of testimony regarding whom Marie told about the rape \u201cis essentially the same as permitting those other witnesses to testify.\u201d 450 Mass. 449, 457 (2008). The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Stuckich </em>as requiring reversal is misplaced. Here, the testimony was properly admitted \u201cas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>evidence relevant to a highly contested issue, namely whether [Marie\u2019s] accusations were fabricated\u201d to prompt the family\u2019s move back to the grandmother\u2019s home. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass. 214, 226 (2009).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">As we have noted, the defendant\u2019s trial strategy was to undermine Marie\u2019s credibility by suggesting that she contrived the allegations of abuse so that she and her family would move out of the defendant\u2019s home and back to her grandmother\u2019s house. Consistent with this strategy, trial counsel vigorously cross-examined Marie and her mother on this point. Marie\u2019s testimony that she told her grandmother that the defendant raped her \u2014 three years after the fact and while she was living with the grandmother \u2014 directly rebutted the defendant\u2019s theory of the case. It was, therefore, relevant and admissible to establish her credibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kebreau, </em>454 Mass. 287, 294-295 (2009) (multiple complaint witness testimony admissible in response to \u201ccontentions raised\u201d by defense). See also Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7\u00a7 401-403 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The question whether testimony concerning multiple complaints is permissible \u201cis fact-specific and requires, in the first analysis, a careful evaluation of the circumstances by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296. Here, as in <em>Kebreau, </em>the defendant was charged with two separate offenses. The judge conducted a thorough hearing in connection with the challenged evidence and carefully balanced its probative value against the potential for undue prejudice. The judge did not abuse her discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dargon, supra </em>at 398-401. This is not a case where the Commonwealth sought to introduce \u201ca parade of multiple complaint witnesses.\u201d <em>Stuckich, supra </em>at 457 n.11. To the contrary, the additional complaint evidence enabled the jury \u201cto make a fairer and more accurate assessment of the Commonwealth\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, supra </em>at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Furthermore, \u201cthe primary goal of the [first complaint] doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>. . . is to refute any false inference that silence is evidence of a lack of credibility on the part of rape complainants.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. at 243. Our conclusion (and that of the trial judge) is consistent with this goal. The exclusion of all evidence that Marie eventually disclosed the rape would have created a \u201cfalse inference\u201d that the rape allegation was fabricated. As acknowledged by the dissent, \u201c[t]rue, the jury might question why Marie did not report the rape at the time that she reported the other touchings (which might, in turn, support an inference the rape was fabricated).\u201d <em>Post </em>at 400 n.3. To deprive the Commonwealth of the ability to correct a potentially false impression would defeat the purpose underlying the first complaint doctrine. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murungu, </em>450 Mass. 441, 446 (2008) (first complaint doctrine counteracts frequent perception that years of silence following sexual assault suggests that victim may have fabricated claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In any event, even if Marie\u2019s testimony regarding her disclosure of the rape was not properly admitted, we cannot conclude there was a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice where the defendant \u201ccapitalized\u201d on the testimony at issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>456 Mass. 838, 851 (2010) (\u201cWhere the inconsistencies contained in the cumulative first complaint testimony were more important to the defense than the Commonwealth, there is no harm to the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">3. <em>The mother\u2019s testimony. </em>As to the mother\u2019s testimony, the defendant contends that her statement about learning \u201cadditional information\u201d was inadmissible because it did not relate to Marie\u2019s first complaint, which was about the indecent touchings and not the rape. He also claims that the prosecutor violated the judge\u2019s guideline that no one would testify about \u201canything [Marie] told them about the rape,\u201d when she elicited the statement from the mother that it was Marie\u2019s disclosure that prompted her to go to the police in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The challenged testimony spans only a few lines of transcript and primarily concerns the circumstances that led Marie\u2019s mother to contact the police. Although the mother did not provide any details about her conversation with her daughter or the police,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>she did testify that she had a conversation with Marie about the \u201cincident.\u201d Even assuming error, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCoy, supra </em>at 846 (admission of mother\u2019s testimony that she and victim had conversation about assault, even without details of conversation, was error when testimony did not serve \u201cany additional purpose\u201d), the testimony was inconsequential. The jury would have inferred that a report had been made to the police by the fact that the defendant was charged with rape. Thus, we conclude that the testimony did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">4. <em>Prior consistent statements. </em>On direct examination, Marie testified that the defendant touched her buttocks and her vaginal area over her clothing. Defense counsel sought to impeach her testimony by introducing evidence that Marie previously had told the grand jury that the defendant had not touched her buttocks but had only touched her vagina. The Commonwealth then requested permission to introduce another portion of Marie\u2019s grand jury testimony that was consistent with her trial testimony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>The judge ruled, over objection, that Marie\u2019s prior consistent statement was admissible under the doctrine of verbal completeness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>377 Mass. 814, 826831 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The defendant contends that it was an abuse of discretion for the judge to admit Marie\u2019s prior consistent statement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the issue was properly preserved, we review to determine whether there was error and, if so, \u201cwhether the error had, or might have had, an effect on the jury and whether the error contributed to or might have contributed to the verdicts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perrot, </em>407 Mass. 539, 549 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u201cA witness\u2019s prior statement that is consistent with that witness\u2019s trial testimony is usually inadmissible.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tennison, </em>440 Mass. 553, 563 (2003). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 613(b)(1) (2010). However, \u201c[w]hen a party introduces a portion of a statement in evidence, the doctrine of verbal completeness allows admission of other relevant parts of the same statement to \u2018clarify the context\u2019 of the admitted portion and prevent one side from \u2018presenting a fragmented and misleading version of events to the finder of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tennison, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carmona, </em>428 Mass. 268, 272 (1998). Here, the defendant introduced only that portion of Marie\u2019s grand jury testimony that was helpful to him. \u201cIn doing so, [he] opened the door for the admission of the remainder of that statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564. Additionally, because the statement introduced by the defendant left the impression that Marie\u2019s memory was faulty, the Commonwealth was entitled to rehabilitate Marie by introducing statements that explained or contradicted the inconsistency, \u201ceven though prior consistent statements by [Marie were] implicated.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vuthy Seng, </em>456 Mass. 490, 498-499 (2010): Consequently, the judge acted properly to ensure that the jury heard \u201call that was said by [Made] at the same time and upon the same subject.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, supra </em>at 827, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keyes, </em>11 Gray 323, 324 (1858). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 106(a) (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Even if we were to conclude that it was error for the judge to have admitted Marie\u2019s consistent statement, any harm that followed as a result was minimal. \u201cThis was not a case where the additional testimony was merely loaded with \u2018self-serving statements,\u2019 or information on unrelated subject matter.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tennison, supra </em>at 564. To the contrary, the prosecutor did no more than ask the stenographer to read two lines of transcript that directly followed the testimony introduced by the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We thus conclude that the judge did not abuse her discretion in allowing the jury to hear the entirety of Marie\u2019s grand jury testimony about the indecent touchings.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\"><em>A </em>pseudonym.

Based upon three pretrial conversations between the parties and the judge, I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">In the first conversation, defense counsel argued that the complaint of rape was \u201cbeyond the scope of\u201d the first complaint doctrine. The prosecutor responded that while she did not intend to elicit \u201cdetails\u201d from Marie, she argued that Marie could testify that she had made such a complaint. Defense counsel objected to testimony regarding \u201cwhat happened two years later that caused people to go to the police.\u201d He then made it explicit that he was \u201cobject[ing] to the conversation with the grandmother, and the ensuing police report\u201d because it was not \u201cfirst complaint.\u201d The judge reserved decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">In the second conversation, the judge summarized the controverted testimony to be that \u201cas a result of seeing the [djefendant on television, [Marie] told her mother and grandmother that she had been raped by him.\u201d Defense counsel argued that Marie could not testify to \u201cwhat she said to [other people], for example, that she was raped.\u201d The judge ruled that although Marie could not disclose \u201c[t]he substance of what she said to her mother or grandmother[,]\u201d she could testify \u201cthat as a result of seeing the Defendant on television, she made a disclosure to her mother or grandmother.\u201d Defense counsel immediately objected to this ruling and \u201cask[ed] that [his] objection be preserved.\u201d The judge did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>In the third conversation, which occurred very shortly after the second, defense counsel sought reconsideration of the judge\u2019s ruling, focusing at that point on the evidence of Marie seeing the defendant on television. The record reflects that at this time, defense counsel, the prosecutor, and the judge had in mind the guidelines established in the second conversation, which had occurred only ten transcript pages earlier. At the conclusion of this third conversation, the judge stated that defense counsel\u2019s \u201cobjection is noted\u201d and agreed that his \u201crights [were] preserved.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, I would review the challenged testimony under the familiar principles of the prejudicial error standard. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The majority appears to acknowledge that the challenged testimony was not admissible as first complaint evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s analysis and conclusion regarding whether the testimony was otherwise admissible under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass. 214, 222-223 (2009), and other cases cited in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Although evidence not admissible as first complaint may be \u201cindependently admissible in the judge\u2019s discretion on the basis of some other evidentiary principle,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 224, the multiple complaint evidence was not otherwise admissible in this case. The majority concludes that the challenged testimony was properly admitted because, in part, it \u201cenabled the jury \u2018to make a fairer and more accurate assessment of the Commonwealth\u2019s case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 394, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, supra </em>at 229. I read <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana </em>differently. If multiple complaint testimony \u201cserves no purpose other than to repeat the fact of a complaint and thereby corroborate the complainant\u2019s accusations, it is inadmissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>456 Mass. 838, 846 (2010) (\u201cThe testimony of multiple witnesses may not be used solely to enhance a victim\u2019s credibility, without serving any additional evidentiary purpose\u201d). Thus, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the challenged testimony was admissible simply because it established Marie\u2019s credibility. <em>Ante </em>at 394-395.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Our cases explicitly instruct that in order to be admissible, such testimony must \u201cserve[] a purpose other than to corroborate [Marie\u2019s] allegations.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteiro, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 489, 495 (2009). If multiple complaint testimony was admissible simply because it bolstered a victim\u2019s credibility or enabled the jury to better understand the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the first complaint doctrine would have no meaning. The testimony regarding the 2005 disclosures did not relate to Marie\u2019s state of mind and did not offer any reason for the delay in her disclosures. Further, the \u201cjury did not need to know how the complaint of abuse evolved into the case before them.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass. 449, 457 (2008). The defendant did not exploit the delay in order to impeach Marie\u2019s credibility and did not otherwise open the door to the multiple complaint testimony. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kebreau, </em>454 Mass. 287, 299 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In applying the prejudicial error standard of review, I note that in this case, the \u201ccentral determination before the jury was the credibility of the complainant!].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, supra </em>at 228. When the case turns on credibility, \u201cthere is a particularly high probability of prejudice from the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>duplicative complaint evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monteiro, supra </em>at 497. Considering the multiple complaint testimony which was erroneously received by the jury, I conclude that relief is warranted and thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Although Marie did not testify as to the details of that conversation, she did testify that such a conversation occurred in which she revealed a rape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Although the defendant did not object at trial, the judge\u2019s statement that this issue was preserved \u201crelievfed] the defendant of the necessity to object to the evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kee, </em>449 Mass. 550, 553 n.5 (2007). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunton, </em>397 Mass. 101, 102 n.2 (1986) (an objection need not be renewed where the judge expressly assures defense counsel that his rights are \u201cfully protected\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaSota, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 15, 24 n.12 (1990) (issue preserved where judge twice noted defense counsel\u2019s objection and said that \u201chis rights were preserved\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-12\">The Commonwealth argues that the multiple complaint testimony was permissible under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kebreau, </em>454 Mass. 287 (2009). In that case, one witness was permitted to testify to a disclosure, which occurred between 1988 and 1990, of genital touching. Another witness, who the judge ruled was an additional first complaint witness, was permitted to testify to a subsequent disclosure, which occurred in 1994, of rapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">The rapes in <em>Kebreau, </em>which began in 1990, did not take place until <em>after </em>the first complaint of indecent touchings. Accordingly, it was impossible for the complainant in that case to have reported the rapes at the time of her first complaint. In this case, by contrast, all the abuse occurred <em>before </em>Marie\u2019s first complaint. As a matter of timing, Marie could have reported the rape in her first complaint to her mother. Compared to the risk of prejudice to the defendant, the prejudice to Marie by excluding evidence of the rape complaint is relatively minor. True, the jury might question why Marie did not report the rape at the time that she reported the other touchings (which might, in turn, support an inference that the rape was fabricated). However, this same inference might occur even if the testimony were admitted, because she waited three years to come forward with the new complaint rather than report it at the time of the first complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
