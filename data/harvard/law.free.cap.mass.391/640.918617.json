The decision was affirmed by a judge of the Brockton District Court. Pursuant to G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42, this case came here for direct review with a report from that court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">We summarize the facts found by the review examiner. The plaintiff worked as a nurse\u2019s aide for St. Joseph Manor Nursing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Home (employer) from December, 1980, to November 4, 1982. She was thoroughly trained in all aspects of her work. Despite this, she frequently failed to follow job-related instructions, a number of which related to patient care. On October 15, 1982, the plaintiff was issued a written warning that further incidents would result in her termination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She was placed on thirty days\u2019 probation. During the probationary period, the plaintiff left a patient unrestrained on a commode and personally used medicated cream belonging to another patient, both violations of the employer\u2019s policies. The plaintiff was discharged. The review examiner found that \u201c[sjince the claimant was fully trained in all aspects of her work and was capable of doing her work in the manner required by the employer, [and] since she had been adequately warned that her job was in jeopardy, her discharge is attributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The plaintiff contends that the board\u2019s finding that she was \u201cfully trained in all aspects of her work\u201d and \u201cwas capable of doing her work in the manner required\u201d is not based on substantial evidence. The plaintiff\u2019s allegations go to the issue whether she had the requisite state of mind so that her actions could be found to be deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest. See <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>387 Mass. 776, 779 (1982); <em>Reavey </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 913, 914 (1979); G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2). The plaintiff argues that we should remand because the review examiner failed to make subsidiary findings with respect to state of mind.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>the question is close, we conclude that the review examiner\u2019s findings are sufficient on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">We agree \u201cthat the \u2018critical factual issue\u2019 in considering whether an employee\u2019s alleged misconduct is in wilful disregard of [her] employer\u2019s interest is the employee\u2019s state of mind at the time of the misconduct.\u201d <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., ante </em>206, 209 (1984), citing <em>Torres, supra </em>at 779. \u201cIn evaluating its subsidiary findings, the board must therefore take into account the worker\u2019s knowledge of the employer\u2019s expectation, the reasonableness of that expectation and the presence of any mitigating factors.\u201d <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 94, 97 (1979). Further, \u201c[i]n the absence of any finding on the basic factual issue of the employee\u2019s state of mind, the agency decision cannot stand.\u201d <em>Reavey </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 914. See <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 779. Accepting these principles, we believe the record is adequate to support the board\u2019s decision to deny benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">There is substantial evidence that the plaintiff was fully trained with respect to the rights of patients and the need for and use of restraints. She attended a five-hour initial orientation, a forty-hour orientation for her work on Level 2, and a series of forty-six in-service training sessions, including sessions on patients\u2019 rights, patient abuse, positioning, transfer and lifting, and \u201ccompassion.\u201d The record discloses that the plaintiff was warned many times not to leave patients unattend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>ed without a restraint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, there was evidence that prior to the written warning the plaintiff had used the private property of patients without their permission and knew that such use was a violation of the employer\u2019s policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Relying on the obvious proposition that \u201c[a] person\u2019s knowledge . . . like his intent, is a matter of fact, which may not be susceptible of proof by direct evidence, [the review examiner assessed] . . . the facts and circumstances developed at the trial,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holiday, </em>349 Mass. 126,128 (1965), to determine the plaintiff\u2019s state of mind. In his findings, the review examiner focused on whether the plaintiff was adequately trained and adequately warned to determine if the plaintiff\u2019s actions might have been motivated by incompetence, good faith lack of understanding of employer policies or practices, or other causes that would entitle her to benefits. From the evidence adduced at the hearings (there were two), the review examiner eliminated these possibilities and concluded that leaving the patient unrestrained and using the patient\u2019s private property<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> were acts of deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In making her claim that another hearing is required, the plaintiff relies on her oral testimony to undermine the review examiner\u2019s conclusions. However, a reading of the findings of the review examiner indicates he did not give any credence to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony. The responsibility for determining the credibility and weight of conflicting evidence rests solely with the agency. See <em>Trustees of Deerfield Academy </em>v. <em>Director </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number><em>of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>382 Mass. 26, 31-32 (1980). We conclude that the review examiner\u2019s findings of fact, although unnecessarily sparse,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> are adequate to support his conclusion that the plaintiff was discharged solely for deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b656-15\">The board denied the plaintiff\u2019s application for review. Thus, we treat the review examiner\u2019s findings as the findings of the board. G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 41 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The warning was issued as a result of violations of the employer\u2019s policies relating to the well-being and rights of patients.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\"> The employer, citing <em>Sharon </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>390 Mass. 376 (1983), and <em>Johnsons. Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 229 (1979), argues that the review examiner did not need to make express findings as to the plaintiff\u2019s state of mind because the plaintiff\u2019s acts were sufficiently egregious so that state of mind was readily apparent from the facts. Because we hold that the review examiner did make adequate findings with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s state of mind, we need not address this argument. We reiterate, however, that findings as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>state of mind must be made on the record by the administrative agency in order to facilitate \u201cthe proper exercise of our appellate function in these cases.\u201d <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 779. In <em>Sharon </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra, </em>we recognized an exception to this principle because the employee\u2019s deliberate refusal to make the required apology was \u201cobviously <em>intentional.\u201dId. </em>at 378. However, in cases in which misconduct might have been motivated by incompetence, misunderstanding, or other factors not constituting deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest, the review examiner should make specific findings on the issue of state of mind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\"> In addition to her supervisor\u2019s testimony that the plaintiff \u201cmany times left patients without restraints,\u201d and that the supervisor was \u201cconstantly telling her\u201d not to leave patients unrestrained, the plaintiff\u2019s evaluation review dated January 26, 1981, states: \u201cYou must never leave a patient without a restraint, side wall up or sitting or standing when they are not stable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\"> \u201cSince we conclude that the board was warranted in determining that the discharge was attributable <em>solely </em>to <em>wilful </em>misconduct, we need not consider whether a discharge, based in part on wilful misconduct and in part on legitimate excusable reasons, disqualifies an employee from benefits under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 (e) (2). See <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, supra </em>at 96 n.2\u201d (emphasis in original.) <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Director ofthe Div. of Employment Sec., </em>390 Mass. 1004, 1006 n.3 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b660-6\"> The plaintiff alleges that the District Court judge erred in affirming the decision of the board because at the hearing there was an agreement that the matter should be remanded to the board, and that the only disagreement was whether there should be a de novo hearing or a remand for further findings limited to \u201cstate of mind.\u201d The issue of the adequacy of the record was an issue of law and the District Court judge could conclude that the record was adequate and that remand was not required. We note that fuller findings with respect to state of mind would have obviated any difficulties on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
