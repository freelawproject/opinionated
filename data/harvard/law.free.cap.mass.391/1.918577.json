The parties have agreed, \u201c[o]n information and belief,\u201d that the affidavit contained \u201cinformation including, but not limited to, a chronology of . . . Torres\u2019 geographic location.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">Information concerning Torres\u2019s whereabouts at various times (and whatever other information may have been in the affidavit) may have significance in the determination of his rights in the Federal action. Torres argues that the disclosure of the information concerning him in the DSS affidavit violated the Fair Information Practices Act (FIPA) (G. L. c. 66A, inserted by St. 1975, c. 776, \u00a7 1). We agree with the decision of the Superior Court judge that the disclosure was made in violation of the FIPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">The case appears to have been presented solely on a stipulation to relevant facts which the judge largely adopted. In August, 1979, Torres and others commenced the Federal court action against the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Education, the Secretary of Human Services, and the Governor. Civil Action No. 79-1652-K (D. Mass., August 16, 1979). The Federal court action seeks the delivery of \u201cappropriate education and mental health services\u201d which, it is alleged, Torres and other emotionally disturbed children and adolescents have been unlawfully denied. The office of the Attorney General through the defendant Fox represents the defendants in the Federal court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">Torres, who apparently has attained the age of eighteen while this State proceeding has been pending, had been a client of the DSS. The defendant Prostack, the DSS social worker assigned to Torres\u2019s case, had assembled a case file containing confidential and personal information about Torres. A case file typically contains such information as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>client\u2019s name and address, his residential history, family situation and background, educational history, evaluations by social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists, and records of any court involvement. It is from Torres\u2019s case file that the information contained in the DSS affidavit was obtained. In seeking the information contained in the affidavit, the office of the Attorney General was acting solely for the purpose of defending the Federal court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">In February, 1981, Torres\u2019s counsel learned of the affidavit and objected to the disclosures made in it. It is agreed that neither Torres nor his parents consented to the release of information concerning him in the DSS files. Neither the affidavit nor its substance has been used in the Federal court litigation. Although the defendants Fox and the Attorney General declined to agree not to use the information in the DSS affidavit in the Federal court action, they did agree to give advance notice to Torres\u2019s counsel if the defendant Fox should decide to submit the affidavit in court. Attempts to resolve the dispute concerning the DSS affidavit were unsuccessful, and this action followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">Torres sought equitable and declaratory relief and damages for the alleged release of personal data in violation of the FIFA. The trial judge concluded that the information in the DSS affidavit was \u201cpersonal data,\u201d as defined in the FIFA (G. L. c. 66A, \u00a7 1). He further concluded that the disclosure of the information in the DSS affidavit was a violation of the FIFA because that disclosure was not approved by Torres or otherwise authorized by statute or regulation. He entered a judgment enjoining the defendant Fox and the Attorney General from disseminating or using the information taken from Torres\u2019s DSS file, in the absence of an appropriate court order. He also enjoined the defendant Prostack and the Commissioner of DSS from disseminating personal and confidential DSS information concerning Torres to the Attorney General in the absence of an appropriate court order. He further ordered the defendant Fox and the Attorney General to destroy all copies of personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>and confidential information taken from Torres\u2019s DSS file.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By a subsequent order the judge directed the defendants to pay exemplary damages of $100, attorney\u2019s fees of $1,500, and court costs of $40. The trial judge stayed execution of his order pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">The defendants have appealed, challenging the judge\u2019s determination that there had been a violation of the FIFA and further challenging his award of exemplary damages and attorney\u2019s fees. Torres has also appealed, arguing that the amount awarded for attorney\u2019s fees is unreasonably low. We granted the defendants\u2019 application for direct appellate review. We agree with the trial judge\u2019s determination that there was a violation of the FIFA. We also agree that Torres is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees (and costs), but the obligation to pay that award should be placed solely on the DSS. We agree with Torres that an award of attorney\u2019s fees of $1,500 was not adequate on the record, and we remand the case for a redetermination of the amount to be awarded for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">1. We consider first whether the information set forth in the DSS affidavit concerning Torres was of a character generally protected from disclosure under the FIFA. One major objective of the FIFA was to limit access to personal data maintained by a State agency (the holding agency or \u201cholder,\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 66A, \u00a7 1). Generally, no other agency and no individual not employed by the holding agency is allowed access to personal data \u201cunless such access is authorized by statute or regulations which are consistent with the purpose of [G. L. c. 66A] or is approved by the data subject whose personal data are sought.\u201d G. L. c. 66A, \u00a7 2 (c), as appearing in St. 1977, c. 691, \u00a7 8. Penalties are provided for violations of any provision of the FIFA. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3B.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">Our concern is whether the information disclosed by the DSS affidavit concerning Torres is \u201cpersonal data.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>question arises under the definition of \u201cpersonal data\u201d as amended in 1977. G. L. c. 66A, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1977, c. 691, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The 1977 amendment added language which, for our purposes, states that information contained in a public record, as defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, is not personal data.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">Our attention is thus turned to the definition of \u201cpublic records\u201d in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, as amended through St. 1977, c. 691, \u00a7 1. The portions of the definition that are relevant to the arguments in this case are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No longer can clause Twenty-sixth <em>(a) </em>apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>because, due to the 1977 amendment of G. L. c. 66A, \u00a7 1, there is no specific statutory exemption from disclosure, apart from any exemption supplied by some other subclause of the definition of \u201cpublic records.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nor do we see any exemption by necessary implication. The legislative directive that we consider the definition of \u201cpublic records\u201d in determining what personal data are leaves no room for such an implication.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">The language on which the parties\u2019 disagreement must be resolved is the concluding portion of clause Twenty-sixth (c), which excludes from \u201cpublic records\u201d those \u201cmaterials or data relating to a specifically named individual, the disclosure of which may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d The word \u201cunwarranted\u201d was added to subclause (c) of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, by the same 1977 act that amended the definition of \u201cpersonal data.\u201d St. 1977, c. 691, \u00a7 1. These two 1977 amendments in essence broadened the range of information that might be available as public records and reduced the scope of data that are \u201cpersonal data.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>In any attempt to determine whether disclosure of the information about Torres contained in the DSS affidavit may constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy, or, as the statute redundantly says, \u201cpersonal privacy,\u201d it would be helpful to know just what the information was, who provided it in what circumstances, and whether it was otherwise available. We are advised with certainty only that the information concerned Torres\u2019s whereabouts at certain times. Disclosure of information provided to DSS in connection with obtaining government services or benefits would normally be regarded as an invasion of privacy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Torres is a member of a class of persons for whom the protections of the FIFA were particularly intended.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> No member of the pub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>lie could have come in off the street and rightfully obtained any information from DSS concerning a private individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Certainly the expectations of the data subject are relevant in determining whether disclosure of information might be an invasion of privacy. Compare <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>City Treasurer of Lynn, </em>374 Mass. 812, 817-818 (1978) (disclosure of policemen\u2019s payroll records not shown to constitute an invasion of privacy), with <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Northampton, </em>375 Mass. 127, 132 (1978) (disclosure of names of applicants for position of superintendent of schools might constitute an invasion of privacy as to some applicants). Thus the same information about a person, such as his name and address, might be protected from disclosure as an unwarranted invasion of privacy in one context and not in another.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The word \u201cunwarranted,\u201d added by the 1977 amendment, particularly suggests a weighing of the circumstances of the data subject \u2014 a balancing of the public\u2019s right to know as reflected in the Commonwealth\u2019s public records law, and the individual\u2019s right to protection against an unwarranted intrusion into his privacy. The exemption of subclause <em>(c) </em>appears to be the only exemption in the definition of \u201cpublic records\u201d calling for a balancing of interests rather than for an objective determination of fact.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>balancing of interests, did the Legislature contemplate that the interests of the person who seeks the record must also be weighed? In other words, may an invasion of privacy be warranted when the request for special data is supported by strong public policy considerations and not warranted when the request for the same data is not so supported? We question whether the Legislature intended a variable definition of \u201cpersonal data\u201d and \u201cpublic records,\u201d depending on the merits of the information seeker\u2019s need. It may be that the public records law was intended only to make properly maintained information available to members of the public treated collectively and not intended to differentiate among the purposes for which information is requested. That seems to be the view taken of the Federal Freedom of Information Act. See <em>Kurzon </em>v. <em>Department of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>649 F.2d 65, 68 n.2 (1st Cir. 1981); <em>DePlanche </em>v. <em>Califano, </em>549 F. Supp. 685, 693 (W.D. Mich. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">We need not decide, however, whether the reason why personal data are sought can ever warrant an invasion of privacy because, even if an applicant\u2019s reasons are to be considered, the defendants here have not presented an adequate reason why the disclosure of Torres\u2019s whereabouts on particular dates (the invasion of \u201cpersonal privacy\u201d) was so essential to its defense of the Federal case that disclosure was warranted at the time it was made. The burden is on the defendants to show that the invasion of Torres\u2019s privacy was warranted. In an action to obtain information under the public records law, the burden is placed on a holding agency seeking to withhold that information to prove that one of the exemptions in the definition of public records applies. G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (c). Under the FIFA, however, the situation is different because the holding agency may (as here) wish to disclose information. When a data subject shows that information falls within the definition of personal data, but for the exemption for public records, and further shows that the disclosure not only might be, but in fact is, an invasion of privacy, the State agency seeking to justify the disclosure has the burden of showing that an invasion of privacy is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>warranted. Here, there has been no evidentiary showing that the invasion of privacy was warranted. The information disclosed was, therefore, \u201cpersonal data\u201d not subject to disclosure unless some other provision of the FIFA permitted its disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">2. The defendants argue that, by bringing the Federal action, Torres waived his right to have any personal data contained in the DSS affidavit held in confidence. The FIFA does not recognize the concept of waiver as such. Under G. L. c. 66A, \u00a7 2 (c), access to personal data may be \u201capproved by the data subject whose personal data are sought.\u201d We see no approval of access to any personal data held by DSS inherent in Torres\u2019s commencement of an action against other State agencies or in any communication of his counsel seeking relief. The word \u201capproval,\u201d as used in \u00a7 2 (c), requires conscious attention to the question of the disclosure of the personal data and assent by the data subject himself (or someone authorized to act on his behalf). If there may be room for an implied approval of the disclosure of personal data in particular circumstances, the facts in this case present no basis for such an implication. Nor do we see the commencement of the Federal action as constituting a waiver of Torres\u2019s right of privacy under G. L. c. 66A or as making the invasion of privacy warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">If the limitations of G. L. c. 66A unreasonably restrict the defense of actions against State employees or State agencies, the remedy must be legislative. Restraints on governmental action often serve a wide public objective, even at a sacrifice in particular circumstances, and are not uncommon in the law of this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">3. The defendants argue that the disclosure of information to the office of the Attorney General by DSS was permitted by G. L. c. 66A, \u00a7 2 (c), because it was \u201cauthorized by statute or regulations which are consistent with the purposes of this chapter.\u201d The Executive Office of Human Services (EOHS), of which DSS is a part (G. L. c. 6A, \u00a7 16), had adopted a regulation pursuant to G. L. c. 66A, \u00a7 3, stating that \u201c[a]ny agency which is a holder of personal data may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>give access to that data to authorized <em>investigative agents </em>of the Attorney General. . . acting in furtherance of their official duties\u201d (emphasis added). 101 Code Mass. Regs. 8.06 (7) (1979). Further, the defendants assert a statutory authorization for access to Torres\u2019s personal data because the Attorney General has certain rights and obligations under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 3, including the defense of civil actions against State officials and agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">We have acknowledged the special responsibility that the Attorney General has in handling the Commonwealth\u2019s legal business. See <em>Clerk of the Superior Court for the County of Middlesex </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>386 Mass. 517, 526 (1982); <em>Feeney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>373 Mass. 359, 365 (1977); <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>367 Mass. 154, 158-165 (1975). That special responsibility, some of which has a common law rather than a statutory origin <em>(Opinion of the Justices, </em>354 Mass. 804, 809 [1968]), does not include by implication statutory authorization for access to Torres\u2019s personal data in the circumstances of this case. Although the Attorney General\u2019s obligations transcend the interests of a State employee or a State agency being sued, we see no legislative intent to grant the office of the Attorney General open access to personal data held by one State agency simply because a data subject has brought a suit against one or more other State agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The EOHS regulation must be construed so as to avoid creating the possibility of exceptions as broad as the protection granted by the FIFA. If the EOHS regulation were read to permit access by any assistant attorney general whenever it is thought that personal data of a litigant might be helpful in the prosecution or defense of litigation, the regulation would not be consistent with the purposes of the FIFA. The limiting words, \u201cinvestigative agents of the Attorney General,\u201d in the EOHS regulation must not be ignored. We view the exception granted by the EOHS as extending no further than to the disclosure of personal data in connection with investigations and as not including disclosure of personal data to agents of the Attorney General \u201cinvestigat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>ing\u201d the defense of a civil action. The Attorney General may well conclude that the allegations of a legal action require not only the defense of an action but also investigation of the question whether an agency is complying with the requirements of law. In such a case, if personal data are concerned, the investigative and the defense roles of the office of the Attorney General should be separated. On this record, the assistant attorney general who received the DSS affidavit was not an investigative agent of the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">4. A holder of personal data which violates any provision of G. L. c. 66A \u201cshall be liable for exemplary damages of not less than one hundred dollars for each violation,\u201d even if the data subject sustained no actual damages. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3B, as amended through St. 1977, c. 691, \u00a7 14. Such a holder is also liable for \u201csuch costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as may be <em>incurred </em>in said action\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>The motion judge ordered the defendants to pay Torres $100 as exemplary damages and to pay him $1,500 as attorney\u2019s fees and $40 in court costs. The defendants challenge the award of exemplary damages and attorney\u2019s fees. By his cross appeal, Torres challenges the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">By its terms, G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3B, mandates the payment of at least $100 in exemplary damages when a holder has been shown to have violated a provision of G. L. c. 66A. There is, of course, no evidence in this case that any defendant acted maliciously, fraudulently, or wantonly toward Torres. Nor is there any evidence that Torres sustained any damage because of the violation of G. L. c. 66A. In the absence of a statutory directive, an award of exemplary damages would not be appropriate in this case. See <em>International Fidelity Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 856 n.20 (1983). However, the statute provides no exception for good faith conduct, nor does it grant discretion to the judge whether to award exemplary damages of $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">The statute is directed against State agencies that are \u201cholders,\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 66A, \u00a7 1. We decline to read the words \u201cshall be liable\u201d as permitting any element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>of judicial discretion. An award of exemplary damages of at least $100 was required, once the FIPA violation was found. However, G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3B, places the obligation to pay exemplary damages (and attorney\u2019s fees and costs) on the holder who violated G. L. c. 66A and not on any individual State employee. The agency is the \u201cholder,\u201d not its employees. The Commissioner of DSS is a named defendant in her official capacity. The order for exemplary damages (and attorney\u2019s fees and costs) should have been directed against the DSS alone. We shall remand the case for an appropriate revision of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The defendants argue that Torres is not entitled to an allowance for attorney\u2019s fees because G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3B, only calls for an award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cincurred in said action,\u201d and it is agreed that Torres has no obligation to pay an attorney\u2019s fee because a legal services organization has represented him. We have said that, if a statute authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees, an award may be made to a legal services organization. See <em>Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>378 Mass. 758, 764 (1979); <em>Lincoln St. Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>374 Mass. 630, 632 (1978). The question whether a person such as Torres has \u201cincurred\u201d attorney\u2019s fees within the meaning of a statute similar to the FIPA has generally been answered elsewhere in the affirmative.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We now join <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>that view. The reasoning is that the Legislature allows attorney\u2019s fees to a successful litigant in such cases to encourage private enforcement of the law and to encourage the government to comply with the law at the risk of a financial loss to it if it does not. These legislative goals have been given more weight in construing the word \u201cincurred\u201d in the context of such statutes than has the meaning of the word in a debtor-creditor sense. Torres was entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Torres argues that the allowance of attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $1,500 was unreasonably low and that the motion judge did not properly apply the standards for determining a reasonable fee that are set forth in our opinion in <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312, 319 (1982). Torres also argues that the judge gave no reason for rejecting his request for substantially higher fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The claim for attorney\u2019s fees was presented on affidavits of the three counsel who worked on behalf of Torres. Two attorneys worked on the matter from June, 1981, into the fall of 1981. One spent approximately 121 hours, and the other approximately 80 hours on the case. Present counsel devoted approximately 60 hours to the case. The first two attorneys represented that \u201cat the market rate\u201d the appropriate charge for an attorney with their experience was $80 an hour. Current counsel\u2019s affidavit indicated a market rate for an attorney of her experience was $60. The total claim represented by the affidavits was slightly less than $19,750. The defendants have not argued to us that, if an award of attorney\u2019s fees is lawful, the award of $1,500 was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">We have no question that, on the basis of the information submitted with the affidavits and the motion judge\u2019s obser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>vations and experience (see <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Silverbranch Constr. Corp., </em>376 Mass. 621, 629-630 [1978]), there was an adequate basis for rejecting the total fee claimed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The appropriate initial standard is the \u201cfair market rates for time reasonably spent.\u201d <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, supra </em>at 322. \u201cCalculation of reasonable hourly rates should begin with the average rates in the attorney\u2019s community for similar work by attorneys of the same years\u2019 experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323. There are then various appropriate considerations that may call for adjustments in the fee otherwise indicated. See <em>id. </em>at 323-324; <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Greenfield, </em>384 Mass. 444, 456-457 (1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 947 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">On the record before us we are unable to find a reasonable basis for the allowance of a fee of only $1,500. We are unaided by any factual determinations or reasoning in support of the judge\u2019s conclusion. There must be a redetermination of the amount to be allowed for attorney\u2019s fees. Such a determination should reflect the reasonable services of counsel since the date of the services shown on the affidavits of counsel, including the efforts of Torres\u2019s counsel on the defendants\u2019 appeal and, if appropriate under the principles stated in <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, supra </em>at 325, the efforts of Torres\u2019s counsel in his appeal. To assist in that determination, we note that the presentation of Torres\u2019s position before this court was competent and appropriately directed to the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">5.

L. c. 66A, access to the identifiable information in the DSS files concerning Torres could not have been lawfully given to the Attorney General. That information would not have been available under the public records law as a \u201cpublic record\u201d because it was material or data \u201cspecifically . . . exempted from disclosure by statute.\u201d G.

To a young mother on welfare whose primary concern is feeding her child, to the unemployed head of a household trying to secure work, to the drug dependent who turns to a drug treatment center for help, to the indigent patient in a hospital in need of emergency medical attention, persons who need the necessities of life are quite willing to trade off great quantities of personal information, without regard for the potential uses or abuses of that personal data.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-10\">\u201cThe implicit assumption on the part of each person in the examples listed is that information will be used to assist them in the delivery of services \u2014 not aware that the information obtained may be disseminated or made available to other agencies without the consent of the data subject for purposes quite different from those for which the information was originally released.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b25-7\"> The Attorney General has noted that this distinction must be drawn, based on whether a person has or has not a legitimate privacy interest in the disclosure of his name and address in the files of State agencies. Compare Report of the Attorney General to the Chairman of the Division of Industrial Accidents, Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 90-91 (1978) (disclosure of names and addresses of employees who have sought workmen\u2019s compensation benefits would be an invasion of privacy) with Report of the Attorney General to' the Secretary of the Executive Office of Consumer Affairs, Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 161 (1977) (names and addresses of persons licensed by State agencies to engage in certain trades or professions not protected from disclosure).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b25-8\"> Similar, but not identical, language in the Federal Freedom of Information Act concerning the exemption from disclosure of \u201cfiles the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552[b][6] [1970]) is also unique in that act in calling for a \u201cdiscretionary balancing of competing interests.\u201d See <em>Getman v.

L. c. 186, \u00a7 20) concerned with the award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cincurred\u201d by a tenant in an action involving her landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The Federal Equal Access to Justice Act directs that generally a prevailing private party shall be awarded fees incurred in certain civil actions brought by or against the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (1976 &amp; Supp. 1980). Almost universally Federal courts have allowed legal fees when the successful prevailing private party was represented by a legal services organization. See <em>Ceglia </em>v. <em>Schweiker, </em>566 F. Supp. 118,122-123 (E.D.N.Y. 1983); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Schweiker, </em>565 F. Supp. 52, 54-55 (W.D.

As noted by the majority, this court has held that an award of counsel\u2019s fees to a party represented by a publicly-funded legal service organization was not warranted under a contract that provided for the awarding of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by the prevailing party. <em>Lincoln St. Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>374 Mass. 630, 632 (1978). There, the issue whether a person so represented incurred attorneys\u2019 fees within the meaning of a statute similar to the one applicable here was noted, but not decided. <em>Supra </em>at 14. <em>Lincoln St. Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Green, supra </em>at 632 &amp; n.2. The majority rely primarily upon decisions of the Federal courts in deciding this issue in favor of the plaintiff. The principal statute construed in these decisions, 28 U.S.G. \u00a7 2412 (d)(1)(A) (1976 &amp; Supp. 1980), does contain what I regard as the crucial modifier, \u201cincurred.\u201d This court, however, has interpreted the word \u201cincur\u201d in a different context to mean \u201c \u2018to become liable to or subject to; to bring down upon oneself; as, to incur debt, danger, displeasure, penalty, etc.,\u2019 and \u2018to become through one\u2019s own action liable or subject to; to bring upon oneself.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>346 Mass. 294, 298 (1963). We have often stated that \u201cevery word of a legislative enactment is to be given force and effect.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Pub. Works </em>v. <em>Cities Serv. Oil Co., </em>308 Mass. 349, 360 (1941). And the words so used are to be construed according to their natural and ordinary meaning. <em>Chatham Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>362 Mass. 216, 219 (1972). <em>Davey Bros. </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., </em>351 Mass. 59, 63 (1966). When faced with such recognition by this court of the accepted meaning of this term, and these often applied principles of statutory construction, I find it impossible to conclude that the Legislature intended that we read the word \u201cincurred\u201d out of the statute for policy reasons, no matter how compelling. There is no question that the plaintiff here has not incurred legal fees in accordance with the commonly accepted usage of that term which this court has acknowledged. The majority fail to give meaning to the express words of the statute. I would, therefore, conclude that no award of fees should have been made in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
