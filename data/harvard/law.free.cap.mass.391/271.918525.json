We allowed the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-15\">On June 16, 1982, the judge charged the jury, two alternate jurors were selected, the jury retired at 3:22 p.m., and the judge left the bench. Some time later, before 4 p.m., in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>a way and at a time not shown on the record, the judge received information that caused him, on his own motion, to bring the jury back into the courtroom. The judge then called one juror to the bench, where a bench conference was held with the prosecutor and defense counsel present. We shall assume that the jury did not hear what was said. It is apparent, however, that the remaining jurors (and presumably the two alternates) saw what went on at the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">We set forth the colloquy that followed:</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The judge: \u201cIt was just brought to my attention, Ms. [name], that you might have some problems. What are your problems?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The juror: \u201cWell, first of all, I feel, you know, kind of see him guilty on, you know, hitting her. But the other charges, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The judge: \u201cWhy? Even though the evidence might be completely compelling, you can\u2019t do it?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">The juror: \u201cIt just don\u2019t seem right because it was two different stories.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">The judge: \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that this juror has a serious and profound mental block about considering the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">The juror: \u201cYes. You know, I can\u2019t see giving him time when, you know \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">Defense counsel: \u201cI don\u2019t see any such block, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">The juror: \u201cI can\u2019t, because \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">The judge: \u201cLet me ask you this. Let me be very specific. Are you telling me that you feel that way despite what the evidence was?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-16\">The juror: \u201cI mean, after I listened to both sides.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-17\">The judge: \u201cNo, listen to me very closely. It is important that you keep an open mind. It is inconceivable to me that after ten minutes of deliberation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that\u2019s all you have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>deliberated, you have made up your mind already. Are you telling me that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The juror: \u201cOn the last two counts of rape and kidnapping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The judge: \u201cWhy have you made up your mind already? Please let me ask these questions. Go ahead. Why have you made up your mind? Is it because of the race issue?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The juror: \u201cNo, no, no, definitely not. It don\u2019t sound right because it was two different stories. I mean, some, you know, like they say, \u2018Well, he asked for a ride.\u2019 They gave him a ride, and they turned around and say he forced himself in the car, which don\u2019t sound right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The judge: \u201cI think I tend to agree with counsel for the defendant that there is no reason for excusing this juror at this time from deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The juror: \u201cI mean, it just don\u2019t sound right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">The judge: \u201cNow, let me tell you something. Please listen to me very closely. You took an oath. You took an oath to consider the evidence carefully and to keep an open mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">The juror: \u201cI did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">The judge: \u201cFor you to make up your mind without listening to \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">The juror: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that quick, but after we got there</p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">\n<em>99</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">The judge: \u201cOf course it was that quick. For you to make up your mind without listening to your fellow jurors\u2019 views about things is wrong. Now, after you listen to your fellow jurors\u2019 views about things, if you still feel the same way, that\u2019s fine. Do you understand that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-16\">The juror: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-17\">The judge: \u201cBut you have to deliberate this case, and you have to keep an open mind. Now, once you\u2019re convinced, that\u2019s another thing. But you have to listen, you have to remember what the evidence was, and you have to reflect upon it very carefully. Do you understand that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-18\">The juror: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The judge: \u201cFine. Thank you. Now, why don\u2019t you go back to the jurors, and I will see counsel here. Think about what I said overnight and tomorrow and tell me how you feel about things, not about the guilt or innocence of the defendant, but whether or not you have been able to keep an open mind during this trial. Tell me that first thing Friday morning, would you?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The juror: \u201cAll right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The judge: \u201cThank you very much.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">(Juror excused.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The judge: \u201cNow, I want to make a statement for the record. I am convinced beyond any question, based upon my observations of the demeanor of that person and my conversation with her, that she has not given any consideration to the evidence at all. She has not thought about it. In fact, she is a bad juror, and I say that unequivocally. I think, however, I\u2019m in a box, and I think you both would agree that I\u2019m in a box. I mean, we have to deal with stupid jurors; we have to deal with perverse jurors. And, quite frankly, she is both stupid and perverse, and I say that out of her presence. But if she comes back to me on Friday and says that she had kept an open mind, then she must remain on the jury. Do you both understand that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">The prosecutor: \u201cThe Commonwealth understands that, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">Defense counsel: \u201cI understand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">The judge: \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">Defense counsel: \u201cAnd I\u2019ll object, too, Judge, and I\u2019m objecting to your intimidating that lady. I\u2019m objecting to your coming to that conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">The judge: \u201cDon\u2019t you dare yell at me, or I\u2019ll kick you out of this courtroom right now. You are yelling at me. Your voice and your demeanor are offensive, and I find and rule that you are being contemptible to the Court. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">(End of bench conference.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>On the following trial day \u2014 there was an intervening holiday in Suffolk County \u2014 the \u201cproblem\u201d juror telephoned that she was sick. She did not appear. The defendant moved for a mistrial on the ground that the judge had interfered with the jury\u2019s deliberations through intimidation of the juror. He also moved that an inquiry be made concerning the reason for the juror\u2019s absence. The judge denied the motion, stating that in his opinion \u201cthat conversation with that juror the other evening was totally warranted by what that juror indicated to me.\u201d The judge then made a further comment that gives some indication of the likely effect of the bench conference on the other jurors. The judge said to defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">\u201cI also say that your demeanor to me at our conversation at the side last Wednesday was the most offensive demeanor I have ever experienced in ten years of being a judge. You physically sought to intimidate me by your bodily movements and the tone of your voice. I found it to be absolutely extraordinary. I\u2019ve never experienced any conduct like that in my ten years as a sitting judge. And I thank you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The judge then ordered that one of the two alternates be selected. The jury, charged to begin deliberations anew, retired at 10:35 a.m. and returned with guilty verdicts at 3:22 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">We need not consider whether the judge erred in substituting an alternate juror without further inquiry and a hearing on the question of replacing the absent juror (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>377 Mass. 755, 769-770 [1979]), because the judge should have declared a mistrial on the defendant\u2019s motion following the bench conference with the \u201cproblem\u201d juror. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hebert, </em>379 Mass. 752, 755 (1980), we said that \u201cany questioning of a juror must be neutral and not coercive or otherwise calculated to affect the juror\u2019s judgment.\u201d Our law does not permit in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>quiry into \u201cthe subjective mental processes of jurors, such as the reasons for their decisions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. 192, 198 (1979). The jury heard conflicting stories. The juror who had \u201cproblems\u201d inferentially had taken a position in the jury room that, for some reason, led someone to send word from the jury room and in turn led the judge to bring the jury into the courtroom. The judge improperly told the juror that she had \u201ca serious and profound mental block about considering the evidence,\u201d and implied that she may have violated her oath as a juror. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 A.2d 1140, 1142 (D.C. 1977) (per curiam). This intimated that the judge disagreed with her on the evidence \u2014 \u201cAre you telling me that you feel that way despite what the evidence was?\u201d He then said that the period of deliberations was too short for her to have made up her mind. Authority does not support the statement that a verdict could not properly have been reached during that time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">This colloquy has a coercive quality that invades the province of the jury. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>449 F.2d 1177 (D.C. Cir. 1971). We cannot, of course, tell on this record whether the juror failed to appear on the next trial day because of the effect of the colloquy or because of illness. As a matter of fairness in the trial of criminal cases, we might require more of an investigation, in circumstances such as these, to ensure that the reported illness was real and not a pretext. \u201cA lone juror who could not in good con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>science vote for conviction could be under great pressure to feign illness or other incapacity so as to place the burden of decision on an alternate juror.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>529 F.2d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">We think, in any event, that the effect on the other jurors was substantially prejudicial to the defendant. They knew of the juror\u2019s disinclination to convict the defendant on certain charges. Presumably, one or more of the other jurors reported that the juror had a \u201cproblem.\u201d Of course, the judge should have placed more information on the record concerning that communication and should have permitted counsel to express their views on what procedure to follow in view of the sensitive nature of the \u201cproblem.\u201d See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ronder, </em>639 F.2d 931, 934 (2d Cir. 1981). The jurors saw the \u201cproblem\u201d juror interrogated. We cannot say with certainty what the jurors may have inferred from the actions of the participants in the conference with the \u201cproblem\u201d juror. We can reasonably infer that the jury could determine that defense counsel strenuously disagreed with what the judge had said or done. The jurors may well have been influenced to believe that the judge expressed his disagreement with the \u201cproblem\u201d juror\u2019s position. We do know that, on the next day of deliberations, the \u201cproblem\u201d juror was absent and the judge told the jury that she had called in sick. We think the jury may well have received a message that the judge wanted guilty verdicts on the more serious charges on which the \u201cproblem\u201d juror was in doubt. The proper course would have been to permit deliberations to proceed without judicial intervention and, if there were an apparent deadlock, to deal with the problem with an appropriate charge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>364 Mass. 87, 98 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Because there is a strong likelihood that the jury may have given special weight to the judge\u2019s silent communication (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>388 Mass. 749, 751 [1983]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>376 Mass. 867, 870 [1978]) and because there were significant factual issues in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>contest,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we have no alternative but to reverse the judgments, set aside the verdicts, and remand the cases for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-18\">On the next trial day, before deliberations resumed, the judge in instructing the jury further said to them that \u201cyou\u2019ve only been deliberating for a couple of hours, or perhaps an hour \u2014 not even an hour, perhaps a half to three-quarters of an hour.\u201d And in the same instruction he later said, \u201c[Y]ou\u2019ve only been deliberating for three-quarters of an hour.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\"> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>292 Mass. 409, 416 (1935), where the jury returned a guilty verdict in a murder case after no more than nineteen minutes of deliberation. In responding to the defendant\u2019s claim that the jury did not give the evidence adequate consideration, this court said \u201c[t]he case had been tried fully, and the jury could not help receiving impressions as the case proceeded.\u201d See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>561 F.2d 1301, 1303 (9th Cir.) (per curiam), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 943 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Inman, </em>350 A.2d 582, 600-601 (Me. 1976) (forty minutes, murder); <em>State </em>v. <em>Verdone, 114 </em>R.I. 613, 623 (1975) (thirteen minutes, rape); <em>State </em>v. <em>Killary, </em>133 Vt. 604, 607 (1975) (less than forty-seven minutes, first degree murder).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\"> The defendant\u2019s testimony directly contradicted the testimony of the complaining witnesses.
