L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> permits a police department to require police officers suspected of criminal activity to submit to polygraph testing under threat of discipline. We now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>hold that G. L. c. 150E does not require a city or town to negotiate with the union over the police department\u2019s decision to use polygraph examinations in the investigation of criminal activity by police officers. Therefore, we affirm the decision of the Labor Relations Commission (commission), dismissing a complaint of prohibited practice filed against the town of Ayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The facts, as found by the commission, are not disputed and can be briefly summarized. For approximately eight months during 1979, a construction company in Ayer hired off-duty police officers to guard a manufacturing site.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In February, 1980, after the company had terminated its employment of police officers, the manufacturing site was broken into and extensively ransacked. Damage estimates ranged from $25,000 to $45,000. The Ayer police department began an extensive investigation of the crime but for some time was unable to identify any suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In April, 1981, in the course of casual conversation with a fellow officer, an Ayer police officer stated that he and three fellow officers, identified by name, had perpetrated the vandalism as retaliation for the company\u2019s termination of their employment as private guards.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Eventually, this information was relayed to the Attorney General, who began his own investigation of the incident in July, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">By the late summer of 1981, the possible involvement of the four police officers in the crime, as well as the Attorney General\u2019s decision to investigate, had become public knowledge, and spawned public distrust of the police department.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One of the suspected officers resigned. The Ayer chief of police, who was related to that officer, separated himself from the department\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>investigation and, subsequently, also resigned his position. In February, 1982, the Ayer selectmen appointed a new police chief. The new police chief decided to terminate the police department\u2019s official investigation of the vandalism so as not to interfere with the Attorney General\u2019s investigation, but, acting on a belief that the matter hampered the effectiveness of the police department,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> pursued an internal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In early April, 1982, the police chief ordered the three officers under suspicion to take polygraph examinations. The chief scheduled the examination of one of the three officers for April 14, 1982. The chief informed the officer that the results would not be used against him in a criminal proceeding, but that, if the officer failed to take the examination, the chief would recommend discipline, including dismissal. The chief denied the officer\u2019s request for a postponement of the ex ami - nation pending the officer\u2019s consultation with a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Prior to the scheduled examination date, the officer called another of the suspects, who was the president of the union local, and informed him of the chief\u2019s ultimatum. The three suspected officers then met with union attorneys, who advised them to request a postponement of the polygraph examination in order to permit further legal consultation. The officers spoke to the police chief, who refused the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">On April 14, 1982, the officer whose polygraph examination was scheduled for that date refused to travel to Boston, where the test was to be administered. The police chief immediately suspended the officer for five days and wrote a letter to the Ayer selectmen recommending dismissal. The letter stated that, unless the officer were dismissed, the police chiefs ability to investigate the vandalism incident would be eliminated. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>same date, the chief scheduled polygraph examinations of the other two officers for April 20 and April 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">On April 16, the selectmen held a hearing regarding the suspended officer. Immediately prior to the beginning of the hearing, counsel for the union delivered a letter to the selectmen demanding that the town agree to meet and bargain in good faith with respect to the use of polygraph tests to examine police employees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The letter also requested that the suspended officer be returned to active duty status pending the outcome of such negotiations. The selectmen denied the request to bargain. The selectmen considered the request untimely, and the subject matter nonnegotiable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The selectmen voted an indefinite suspension of the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">On April 20, the second officer was taken in a police cruiser to Boston for the scheduled polygraph examination. The examiner asked the officer to sign a waiver releasing the examiner and his company from any claims which might arise from the examination and permitting the examiner to inform the police chief of the examination results. The officer agreed to the dissemination of the results but refused to sign the release of the examiner and his company. The officer asked the examiner to administer the test; the examiner refused to do so unless the officer signed the release. When it became evident that an impasse had been reached, the examiner told the officer to leave. On the next day, a-similar scenario took place with respect to the third officer\u2019s examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Upon learning what had transpired, the police chief suspended the two officers for five days. The chief asked the selectmen to dismiss the two officers for failing to obey his order to take the polygraph examinations. The chief also emphasized the officers\u2019 failure to testify before the grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>investigating the crime.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On April 23, 1982, the selectmen held hearings concerning the second and third officers and voted to dismiss them for their refusal to obey the chief\u2019s orders to take polygraph examinations, as well as for their noncooperation with the grand jury. The selectmen subsequently voted to dismiss the first officer (who had been indefinitely suspended) for his refusal to obey the chief\u2019s order to take the polygraph test.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">On April 20, 1982, the union filed a charge with the commission alleging that the town engaged in a prohibited practice under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(1) and (5), by unilaterally implementing the requirement that the officers submit to polygraph examinations and by refusing the union\u2019s request to bargain over that decision. After the commission issued a complaint of prohibited practice, a formal hearing was held before a hearing officer. On October 26, 1982, the commission dismissed the complaint in a decision which we discuss below. The union appealed the commission\u2019s decision to the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11. We transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>In its decision, the commission initially determined that the polygraph examinations at issue were permitted under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, as amended through St. 1973, c. 620.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That statute prohibits employers from requiring employees to submit to lie detector tests but excepts \u201clie detector tests administered by law enforcement agencies as may be otherwise permitted in criminal investigations.\u201d Turning to the separate question whether G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, required the town to negotiate with the union before implementing the polygraph requirement, the commission applied a balancing test articulated in a prior decision, <em>Boston School Comm., </em>3 M.L.C. 1603 (1977). In measuring, for purposes of the balancing test, the importance of the town\u2019s interest in requiring that officers suspected of criminal activity submit to polygraph examination, the commission referred to this court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>379 Mass. 322 (1979), that the statutory exception \u201crecognize[s] an evident interest of the employer in applying some pressure to assist an investigation leading to exoneration of the employee or the opposite.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327. The commission did not specify the extent of the impact upon the employment relationship of the polygraph requirement but implicitly found that the officers\u2019 interest in negotiating over that requirement, however strong, was outweighed by the town\u2019s interest in utilizing polygraph tests in such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The commission also found support for its conclusion that G. L. c. 150E does not require a police department to negotiate over an order that police officers suspected of criminal activity undergo polygraph testing in a line of cases decided by the New York Public Employee Relations Board. Those cases require a police department to negotiate over the use of polygraphs during investigations \u201csolely relating to ordinary employee departmental discipline,\u201d <em>Police Benevolent Ass\u2019n of White Plains, Inc., </em>12 N.Y. P.E.R.B. par. 3046 (1979); see <em>Buffalo Police Benevolent </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number><em>Ass\u2019n, 9 </em>N.Y. P.E.R.B. par. 7020 (N.Y. S.Ct. 1976), but hold that the issue of a police department\u2019s use of polygraphs while investigating \u201csuspected and actual crimes of policemen\u201d is outside the scope of terms and conditions of employment, and that a police department is not, therefore, required to bargain over such testing. <em>Police Benevolent Ass\u2019n of White Plains, Inc., supra. </em>See <em>Salamanca Police Unit, </em>12 N.Y. P.E.R.B. par. 4503 (H.O. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">1. The union contends that the commission relied on G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, \u201cas the decisive factor\u201d in its determination that the town did not violate G. L. c. 150E by refusing to bargain with the union over the institution of polygraph exams. The union takes the position that the commission\u2019s authority extends only to applications and interpretations of G. L. c. 150E, that the commission is precluded from analyzing external legislation in ruling on a charge of prohibited practice brought under the public employer collective bargaining law, and that the commission exceeded its authority in adjudicating the case. In the alternative, the union posits that the commission committed an error of law in interpreting G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, as precluding a finding that the town had a duty to negotiate under G. L. c. 150E.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">We believe that the union misreads the rationale of the commission\u2019s decision. Although the town, in its answer to the complaint of prohibited practice, raised the affirmative defense that its use of polygraphs is governed by G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, and therefore not subject to bargaining under G. L. c. 150, \u00a7 6, the commission appears to have disregarded that defense. It is apparent that the commission based its decision on a determination that the management concerns of police departments in thorough investigation of employees reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity outweigh the interests of the union representing those employees in negotiating about the administration of such tests. The commission\u2019s reference to this court\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, supra, </em>hardly constitutes an interpretation by the commission of that statute. We thus have no occasion to examine the extent of the commission\u2019s authority to interpret <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>statutes other than G. L. c. 150E in adjudicating prohibited practice claims. But see <em>Worcester Police Officials Ass\u2019n, </em>4 M.L.C. 1366, 1368 (1977) (commission reluctant to interpret statutes other than G. L. c. 150E \u201cunless compelled to do so . . . when a claim under some other statute is raised as an affirmative defense to a charge of prohibited practice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">As we read the commission\u2019s decision, it relied on G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, only to the extent necessary to establish that the police department\u2019s order in this case was not prohibited by law (a conclusion the union does not dispute, see note 11, <em>supra), </em>and to corroborate its determination that the town has a weighty interest in requiring such examinations. We therefore reject the union\u2019s argument that the commission exceeded its authority or erred in its consideration of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">2. The union attacks as arbitrary and an abuse of discretion the commission\u2019s ruling that the polygraph requirement falls outside the arena of \u201cterms and conditions of employment\u201d and is not subject to mandatory bargaining. In essence, the union challenges the balancing test applied by the commission in deciding whether G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, compels the town to negotiate over the use of the polygraph. The union alleges that the commission unjustifiably and arbitrarily deviated from precedent establishing that a rule on which continued employment is contingent is a \u2018 \u2018condition of employment. \u2019 \u2019 We conclude that the commission properly took into account the unique requirements of a police employer in distinguishing the cases relied on by the union and correctly determined that the town was not required to negotiate with the union before ordering polygraph examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The union argues that because the officers were required to comply with the polygraph order or face discharge, the town\u2019s decision to institute polygraph tests had a direct, rather than \u201cperipheral,\u201d impact on the officers\u2019 employment, and that G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, therefore compels negotiation. <em>See Boston School Comm., </em>3 M.L.C. 1603, 1607 (1977); <em>Medicenter, Mid-South Hosp., </em>221 N.L.R.B. 670 (1975). The commission concedes that \u2018 \u2018the threat of loss of employment is at the very heart of the work relationship.\u201d The question raised by this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>is whether G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, imposes a per se requirement that every matter directly affecting the employment relationship be the subject of mandatory bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In <em>School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019 n, </em>388 Mass. 557 (1983), we noted that the subject of layoffs \u201cinvolved the very essence of the [employer-employee] relationship , the employment itself, and not a peripheral matter, \u2019 \u2019 <em>id. </em>at 563, and was therefore presumptively a \u201cterm[ ] and conditionf ] of employment\u2019 \u2019 subject to the bargaining requirements of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, <em>id. </em>However, we also implicitly acknowledged that some decisions directly affecting employment conditions may be exempt from the bargaining requirements of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6. Responding to the school committee\u2019s argument that the general authority over the operation and maintenance of public schools conferred upon it by G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 68, took precedence over the duty to bargain over layoffs established by G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, we stated that G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, evidenced a \u201clegislative purpose to subject that general authority to the collective bargaining process, <em>absent some overriding policy against interfering with the school committee\u2019s right to determine significant aspects of educational policy\u2019 \u2019 </em>(emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 566. Finding no \u2018 \u2018overriding policy\u201d against compelling the school committee to negotiate over the subject of janitorial layoffs, we determined that mandatory bargaining was required by G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6. Thus, we left open the possibility that in instances where a negotiation requirement would unduly impinge on a public employer\u2019s freedom to perform its public functions, G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, does not mandate bargaining over a decision directly affecting the employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The commission\u2019s decisions also hold that management decisions directly affecting the work relationship require negotiation, see <em>Town of Danvers, </em>3 M.L.C. 1559, 1571 (1977); <em>Commonwealth of Massachusetts, </em>5 M.L.C. 1800 (H.O. 1979), unless the employer has an overriding interest which outweighs the negotiation process. See <em>City of Boston, </em>5 M.L.C. 1723, 1726 (1979) (\u201c[O]nly if [a proposal\u2019s] impact on terms and conditions of employment outweighs its im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>pingement on core managerial prerogatives or concerns will the proposal be deemed mandatorily bargainable\u201d). Cf. <em>Boston School Comm., 3 </em>M.L.C. 1603, 1607 (1977). There is no error in the commission\u2019s conclusion that the police department\u2019s overriding interest in the integrity of its police officers exempted the town from negotiating with the union over the use of polygraph examinations to investigate criminal activity by police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The balancing test applied by the commission in this case is consistent with the standard enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in construing the bargaining requirements imposed by the parallel provisions of the National Labor Relations Act. In <em>First Nat\u2019l Maintenance Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>452 U.S. 666, 679 (1981), the Supreme Court observed that \u201cin view of an employer\u2019s need for unencumbered decisionmaking, bargaining over management decisions that have a substantial impact on the continued availability of employment should be required only if the benefit, for labor-management relations and the collective-bargaining process outweighs the burden placed on the conduct of the business.\u201d See <em>Fibreboard Paper Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>379 U.S. 203, 223 (1964) (Stewart, J., concurring). Acknowledging that, as a general rule, mandatory bargaining over questions of vital concern to labor and management \u201cwill result in decisions that are better for both management and labor and for society as a whole,\u201d <em>First Nat\u2019l Maintenance Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra </em>at 678, the Supreme Court observed that \u201c[mjanagement must be free from the constraints of the bargaining process to the extent essential for the running of a profitable business,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 678-679. <em>See Newspaper Guild of Greater Philadelphia, Local 10 </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>636 F.2d 550, 562 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (in establishing existence of duty to bargain over matters basic to both management and employees, \u201ca balance must be struck . . . which will take account of the relative importance of the proposed actions of the two parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The list of factors so fundamental to the effective operation of an enterprise as to be exempt from mandatory bargaining requirements will of necessity vary with the nature of the employer. The effective operation of certain private sector employers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>has been found to be linked sufficiently to the integrity of employees to justify the unilateral imposition of rules designed to preserve that integrity. In <em>Newspaper Guild of Greater Philadelphia, Local 10 </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the right of a newspaper to impose, without submitting to collective bargaining, regulations designed to preclude reporters from engaging in activities detrimental to the newspaper\u2019s aura of objectivity. Reasoning that \u2018 \u2018protection of the editorial integrity of a newspaper lies at the core of publishing control, \u2019 \u2019 and that \u201ccredibility is central to their ultimate product and to the conduct of the enterprise,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 560, the court held that regulations reasonably necessary to the protection of the newspaper\u2019s integrity were not subject to mandatory bargaining under \u00a7 8 (d) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158 (d) (1976), even though employees violating these regulations were subject to discharge. <em>Newspaper Guild of Greater Philadelphia, Local 10 </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra </em>at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Few institutions depend as heavily on integrity and credibility for the effective performance of their duties as do police departments.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We have little hesitation in concluding that, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>the functions of a police department are disrupted by allegations of criminal conduct by police officers, the police department\u2019s decision to subject officers reasonably suspected of criminal activities to lie detector tests furthers law enforcement objectives that override the employees\u2019 interest in negotiation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To require collective bargaining over a police department\u2019s use of available techniques for investigating substantial allegations of criminal activities by officers \u201cwould be totally subversive of the discipline and efficiency which is indispensable to a public law enforcement agency.\u201d <em>Chief of Police of Dracut </em>v. <em>Dracut, </em>357 Mass. 492, 502 (1970). See <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>76 Misc. 2d 151, 157 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1973) (\u201cthe effective operation of [a police] department requires that suspected misconduct of members of the force be thoroughly investigated\u201d). We therefore conclude that the Legislature did not intend G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, to render the decision to institute such tests contingent on the collective bargaining process.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Further, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, specifically treats the use of lie detectors in the employment context. The Legislature, \u201calthough generally averse to [lie detector] tests forced by employers upon their employees,\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, supra </em>at 327, elected not to place any restrictions on a police department\u2019s testing of its own employees in the course of criminal investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>tions. The link between effective law enforcement and a police department\u2019s ability to subject its employees suspected of criminal activities to lie detector tests is acknowledged by this statutory exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The union argues that the Legislature, in preserving the right of law enforcement agencies engaged in criminal investigations to administer lie detector tests to employees \u201cas may be otherwise permitted,\u201d meant the availability of that right to be determined through collective bargaining. We find no support in the history of \u00a7 19B<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> for this interpretation. In <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, supra, </em>we interpreted the excepting language of \u00a7 19B as permitting an employer to request that an employee submit to a lie detector test administered by a law enforcement agency, \u201cwith implied job sanctions if the employee finally declines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327. We rejected as intent-defeating a construction of the phrase \u201cas may be otherwise permitted\u201d that would require the acquiescence of the employee as a precon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>dition to such testing. <em>Id. </em>at 328. It would likewise be anomalous to construe \u00a7 19B\u2019s excepting language as requiring the acquiescence of the employee\u2019s union.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">We conclude that the commission did not err in determining that the town\u2019s decision to order polygraph testing was within the town\u2019s exclusive managerial prerogative.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\n<em>Decision of the Labor Relations Commission affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b445-16\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 19B, as amended through St. 1973, c. 620, provides as follows: \u201cAny employer who subjects any person employed by him, or any person applying for employment, including any person applying for employment as a police officer, to a lie detector test, or requests, directly or indirectly, any such employee or applicant to take a lie detector test, shall be punished by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars.

Prior to that date, the officers\u2019 attorney entered into an agreement with an assistant attorney general providing that, because the officers intended to exercise their privilege against self-incrimination, they would not be called before the grand jury. On April 1, the officers were asked by the assistant attorney general to waive the agreement; the officers refused to do so and reiterated their intent to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege if called to testify. The officers were not called before the grand jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\"> As we read the record, two of the officers, who were otherwise prepared to submit to polygraph testing, insisted on retaining their rights to bring potential claims against the test administrator, and, because of that insistence, the polygraph examiner refused to administer the examination. The issue whether the selectmen appropriately characterized these events as refusals by the police officers to submit to polygraph testing was not before the commission and is not argued or briefed on appeal. We thus have no occasion to consider whether the two officers\u2019 conduct constituted insubordination or provided just cause for their dismissals. See <em>Wolfberg </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>385 Mass. 390, 391 n.l (1982); Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 919 (1975) (issues not briefed or argued are deemed waived). For the same reason, we do not address the effect of the selectmen\u2019s partial reliance on the officers\u2019 exercise of their constitutional privilege against self-incrimination in connection with the grand jury proceeding on the validity of the dismissals voted by the selectmen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The union does not dispute this conclusion. In <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>379 Mass. 322, 329-330 (1979), we held that the term \u201ccriminal investigations\u201d in the excepting language of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, permits a police department to require polygraph examinations during investigations with \u201can obvious departmental aspect\u201d if there is \u201can alleged crime in the picture\u201d rather than a violation of a department regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b455-6\"> The union argues that the commission inadequately distinguished <em>Medicenter, Mid-South Hosp., </em>221 N.L.R.B. 670 (1975), in which the NLRB held a private employer\u2019s use of polygraph tests to investigate employees suspected of vandalism a mandatory subject of bargaining. <em>Medicenter </em>is distinguishable as involving a private employer, rather than a police department charged with preserving public order and preventing crime. See generally <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Teachers Local 66, </em>378 Mass. 65, 70 (1979) (\u201cIt is by now well recognized that the subjects of public sector collective bargaining are more restricted than those in private sector labor relations\u201d); <em>Newspaper Guild of Greater Philadelphia, Local 10 </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>636 F.2d 550, 560 n.34 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (whether credibility and integrity are fundamental to enterprise may depend on \u201cspecial characteristics\u201d of enterprise). We conclude, therefore, that the commission did not err in electing not to follow <em>Medicenter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">We note that because the excepting language of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, applies only to lie detector tests administered by law enforcement agencies, other employers are prohibited from initiating such testing whether or not they negotiate with the employees affected. Thus, in the factual situation discussed in <em>Medicenter, </em>employees in Massachusetts would be absolutely protected from polygraph testing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b456-6\"> The union asserts that, because the reliability of lie detector tests is disputed, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>376 Mass. 426, 431 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>365 Mass. 421, 429 (1974), and because other means of internal investigation are available, the decision to use polygraphs to investigate alleged crimes by police officers cannot be said to further an overriding governmental interest. We have previously noted that, notwithstanding limitations on the evidential use of polygraph results, polygraph testing furthers \u201cthe legitimate needs of certain criminal investigations.\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>379 Mass. 322, 329 n.11 (1979). <em>See Dolan </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>76 Misc. 2d 151, 157 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1973). Moreover, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, is indicative of \u201ca legislative judgment that the polygraph may be useful as an investigatory aid.\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, supra </em>at 328 n.9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The obligation to bargain under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, inserted by St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7 2, \u201cshall not compel either party to agree to a proposal or make a concession.\u201d Procedures for resolving an impasse between the union and the public employer may be lengthy and inconclusive. See G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 9, as amended through St. 1979, c. 594, \u00a7 1. That result would be unacceptable in matters concerning the integrity of police officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b457-6\"> As originally inserted by St. 1959, c. 255, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, imposed a blanket prohibition on an employer\u2019s use of lie detector tests. In 1963, the statute was amended to permit \u2018 \u2018lie detector tests administered by law enforcement agencies in the performance of their official duties.\u201d St. 1963, c. 797. In 1973, two bills restricting a law enforcement agency\u2019s ability to subject policemen to lie detector examinations were considered by the General Court. The Legislature rejected 1973 Senate Doc. No. 673, which would have eliminated such testing completely by deleting the excepting language and reinstating the blanket prohibition. The Legislature adopted language in 1973 House Doc. No. 7114, prohibiting polygraph testing of persons applying for employment as police officers, but omitted language explicitly including police officers already employed within the scope of the prohibiting language. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lawrence, supra </em>at 326-327 &amp; n.7. The excepting sentence was also amended to sanction \u201clie detector tests administered by law enforcement agencies <em>as may be otherwise permitted in criminal investigations\u201d </em>rather than \u201clie detector tests administered by law enforcement agencies <em>in the performance of their official duties\u201d </em>(emphasis added). G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, as amended by St. 1973, c. 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The union seeks to invoke the collective bargaining process in a context where the subject affects not only the employer-employee relationship, but, in a direct sense, the safety of the public. There is no indication that the Legislature intended the 1973 amendment to subject a law enforcement agency\u2019s use of lie detectors to collective bargaining. Absent a showing that the Legislature intended such an application of G. L. c. 150E, we are not disposed to construe that statute or G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 19B, as placing such an obstacle in the path of efficient law enforcement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\"> We have said that even if a decision is one committed to a public employer\u2019s prerogative, G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, may impose a duty to bargain over the means and impact of the decision. <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>390 Mass. 157, 165 (1983). <em>School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>388 Mass. 557, 564 (1983). In the instant case, however, the union has not briefed or argued that there is a distinction between the \u201cdecision\u201d to require officers suspected of criminal activity to submit to polygraph testing or to face discharge, and the \u201cmeans\u201d or impact of that decision. We perceive none. In any event, the issue is waived. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 919 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
