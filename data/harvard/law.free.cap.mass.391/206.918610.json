(Ruland), on July 2, 1982, Fritz Jean applied for unemployment compensation benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 151A. His claim was allowed and Ruland filed a timely appeal. A hearing was held on August 11, 1982, by a review examiner of the Division of Employment Security (division). The review examiner made findings and relying on G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> reversed the allowance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>benefits. The division\u2019s board of review (board) denied Jean\u2019s application for further review, making the review examiner\u2019s decision the final decision of the board. G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 41 (c). The decision was affirmed by a judge of the Boston Municipal Court. It was reported here under G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42. We remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">We summarize the review examiner\u2019s findings of fact.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Jean was employed by Ruland as a chucking machine operator from August 12, 1981, to July 2, 1982. Ruland alleges that during that period Jean was counseled several times on the use of the chucking machine he operated. According to Ruland, Jean was unreceptive to such direction or to corrective criticism. As a result, Ruland claims, Jean was reprimanded on several occasions for failure to follow instructions and improper operation of the chucking machine. In late June, 1982, Jean\u2019s assigned machine had a break down which was attributable to negligence on the claimant\u2019s part in not checking chuck pressure. Ruland had the machine repaired. After the repairs were completed, Jean was specifically instructed to go through a series of six operations of the chucking machine. He was directed to do these operations manually to assure that the machine was in proper working condition and would not malfunction again. Jean, however, performed only three of the operations manually. The other three were done under power. He then reported that the machine had been checked through the six operations and was in proper working order. Nevertheless, the machine malfunctioned within thirty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>minutes into its production operation. This second malfunction caused Ruland considerable labor and lost production cost. Upon being confronted by his supervisor, Jean admitted to having not followed instructions. He declared, however, that he was not responsible as another employee was operating the machine when it malfunctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The board found as follows: \u201cIt is found from conflicting testimony that the claimant was discharged when after reprimand he again failed to follow instructions resulting in a machine breakdown with costly repairs and lost production. Such discharge is attributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of employing unit interests within the meaning of Section 25 (e) (2) of the Mass. Employment Security Law and it is so found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Jean challenges the board\u2019s findings on two grounds. First, he claims the board\u2019s decision was unsupported by substantial evidence. Second, he argues that the board\u2019s decision was improper because the board failed to make subsidiary findings on the employee\u2019s state of mind. We do not address Jean\u2019s first claim as we agree that the board acted improperly in rendering its decision under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2), without making subsidiary findings of fact regarding Jean\u2019s state of mind. See <em>Reavey </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 913, 914 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">In examining whether the Legislature intended to preclude a discharged employee from the benefits of G. L. c. 151A by the application of \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2), <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 94, 95-96 (1979), we must examine whether a claimant \u201chas brought about his own unemployment through intentional disregard of standards of behavior which his employer has a right to expect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97. This examination is in two parts. Both \u201cdeliberate misconduct\u201d and \u201cwilful disregard\u201d of an employer\u2019s interest by the claimant are required to deny benefits under \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2). <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>387 Mass. 776, 778-779 (1982). <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>375 Mass. 434, 436 (1978). Findings as to both of these issues under \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>(2) must be made to warrant disapproval of benefits. \u201cAn administrative agency must make findings on each factual issue essential to its decision.\u201d <em>Manias </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>388 Mass. 201, 205 (1983), quoting <em>Reavey </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra. </em>We have stated specifically that the \u201ccritical factual issue\u201d in considering whether an employee\u2019s alleged misconduct is in wilful disregard of his employer\u2019s interest is the employee\u2019s state of mind at the time of the misconduct. <em>Torres, supra </em>at 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Here, the board made subsidiary findings that Jean engaged in deliberate misconduct by disobeying explicit instructions to run the machine manually through six operations. The board did not, however, make subsidiary findings regarding Jean\u2019s wilful disregard of his employer\u2019s interest. It made no reference to his state of mind other than that he admitted that he performed only three of the six operations by hand. We repeatedly have stated that a finding of deliberate misconduct alone will not warrant a denial of benefits under \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2). <em>Torres, supra. </em>\u201cIn the absence of any finding on the basic factual issue of the employee\u2019s state of mind, the agency decision cannot stand.\u201d <em>Reavey, supra. </em>While the board found that Jean failed to follow explicit instructions, what this fact implies regarding Jean\u2019s state of mind is far from clear. The board did not \u201ctake into account the worker\u2019s knowledge of the employer\u2019s expectation, the reasonableness of that expectation and the presence of any mitigating factors,\u201d <em>Garfield, supra </em>at 97, as we have instructed. The record of the hearing suggests that Jean\u2019s lack of proficiency in speaking English may have presented a communication problem causing Jean, in good faith, to misunderstand the instructions given to him. Similarly, he may not have understood the consequences of his actions as explained to him. Findings on such factual questions will clarify Jean\u2019s state of mind at the time of the misconduct. The board must make specific findings regarding Jean\u2019s state of mind in not following directions before concluding that the deliberate misconduct in question was in wilful disregard of Ruland\u2019s interest under \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The decision of the Municipal Court judge is reversed.
