L. c. 272, \u00a7 16. Prior to trial, the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the statute under which the crime was charged was so vague and over-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>broad that it deprived him of his constitutional rights under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Relying on <em>Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>306 U.S. 451, 453 (1939), and <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Constr. Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926), the defendant claims that the portion of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, under attack is \u201ca statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application [and thus] violates the first essential of due process of law.\u201d <em>Connally, supra </em>at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">After hearing, a judge of a District Court reported two questions, without decision, to the Appeals Court concerning the constitutionality of the portion of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, penalizing \u2018\u2018open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979). We transferred the report to this court on our own motion. We hold that the challenged portion of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, is not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and that the disparity of the sentencing provisions between open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior, and indecent exposure, does not render the statute with the greater penalty unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">We summarize the agreed facts. At approximately 9:25 P.M., the defendant was sitting in his parked car. Two ten-year-old boys were playing nearby. The defendant called out to one of them, \u2018\u2018You have nice legs,\u201d and then asked what he was doing. When the children approached the defendant\u2019s vehicle, the defendant exposed his penis to the boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">1. <em>Constitutionality ofG. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, as applied. </em>The defendant asserts that the challenged portion of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>does not provide sufficient notice as to what conduct may violate the statute. In making his argument, the defendant looks solely to the words of the statute. However, longstanding judicial interpretation clearly conveys \u201csufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices [so that the challenged portion of the statute is] constitutionally adequate.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>359 Mass. 491, 496-497 (1971). See <em>Ward v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 767, <em>771 </em>(1977); <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>423 U.S. 48, 52-53 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265, 271 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, </em>376 Mass. 533, 538 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We have stated that \u201c [t]he \u2018open and gross lewdness\u2019 provision has been said to be \u2018closely similar\u2019 to the offense of indecent exposure, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Broadland, </em>315 Mass. 20, 22 (1943), and has been applied primarily to indecent exposure in front of, and sexual conduct with, children.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 116 (1980). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265, 271 (1983). In discussing open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior, we have said that the defendant\u2019s act must be committed \u201cin such a way as to produce alarm\u201d or shock. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Warded, </em>128 Mass. 52, 53 (1880). Indecent exposure, on the other hand, only requires \u201can intentional act of lewd exposure, offensive to one or more persons.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Broadland, supra </em>at 21-22, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>273 Mass. 229, 231 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">To convict a defendant of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior, the Commonwealth must prove that the conduct is committed in \u201csuch a way as to produce alarm\u201d or shock. This element of the crime of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior is not required for indecent exposure. Thus, if the Commonwealth were to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201cintentionally, indecently, and offensively expos[ed] himself. . . to [a child] of tender years, without necessity or reasonable excuse, and in such a way as to produce alarm . . . [the defendant would be] guilty of gross lewdness and lascivious behavior.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Warded, </em>128 Mass. 52, 53 (1880). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265 , 271 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>348 Mass. 767 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>2. <em>Overlap of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, and G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 533 </em>The defendant argues that, since G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53 (\u201cindecent exposure\u201d), and G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16 (\u201copen and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior\u201d), could, on the facts of this case, be used to punish identical conduct, the disparity of their sentencing provisions makes them \u201cconstitutionally vague.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since \u00a7 16 requires proof of an element not required for indecent exposure, the defendant\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The defendant also argues that, if two statutes punish the same conduct but impose different penalties, the statute imposing the greater penalty is unconstitutional as a matter of Federal constitutional law. This claim, however, has been rejected by the United States Supreme Court. \u2018 \u2018 [Pjarticular conduct may violate both [statutes but] does not detract from the notice afforded by each. Although the statutes create uncertainty as to which crime may be charged and therefore what penalties may be imposed, they do so to no greater extent than would a single statute authorizing various alternative punishments. So long as overlapping criminal provisions clearly define the conduct prohibited and the punishment authorized, the notice requirements of the Due Process Clause are satisfied.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 123 (1979). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Abraham, </em>627 F.2d 205 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>611 F.2d 113 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 922 (1980). See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>417 Mich. 66 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Karpinski, </em>92 Wis. 2d 599 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Finally, we repeat that \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 [interlocutory matters should be reported only where it appears that they present serious questions likely to be material in the ultimate decision, and that subsequent proceedings in the trial court will be substantially facilitated by so doing.\u2019 <em>John Gilbert Jr. Co. </em>v. <em>C. M. Fauci Co., </em>309 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>271, 273 [1941], <em>Bendslev </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Safety, </em>328 Mass. 443, 445 [1952].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry\u2019s Drywall Co., </em>362 Mass. 552, 557 (1972). It is not clear that the test was met in this case, where the trial will be short, the issues are clear cut, there are ample precedents, and the defendant only agrees to facts for purposes of a report. The better practice is for a judge to decide the issues raised by a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. In the event of conviction, appellate review is available to a defendant. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 27A. If the motion to dismiss is allowed, the Commonwealth has the right to appeal. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a), 378 Mass. 882 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Our answers to the reported questions are:</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">1. General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 16, penalizing \u201copen and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior\u2019 \u2019 is not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">2. The disparity of the sentencing provisions between open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior, and indecent exposure, is not violative of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The case is remanded to the District Court jury-of-six session for trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-15\">The defendant sought a jury trial in the first instance. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\"> \u201c 1. Whether the phrase \u2018open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior\u2019 pursuant to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16 is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad when said language imposes criminal liability upon an individual who is found to have intentionally exposed his penis to ten year old children without necessity or reasonable excuse and in such a way as to produce alarm?</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">\u201c2. Whether \u2018lewd, wanton and lascivious persons in speech or behavior\u2019 or \u2018indecent exposure\u2019 prohibited pursuant to G. L. c. 272 \u00a7 53 constitutes the same conduct which is made criminal to G.L. c. 272 \u00a7 16 and whether Section 16 is thereby rendered unconstitutional by virtue of the disparity in the sentencing provisions of these two sections?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 53, amended through St. 1973, c. 1073, \u00a7 20, sets the punishment at not more than six months\u2019 imprisonment in a house of correction or jail, or a fine of not more than two hundred dollars, or both. General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 16, sets punishment at up to three years in a State prison or two years in a jail, or a fine of not more than three hundred dollars.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The defendant does not make any claim under the State Constitution. Thus we decide these issues solely on the basis of Federal constitutional principles.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
