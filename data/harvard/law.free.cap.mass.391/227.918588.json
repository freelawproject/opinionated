Jadd, a resident of the State of New York, a member of the bar of the State of Florida since 1974, and a member of the bar of the State of New York since 1975, challenges the constitutionality of the requirement of S.J.C. Rule 3:01, \u00a7 6.1.1, as appearing in 382 Mass. 753 (1981), that an attorney seeking admission to the Massachusetts bar on motion must be a resident of the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His principal claim is that the residency requirement violates the privileges and immunities clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>of art. 4 of the Constitution of the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board of Bar Examiners denied Mr. Jadd\u2019s application for admission on motion because he failed to meet the residency requirement of the rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Jadd then filed an application for a hearing before a single justice of this court. She reserved and reported the matter to this court for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We conclude that the residency requirement of rule 3:01, \u00a76.1.1, violates the privileges and immunities clause. Judgment shall be entered that rule 3:01, \u00a7 6.1.1 violates the privileges and immunities clause and that the Board of Bar Examiners shall consider Mr. Jadd\u2019s application for admission to the bar without regard to his place of residency.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The privileges and immunites clause, appearing at art. 4, \u00a7 2, cl. 1, of the Constitution of the United States,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2018\u201cestablishes a norm of comity,\u2019 . . . that is to prevail among the States with respect to their treatment of each other\u2019s residents\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Hicklin </em>v. <em>Orbeck, </em>437 U.S. 518, 523-524 (1978). See <em>Austin </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>420 U.S. 656, 660-663 (1975). That clause does not identify those subjects as to which equality of treatment is required. \u201cOnly with respect to those \u2018privileges\u2019 and \u2018immunities\u2019 bearing upon the vitality of the Nation as a single entity must the State treat all citizens, resident and nonresident, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>equally.\u201d <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Fish &amp; Game Comm\u2019n, </em>436 U.S. 371, 383 (1978). These rights are referred to as \u201cfundamental\u201d under the clause. <em>Id. </em>at 387-388. There are some matters so related to State sovereignty that, even though they are important rights of a resident of a State, discrimination against a nonresident is permitted. See, e.g., <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Blumstein, </em>405 U.S. 330, 343 (1972) (the right to vote in State elections). See also <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Fish &amp; Game Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 383, and cases cited; Note, A Constitutional Analysis of State Bar Residency Requirements Under the Interstate Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, 92 Harv. L. Rev. 1461, 1468-1470 (1979). Some interests or rights do not rise to the level of being fundamental and, accordingly, equality of treatment is not required. See <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Fish &amp; Game Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 388 (discrimination against nonresidents concerning elk hunting for sport upheld). See also <em>Massachusetts Council of Constr.

Where discrimination is challenged, it may be justified if there is a showing that nonresidents are a \u201cpeculiar source\u201d of an \u201cevil\u201d the State is seeking to remedy <em>(Hicklin </em>v. <em>Orbeck, supra </em>at 525-526, quoting <em>Toomer </em>v. <em>Witsell, supra </em>at 398). If the State interest is substantial and some measure of discrimination is permissible, there must be a \u201creasonable relationship between the danger represented by non-citizens, as a class, and the . . . discrimination practiced upon them.\u201d <em>Hicklin </em>v. <em>Orbeck, supra </em>at 526, quoting <em>Toomer </em>v. <em>Witsell, supra </em>at 399. The discrimination must not sweep more broadly than necessary to achieve the purpose that justifies the discrimination. See <em>Hicklin </em>v. <em>Orbeck, supra </em>at 527-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>528; <em>Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, supra </em>at 475-476 &amp; n.17; L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 6-33, at 410 (1978). It has long been held that the clause protects the right to \u201ctravel to another State for purposes of employment free from discriminatory restrictions in favor of state residents imposed by the other State.\u201d <em>Hicklin </em>v. <em>Orbeck, supra </em>at 525, discussing the holding in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 418 (1871).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The Supreme Court of the United States has not yet decided whether the practice of law is a fundamental right protected by the privileges and immunities clause. We anticipate, however, that the Supreme Court would conclude that the practice of law, an important commercial activity, although that of a \u201clearned profession,\u201d is a fundamental right. See <em>Bates </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>433 U.S. 350, 368-372 (1977); <em>Goldfarb </em>v. <em>Virginia State Bar, </em>421 U.S. 773 (1975); <em>In re Griffiths, </em>413 U.S. 717, 723-724 (1973).

We have noted the question but have not had to express our views on the subject. <em>Massachusetts Council of Constr.

We are aware of no case that holds to the contrary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Contests under the privileges and immunities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>clause concerning residency requirements for admission to the bar have not been fought over the \u201cfundamental\u201d right question but rather have largely been fought over the question whether, under the principles set forth in the <em>Hicklin </em>case, the State has a sufficient interest in requiring residency so as to justify the discrimination. We turn to those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Various State courts have found residency requirements for bar admission to be a denial of rights under the privileges and immunities clause. In <em>Matter of Gordon, </em>48 N.Y.2d 266 (1979), the Court of Appeals of New York struck down, on privileges and immunities grounds, requirements that an applicant for admission to the bar by examination have been (1) a New York resident for the six months immediately preceding submission of his application for admission to practice, and (2) a New York resident at the time of his admission.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The New York court\u2019s broad reasoning in condemnation of its residency requirements reaches any residency requirement for bar admission, including admission on motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 272-273. The year after the <em>Gordon </em>decision, the Supreme Court of Alaska reached the same conclusion, on privileges and immunities grounds, in holding invalid a requirement that an application for admission to the bar by examination reside in Alaska for thirty days before the first day on which the bar examination is to be given. <em>Sheley </em>v. <em>Alaska Bar Ass'n, </em>620 P.2d 640, 646 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>(Alaska 1980). Two years later the Supreme Court of Alaska struck down a requirement that an applicant for admission to the bar by examination be domiciled in Alaska on the date of admission. <em>Noll </em>v. <em>Alaska Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>649 P.2d 241 (Alaska 1982). In 1982, the Supreme Court of West Virginia held that a requirement that an applicant for admission by examination be a resident of West Virginia for at least thirty days before taking the bar examination was an unconstitutional denial of privileges and immunities. <em>Sargus </em>v. <em>West Virginia Bd. of Law Examiners, </em>W. Va. (294 S.E.2d 440 [W. Va. 1982]). That court\u2019s analysis seems fully applicable to a simple residency requirement as a condition for admission by examination or on motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">On reasoning similar to that of the opinions of the State courts cited above, Federal District Courts have held that residency requirements for admission to the bar were unconstitutional in New Hampshire <em>(Piper </em>v. <em>Supreme Court, </em>539 F. Supp. 1064 [D.N.H. 1982], aff\u2019d by an equally divided court, 723 F.2d 110 [1st Cir. 1983]), in South Dakota <em>(Stalland </em>v. <em>South Dakota Bd. of Bar Examiners, </em>530 F. Supp. 155 [D.S.D. 1982]),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and in Alabama <em>(Strauss </em>v. <em>Alabama State Bar, </em>520 F. Supp. 173 [N.D. Ala. 1981]). There is no significant contrary authority. The opinion of a Federal District Court in Wisconsin upholding a bar examination residency requirement against a privileges and immunities challenge was vacated. <em>Canfield </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Bd. of Attorneys Professional Competence, </em>490 F. Supp. 1286, 1290-1291 (W.D. Wis. 1980), vacated as moot, 645 F.2d 76 (7th Cir. 1981).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Another opinion expressing the conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>sion that a Maryland residency requirement for bar admission on examination met privileges and immunities standards has also been vacated. See <em>Golden </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Law Examiners, </em>452 F. Supp. 1082 (D. Md. 1978), vacated as moot, 614 F.2d 943 (4th Cir. 1980).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Various arguments in support of a residency requirement for admission to the bar on examination have been rejected as not meeting the two-pronged test set forth in the <em>Hicklin </em>case. In the cases, there has been no showing that nonresidents are \u201cpeculiar sources\u201d of attorney incompetence or that a residency requirement is substantially related to the solution of any problem, in the sense that less discriminatory means could not be adopted. <em>Hicklin </em>v. <em>Orbeck, supra </em>at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">It is not apparent that residency is a measure of familiarity with local practice or of the willingness of an attorney to learn local procedure. See <em>Stalland </em>v. <em>South Dakota Bd. of Bar Examiners, supra </em>at 159-160; <em>Sargus </em>v. <em>West Virginia Bd. of Law Examiners, supra </em>at <em>(supra </em>at 445). Massachusetts does not require residency for admission by examination, nor does it require attorneys once admitted to continue to be Massachusetts residents as a condition of continuing bar membership. If there were a basis for the conclusion that nonresident attorneys are not conversant with Massachusetts practice, a requirement of an examination on local practice for those seeking admission on motion might be adopted as less discriminatory than a residency requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">We are aware of no problem in the service of process on nonresident members of the Massachusetts bar or in obtaining jurisdiction over them for bar discipline purposes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>there were any problem, we could adopt a court rule requiring that a nonresident attorney appoint the clerk of this court as an agent for the service of process. The asserted problem of obtaining jurisdiction over nonresident attorneys has been rejected as an adequate justification for discrimination based on residency in bar admissions. See <em>Stalland </em>v. <em>South Dakota Bd. of Bar Examiners, supra </em>at 160-161; <em>Noll </em>v. <em>Alaska Bar Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 245-246; <em>Matter of Sackman, </em>90 N.J. 521, 528-530 nn. 6 &amp; 7, 533-534 (1982); <em>Matter of Gordon, supra </em>at 274; <em>Sargus </em>v. <em>West Virginia Bd. of Law Examiners, supra </em>at <em>(supra </em>at 445).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">There is a possibility that a nonresident attorney may not be able to respond to reasonable demands for court appearances. There is, however, no showing that nonresident attorneys have been a source of any problem that does not arise in connection with resident attorneys living and practicing in the Commonwealth. The requirement of residence on admission, unaccompanied by any requirement of continued residence or any requirement of association with local counsel in litigated matters, does not significantly improve accessibility and thus seems unlikely to be an acceptable basis for our residence-based discrimination under the <em>Hicklin </em>test, even if there is a problem in the handling of litigated matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The claim that residency is required in order to investigate the background of the applicant is not persuasive. We have no residency requirement for applicants admitted by examination. To be sure, the investigation of those who have practiced elsewhere, and seek admission on motion, presents a different kind of problem. But we have no showing that the problem is significantly eased when the applicant for admission on motion has lived in Massachusetts, as is usually the case, for only several months, if that long. The necessity for investigation at the place where the applicant has practiced law is not altered simply because he has moved to Massachusetts. If the problems of investigation are greater as to a nonresident, the solution might be to impose a higher fee for the investigation and admission of a nonresi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>dent applicant. In any event, residency is not essential for conducting personal interviews. Courts have rejected administrative convenience as adequate, for privileges and immunities purposes, to justify a residency requirement for bar admission. See <em>Strauss </em>v. <em>Alabama State Bar, </em>520 F. Supp. 173, 178-179 (N.D. Ala. 1981); <em>Sheley </em>v. <em>Alaska Bar Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 645-646; <em>Matter of Gordon, supra </em>at 274; <em>Sargus </em>v. <em>West Virginia Bd. of Law Examiners, supra </em>at <em>(supra </em>at 445-446).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The question remains whether there is any significant difference between residency requirements for admission by examination which, since the <em>Hicklin </em>decision, have been consistently struck down on privileges and immunities grounds, and a residency requirement for admission to the bar on motion. The reported cases have not dealt with this subject, although the reasoning of certain opinions cited earlier in this opinion suggests that any residency requirement in the bar admissions area is unconstitutional. Does the fact that an attorney admitted on motion need not take and pass our State\u2019s bar examination make a difference in an analysis of the validity of a residency requirement? We think it does not. It is true that, in response to the argument that a nonresident who seeks admission lacks familiarity with local law, some courts in considering admission by examination have pointed to the fact that the nonresident must pass a bar examination which tests familiarity with State law. See, e.g., <em>Stalland </em>v. <em>South Dakota Bd. of Bar Examiners, supra </em>at 159; <em>Noll </em>v. <em>Alaska Bar Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 244; <em>Sargus </em>v. <em>West Virginia Bd. of Law Examiners, supra </em>at <em>(supra </em>at 445). Here, as to Mr. Jadd, there would be no such testing. But we do not require testing as to residents seeking admission on motion. If we are willing to admit a qualified person on motion if he or she moves to Massachusetts, we have already concluded that passing a bar examination is not an essential means in assessing his or her knowledge of local law or any other qualification for admission to the bar. Thus, the discrimination among persons seeking admission on motion is based solely on residence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>We conclude that the right of a nonresident attorney to equal treatment with resident attorneys does not become less than fundamental or the discrimination justified, in a privileges and immunities sense, because Massachusetts affords him the option to remain a nonresident and achieve admission to the bar by examination. See 53 Miss. L.J., <em>supra </em>at 39 n. 131 (\u201cIt is unlikely that this distinction between admission by examination and admission by reciprocity has constitutional significance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">A judgment shall be entered that S.J.C. Rule 3:01, \u00a7 6.1.1., violates the privileges and immunities clause of the Constitution of the United States and that the Board of Bar Examiners shall consider Mr. Jadd\u2019s application for admission to the bar without regard to his place of residency.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-14\"> Subsections 6.1 and 6.1.1 provide: \u201c6.1 Attorneys Admitted in Other States.

The trial judge held that a residency requirement for admission to the bar of New Hampshire of an out-of-State resident who had passed a New Hampshire bar examination was unconstitutional in violation of the privileges and immunities clause. On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, the judgment was reversed by a two-to-one vote. <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Supreme Court, </em>708 F.2d 825 (1st Cir. 1983). A petition for a hearing en banc was granted. The court vacated the panel\u2019s judgment and withdrew the panel opinion. <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Supreme Court, </em>723 F.2d 110 (1st Cir. 1983). The court then divided evenly two to two, with the result that the decision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the District Court was affirmed by an equally divided vote. <em>Id. </em>Judge Bownes, joined by Judge Coffin, voted to affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment, based on reasoning that is consistent with views we express in this opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 118 (Bownes, J., with whom Coffin, J., joined). Chief Judge Campbell, joined by Judge Breyer, concluded \u201cthat principles of federalism require giving greater weight than did the district court to the right of each state court to set bar standards, including bar residency standards.\u201d <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Supreme Court, supra </em>at 118 (Campbell, C.J., with whom Breyer, J., joined).

Of course, the traditional right to regulate the admission of attorneys may not be exercised in a way that infringes on the constitutional rights of bar applicants.

Supp. 1064, 1067-1071 (D.N.H. 1982), aff\u2019d by an equally divided court, 723 F.2d 110 (1st Cir. 1983); <em>Stalland v. South Dakota Bd. of Bar Examiners, supra </em>at 161-162; <em>Noll </em>v. <em>Alaska Bar Ass'n, supra </em>at 246 n. 17; <em>Sargus </em>v. <em>West Virginia Bd. of Law Examiners, supra </em>at <em>(supra </em>at 446).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b250-9\"> The District Court opinion, issued less than three months before <em>Hicklin </em>v. <em>Orbeck, </em>437 U.S. 518 (1978), was decided, erroneously asserts that the attorney\u2019s privileges and immunities rights were at best no greater than his rights under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>Golden </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Law Examiners, supra </em>at 1094.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b250-10\"> Information provided to this court by the Board of Bar Overseers shows that there were approximately 5,000 nonresident members of the Massachusetts bar during 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\"> Concurrently with the release of this opinion, we shall eliminate the requirement of S.J.C. Rule 3:01, \u00a76.1.1, that an applicant for admission on motion have his or her principal residence in the Commonwealth. In cooperation with the Board of Bar Examiners and other interested parties, we shall consider the possibility of replacing \u00a7 6.1.1 of rule 3:01 with a new provision requiring that applicants for admission to the bar on motion pass a limited examination on Massachusetts practice and procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
