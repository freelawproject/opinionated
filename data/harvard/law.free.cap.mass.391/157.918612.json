L. c. 43, \u00a7 28, which prohibit the award of certain contracts by a city without competitive bids. The conspiracy was alleged in the indictments to have taken place between April, 1974, and August, 1979. Sentences were imposed. The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>ants appealed. Execution of the sentences was stayed pending appeal. The defendants also appealed from the denial of several posttrial motions. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We hold that denial of the defendants\u2019 motions for required findings of not guilty, presented at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence, was error, and we reverse the convictions. The basis of our holding is that the contracts at issue were not subject to the competitive bidding requirements of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 28. In view of our holding it is unnecessary for us to consider numerous other issues presented by these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">General Laws c. 43, \u00a7 28, as amended through St. 1974, c. 199, \u00a7 2, in effect throughout the periods relevant to these indictments, provided that \u201c[n]o contract for construction work or for the purchase of equipment, supplies or materials, whether for repairs or original construction, the estimated cost of which amounts to two thousand dollars or more . . . shall be awarded unless [certain bidding procedures are followed] .... No bill or contract shall be split or divided for the purpose of evading any provision of this chapter.\u201d The jury could have found the following facts from the evidence most favorable to the Commonwealth. The defendant Brown was superintendent of public buildings for the city of Taunton during the period of the alleged conspiracy. The other defendants, as well as Frederick Randall and Richard Grassley,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were roofers. Between April, 1974, and December, 1977, Brown awarded the defendant Nardozza at least fifty contracts to repair and resurface existing roofs of four Taunton public schools. There were no competitive bidding procedures. The work was done by Nardozza and Nardozza was paid for it, but the city\u2019s records showed that the contracts were awarded, and payments were made, to Randall, Grassley, and the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>ant Geraghty. The amount invoiced for each job was under $2,000, and in almost every instance it was almost that much. Charges for equipment, supplies or materials were included in only four invoices and they totalled $653.50. From this evidence and from evidence of the nature of the work performed pursuant to the several contracts, the jury could have found that the defendants conspired to divide the roofing projects into small units in order to evade bidding requirements that they either thought had been imposed, or thought might have been imposed by G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">However, it was not enough for the Commonwealth to show that the defendants attempted to evade bidding procedures that they <em>thought </em>were required by G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 28. The burden was on the Commonwealth to prove that the defendants combined for a purpose, or contemplated the use of a method, that was <em>actually </em>prohibited by G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 28. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bessette (No. 1), </em>351 Mass. 148, 153-154 (1966); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bessette (No. 2), </em>351 Mass. 157, 162 (1966). The Commonwealth, therefore, was required to prove that the contracts that were awarded were for \u201cconstruction work or for the purchase of equipment, supplies or materials, whether for repairs or original construction, the estimated cost of which [amounted] to two thousand dollars or more\u201d within the meaning of that language in the statute. There was no evidence that the contemplated contracts would provide for equipment, supplies, or materials, the total estimated cost of which was $2,000 or more, to be furnished to the city. This case, therefore, is unlike <em>Datatrol, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Purchasing Agent, </em>379 Mass. 679, 696 &amp; n.14 (1980), in which we held that a contract for personal services was subject to the bidding requirements of G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 22, because it was incident to a procurement of equipment for which bidding was required. We are confronted with the limited question whether \u201cconstruction work,\u201d not defined in the statute, includes the repair and resurfacing of roofs on existing buildings. In answering that question, we are guided by the principle that criminal statutes must be strictly construed. <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>387 Mass. 567, 569 (1982). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>366 Mass. 132, 137 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">If the Legislature intended the statutory phrase \u201cwhether for repairs or original construction\u201d to refer to contracts for construction work as well as to contracts for the purchase of equipment, supplies, or materials, it would necessarily follow that the Legislature meant \u201cconstruction work\u201d to include repairs. However, if the phrase refers only to contracts for the purchase of equipment, supplies, or materials, it sheds no light on the meaning of \u201cconstruction work\u201d and we must look elsewhere for assistance in construing that term. We conclude that the modifying phrase refers only to contracts for the purchase of equipment, supplies, or materials. In doing so, we rely not only on the rule of strict construction of criminal statutes, but also on \u201cthe general rule of statutory as well as grammatical construction that a modifying clause is confined to the last antecedent unless there is something in the subject matter or dominant purpose which requires a different interpretation.\u201d <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Brookline Rent Control Bd., </em>385 Mass. 228, 230-231 (1982), quoting <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>287 Mass. 542, 547 (1934). <em>Druzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haverhill, </em>324 Mass. 129, 133 (1949). We are not satisfied that the subject matter or dominant purpose of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 28, requires that the modifying clause not be confined to the last antecedent in keeping with the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The Commonwealth argues that the statute\u2019s clear purpose requires that \u201cconstruction work\u201d be construed to include roof repair and resurfacing. The argument is that G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 28, is but one of many competitive bidding statutes, all of which must be interpreted harmoniously to further a common purpose: establishing fair competition and obtaining the lowest available prices from responsible bidders for public projects. See <em>Interstate Eng\u2019g Corp. </em>v. <em>Fitchburg, </em>367 Mass. 751, 757-758 (1975). The Commonwealth observes that competitive bidding on contracts for the repair of public buildings is no less relevant to these objectives than competitive bidding on original construction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Our attention is directed to several statutes, all of which were enacted substantially later than 1915, the year that G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 28, was enacted. See St. 1915, c. 267, \u00a7 28. For instance, G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 8A, as appearing in St. 1980, c. 579, \u00a7 52, requires competitive bidding on contracts with the Commonwealth <em>for the construction, reconstruction, alterations, repair or development </em>at public expense of any building, road, bridge or other physical property if the amount involved therein is one thousand dollars or over\u201d (emphasis added). The emphasized language has been part of \u00a7 8A since its enactment in 1939. See St. 1939, c. 427. General Laws c. 30, \u00a7 39M <em>(a), </em>as amended through St. 1977, c. 970, \u00a7 1, provides: \u201cEvery contract for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling or repair of any public work, or for the purchase of any material. . . by the commonwealth, or political subdivision thereof, or by any county, city, town, district, or housing authority, and estimated by the awarding authority to cost more than five thousand dollars in the case of the commonwealth, or political subdivision thereof, and more than two thousand dollars in the case of any other such awarding authority, shall be awarded [only pursuant to specified bidding procedures].\u201d General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 44A, as amended by St. 1967, c. 899, required bidding on certain contracts \u201cfor the construction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling, repair or demolition of any public building.\u201d General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 44A, as appearing in St. 1980, c. 579, \u00a7 55, requires competitive bidding on \u201c[e]very contract for the construction, reconstruction, installation, demolition, maintenance or repair of any building by a public agency estimated to cost more than five thousand dollars.\u201d The Commonwealth reasons that these statutes, focusing on reconstruction, alteration, repair, remodeling, and the like, in addition to construction, manifest a legislative policy to require competitive bidding on public contracts for a broad range of activities which includes the repair and resurfacing of roofs of public schools. The Commonwealth concludes that the term \u201cconstruction work\u201d in G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 28, must be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>strued to include roof repairs and resurfacing in order to effectuate that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">We do not agree that the intent of the Legislature in 1915, in enacting G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 28, is revealed by statutes enacted many years later when the range of legislative concern may well have expanded to include contracts that were not the concern of the earlier Legislature. If the more recent statutes, relied on by the Commonwealth, are indicative of anything relevant to our inquiry, it is that the meaning of the terms \u201cconstruction\u201d and \u201cconstruction work\u201d is imprecise, and that a Legislature may give those terms a narrow meaning that excludes repairs and roof resurfacing. Since a statute should be interpreted so as to give meaning to all the words when possible, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood\u2019s Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>352 Mass. 617, 618 (1967), the word \u201cconstruction\u201d in the later statutes must be construed not to include such words as \u201creconstruction,\u201d \u201calteration,\u201d \u201crepair,\u201d or \u201cremodeling.\u201d These words would be superfluous if they were included within the meaning of \u201cconstruction\u201d in those statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s best argument may be that if the word \u201cconstruction\u201d in G. L. c. 43, \u00a7 28, is interpreted to mean only original construction work, the word \u201coriginal\u201d in the phrase \u201cwhether for repairs or original construction\u201d becomes superfluous. This, the Commonwealth contends, suggests that the word \u201cconstruction\u201d was intended to be construed broadly. The difficulty with the Commonwealth\u2019s position is that \u201c[i]t is a fundamental tenet of due process that \u2018[n]o one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes.\u2019\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 123 (1979), quoting <em>Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>306 U.S. 451, 453 (1939). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, supra </em>at 569. Even though resort to a rule in aid of statutory construction may give some support to an interpretation of the term \u201cconstruction work\u201d that is broader than \u201coriginal construction,\u201d the statute does not give clear warning that it applies to the repair and resurfacing of roofs on existing buildings. Dic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>tionary definitions confirm this conclusion. Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary at 489 (1961) defines \u201cconstruction\u201d as \u201cthe act of putting parts together to form a complete integrated object: [synonymous with] fabrication.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary at 283 (5th ed. 1979) states that \u201cconstruction\u201d means \u201c[t]he creation of something new, as distinguished from the repair or improvement of something already existing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Throughout the period covered by the indictments, G.
