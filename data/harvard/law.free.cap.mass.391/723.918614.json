See art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; U.S. Const, amend. V; G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20E.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The single justice heard argument from counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>for both parties, and reserved and reported the matter to the full bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The Commonwealth contends that the single justice had the power to grant immunity pursuant to \u00a7 20E, since the witness had claimed his privilege against self-incrimination and refused to testify before a grand jury proceeding. Alternatively, the Commonwealth claims that the single justice should have granted the immunity under the court\u2019s constitutional and statutory superintendency authority. See G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. Finally, the Commonwealth asserts that the witness should be compelled to testify without a grant of immunity since he waived his Fifth Amendment privilege by answering questions about the same matter before a different grand jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AvK\">The witness contends that the Commonwealth has not followed the statutory procedure for obtaining a grant of immunity and, instead, has abused the grand jury process by requiring the witness to appear before a grand jury for the sole purpose of obtaining testimony in a forthcoming murder trial of another person. Therefore, the witness asserts that immunity should not be granted in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that the Commonwealth has not adhered to the prescribed procedure for seeking immunity and seeks improperly to utilize the grand jury process in an attempt to immunize the witness. Furthermore, we conclude that the question whether the witness has waived his Fifth Amendment privilege by testifying at a previous grand jury proceeding is a matter best left to the determination of a trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The parties have stipulated to the following relevant facts. In September, 1981, the body of a young woman brutally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>murdered was found in a stream in Brockton. Laboratory analysis showed the presence of semen in her mouth. Suspicion focused on both Richard A. Palaza (the witness) and Jeffrey R. Jones (the defendant). The victim was last seen alive in their company.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Testifying before a Plymouth County grand jury investigating possible charges in connection with the woman\u2019s death, the defendant and the witness accused each other of committing the murder then alleged. Both men were indicted for aggravated rape and murder. The Commonwealth elected to prosecute the witness first, believing the government\u2019s case against him to be stronger. Although he was required to appear and to submit to examination at the witness\u2019s trial, the defendant refused to testify. The Commonwealth failed to take any action to compel his testimony. Subsequently, the jury acquitted the witness of all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Almost immediately following the verdict, the witness received a summons ordering him to appear and to testify at the trial of the defendant. The witness advised the Commonwealth that, if called to testify, he would assert his privilege not to incriminate himself. Subsequently, the witness was summoned to testify again before a Plymouth County grand jury. As the Commonwealth concedes, this grand jury was not involved in an ongoing investigation into the victim\u2019s death. The purpose of summoning the witness was to determine whether he actually would assert the privilege and would refuse to testify concerning the defendant\u2019s involvement in the victim\u2019s death. Should the witness assert the privilege, the Commonwealth indicated that it would seek an immunity order for the witness. After attempting unsuccessfully to quash the summons, the witness appeared before the grand jury and asserted the privilege with respect to all questions except those asking for his name and address. The Commonwealth subsequently filed this application for immunity under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20E, and alternatively sought the same relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">We have stated that \u201ca witness called to testify before a grand jury may be granted immunity from prosecution only in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>the manner prescribed by statute.\u201d <em>Grand Jurors for Middlesex County for the Year 1974 </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>369 Mass. 876, 879 (1976). \u201c[T]he statutes provide that immunity may be granted thereunder only in proceedings or investigations concerned with certain specified crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20E, inserted by St. 1970, c. 408, provides that a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court may grant the Commonwealth\u2019s application for immunity \u201cif, after a hearing, ... the justice finds that the witness did validly refuse to answer questions ... on the grounds that such testimony . . . might tend to incriminate him <em>and that the investigation or proceeding before the grand jury </em>involves an offense listed in section twenty D . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied). General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 20D, prescribes that a witness called to testify before a grand jury may be granted immunity in any proceeding or investigation involving certain, enumerated crimes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s method of seeking immunity clearly does not comport with these statutory procedures. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 20D and 20E. As the Commonwealth conceded, the grand jury, which was convened soon after the witness\u2019s acquittal, was not involved in any continuing investigation concerning the victim\u2019s death. The Commonwealth never claimed that this grand jury was investigating any other crimes which would entitle the district attorney to seek immunity for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>witness under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20D.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commonwealth admitted that the sole purpose of the summons was to determine whether the witness would assert his Fifth Amendment privilege and would refuse to testify concerning the victim\u2019s death. In short, it appears that the witness was brought before the grand jury solely to obtain an order of immunity and thus obtain his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The Commonwealth cannot prevail on its contention that an exception to the statutory immunity procedures should lie where the Commonwealth\u2019s objective in seeking grand jury testimony is to determine whether a crucial witness intends to claim the Fifth Amendment privilege and, therefore, whether a grant of immunity must be sought to compel his testimony. To sanction such an exception not only would invalidate the rule that the statutory procedures for obtaining immunity should be followed, but also would tolerate an abuse of the grand jury process. We have stated that \u201cit is improper to use [a] grand jury for the purpose of preparing an already pending indictment for trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Liebman, </em>379 Mass. 671, 677 (1980).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>455 F.2d 1270, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>1273 (1st Cir. 1972); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>455 F.2d 1101, 1105 (2d Cir. 1972).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That is precisely what the Commonwealth argues it should be allowed to do in this case. It has candidly agreed that \u201cthe Grand Jury was not involved in an ongoing investigation into the death of [the victim],\u201d and that the \u201cpurpose of the summons for [the witness] was ... to seek an order of immunity.\u201d Such a procedure is not within the scope of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 20C-20I.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">We do not reach the question whether this court has the power to grant immunity under the authority granted by G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, or as part of its inherent powers. Assuming, without deciding, that such power exists, we conclude that there exists no \u201csubstantial claim of [a] violation of . . . substantive rights and irremediable error\u201d so as to entitle the Commonwealth to extraordinary relief. <em>Schipani </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>382 Mass. 685, 685 (1980), quoting <em>Morrissette </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>380 Mass. 197, 198 (1980).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>We do not decide, as the Commonwealth requests, whether the witness waived his privilege against self-incrimination by testifying previously before a different grand jury which returned indictments against the defendant. The issue of waiver is more properly to be decided by a trial judge should the witness be called to testify and should the witness assert the claim of the privilege in response to specific questions. Cf. <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 486-487 (1951) (witness called to testify may invoke Fifth Amendment privilege based on trial judge\u2019s finding that response to specific question might tend to incriminate witness); <em>Silverio </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the City of Boston, </em>355 Mass. 623, 630 (police officer could not justify, based on Fifth Amendment privilege, refusal to answer superior\u2019s inquiry whether officer had claimed privilege before grand jury), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 878 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">This matter is to be remanded to the single justice, who is to enter an order denying the Commonwealth\u2019s application for immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-15\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-16\">Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides in relevant part: \u201cNo subject shall be . . . compelled to . . . furnish evidence against himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-17\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 20E, inserted by St. 1970, c. 408, provides in relevant part: \u201cA justice of the supreme judicial court may, upon application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>of ... a district attorney, issue an order granting immunity to a witness . . . [who] did validly refuse to answer questions ... on the grounds that such testimony . . . might tend to incriminate him . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20E, a single justice must make several findings, including whether the witness \u201cdid validly refuse to answer questions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b740-9\"> The witness also claims that there is no power in this court to grant immunity pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and, even if an immunity order could be issued under that statute, this matter does not present an appropriate case for the exercise of this court\u2019s superintendency powers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b742-6\"> We also note that in G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20C, inserted by St. 1970, c. 408, the language emphasized in the text reappears, as follows: <em>\u201cIn any investigation or proceeding before a grand jury </em>involving any offense listed in section twenty D, a witness shall not be excused from testifying ... if he has been granted immunity ... by a justice of the supreme judicial court, as provided in section twenty E\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Some of the crimes which can form the basis of the grand jury\u2019s investigation and enable the Commonwealth to seek an immunity order include \u201carson, . . . assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, . . . breaking and entering a dwelling house or a building, bribery,. . . burglary, counterfeiting, . . . kidnapping, larceny, . . . mayhem, murder, . . . being an accessory to any of the foregoing offenses and conspiracy or attempt or solicitation to commit any of the foregoing offenses.\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20D, inserted by St. 1970, c. 408.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b743-6\"> The Commonwealth has merely asserted, in its brief, that the witness has refused to testify, based on his fear that his testimony will subject him to prosecution. Whether the witness will actually claim the privilege against self-incrimination if called to testify is not yet established.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b743-7\"> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Liebman, supra, </em>although we intimated that the grand jury may have been used improperly to subpoena documents later introduced as evidence at trial, we held that no prejudice to the defendant ensued since the documents were readily available by trial subpoenas, and the defendant was made aware of this fact well in advance of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">In a case inapposite on its facts to the present matter, we addressed the propriety of a single justice\u2019s grant of immunity. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>369 Mass. 943, 948, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 833 (1976). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, supra, </em>the district attorney applied for, and received, a grant of immunity after a witness claimed the privilege against self-incrimination before a grand jury which had already indicted the defendant for receiving stolen property. We decided that the facts did not support the defendant\u2019s claim that the grand jury was a pretext to obtain immunity for the witness in an attempt to ensure his cooperation with the prosecution. The witness had not testified previously before this grand jury. <em>Id. </em>at 948. Moreover, he had supplied the police on another occasion with relevant information concerning the defendant\u2019s unlawful ventures. <em>Id. </em>at 946. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Thus, it was logical for the Commonwealth to seek the witness\u2019s assistance before a grand jury which was investigating other possible indictments against the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 948-949.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Unlike the present matter, the <em>Donahue </em>case involved a grand jury properly being utilized to consider the return of indictments. Here, the Commonwealth has conceded that the grand jury was used merely to determine whether the witness would assert his privilege and refuse to answer questions concerning the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b744-12\"> The government certainly may obtain advantages incidental to a grand jury proceeding which serves a legitimate, investigative purpose. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Doe, supra </em>at 1274-1275; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beasley, </em>550 F.2d 261, 267 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 938 (1977). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, supra </em>at 948-949 (single justice properly granted immunity to witness who claimed Fifth Amendment privilege before grand jury investigating other criminal activities of defendant).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b744-13\"> In this case, the Commonwealth seeks evidence that will aid in the prosecution of the defendant in his upcoming trial. Thus, the Commonwealth cannot rely on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hennigan, </em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. for Suffolk County, No. 79-439 Civil, October 22, 1979), wherein a single justice of this court decided that the court has the inherent authority, under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, to immunize a witness so as to ensure that a defendant receives his right to a fair trial. In <em>Hennigan, </em>the single justice decided that where the prosecution had immunized its witnesses, and no immunity comparable in scope was granted the defendant\u2019s witnesses, and where the defendant, the prosecutor, and the trial judge all favored an immunity order, due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>considerations required the invocation of our superintendency power to ensure equal treatment in the dispensation of immunity. Compare <em>Schipani </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 686 (affirming single justice\u2019s refusal to grant immunity under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, where record failed to disclose identity of \u201cJohn Doe\u201d witness, validity of claim of privilege, or inability of defendant to receive fair trial if immunity not granted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
