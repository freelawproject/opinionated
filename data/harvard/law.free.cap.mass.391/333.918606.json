Ins. Co., </em>384 Mass. 659, 673 (1981) <em>(Gram I), </em>we remanded \u201cthe case for a determination of damages, measured by the amount of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>newal commissions Gram reasonably could have expected to receive, reduced to reflect the proportion of his time that would reasonably have been expected to have been devoted to the servicing of those renewal policies.\u201d We noted that \u201cGram has made no specific showing of his loss of any other identifiable, future benefit . . . reflective of past services to Liberty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We expressly stated that \u201c[t]he amount of the renewal commissions substantially proves the outer limit of the compensation Gram lost for past service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 672 n.10. We pointed out that \u201cLiberty benefited from its discharge of Gram without cause\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 672) and that the failure to prove that Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty) discharged Gram in bad faith did not relieve Liberty of liability \u201cfor the loss of compensation that is so clearly related to an employee\u2019s past service\u201d <em>(id.) </em>as are renewal commissions. On remand, a jury rendered a verdict in the amount of $325,000 in favor of Gram. Liberty appealed, and we granted Gram\u2019s application for direct appellate review. The jury\u2019s verdict must be vacated and a new trial must be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In spite of the direction that damages be measured, in their \u201couter limit,\u201d by renewal commissions, the remand judge improperly submitted to the jury the question of Gram\u2019s right to career credits \u2014 future compensation for future services that, under his compensation agreement, was based on the length of Gram\u2019s service as a sales representative. As a matter of law, career credits are not \u201crenewal commissions.\u201d They compensate for future, not past, services, and are thus not recoverable in these circumstances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Kravetz </em>v. <em>Merchants Distribs., Inc., </em>387 Mass. 457, 463 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">It is important to recall that Gram served as an employee at will. He is not entitled to damages on the basis of a breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>of a contract for life or for a term of years. The recovery allowed Gram in our earlier opinion pressed to the limit the recovery allowed to an at-will employee discharged without cause. Two members of the court even rejected Gram\u2019s limited right to damages expressed in the court\u2019s earlier opinion. See <em>Gram I, supra </em>at 674 (Nolan, J., dissenting in part, concurring in part, with whom Lynch, J., joined). We must be careful not to approach the allowance of contract damages as if Gram had a contract for life or for a term of years. Our goal is and has been simply to deny to Liberty any readily definable, financial windfall resulting from the denial to Gram of compensation for past services.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Liberty argues that on termination Gram was limited by his compensation agreement to certain final adjustments and no more. In its appeal in <em>Gram I, </em>Liberty did not rely on limitations expressed in Gram\u2019s compensation agreement. That agreement was not printed in the record appendix in <em>Gram l, </em>and we did not consider it. It is too late for Liberty to argue now that Gram\u2019s rights were limited by the terms of his compensation agreement. We need not, therefore, consider the terms of the agreement, or whether, by agreement, an employer and an employee may restrict the rights of an at-will employee to compensation based on the windfall to an employer who, by discharging the employee without good cause, deprives the employee of clearly identifiable future compensation reflective of the employee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>past services.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There was no error in denying Liberty\u2019s motion for a directed verdict or its motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The judge also permitted the jury to consider future commissions expected to result from endorsements on policies procured by Gram. In <em>Gram l, </em>we did not discuss the question of the effect of endorsements on Gram\u2019s lost commissions. Such endorsements result from changes in the policy coverage because of changes in the policyholder\u2019s circumstances, such as the purchase of a less expensive motor vehicle or making improvements in, or an addition to, a building. Changes by endorsement might increase or decrease the premium owed by the policyholder. The question of Gram\u2019s right to credit for anticipated policy endorsements will arise at any retrial of this case and, therefore, we discuss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Although the question is not free from doubt, we conclude that commissions on future endorsements and the consequences of any anticipated future inflation should not be included in the measure of Gram\u2019s damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Future policy changes and future premium levels are speculative. We think that Gram\u2019s damages should be measured by the amount of annual renewal commissions payable under his compensation agreement in effect at the time of his discharge, recognizing the renewal of coverage but disregarding the effect of endorsements. Attrition in the block of business produced by Gram should be determined for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>future year of his anticipated employment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and anticipated future renewal commissions should be adjusted to present value. The calculation of Gram\u2019s damages should also reflect the proportion of Gram\u2019s time that would have been devoted to servicing renewal policies, but, because we exclude the effects of endorsements in measuring the renewal commissions recoverable, the portion of Gram\u2019s time reasonably expected to be devoted to servicing renewals should not include time devoted to handling endorsements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">We reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\"> The applicable compensation plan provided for \u201ca basic Career Credit\u201d of $7,500 a year for each person who had more than ten years of direct sales or sales management experience with Liberty. The amount paid as a basic career credit was wholly unrelated to the volume of business previously produced by the employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\"> In Justice Nolan\u2019s dissent on the question of awarding damages to Gram, he said <em>(supra </em>at 674): \u201cThe court has restructured an at-will employment agreement to reflect an imposed condition never heretofore recognized by this court and one of doubtful legitimacy.\u201d In dissenting to this opinion, Justice Nolan appears to have abandoned his previous position. If, as he thought, the earlier opinion improperly permitted \u201c[t]he trier of fact to engage in extravagant speculation,\u201d <em>Gram I, supra </em>at 675, it would seem that now is the time to eliminate such speculation, not to endorse it.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The basic difference between the view of the court and the dissent of Justice Liacos lies in the court\u2019s determination that the words \u201crenewal commissions\u201d have a legal meaning and do not offer a question\u00bb of fact for interpretation by the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\"> The remand judge permitted Liberty, over objection, to argue to the jury that Gram\u2019s employment agreement limited his damages. That was more than Liberty was entitled to.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\"> The words \u201crenewal commissions,\u201d which we used in <em>Gram. I, supra, </em>strictly deal only with the renewal of business covering the same risks on the same terms and conditions. See 4 G.J. Couch, Insurance \u00a7 26:400, at 372-373 (2d ed. 1960 &amp; Supp. 1982), citing <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>American Bonding Co., </em>200 A.D. 452, 457 (N.Y. 1922), modified on other grounds, 235 N.Y. 533 (1923) (\u201c[I]t makes no difference whether the bond was renewed by a renewal certificate or by giving a new bond, providing the terms and conditions thereof were the same\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b353-9\"> The actual attrition in the business produced by Gram may be ascertainable for the years since his termination and estimates can be made of anticipated future attrition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b353-10\"> We have considered Liberty\u2019s other claims of error and find them to be without merit. These claims involved matters within the discretion of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">Liberty made no claim that the measure of Gram\u2019s future renewal commissions should reflect his life and work expectancy. For the purposes of any retrial, we think Liberty should be held to have waived this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b353-7\">Liacos, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJi\">(dissenting, with whom Abrams and Nolan, JJ., join). In <em>Gram </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>384 Mass. 659, 660 (1981) <em>(Gram I), </em>we held that the plaintiff in this case was entitled \u201cto recover identifiable, reasonably anticipated future compensation, based on his past services, that he lost because of his discharge without cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The parties are agreed that, because this case went to trial for a second time on remand from this court, \u201c[i]t is the duty of the trial court, unless in its discretion it permits new issues to be raised, to follow implicitly the terms of the re-script and not to travel outside what is there laid down, read in the light of the opinion on which it is founded.\u201d <em>Lannin </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>268 Mass. 106, 111 (1929). The major issue to be addressed on Liberty\u2019s appeal is whether the remand judge committed an error of law by exceeding the scope of our decision wherein we remanded this case for a new trial on the question of damages. See <em>Gram I, supra. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Cf. <em>Loschi </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., </em>361 Mass. 714, 715-716 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In my view, the trial judge followed faithfully the views the court expressed in <em>Gram I. </em>It is unfortunate that the court now requires yet another trial in this case on the basis of allegedly erroneous instructions given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In our decision, <em>Gram I, supra, </em>we found that the jury were warranted \u201cin concluding that Gram\u2019s discharge was \u2018bad, unjust, and unkind\u2019 . . . contrary to Gram\u2019s reasonable expectations, and the product of inadequate investigation\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Gram I, supra </em>at 670. After determining that the jury correctly concluded that Gram had been discharged without good cause, we went on to consider the question of liability on the part of the defendant. We declined to adopt, as a general rule, the principle that the discharge of an at-will employee without cause is, in itself, a violation of an employer\u2019s obligation of good faith and fair dealing. <em>Gram I, supra </em>at 672. Nevertheless, because of the windfall to, or unjust enrichment of, an employer as the result of such an employee\u2019s discharge, we concluded that \u201cthe obligation of good faith and fair dealing imposed on an employer requires that the employer be liable for the loss of compensation that is so clearly related to an employee\u2019s past service, when the employee is discharged without good cause.\u201d <em>Gram I, supra </em>at 672. We affirmed the judgment of the trial court as to the defendant\u2019s liability, but having rejected as inappropriate the standard under which the jury awarded the plaintiff damages, we concluded that the plaintiff was \u201centitled to recover identifiable, reasonably anticipated future compensation, based on his past services, that he lost because of his discharge without cause.\u201d <em>Gram I, supra </em>at 660. At the second trial conducted in 1982 as to the issue of damages, the trial judge observed: \u201cI\u2019m faced with [the remand decision] and I have to take all of the language. I just can\u2019t take one sentence. I\u2019ve got to take all of the language and try to see if I can form an opinion from the entire language, not just one sentence. . . . The Court has set a new field up. And what they\u2019re doing is I think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>they\u2019re giving us a feel and they can\u2019t put it all in one sentence, but I do have to consider this, the very first paragraph: \u2018He is, however, entitled to recover identifiable\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s the key word \u2014 \u2018reasonably anticipated future compensation.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The trial judge correctly concluded that we had remanded the case for damages to be determined by whether a windfall to, or unjust enrichment of, the employer resulted from the employee\u2019s loss of identifiable, reasonably anticipated future compensation based on his past service. <em>Gram I, supra </em>at 672-673 &amp; n. 10. We had determined, on the record before us in <em>Gram I, </em>that the windfall to, or unjust enrichment of, the defendant was the equivalent of the amount of future renewal commissions Gram reasonably could have expected to receive from existing insurance policies established with Liberty as a result of Gram\u2019s past efforts and services, if he had remained in the continued employment of Liberty. <em>Gram I, supra </em>at 671-672. The proportion of his time that normally would have been spent in servicing such policies was to be deducted from the amount due him in renewal commissions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Gram I, supra </em>at 672-673.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The parties were in disagreement at the second trial as to how the windfall or unjust enrichment factor should be defined. The plaintiff took the view that he was entitled to recover compensation, based on his past service, which the plaintiff reasonably could anticipate. The defendant took the view that only \u201crenewal commissions\u201d were to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Determining that the date of Gram\u2019s termination, January 6, 1977, was the date from which to measure the plaintiff\u2019s reasonable anticipation of future compensation based on his past services, the trial judge ruled that the new compensation plan which had been put into effect by Liberty on January 1, 1977, five days prior to the plaintiff\u2019s discharge, was the appropriate means by which to calculate the plaintiff\u2019s future renewal commissions based on his past efforts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the 1977 compensation plan changed the method of compensation for renewals from that referred to by this court in <em>Gram I, </em>and it resulted in semantic confusion at the second trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cRenewal\u201d refers to the circumstances in which a policy holder annually decides whether or not to continue his insurance coverage with his insurance company by renewing his present insurance policy. There is no question that earnings attributable to an insurance salesman from the renewal of a policy constituted a windfall to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">It is the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the 1977 compensation plan that is the basis of its contention that the trial judge failed to adhere to the mandate of <em>Gram I.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>fendant correctly argues that the windfall benefits to Liberty were to be measured by the amount of the renewal commissions the plaintiff could have expected in the future resulting from his past services. The defendant contends, however, that the \u201crenewal commissions\u201d referred to by us in <em>Gram I </em>were limited to the component in the 1977 compensation plan labeled \u201crenewal credits.\u201d The plaintiff contends that, under the 1977 compensation plan, his reasonable expectancy of future \u201crenewal commissions\u201d must be read to include not only what the 1977 plan labeled \u201crenewal credits,\u201d but also components labeled \u201cendorsements\u201d and \u201ccareer credits.\u201d The trial judge permitted conflicting testimony to be presented to the jury by the expert witnesses whether \u201cendorsements\u201d and \u201ccareer credits\u201d related to lost future compensation based on past services from which benefits accrued to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">A professor of economics at Brand\u00e9is University was the expert witness for the plaintiff. He defined \u201cendorsements\u201d as the enhancement of an existing policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since an \u201cendorsement\u201d was credited under the 1977 compensation plan to the salesman of the original policy, he felt, therefore, that \u201cendorsements\u201d were part of future \u201crenewal commissions\u201d for past services. He termed \u201ccareer credits\u201d as the base amount of commission compensation calculated by the length of a sales representative\u2019s past service with Liberty.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cRenewal credits\u201d were flat fees that were added to the base compensation for the annual renewal of existing policies. Previously, \u201crenewal credits\u201d had been a percentage of the value of the premium of a renewed policy. For the thirty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>one year period from the date of Gram\u2019s termination until his retirement at age seventy, plaintiff\u2019s expert calculated the plaintiff\u2019s future compensation for past services to be $301,800, at present value, using all three components and deducting 1% for servicing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">An actuary for the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company was the expert witness for Liberty. He did not include in his analysis the two components, \u201ccareer credits\u201d or \u201cendorsements.\u201d His estimate for the component labeled in the 1977 plan as \u201crenewal credits\u201d was $63,674, reduced to present value but without a deduction for servicing time. When, on cross-examination by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, he was asked to include the other two components, the defendant\u2019s expert estimate of Gram\u2019s loss amounted to $261,790, reduced to present value.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The plaintiff testified that he calculated his future compensation to be $375,185, using the three components under the 1977 compensation plan and deducting 1 % for servicing time. The plaintiff did not calculate this figure at present value. Under the prior compensation plan, the plaintiff testified, without objection of defense counsel, that he calculated his future compensation, based on past services, to be $529,570. Although the plaintiff explained how he reached both figures, he did not break down the total compensation into component amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Certainly, where conflicting testimony was presented as to the components comprising the renewal commissions we described in <em>Gram </em>I, the judge did not stray outside our, earlier decision in permitting such testimony to be presented to the jury. The determination of what the plaintiff \u201crea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>sonably anticipated\u201d as future compensation, based on past services, was a question of fact for the jury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court, however, incorrectly treats these questions as matters of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">At closing argument, defense counsel was permitted to argue to the jury that endorsements were future new business, were immeasurable, and not properly part of the plaintiff\u2019s damages. He also argued to the jury that \u201ccareer credits\u201d were paid by Liberty for future services and that the plaintiff was entitled only to compensation for past services. Furthermore, he was permitted to argue that Gram had waived any rights to damages under the 1977 compensation plan.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The 1977 compensation plan was before the jury during their deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The trial judge began his instructions to the jury by explaining that the issue of liability already had been decided by this court and that the only issue to be determined by the jury was the question of damages, if any, \u201c[t]hat is, a determination of damages due to the plaintiff, <em>measured by the amount of renewal commissions </em>Gram reasonably could have expected to receive, reduced to reflect the proportion of his time that would reasonably have been expected to have been devoted to servicing those renewal policies\u201d (emphasis added). This language, in large part taken from this court\u2019s <em>Gram I </em>opinion, was repeatedly given verbatim. Damages should be <em>\u201cmeasured by the amount of renewal commissions </em>Mr. Gram reasonably could have expected to receive\u201d; \u201c[t]he plaintiff had a reasonable expectancy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>renewal commissions\u201d; </em>\u201cyou must determine the <em>amount of renewal commissions </em>he could have reasonably expected to receive\u201d; and \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has said there is no dispute about Gram\u2019s right to <em>renewal </em>commissions\u201d (emphasis added). Where the trial judge repeatedly read the language of our earlier decision in his charge to the jury, we should not say that he did not adhere scrupulously to this court\u2019s guidelines set forth in that opinion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The trial judge informed the jury that, in their role as finders of fact, it was their function to decide what components constituted \u201crenewal commissions.\u201d \u201c[Y]ou, as triers of fact, are to determine what is meant by compensation, and you are to determine, when we say compensation based upon his past services, what those past services constitute or constituted.\u201d Again, the judge repeated his instruction, \u201c[a]s to what elements were included to constitute those commissions is a question of fact for you to determine.\u201d Defense counsel argued in his final argument that the jury should consider only renewal commissions. I see no basis upon which to conclude that the trial judge exceeded the scope of our instructions. I would affirm the judgment. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The second trial occurred prior to our decision in <em>Kravetz </em>v. <em>Merchants Distribs., Inc., </em>387 Mass. 457, 463 (1982). See <em>Maddaloni </em>v. <em>Western Mass. Bus Lines, </em>386 Mass. 877, 884 (1982), and <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., </em>385 Mass. 300, 305 (1982).

Under the 1977 compensation plan, \u201crenewal credits,\u201d \u201cendorsements,\u201d and \u201ccareer credits\u201d were key categories for the calculation of a salesman\u2019s earnings to be added to his biweekly salary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\"> The defendant contends that, under the terms of the 1977 compensation plan, the \u201c[t]entative final and final adjustment . . . constitute[d] a full and final settlement between the Company and [Gram] under this Plan,\u201d relying on <em>Feeney </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins.

Therefore it was appropriate for the judge to allow the jury to hear the evidence, including the terms of the 1977 agreement (even though plaintiff was not shown to have been a party to the agreement) to enable them to determine what was \u201creasonably anticipated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\"> See note 5, <em>supra. </em>I agree with the court that Liberty got more than it was entitled to on this point.

I am constrained (unhappily) to file this separate dissent because the trial judge followed the teaching of <em>Gram I </em>and that is the only issue in this case. However, I cannot resist adding that my worst fears of a jury\u2019s \u201cextravagant speculation\u201d <em>(Gram I, supra </em>at 674-675) have materialized in the new judgment, which exceeds the first judgment by $225,000.
