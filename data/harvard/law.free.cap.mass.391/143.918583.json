H. Robertson Company (Robertson) to determine whether Continental had a duty to defend Gilbane and Robertson in actions brought by John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company (Hancock) and Mamma Leone\u2019s of Boston, Inc. (Mamma Leone), claiming damages from Gilbane and Robertson for the faulty design<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the John Hancock Tower (Tower). A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>judge of the Superior Court, on Continental\u2019s motion for a judgment on the pleadings or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, and on Robertson\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment, ruled against Continental and declared that Continental had a duty to defend Gilbane in the Mamma Leone action and Robertson in both actions. Continental appealed the judge\u2019s order for summary judgment and renewed its notice of appeal after judgment was entered in the Superior Court as to Robertson.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We granted Continental\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">We summarize the facts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 1968, Hancock purchased two insurance policies from Continental pursuant to speci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>fications outlined in the construction contract for the Tower. The comprehensive general liability policy provided personal injury and property damage coverage for, among others, Hancock, the owner, Gilbane, the general contractor, and Robertson, the curtain wall subcontractor. At Hancocks insistence, the printed policy was amended to read: \u201cThe insurance afforded applies separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"As3\">In 1975, Hancock sued Gilbane, Robertson, and others associated with the design and construction of the Tower curtain wall. In relevant part, the action alleged that in 1972 significant numbers of glass panels failed in the Tower\u2019s curtain wall. As a consequence, the Tower was not weathertight \u201cand could not withstand the forces and conditions to which it was subjected.\u201d Hancock further alleged that the problem was the result of negligent design and construction by Gilbane and Robertson, and that Hancock sustained substantial damages, including \u201cthe deprivation of the use of the Tower, diminution in value of the Tower, and lost income on rentals for the Tower.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">1. <em>The duty to defend.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cIt is settled in this jurisdiction, and generally elsewhere, that the question of the initial duty of a liability insurer to defend third-party actions against the insured is decided by matching the third-party complaint with the policy provisions: if the allegations of the complaint are \u2018reasonably susceptible\u2019 of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms, the insurer must undertake the defense. See <em>Vappi &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>348 Mass. 427, 431 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>(1965); <em>Magoun </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>346 Mass. 677, 681-682 (1964); <em>Terrio </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 163, 166 (1983). See also 7C J.A. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4683 (rev. ed. 1979); 14 M.H. Rhodes, Couch\u2019s Cyclopedia of Insurance Law \u00a7 51.42 (2d ed. rev. 1982); 1 R. Long, Liability Insurance \u00a7 5.03 (1981); A.D. Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes \u00a7 4.01 (1982); Annot., 50 A.L.R.2d 458 (1956). Otherwise stated, the process is one of envisaging what kinds of losses may be proved as lying within the range of the allegations of the complaint, and then seeing whether any such loss fits the expectation of protective insurance reasonably generated by the terms of the policy\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 318 (1983). See <em>Terrio </em>v. <em>McDonough, supra </em>at 169. We turn to the allegations of the underlying complaints to determine whether they are or may be envisioned to be within the provisions of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">2. <em>\u201cProperty damage\u201d under the insurance policies. </em>Continental argues that the loss of use of property is not covered by the policy unless there is physicalInjury to tangible property. The comprehensive general liability policy defines property damage as \u201cinjury to or destruction of tangible property.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Hamilton Die Cast, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity </em>&amp; <em>Guar. Co., </em>508 F.2d 417, 419-420 (7th Cir. 1975). The judge ruled that because the complaints may be read to allege \u201cboth physical injury to and loss of use of the John Hancock Tower, the claims for damages result from 'property damage\u2019\u201d and were within the coverage of the policy. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">We read the policy as written. We are not free to revise it or change the order of the words. \u201cThere is nothing in the definition [of property damage] requiring physical injury or destruction of property. The guide to determination of coverage is the kind of property rather than the kind of injury. Tangible property rendered useless is injured and hence is covered, since the definition of damages includes \u2018loss of use of property resulting from property damage.\u2019\u201d 3 R. Long, Liability Insurance App. B, \u00a7 6 (1981). We, like a major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ity of courts considering this issue, conclude that \u201cthe term property damage does not require actual physical damage but can include intangible damage such as the diminution in value of tangible property.\u201d <em>McDowell-Wellman Eng\u2019g Co. </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>711 F.2d 521, 525-526 n.7 (3d Cir. 1983). See <em>Sola Basic Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>90 Wis. 2d 641, 653-654 (1979); <em>Pittway Corp. </em>v. <em>American Motorists Ins. Co., </em>56 Ill. App. 3d 338, 342 (1977), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">(a) <em>Hancock complaint. </em>The Hancock complaint alleges \u201csubstantial damages, including the cost of labor and materials for removing and replacing the glass units, additional design, engineering and construction costs, increased operating expenses and other costs for the Tower, the deprivation of the use of the Tower, diminution in value of the Tower, and lost income on rentals for the Tower.\u201d The complaint also alleges that the defects were not apparent until after the wall had been \u201ccompleted and been subjected to normal forces and conditions.\u201d Further, the complaint suggests that Gilbane and Robertson fraudulently lulled Hancock into a false sense of security by assuring Hancock that the curtain wall would not fail once it \u201cwas completed and sealed\u201d in the Tower.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Continental argues that the curtain wall was not integrated into the Tower,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and therefore damages were limited to the curtain wall itself and the cost of repair and replacement. Such damages are explicitly excluded from coverage by exclusion (1) and (m). See 151-155, <em>infra. </em>As we read the Hancock complaint, we think the allegations are \u201creasonably susceptible of an interpretation\u201d that Hancock suffered its damages after the curtain wall was \u201ccompleted and sealed\u201d in the Tower. The allegations of damages are not limited to repair and replacement or intangible damages. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>They also encompass damage to the Tower itself after installation of the curtain wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Since the complaint may be read as claiming damages after integration of the defective curtain wall into the Tower, the allegations are sufficient to trigger the duty to defend. \u201c[CJommon sense dictates there was substantial property damage to the entire . . . building when the exterior walls presented a faded, discolored, mottled and unsightly appearance in contrast to a uniform and eye-pleasing manifestation envisioned by the original plans. To say the damage in such instance can be confined to the blocks as distinct from the . . . building, we feel, is unrealistic and loses sight of the forest because of the trees.\u201d <em>Dakota Block Co. </em>v. <em>Western Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>81 S.D. 213, 218 (1965). See <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co. </em>v. <em>American Ins. Co., </em>169 Ind. App. 1 (1976). See also <em>Beacon Textiles Corp. </em>v. <em>Employers Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>355 Mass. 643, 646 (1969); <em>Sturges Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>37 N.Y.2d 69 (1975); <em>Lipton, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>34 N.Y.2d 356 (1974).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">(b) <em>Mamma Leones complaint. </em>The judge, citing R. Long\u2019s treatise, found that Mamma Leone\u2019s complaint alleged property damage within the policy because \u201c[tjangible property rendered useless is injured and hence is covered .... The discharge of noxious gas from the insured\u2019s plant renders a nearby business building unfit for human occupancy, the resulting loss of profits is covered.\u201d 3 R. Long, Liability Insurance App. B, \u00a7 6, 38-39 (1981). Accord: R. Elliot, The New Comprehensive General Liability Policy 12-6 (definition of property damage \u201comits any requirements that there be physical injury as a prerequisite for coverage. Thus, if tangible property is not physically damaged but is made useless by an act of an insured, the policy will cover the insured\u2019s legal liability assuming no specific exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>applies. As an example: a large piece of contractor\u2019s equipment breaks down in a public street in such a manner that the street must be closed off for a period of time and the public has limited or no access to the stores located in the block affected. Loss of use claims from the operators of those stores would be covered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Mamma Leone\u2019s allegations also are \u201creasonably susceptible of an interpretation\u201d that the falling glass caused the area surrounding the restaurant to be cleared of pedestrians and roped off on numerous occasions. As a result of the falling glass, the public may not have been able to gain access to the premises. A \u201cbusiness may state a claim in nuisance for severe economic harm resulting from loss of access to its premises by its customers.\u201d <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos. </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>387 Mass. 889, 896 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In categorizing loss of access to property that results in severe economic harm, with physical damage to property with respect to a plaintiff\u2019s ability to sue in public nuisance, we implicitly recognized that \u201cin cases where an established business may have been virtually destroyed,\u201d <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos. </em>v. <em>Fisher, supra </em>at 895, the business has suffered injury to its property. The Mamma Leone complaint envisions an interpretation that encompasses such a claim. Because our function simply is to decide whether Mamma Leone\u2019s allegations are \u201creasonably susceptible of the interpretation that they assert injury to property caused by accident and of a type not within the . . . [policy\u2019s] exclusion[s],\u201d <em>Vappi &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>348 Mass. 427, 431 (1965), we conclude that the judge correctly determined that Continental had a duty to defend this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">3. <em>Exclusions. </em>Continental argues that coverage for property damage is excluded by four clauses in the comprehensive liability policy. \u201cEach exclusion is meant to be read with the insuring agreement, independently of every other exclusion.\u201d Tinker, Comprehensive General Liability Insurance \u2014 Perspective and Overview, 25 Fed\u2019n Ins. Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>sel Q. 217, 223 (1975). We therefore consider each exclusion separately.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">(a) <em>Care, custody, or control exclusion. </em>Exclusion (i) of the comprehensive general liability policy excludes coverage of <em>\u201cproperty damage </em>to property owned by the <em>Insured, </em>leased or rented equipment, or property <em>being installed, erected or worked upon by the insured, </em>his agents or subcontractors\u201d (emphasis supplied). Continental argues that this exclusion applies because the property allegedly damaged in the Hancock complaint was \u201cbeing installed, erected or worked upon by [Gilbane and Robertson], [their] agents or sub-contractors\u201d at the time of the \u201coccurrence\u201d specified in the Hancock complaint. The crux of this argument is that the failure of the curtain wall constituted a single occurrence that commenced when Robertson was still working on the curtain wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">In making this argument, Continental relies on the contractual definition of occurrence in the policy: \u201cOccurrence means: (1) with respect to . . . <em>property damage, </em>an accident, including injurious exposure to conditions which results, during this policy period, in . . . property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured. All. . . <em>property damage </em>arising out of continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same conditions shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.\u201d Continental concludes that the damage incurred during the later period was an extension of the initial breakage of the curtain wall and therefore is not within the policy. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\u201cThe time of the occurrence of an accident within the meaning of an indemnity policy is not the time the wrongful act was committed, but the time when the complaining party was actually damaged.\u201d <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>502 F. Supp. 246, 252 (D. R.I. 1980), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Appalachian Ins. Co., </em>655 F.2d 27 (1st Cir. 1981), quoting <em>United States Fidelity </em>&amp; <em>Guar. Co. </em>v. <em>American Ins. Co., </em>169 Ind. App. 1, 7 (1976). As we read the Hancock complaint, its allegations are reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that Robertson and Gilbane turned over a completed but defective Tower, and that when the Tower malfunctioned, Hancock suffered property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The Hancock complaint states that \u201c[w]hen some of the glass units in the curtain wall failed during or shortly after installation, Robertson assured John Hancock that the failures were a result of normal problems incident to installation or were due to causes other than Robertson\u2019s negligent design, and would not continue once the entire curtain wall was completed and sealed. Robertson replaced glass units which failed during or shortly after installation.\u201d The Hancock complaint then claims that Robertson and Gilbane \u201cfraudulently concealed from John Hancock the cause of the failures. Significant numbers of glass units did not fail until November, 1972.\u201d Hancock\u2019s complaint further alleges that \u201cJohn Hancock has sustained substantial damages, including but not limited to the cost of labor and materials for removing and replacing the glass units in the curtain wall, additional design, engineering and construction costs, increased operating expenses and other costs for the Tower, the deprivation of the use of the Tower, diminution in value of the Tower, and lost income on rentals for the Tower.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The complaint is \u201creasonably susceptible\u201d of the interpretation that stresses to which the curtain wall was subjected as part of the Tower differed significantly from the stresses which were placed on the individual glass panels during construction. Further, as we read the complaint, the repairs made while the Tower was still in the \u201ccustody and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>control\u201d of Gilbane and Robertson could have alleviated the conditions that led to the precompletion breakage. Thus, the complaint fairly read suggests an interpretation that precompletion and postcompletion property damage did not arise \u201cout of continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same conditions [so as to] be considered as arising out of one occurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Continental argues additionally \u201c[t]he only fair reading of exclusion (i) is to exclude from coverage all damage to property which was the subject of the insured\u2019s work.\u201d Before the insurance contract was signed, however, Hancock sought an explanation of exclusion (i) and Continental responded to Hancock\u2019s request by stating, \u201cWe . . . draw your attention to the severability of interests phraseology appearing under the persons insured section which confirms that \u2018the insurance afforded applies separately to each Insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought . . ., etc.\u2019 The question to ask is whether the Property damaged falls into the category of . . . property being installed, erected or worked upon by the Insured, his Agents or Subcontractors. In this case, the Insured is that entity against whom claim is being brought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Hancock negotiated for and Continental agreed to the severability clause providing that each of the named insured be covered \u201cas if separate policies . . . had been issued to each Insured hereunder.\u201d As we read its letter, Continental told Hancock that, although it was not providing builder\u2019s risk insurance under its third-party liability policies, the various named insured companies would be considered third parties with respect to each other under exclusion (i) unless the property allegedly damaged was <em>being </em>worked upon by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Exclusion (i) as written and exclusion (i) as Continental would have us read it are concerned with different actuarial problems. \u201c[Ijnsurance premiums are based upon risk-allocation, and the risk of damaging property handled in the course of work is greater than the risk of damaging other property.\u201d Mustachio, Manufacturers\u2019 and Contractors\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Liability Insurance Policy: The Care, Custody, or Control Exclusion Clause, 6 Hous. L. Rev. 359, 359 (1968). Thus, exclusion (i) as written excludes a high risk occurrence (property <em>being </em>worked on) and provides a powerful incentive for the insured to exercise optimum care with respect to property being worked on and still within its care, custody and control. Continental would transform exclusion (i) into a sweeping exclusion of coverage for property damage to all property on which the insured worked, even after completion. Such an interpretation contradicts the plain language of the clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">(b) <em>Injury to products exclusion. </em>Exclusion (1) of the general liability policy excludes coverage \u201cto property damage to the named insured\u2019s products arising out of such products or any part of such products.\u201d \u201c[N]amed insured\u2019s products\u201d is defined as \u201cgoods or products manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by the named insured or by others trading under his name, including any container thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Continental does not contend that the whole Tower was Robertson\u2019s \u201cproduct.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> According to Continental, however, the curtain wall was Robertson\u2019s product, and all damage alleged by Hancock was a consequence of \u201cproperty damage to the named insured\u2019s products arising out of such products.\u201d Continental\u2019s theory is that, if the insurance does not cover damage to the curtain wall itself, it cannot cover consequential damages resulting from failure of the Tower after installation of the curtain wall. We have rejected Continental\u2019s definition of \u201cproperty damage.\u201d <em>Supra </em>at 148. Because the complaint suggests that the curtain wall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>was integrated into the Tower in a manner causing \u201cinjury to . . . tangible property,\u201d we conclude that exclusion (1) does not relieve Continental of its duty to defend Robertson on the Hancock claim. See <em>Sturges Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>37 N.Y.2d 69 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">(c) <em>Injury to work exclusion. </em>Exclusion (m) of the comprehensive general liability policy excludes coverage \u201cto <em>property damage </em>to work performed by or on behalf of the <em>named insured </em>arising out of work or any portion thereof, or out of materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection therewith.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In arguing that exclusion (m) should apply to property damage to the Tower as a whole, Continental makes the identical argument that it made with respect to exclusion (1) and the Mamma Leone claim, i.e., that the only actual physical injury to property alleged in either complaint was injury to the curtain wall, that such injury is excluded, and, therefore, that consequential damages such as loss of use do not constitute property damage under the insurance contract. We reject Continental\u2019s argument that, as a matter of law, we must hold that the curtain wall was not integrated into the Tower, and, therefore, there was no \u201cinjury to . . . tangible property.\u201d As we have said, the complaint fairly read suggests that the curtain wall was integrated into the Tower. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>Thus, Continental must defend Robertson with respect to the loss of use or diminution of value of the Tower. See <em>supra </em>at 147-148 (discussing \u201cproperty damage\u201d) and <em>supra </em>at 154-155 (discussing exclusion [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">(d) <em>The \u201cSistership\u201d exclusion. </em>Exclusion (n) of the comprehensive general liability policy excludes coverage for <em>\u201cdamages </em>claimed for the withdrawal, inspection, repair, replacement, or loss of use of the <em>named insured\u2019s </em>products or work completed by or for the <em>named insured </em>or of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>property of which such products or work form a part, if such products, work or property are withdrawn from the market or from use because of any known or suspected defect or deficiency therein.\u201d Continental argues that the judge created an ambiguity in a clause that clearly excluded coverage and then construed the clause against the insurer. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Exclusion (n) \u201cis intended to exclude from coverage the cost of preventative or curative action by withdrawal of a product in situations in which a danger is to be apprehended. It is not, however, intended to exclude from coverage damages caused by the very product whose failure to perform properly aroused apprehension about the quality of \u2018sister\u2019 products. . . . Still less is it intended to exclude from coverage damages arising from the malfunctioning of a product where no \u2018sister\u2019 products are involved\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Todd Shipyards Corp. </em>v. <em>Turbine Serv., Inc., </em>674 F.2d 401, 419 (5th Cir. 1982). 3 R. Long, Liability Insurance App. B, \u00a7 15 (1981); Henderson, Insurance Protection for Products Liability and Completed Operations \u2014 What Every Lawyer Should Know, 50 Neb. L. Rev. 415, 445 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The complaints allege failure of the Tower itself; no sister products are involved. The Tower is unique, and thus exclusion (n) does not apply. This matter is remanded to the Superior Court where a judgment shall enter declaring that Continental has a duty to defend Gilbane in the Mamma Leone action and Robertson in both actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-14\"> An action was also brought against I. M. Pei, the architect. The judge ruled that the insurance policy specifically excluded the damages alleged in that action, and that Continental had no duty to defend Pei. No appeal from that ruling is before us in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\"> The judge originally ruled that Continental had no duty to defend Gilbane in either action. Gilbane subsequently filed a motion to reconsider the summary judgment with respect to the Mamma Leone action, stating that exclusion (m) did not apply to Mamma Leone. The judge granted Gilbane\u2019s motion and held that Continental had a duty to defend Gilbane in the Mamma Leone action because the restaurant was not located in the Tower, which was Gilbane\u2019s work product, but was situated across the street in the John Hancock garage. Thus, the judge concluded exclusion (m) did not apply to the Mamma Leone action.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">In its brief Gilbane does not contest the judge\u2019s determination on proceedings for summary judgment that Continental has no duty to defend Gilbane in the Hancock action. We deem Gilbane\u2019s failure to brief this issue as a waiver. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 919 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">With respect to the Mamma Leone action, Gilbane argues that because a final judgment was not entered in that case, Mass. R. Civ. P. 58 (a), as amended, 371 Mass. 908 (1977), appeal is not ripe. See <em>Tisei </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Marlborough, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 328, 330 (1977) (final judgment required before appeal). At oral argument, the parties informed us that the underlying actions have been settled, and that the only question remaining to be adjudicated is Continental\u2019s duty to defend G\u00fcbane and Robertson. In these circumstances, we decline to remand this matter to the Superior Court for the entry of judgment in accordance with the judge\u2019s memorandum and then decide Continental\u2019s duty to defend Gil-bane in a later appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\"> We derive the facts from those found by the judge. In the court below, Gilbane contested the propriety of a summary judgment, arguing that there was a factual matter in dispute. The judge held that the case was ripe for summary judgment and, on appeal, Gilbane has not challenged that holding. Thus, we deem the matter waived. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 919 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b162-6\"> Hancock also purchased an umbrella excess third-party liability policy to cover personal injury and property damage in excess of that covered by the primary insurance. Since we hold that Continental has a duty to defend under the comprehensive general liability policy, we do not reach or discuss the excess liability policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b162-7\"> The policy states that Continental \u201cshall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the <em>insured </em>seeking damages on account of such . . . <em>property damage . . . , </em>even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false or fraudulent . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\"> On appeal, the parties differ as to whether the curtain wall was integrated into the Tower. <em>None </em>of the parties asks that we remand this matter to the Superior Court for resolution of this factual dispute. Because the complaint may be read to allege that the curtain wall was integrated into the Tower, we do not remand this matter on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\"> The claim of \u201cadditional design, engineering and construction costs\u201d also may be read to include correcting damage done by the failure of the curtain wall to parts of the Tower not worked on by Robertson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\"> Continental states in its argument headings that the exclusions also apply to the Mamma Leone action. In its brief, however, Continental merely restates its position that property damage is not covered unless it results from <em>physical </em>injury to property not excluded. Continental thus argues that it has no duty to defend the Mamma Leone actions because the damages alleged therein do not in themselves constitute property damage under the policy and are consequential to damages excluded by policy exclusions. Because we hold that the allegation of loss of access to Mamma Leone\u2019s restaurant is, in itself, an allegation of injury to tangible property, this argument fails. None of the other exclusions has any other bearing on the Mamma Leone action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\"> The judge held that exclusion (1) did not apply to Gilbane or Robertson because neither defendant was a manufacturer or supplier of goods. Relying <em>on Paxton-Mitchell Co. </em>v. <em>Royal Indem. Co., </em>279 Or. 607 (1977), the judge stated that \u201c \u2018insured\u2019s products\u2019 refer to that in which the insured trades or deals, and not all goods handled by an insured in the process of completing its business function.\u201d Other courts have accepted this interpretation. See <em>Gulf Miss. Marine Corp. </em>v. <em>George Engine Co., </em>697 F.2d 668, 672-673 (5th Cir. 1983). Because the Hancock complaint alleges damage to the Tower, we need not decide whether the curtain wall was Robertson\u2019s \u201cproduct\u201d so as to invoke exclusion (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b171-8\"> Robertson does not dispute the fact that it worked on the curtain wall and concedes that if Hancock exclusively alleged property damage to the curtain wall, rather than to the Tower, such claim would be excluded by exclusion (m).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
