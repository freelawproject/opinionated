Schofield was convicted of armed robbery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17, and rape, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22 (a), following a trial in the Superior Court before a judge without a jury. He appealed his convictions to the Appeals Court challenging the sufficiency of the colloquy conducted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>the judge concerning the waiver of his rights to a jury trial. The Appeals Court reversed the judgments entered by the trial judge and ordered a new trial before a jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schofield, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 199 (1983). The Commonwealth then filed an application for further appellate review, which we granted. We conclude that the record adequately shows the defendant\u2019s valid waiver of his right to trial by jury. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The facts underlying Schofield\u2019s convictions are summarized in the opinion of the Appeals Court and we need not repeat them here. See <em>id. </em>at 200. Our focus is confined to the waiver of jury trial, evidenced by the colloquy between the trial judge and Schofield and set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appeals Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>found this colloquy inadequate in light of certain language in <em>Ciummei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 504 (1979). The Appeals Court described generally our reasoning in <em>Ciummei. </em>It then stated that under <em>Ciummei </em>a judge\u2019s determination regarding whether a defendant has voluntarily and intelligently waived the right to a jury trial \u201cis not likely to be disturbed simply because the colloquy involved less than an exhaustive description of the ramifications of the defendant\u2019s decision, <em>provided </em>(and this is the crucial point) that the dialogue is sufficient to furnish the judge with the information necessary to warrant findings that the defendant is (1) aware of the differences between jury and jury-waived trials; (2) that he has not been coerced or improperly influenced in his decision; and (3) that he is, at the time of the waiver, capable of rational judgment\u201d (emphasis in the original). 16 Mass. App. Ct. at 203. After so stating, the majority of the panel concluded that \u201c[t]he difficulty in this case lies in the first finding. There is absolutely no indication in the colloquy that Schofield was likely aware of the factors, set out in <em>Ciummei, </em>which distinguish the two forms of trial, particularly the critical information that the defendant has a voice in selecting the jurors and that their verdict must be unanimous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Justice Cutter dissented from the conclusion of the majority of the panel. He stated that he did not read the language in our <em>Ciummei </em>decision to require a colloquy to contain specific information upon which the judge could make the three findings set forth by the majority of the panel. Rather, he viewed the language in our <em>Ciummei </em>decision \u201cmerely as suggestions of possible lines of inquiry \u2018where a defendant needs a compendious reminder\u2019 of the extent of his rights.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schofield, supra </em>at 207 (Cutter, J., dissenting), quoting <em>Ciummei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 510. We agree with the construction of our language contained in Justice Cutter\u2019s dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>In <em>Ciummei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 509-510, we specifically stated that we did \u201cnot intend to create a rigid pattern\u201d of factual determinations which a judge must make before concluding a defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to trial by jury was voluntary and intelligent. We stressed that inquiries directed to such a conclusion should not be \u201cdischarged as a mere matter of rote.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510, quoting <em>Patton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>281 U.S. 276, 312 (1930). The majority of the Appeals Court panel are correct in observing we specifically referred to the factual differences between jury and bench trials as an appropriate focus of a judge\u2019s colloquy with the defendant. See <em>Ciummei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 510. Nevertheless, our reference to the differences between a jury and bench trial was qualified in two ways. First, we mentioned the differences between bench and jury trials only for the purpose of illustrating what a judge <em>might </em>address in his colloquy. Second, we made clear that an extended colloquy is only necessary where a judge determines \u201ca defendant needs a compendious reminder\u201d of the right being waived. These qualifications should make clear the advisory nature of our reference to the differences between jury and bench trials. We did not intend to establish a rule that a defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to jury trial will be deemed valid only where a colloquy on the record evidences the defendant was aware of all the differences between bench and jury trials mentioned in <em>Ciummei. </em>We intended only to suggest some areas of inquiry that a judge might find useful in determining whether a defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntary and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The defendant asserts that the inadequacy of the colloquy alone can form the basis for the grant of a new trial. While that premise may hold true where no colloquy is conducted at all, it does not extend to establish a sweeping prophylactic rule. The colloquy primarily is only evidence of whether a defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to trial by jury was voluntary and intelligent. It is not an independent constitutionally required prerequisite to a valid waiver of the right to a jury trial. See <em>Ciummei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 508-509. That which we required for a colloquy to be adequate in itself, is limited: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>\u201c[T]he defendant, being competent, must simply have indicated a comprehension of the nature of the choice\u201d between a bench and jury trial. <em>Id. </em>at 510. Such comprehension of the choice may be based on information provided to the defendant by the judge, the defendant\u2019s counsel, the defendant\u2019s personal knowledge, or some other source. Once this minimum requirement is met, all other analysis with regard to the colloquy is strictly whether the colloquy as evidence was sufficient for the judge to \u201csatisfy himself that any waiver by the defendant [was] made voluntarily and intelligently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509. If the colloquy cannot support such a conclusion, it may support the grant of a new trial, not because the colloquy was flawed, but because of insufficient evidence to support the judge\u2019s decision to accept the defendant\u2019s waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">In the instant case there is adequate support for the judge\u2019s decision. The facts are sufficient to indicate the defendant\u2019s comprehension of the nature of the choice he faced. The defendant was competent. He stated he discussed the matter of waiver with his attorney. He responded affirmatively when asked if he understood certain differences between bench and jury trials. These facts, in addition to the remainder of the colloquy, support the decision of the judge that the defendant\u2019s choice to waive his right to trial by jury was voluntary and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">\n<em>Judgments of the Superior Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-6\"> The judge: \u201cMr. Schofield, my name is Zobel and I\u2019m the Justice of the Superior Court who\u2019s going to be trying this case. And I understand that you want to waive your right to a jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">The defendant: \u201cYes, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">The judge: \u201cNow, before I can approve of your request to waive your right to a jury, I have to be persuaded that you understand all your rights and are giving them up voluntarily. You understand?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">The defendant: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">The judge: \u201cNow, I\u2019m going to ask you some questions. If any of my questions are not clear, you just tell me, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">The defendant: \u201cYes.\u201d [Then followed preliminary questions concerning Schofield\u2019s age (twenty-seven, at the time of trial), education (ninth grade), occupation (cook), and military service (none)].</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">The judge: \u201cYou understand that a jury trial means that the twelve people in a jury box decide whether or not you are guilty?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">The defendant: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-14\">The judge: \u201cAnd if you give up that right to a jury trial, it means that a judge, in this case, me, I, will decide \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-15\">The defendant: \u201cYes, I understand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-16\">The judge: \u201c \u2014 the case? A jury trial is a very fundamental right. You understand that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-17\">The defendant: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-18\">The judge: \u201cThat\u2019s why I have to be very sure that you are willing to give up that right and are doing it freely and voluntarily. Y ou understand that?\u201d The defendant: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-19\">The judge: \u201cHas anyone promised you or offered you anything to make you give up your right to a jury trial?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-20\">The defendant: \u201cNo, I have done it on my own. I volunteered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-21\">The judge: \u201cHave you discussed this with Mr. Gorman, your lawyer?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AER\">The defendant: \u201cYes, I have.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-22\">The judge: \u201cOkay. And you are satisfied with the advice which Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Gorman has given you?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The defendant: \u201cYes. I am.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">The judge: \u201cAll right. I find that Mr. Schofield is fully aware of his right and that he has knowingly and purposefully and intelligently waived his right to a trial by a jury and I accept the waiver.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
