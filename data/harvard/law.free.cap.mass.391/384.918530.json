The application was filed with the assessors on October 31, 1980, pursuant to St. 1980, c. 560,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which authorized abatement applications by charitable organizations that, because of a failure to file a list of property required under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 29<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>(Form 3 ABC), were ineligible for a charitable exemption under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Third,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> during any year encompassed in the period beginning January 1, 1969, and ending June 30, 1980.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under St. 1980, c. 560, such charitable organizations were permitted to submit abatement applications provided that the requisite Form 3 ABC was filed on or before November 1, 1980, and that \u201cbut for the failure to file said list with the respective assessors for taxable years [1969-1980], [the organization] would have received a property tax exemption in said years.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The association, which had unsuccessfully attempted to obtain an abatement of the fiscal year 1977 tax in a proceeding involving an application for abatement filed in 1976, submitted the requisite Form 3 ABC<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> with its 1980 abatement application. On January 23, 1981, the assessors denied the abatement. The association appealed under formal procedure to the board. After hearing oral argument on a petition to dismiss filed by the assessors, the board, on January 22, 1982, dismissed the association\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The board subsequently issued its findings of fact and report. The association appeals to this court pursuant to G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13. We remand the case to the board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The following factual findings by the board are not disputed. The tax was assessed to St. Dominic\u2019s Institute, Inc. (St. Dominic\u2019s), a Massachusetts corporation organized under G. L. c. 180, which, on January 1, 1976, was the owner of record of the property. The association purchased the property from St. Dominic\u2019s on June 26, 1976. St. Dominic\u2019s, as the \u201cperson . . . assessed,\u201d filed an application for abatement on October 15, 1976.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59, as amended through St. 1974, c. 831, \u00a7 4. In compliance with G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 57, as amended through St. 1976, c. 250, \u00a7 1, permitting payment without interest of the tax in two installments due November 1 (or thirty days after the bill was sent) and May 1, the association paid one half of the tax on November 1, 1976. On or about January 11, 1977, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the assessors notified St. Dominic\u2019s that its application for abatement had been denied. On April 8, 1977, the association filed an appeal in its own name from the assessors\u2019 refusal to abate the tax and, eighteen days later, made timely payment of the second instalment of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The assessors filed a plea in bar with the board on September 16, 1977, alleging that, because the tax had not been assessed to the association, payment of the entire tax was a prerequisite to the association\u2019s right to appeal the denial of the abatement under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59, and that, the association having paid only one half of the tax before appealing, the board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal. The assessors also claimed as jurisdictional defects the omission to submit a certification that an annual report (Form PC) had been filed with the Attorney General as required by G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 8F,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the failure to file Form 3 ABC. On November 4, 1977, prior to a determination by the board of the jurisdictional issue, the association withdrew its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The board concluded that St. 1980, c. 560, did not revive the association\u2019s right to apply for an abatement of the 1977 tax<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> because the association would have been precluded from obtaining an abatement for that year even if the Form 3 ABC had been filed. At the time the 1977 appeal was filed, G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59, as amended through St. 1974, c. 831, \u00a7 4, provided in pertinent part: \u201cA person upon whom a tax has been assessed . . ., if aggrieved by such tax, may . . . apply in writing to the assessors ... for an abatement thereof .... If a person other than the person to whom a tax on real estate is assessed is the owner thereof, or has an interest therein, or is in possession thereof, and <em>pays the tax, </em>he may thereafter prosecute in his own name any application, appeal or action provided by law for the abatement or recovery of such tax, which after the payment thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>shall be deemed for the purposes of such application, appeal or action, to have been assessed to the person so paying the same. The holder of a mortgage on real estate who has paid not less than one-half of the tax thereon may . . . apply in the manner above set forth for an abatement . . . [and] thereafter prosecute any appeal or action provided by law for the abatement or recovery of such tax in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as a person aggrieved by a tax assessed upon him\u201d (emphasis supplied). The board concluded that the statutory requirement that a nonassessed owner pay \u201cthe tax\u201d prior to prosecuting an appeal necessitated payment of the entire tax, and held that the association\u2019s timely payment of the tax in compliance with the payment schedule permitted under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 57, was insufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the board over the association\u2019s 1977 appeal. The board also concluded that St. 1977, c. 198,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was not applicable to that appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We agree with the board that, prior to the 1977 amendment, \u00a7 59 required a nonassessed owner to make full payment of the tax before appealing. The short answer to the association\u2019s claim to the contrary is that \u00a7 59 authorizes a mortgage holder \u201cwho has paid not less than one-half of the tax\u2019 \u2019 to apply for an abatement in the interim between September 20 and October 1 of the fiscal year for which the tax is assessed. Where the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>explicitly creates a category of nonassessed persons entitled to commence abatement proceedings by paying \u201cnot less that one-half of the tax, \u2019 \u2019 we cannot construe the requirement that a different category of persons pay <em>\u201cthe </em>tax\u201d as being satisfied by the payment of half the tax prior to initial involvement in the abatement process.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">At the time the Legislature amended the sections on the jurisdictional requirements for appeals by \u201cperson[s] aggrieved,\u201d it did not change the jurisdictional requisites of \u00a7 59 for the prosecution of abatement requests by nonassessed parties. See <em>Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>313 Mass. 762, 768 (1943). We cannot interpret the meaning of \u201cpays the tax\u201d to entitle the association to appeal by following the instalment payment schedule where the Legislature made no such provision. The Legislature did not elect to place abatement proceedings involving nonassessed owners on a jurisdictional par with those involving assessed owners until it amended \u00a7 59 by St. 1977, c. 198.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The board did not, therefore, have jurisdiction over the association\u2019s 1977 appeal unless St. 1977, c. 198, was applicable to that appeal. See note 10, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">We disagree, however, with the board\u2019s conclusion that St. 1977, c. 198, was not applicable to the association\u2019s appeal. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>applicability of a statute to cases pending on its effective date often turns on whether the statute affects procedural or substantive rights. See <em>Goodwin Bros. Leasing </em>v. <em>Nousis, </em>373 Mass. 169, 173 (1977). The board concluded that the statute affected substantive rights by creating a \u201cnew class\u201d of \u201cperson[s] aggrieved,\u201d namely persons acquiring title to assessed property after January 1 and electing to pay the tax in two instalments. However, it can be argued with equal vigor that the statute merely altered the time at which tax payments were due from a preexisting class of \u201cperson[s] aggrieved.\u201d i.e., persons acquiring title after January 1 and paying the tax. In this case, as in others, the distinction between \u201csubstantive\u201d and \u201cprocedural\u201d is elusive. See <em>City Council of Waltham </em>v. <em>Vinciullo, </em>364 Mass. 624,626-627 (1974); <em>Lindberg </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>335 Mass. 141, 143 (1956). Because the remedial nature of the statute is apparent, and because, in our view, application of the statute would not necessarily interfere with the substantive rights of the assessors or of the town of Brookline, we hold that the statute operated to validate the 1977 claim of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">We note initially that the statutory language itself suggests a legislative intent to make the statutory provisions applicable to cases pending on the effective date. The statute requires that a person acquiring title after January 1 \u201cin any year\u201d be treated as an assessed owner for that year. Absent language explicitly resuscitating a concluded or expired cause of action, cf. St. 1980, c. 560; <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>305 Mass. 5, 8-9 (1940), we would not read \u201cin any year\u201d as applicable \u201cto a case which has been closed, i.e., has gone to judgment and either been affirmed on appeal or not been appealed within the time allowed for appeal,\u201d <em>City Council of Waltham </em>v. <em>Vinciullo, supra </em>at 627. However, the association\u2019s appeal had not been conclusively adjudicated at the time the statute became operative.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The year during which the association acquired the property is literally subsumed in the phrase \u201cin any year.\u201d We can think of no reason why St. 1977, c. 198, did not by its express terms entitle the association to be treated on a jurisdictional par with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>an assessed owner for the purposes of the pending appeal. See <em>E.B. Horn Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>321 Mass. 579, 582-583 (1947); <em>Wynn </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>281 Mass. 245, 250, 251 (1932). Further, \u201cstatutes which are remedial or procedural should be deemed to apply retroactively to those pending cases which, on the effective date of the statute, have not yet gone beyond the procedural stage to which the statute pertains. \u2019 \u2019 <em>City Council of Waltham </em>v. <em>Vinciullo, </em>364 Mass. 624, 628 (1974). \u2018 \u2018Where ... the statute regulates practice, procedure or evidence, as distinguished from substantive rights, it will commonly be applied to actions already pending.\u201d <em>Goodwin Bros. Leasing </em>v. <em>Nousis, </em>373 Mass. 169, 173 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">A contrary conclusion is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s remedial purposes. The pre-1977 requirement that a nonassessed owner, unlike an assessed owner, make full payment before appealing to the board has been described by one commentator as a \u201ctrap for the unwary,\u201d an \u201cunintentional by-product,\u201d of the shift from annual to semiannual property tax bills. E. Hines, State and Local Taxation, 1975 Ann. Survey Mass. Law \u00a7 11.5, at 214. Statute 1977, c. 198, was enacted in response to the clear need for legislative action to eliminate this \u2018 \u2018trap. \u2019 \u2019 See E. Hines, State and Local Taxation, <em>supra, </em>and note 13, <em>supra. </em>Application of St. 1977, c. 198, to salvage the undismissed appeal<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of a. victim of that \u201ctrap\u201d would effectuate the objective of granting \u201cthe broadest application to legislatively mandated procedural changes without subjecting each <em>completed </em>step in the course of a litigation to the uncertainty of possible future legislative changes\u201d (emphasis added). <em>City Council of Waltham </em>v. <em>Vin-ciullo, supra </em>at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>The assessors claim that a retroactive application of St. 1977, c. 198, would disturb vested rights by \u201cdepriving] the Town of Brookline of tax receipts to which it became absolutely entitled on April 11, 1977,\u201d the last date on which the association could have filed an appeal complying with the jurisdictional requisites in effect prior to the 1977 amendment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The 1977 amendment did not affect the town\u2019s presumptive entitlement to collect the assessed tax, nor did it confer upon the taxpayer a right to an abatement on substantive principles not in existence under prior law. See <em>E.B. Horn Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>321 Mass. 579, 582 (1947). The amendment merely made less onerous the conditions under which a nonassessed owner could obtain a hearing on the merits of the assessors\u2019 denial of an abatement and ensured that the right to appeal should not be inadvertently lost because of a transfer of ownership. No vested property rights are affected by the retroactive application of a statute affecting a taxpayer\u2019s right to appeal to the board. <em>E.B. Horn Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, supra </em>at 584. The town retains its substantive right to collect the tax, subject only to the qualification that the board might determine that the denial of an abatement was erroneous.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The result we reach \u201cis buttressed by considerations of fairness.\u201d <em>City Council of Waltham </em>v. <em>Vinciullo, supra </em>at 629. Neither the town nor the assessors were prejudiced in any way by the fact that the otherwise timely payment of the second instalment of the tax was not received until after the association\u2019s appeal was filed. See <em>Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>311 Mass. 415, 420 (1942). By contrast, a prospective application of St. 1977, c. 198, would have the harsh effect of denying the association a hearing on the merits of its 1980 application because of a technicality acknowledged by the Legislature to be obsolete while the 1977 appeal was pending. Neither precedent nor policy counsel such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Our conclusion that the board\u2019s jurisdiction over the abatement appeals was not divested by the association\u2019s failure to pay the entire tax before filing the 1977 appeal does not end the jurisdictional inquiry. The board\u2019s opinion refers to \u2018 \u2018other jurisdictional problems [with the association\u2019s 1977 appeal] which are not addressed in this Opinion for the reason that its failure to pay \u2018the tax\u2019 before filing its appeal is alone sufficient reason for the Board to decline jurisdiction. \u2019 \u2019 The board specifically mentioned the failure of St. Dominic\u2019s or the association to provide certification that Form PC had been filed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The board did not, however, rely on this potential defect in dismissing the appeal, and it is unclear from the record whether the association was given an opportunity to argue fully that question before the board. We therefore remand the case to the board for a full hearing on the effect of the omission on the board\u2019s jurisdiction. See <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Center </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>388 Mass. 832, 843 (1983).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This matter is remanded to the board for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-12\">Statute 1980, c. 560, was approved July 16, 1980, and became effective October 15, 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-13\">General Laws c. 59, \u00a729, as amended by St. 1963, c. 160, \u00a7\u00a7 17,18, requires \u201call persons subject to taxation in their respective towns,\u201d with exceptions not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>here material, to submit on an annual basis itemized lists of all property not exempt from taxation as well as \u201call real and personal estate held ... for literary, temperance, benevolent, charitable, or scientific purposes on January first preceding.\u201d The statute was further amended by St. 1977, c. 992, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5, which among other changes, included, for fiscal years commencing July 1, 1978, a requirement that property held for educational purposes also be itemized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-7\">General Laws c. 59, \u00a7 5, Third <em>(b), </em>as amended by St. 1974, c. 811, provides, in relevant part, that \u201ca charitable organization shall not be exempt [under this clause] for any year in which it omits to bring in to the assessors the list and statement [Form 3 ABC] required by [G.

Because knowledge of the facts and issues in cases decided by summary order is not uniformly available to all persons, these orders may not be used as precedent. Exceptions to this rule are limited to issues such as collateral estoppel, issue preclusion (res judicata), and law of the case because these issues turn on the binding effect of the judgment and not on the order\u2019s value as precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\"> We note additionally that the \u201cpays the tax\u201d requirement of \u00a7 59 governed (and, with respect to nonassessed persons not encompassed by the St. 1977, c. 198, amendment, still governs) not only the board\u2019s jurisdiction over an appeal, but also the assessors\u2019 jurisdiction over abatement applications submitted by persons other than assessed owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The association\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpays the tax\u2019 as being satisfied by timely payment under the G.

L. c. 59, \u00a7 59, by St. Dominic\u2019s, the assessed owner. The sole question before us is whether St. 1977, c. 198, was enacted in time to confer jurisdiction upon the board over the association\u2019s undecided appeal from the assessors\u2019 decision. Cf. <em>City Council of Waltham </em>v. <em>Vinciullo, supra </em>(statute effective after entry of decree by Superior Court judge annulling variance granted by zoning board did not retroactively alter plaintiff\u2019s standing to appeal to Superior Court); <em>Martell </em>v. <em>Moffatt, </em>276 Mass. 174 (1931) (statute effective after appeal dismissed did not retroactively validate appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b408-6\"> The assessors denied the abatement on January 11, 1977. An appeal must be filed within three months of the assessors\u2019 decision. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 64.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The assessors do not suggest that St. 1980, c. 560, or similar statutes reviving otherwise expired rights to an abatement, see <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Center </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>388 Mass. 832, 838 (1983), are unconstitutional. The assessors\u2019 assertion that retroactive application of St. 1977, c. 198, would defeat a claim to the 1977 tax that became \u201cabsolute\u201d on April 11, 1977, is therefore ill-founded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Subsequent to the 1977 application and appeal, G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Third <em>(b), </em>was amended to require a \u2018 \u2018true copy\u201d of Form PC rather than a certification that Form PC had been filed. St. 1977, c. 992, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\"> Property held for \u2018 \u2018religious purposefs] \u2019 \u2019 is exempt from the Form PC filing requirement. G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 8F. We cannot on this record exclude the possibility that the association may be able to establish a factual predicate for a conclusion that St. Dominic\u2019s was using the property for purposes \u201creligious\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 8F, yet simultaneously \u201ccharitable\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Third. See <em>Assessors of Dover </em>v. <em>Dominican Fathers Province of St. Joseph, </em>334 Mass. 530 (1956) (properly owned by religious organization and used for religious education exempt under clause Third). As defined in the regulations promulgated by the division of public charities of the office of the Attorney General effective at the time of the 1977 appeal, the \u2018 \u2018religious purpose[s] \u2019 \u2019 exemption to G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 8F, was sufficiently broad to encompass some uses of property that might qualify the property for clause Third exemption. At oral argument, the association asserted that the practice of the Attorney General\u2019s office is to refuse Form PC\u2019s filed by organizations with a religious name such as St. Dominic\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">If the association can establish that St. Dominic\u2019s was entitled to a clause Third exemption, and that the Attorney General\u2019s office would not have required or accepted the filing of a Form PC, we do not think that St. Dominic\u2019s or the association can be faulted for the failure to file, or that such omission would operate as a jurisdictional bar to the 1980 application.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
