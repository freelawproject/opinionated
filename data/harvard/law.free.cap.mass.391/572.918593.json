L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, to hear a review and redetermination petition regarding a child in the custody of the Department of Social Services (department) pursuant to a care and protection proceeding. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24. We decide that jurisdiction over such petitions is properly in the Juvenile Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">This case has a lengthy procedural lineage, a phenomenon all too common in the child custody area. The minor was bom in January, 1977, and in June of that year the department filed a care and protection suit on her behalf in Juvenile Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Temporary custody was awarded to the department the following month, and the child was placed in a foster home. In July, 1978, the department was awarded permanent custody by the Juvenile Court, and the mother appealed its decision to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Superior Court affirmed the grant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>permanent custody to the department. The child and her mother appealed to the Appeals Court, and in a full opinion that court also affirmed. <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 2), </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 290 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Twelve days after the Appeals Court decision, the United States Supreme Court decided the case of <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745 (1982), in which it held that, where the termination of parents\u2019 rights over their child is at issue, a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidentiary standard (as opposed to a \u201cfair preponderance of the evidence\u201d) must be employed. <em>Id. </em>at 768-769. In response, the Appeals Court modified its disposition of the case by remanding it to the Superior Court judge for reconsideration in light of the decision in <em>Santosky. Custody of a Minor (No. 2), </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1088 (1982). On remand, the judge reaffirmed her decision. This determination was subsequently affirmed on appeal by the Appeals Court. 15 Mass. App. Ct. 1104 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">This decision of the Appeals Court, its third involving this case, was in January, 1983. In April, 1983, the mother and child<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> petitioned in the Juvenile Court for a review and redetermination of the child\u2019s needs, pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although a Juvenile Court judge initially allowed the petition and held a hearing, he subsequently dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. The petitioners then filed their review and redetermination request in the Superior Court, but that court also declined to exercise jurisdiction, noting that \u201c^jurisdiction appears to be in Juvenile Court.\u201d The mother and child appealed to the Appeals Court from both judgments, and we transferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the consolidated appeals to this court sua sponte. In essence, the parties ask us to decide whether the Juvenile or the Superior Court should hear the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Another court plays a role in these proceedings. The department has brought a petition under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 <em>(b), </em>in the Probate Court to dispense with the mother\u2019s consent to the adoption of the child by her foster parents.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In response, the mother has urged the Probate Court to dismiss the department\u2019s petition, on account of the pendency of the review and redeter-mination petitions filed in the Juvenile and Superior Courts. It appears that the Probate Court has not yet acted on the mother\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">1. All parties to this case agree that G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, unequivocally grants a right to the natural parents of a child committed to the custody of the department to request a review of that child\u2019s status on the periodic basis. We have little difficulty in deciding that the appropriate forum for the exercise of this review power is the Juvenile Court. \u201cThis court has often recognized the unique character of the Juvenile Courts as forums in which, to the extent possible, the best interests of the child serve to guide disposition.\u201d <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Dorchester Dist., </em>374 Mass. 640, 666 (1978). On account of its experience with juvenile matters, the Juvenile Court appears to be the natural locus for a proceeding which relies extensively on the assessment of a child\u2019s current well-being, and on the potentiality for a future return to or visitation by her parents. The Superior Court\u2019s involvement in the instant case is entirely a product of a previous statutory structure (see note 3, <em>supra), </em>which has been subsequently amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Although G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, does not specify in which \u201ccourt\u201d review and redetermination petitions should be filed, a survey of its immediate statutory surroundings indicates an intention by the Legislature to confer jurisdiction on the Juvenile Court. General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 24, explicitly provides that care and protection petitions should be initiated in the Juvenile Court (or in the juvenile session of a District Court), and it gives such courts authority to issue orders summoning a child and his parents before the court for adjudication of these petitions. The Juvenile Court may, under that section, issue an emergency order transferring custody of the child to the department. The section further authorizes the Juvenile Court to appoint an investigator to evaluate issues relating to the care and protection petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 26, essentially completes the process which G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24, began. General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 26, permits the \u201ccourt\u201d to adjudicate the petition, and, if a judgment that the child is in need of care and protection is made, to commit the child to the custody of the department. \u201cOn any petition filed in any court pursuant to this section,\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, also creates the review and redetermination right. We can find no judicial policy or statutory indication that this latter, continuing right to review was meant to be vested in a court different from the court in which the care and protection petition was initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">In a process already characterized by long delays, the transfer of the review and redetermination petition to the Superior Court would merely accentuate these problems. Although they are not controlling per se, the department\u2019s regulations also support the conclusion that G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, review and redetermi-nation petitions should be heard by the Juvenile Court. 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 234.064, 234.066 (1978). Since the Juvenile Court in the instant case has already appointed an investigator and conducted a hearing, significant interests of judicial efficiency and expedition are also served by its retention of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">2. The department also asks us to consolidate the review and redetermination proceeding with the pending Probate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>action to dispense with the mother\u2019s consent to adoption. The request is entirely proper, as it seeks finally to bring to a conclusion this seven-year odyssey of proceedings undertaken in multiple trial courts. While delays are often an inevitable product of resolving complex legal disputes, \u201c[n]o cases of any kind have a greater claim for expedition at all stages than those involving care and custody of children.\u201d <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>389 Mass. 755, 764 n.2 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The Legislature has recently emphasized the desirability of avoiding unnecessary delays in the litigation of custody and adoption disputes. Statute 1983, c. 437, was enacted on October 19, 1983, and it explicitly gives the Chief Administrative Justice of the Trial Court the authority to consolidate related custody and adoption actions brought initially in different trial courts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, the law permits a pending petition to dispense with consent to adoption (a G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 <em>(b), </em>action) to be heard immediately after the resolution of a review and redetermination or other care and protection proceeding (actions brought under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 24-27), by the same judge. In accordance with the statutory framework, the judge assigned to hear the respective actions would sit as a Juvenile Court judge during the adjudication of the care and protection issues, and would then sit as a Probate Court judge in hearing the petition to dispense with consent to adoption. In the instant case, we have issued an order to this effect (see note 1, <em>supra), </em>which directs that the Probate Court action be consolidated with the review and redetermination petition, and that a judge of the Juvenile Court begin to hear the latter petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Counsel for the mother raises various objections to the consolidation of the Probate and Juvenile Court actions. As an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>initial matter, it is argued that St. 1983, c. 437, may not be applied, to a case both filed and argued before the expiration of the ninety-day period which typically must elapse before statutes without emergency preambles become effective. Art. 48 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, The Referendum, I. However, the new statute comes within an exception to this general rule. As a law which \u201crelates to . . . the powers ... of courts,\u201d it cannot be made the subject of a referendum, and therefore takes effect in thirty days. Art. 48, The Referendum, III, \u00a7 2. G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 1. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yee, </em>361 Mass. 533, 537-538 (1972). The law took effect on November 18, 1983, over a month before the case was argued before this court. More importantly, the statute regulates procedure rather than substance, and therefore by its very nature applies retroactively to the commencement of these actions. <em>Goodwin Bros. Leasing </em>v. <em>Nousis, </em>373 Mass. 169, 173 (1977). <em>Kagan </em>v. <em>United Vacuum Appliance Corp., </em>357 Mass. 680, 683 (1970). <em>Hanscom </em>v. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Gas Light Co., 220 </em>Mass. 1, 3 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Even if St. 1983, c. 437, is not applied retroactively to the currently pending actions, the Chief Administrative Justice would have authority to order consolidation pursuant to his general authority under G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This statute was part of the Court Reorganization Act, which was aimed at consolidating judicial resources into a unified and efficient trial court. In interpreting G. L. c. 211B, \u00a7 9, we have stated that \u201cit is axiomatic that the Chief Administrative Justice possesses not only that authority specifically granted to him by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>statute, but also the authority to employ all ordinary means reasonably necessary for the full exercise of the powers granted to him and the duties imposed upon him.\u201d <em>Clerk of the Superior Court for the County of Middlesex </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>386 Mass. 517, 522 (1982). In accordance with this implied authority, in 1981 the Chief Administrative Justice issued an informational memorandum discussing his G. L. c. 21 IB, \u00a7 9, powers, which include the ability to assign a judge \u201cto sit simultaneously as a justice of several Departments to reduce delay and duplication in actions pending in the Trial Court.\u201d Informational Memorandum: Procedure for Requesting Judicial Assignments to Address Related Actions Entered in Different Departments of the Trial Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">This description of situations appropriate for the exercise of the Chief Administrative Justice\u2019s consolidation power is clearly applicable to the instant case, where a combination of an extended procedural history and the sensitive personal issues at stake makes its expedited resolution imperative. Consolidation is not an unfamiliar tool in the child custody contest, <em>Cennami </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 403, 415 (1977), and its use has been suggested in other cases where personal rights may be harmed by delay. See, e.g., <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>390 Mass. 489, 499 (1983) (competency and substituted judgment determinations). Certainly, it appears far more desirable to consolidate the related Probate Court proceeding than simply to dismiss it, as urged by counsel for the mother. See <em>Konstan-topoulos </em>v. <em>Whately, </em>384 Mass. 123, 129-130 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The mother also opposes the department\u2019s consolidation request on the ground that initiating a G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 <em>(b), </em>adoption proceeding is premised upon \u201ccare and custody\u201d being in the department, a condition which she says is not fulfilled on account of the pending, unresolved review and redeterm-ination action. The mother relies on our recent decision in <em>Adoption of a Minor, </em>386 Mass. 741, 748 (1982), in which we held that \u201cthe bare fact of physical care\u201d is not enough to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>establish \u201ccustody\u201d for the purposes of a petition for adoption without parental consent. In that case, the mother was in the process of actively appealing a custody award when the petition for adoption without parental consent was filed, and we ruled that the custody dispute should be resolved before adjudication of the adoption action.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">This holding is not inconsistent with our decision today. First, in the instant case the care and protection proceeding as far as the custody award is concerned has been concluded, and the mother has effectively utilized all her available rights of appeal. This is quite unlike the situation of the mother in <em>Adoption of a Minor, supra, </em>who had only progressed to the initial appeals stage of the custody award process, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 27, when the foster parents\u2019 adoption petition was filed. Further, in the instant case, we have directed the judge assigned to hear these actions to schedule them seriatim, with the review and redetermination petition to be heard prior to the petition to dispense with consent to adoption. This was done so as to preserve the \u201corderly progression\u201d of the statutory scheme, <em>Adoption of a Minor, </em>386 Mass. at 748, while at the same time expediting that progression in a manner not prejudicial to any of the parties involved. The concerns that caused us to approve the dismissal of the adoption petition in <em>Adoption of a Minor, supra, </em>such as the prospect of conflicting orders rendered by different courts, simply do not pertain in the instant case, and indeed are actively circumvented by the consolidated trial procedure.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-7\"> On February 17, 1984, we issued the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">\u201cThese are consolidated appeals of actions brought pursuant to G.
