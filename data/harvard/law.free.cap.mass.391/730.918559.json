(1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981). The Attorney General brought this action to compel the defendants to comply with \u00a7 47B. The defendants argued that \u00a7 47B is preempted by ERISA. A judge of the Superior Court ordered the defendants to comply with \u00a7 47B, and we affirmed. 385 Mass. 598 (1982). The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. That Court vacated our judgment and remanded for further consideration in light of its intervening decision in <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, </em>463 U.S. 85 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">ERISA applies to all employee benefit plans except those specifically exempt under ERISA \u00a7 4(b), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003(b) (1976). ERISA explicitly preempts \u201cany and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan,\u201d ERISA \u00a7 514 (a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144 (a) (1976), except that it does not \u201cexempt or relieve any person from any law of any State which regulates insurance, banking, or securities.\u201d ERISA \u00a7 514 (b) (2) (A), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144 (b) (2) (A) (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, ERISA may not \u201cbe construed to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or supersede any law of the United States.\u201d ERISA \u00a7 514 (d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144 (d) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">In <em>Shaw, </em>the plaintiffs sought declarations that two New York State laws are preempted by ERISA in so far as they apply to benefit plans subject to ERISA. One, the Human Rights Law, forbids discrimination in employment on the basis of sex and has been held to prohibit treating pregnancy differently from other nonoccupational disabilities. See <em>Shaw, supra </em>at 88-89. The other, the Disability Benefits Law, requires employers to provide the same benefits for pregnancy as for other nonoccupational disabilities. See <em>id. </em>at 89-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>The Supreme Court had \u201cno difficulty\u201d concluding, on the basis of plain language and legislative history, that both laws \u201crelate to\u201d employee benefit plans within the meaning of ERISA \u00a7 514 (a), the general preemption provision. <em>Id. </em>at 95-100. It rejected the s\u00fcggestions that the preemption provision could be interpreted \u201cto pre-empt only state laws dealing with the subject matters covered by ERISA \u2014 reporting, disclosure, fiduciary responsibility, and the like.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98. In addition, the Court emphasized \u201cCongress\u2019 goal of ensuring that employers would not face \u2018conflicting or inconsistent State and local regulation of employee benefit plans.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105, quoting 120 Cong. Rec. 29,933 (1974) (remarks of Senator Williams). It noted the \u201cinefficiency\u201d that would result from requiring interstate employers to conform to differing State requirements. <em>Shaw, supra </em>at 105 &amp; n.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">With respect to the Human Rights Law, the <em>Shaw </em>defendants argued that, because State fair employment laws play an integral role in the enforcement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, construing \u00a7 514 (a) to preempt the Human Rights Law would impair Federal law and thus violate \u00a7 514 (d). The Supreme Court, however, decided that the \u201cminor practical difficulties\u201d for Title VII enforcement \u201cdo not represent the kind of \u2018impairment\u2019 or \u2018modification\u2019 of <em>federal </em>law that can save a <em>state </em>law from pre-emption under \u00a7 514(d)\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">With respect to the Disability Benefits Law, the <em>Shaw </em>defendants argued that because plans \u201c \u2018maintained solely for the purpose of complying with applicable . . . disability insurance laws\u2019 \u201d are exempt from ERISA coverage under \u00a7 4(b)(3), the law could not be preempted by \u00a7 514 (a). The Supreme Court decided that \u201c\u00a7 4(b)(3) excludes \u2018plans,\u2019 not portions of plans, from ERISA coverage; those portions of the [plaintiffs\u2019] multi-benefit plans maintained to comply with the Disability Benefits Law, therefore, are not exempt from ERISA and are not subject to state regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106. The Court stated, however, that the State could enforce its law by compelling the employer \u201cto choose between providing disability benefits in a separately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>administered plan and including the state-mandated benefits in its ERISA plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">We conclude that nothing in the <em>Shaw </em>opinion requires that we change the result we previously reached in this case. To hold that \u00a7 47B is preempted would frustrate a strong State policy of encouraging the prompt and thorough treatment of mental disorders. It may be argued, on the basis of intimations in <em>Shaw, </em>that the Supreme Court would reach a different result, but we decline to anticipate such a ruling. We think that nothing in the congressional language or in the language of the Supreme Court requires us to sacrifice our State policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The defendants make much of the Supreme Court\u2019s characterization of the exceptions to \u00a7 514 (a) as \u201cnarrow.\u201d However, we view this characterization by the Court as dictum.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to \u00a7 514 (a), the only exceptions to preemption are those provided for in subsection (b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> yet, the Supreme Court did not construe that subsection in <em>Shaw. </em>One of the provisions it construed is a narrowly phrased <em>exemption </em>from ERISA coverage, not an <em>exception </em>to preemption. See ERISA \u00a7 4 (b) (3). The other provision, although treated as an exception by the Supreme Court, is not phrased as an exception and would rarely, if ever, function as such. See ERISA \u00a7 514 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Unlike the provisions at issue in <em>Shaw, </em>the insurance exception to preemption is phrased very broadly: <em>\u201cnothing </em>in this subchapter shall be construed to exempt or relieve <em>any </em>person from <em>any </em>law of any State which regulates insurance ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). ERISA \u00a7 514 (b) (2) (A), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144 (b) (2) (A) (1976). We have interpreted this provision to save from preemption only those State laws that do not conflict with the policies or operation of ERISA. See 385 Mass. 607-609. This interpretation is relatively narrow; we rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>broad interpretation which was accepted in <em>Wadsworth </em>v. <em>Whaland, </em>562 F.2d 70, 77-78 (1st Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 980 (1978), and <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Whaland, </em>119 N.H. 894, 902 (1979). That the Supreme Court has rejected a conflict-based analysis as producing too narrow an interpretation of the broadly phrased preemption provision does not imply that it would reject a conflict-based analysis as producing too broad an interpretation of the broadly phrased insurance exception. We adhere to our prior interpretation of,the exception.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The <em>Shaw </em>opinion does provide support for the defendants\u2019 argument that Congress intended to curtail State police power in order to enable interstate employers to maintain uniform plans. The Supreme Court concluded that this was indeed Congress\u2019s intent. See 463 U.S. at 98-100, 103-105. This conclusion is based on the key phrase in the legislative history: \u201cconflicting and inconsistent State and local regulation. \u201d This phrase is as susceptible of our interpretation \u2014 i.e., conflicting and inconsistent with Federal law, see 385 Mass. at 607-608 &amp; n.16 \u2014 as of the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation \u2014 i.e., conflicting and inconsistent among the States, see 463 U.S. at 104-105 &amp; n.25. Nonetheless, we must accept as authoritative the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Congress\u2019s intent to preclude the States from mandating employee benefits does not require that we change the result in this case. \u201c[T]he court cannot read into a statute an intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>that is not there expressed in plain words or by necessary implication.\u201d <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Haverhill, </em>311 Mass. 572, 578 (1942). <em>See Bate Refrigerating Co. </em>v. <em>Sulzberger, </em>157 U.S. 1, 36-37 (1895) (Harlan, J.); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>366 Mass. 351, 354-355 (1974). The intent ascribed to Congress by the Supreme Court is consistent with the broad language of the preemption provision. It is inconsistent, however, with the broad language of the insurance exception. The <em>Shaw </em>case did not require the Supreme Court to strain the language of the statute in order to give effect to the legislative intent. But to conclude that a State cannot mandate employee benefits indirectly through its insurance laws would require an unnaturally narrow reading of the phrase \u201cany law . . . which regulates insurance.\u201d Mandated coverage is within the States\u2019 traditional authority to regulate insurance. \u201c[UJnless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 349 (1971). <em>See Wadsworth v. Whaland, supra </em>at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Because we treat the reference in \u00a7 47B to \u201cany employees\u2019 health and welfare fund\u201d as preempted, and the remaining language of the statute as severable (see note 2, <em>supra), </em>the statute as we consider it makes no attempt to regulate employee benefit plans directly. Nor is it an attempt to do indirectly what cannot be done directly. The statute applies to health and accident insurance policies, whether issued to employee benefit plans or not. Unquestionably, a large proportion of such policies is unrelated to such plans. Thus the statute is not an attempt to intrude upon the sphere reserved to ERISA, but rather a bona fide regulation of insurance. It is within the spirit, as well as the letter, of the insurance exception to ERISA preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">We conclude that the decision in <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, </em>463 U.S. 85 (1983), does not require us to change our prior decision that \u00a7 47B is not preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b746-16\"> General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 47B, inserted by St. 1973, c. 1174, \u00a7 2, provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny blanket or general policy of insurance ... or any policy of accident and sickness insurance <em>... or any employees\u2019 health and welfare fund </em>which provides hospital expense and surgical expense bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>fits . . . shall provide benefits for expense . . . arising from mental or nervous conditions ...\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">We treat, as we did in the earlier opinion of this court (385 Mass. 598, 600 [1982]), the language referring to employees\u2019 health and welfare funds (emphasized above) as not preempted and as severable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b747-9\"> Other exceptions to ERISA\u2019s general preemption clause are not relevant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\"> As the defendants pointed out in oral argument, the <em>Shaw </em>opinion \u201cwent out of its way\u201d to stress the narrowness of the exception clauses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b749-9\"> ERISA \u00a7 514 (a) (1976), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144 (a) (1976), provides in part: \u201cExcept as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan described in section 1003 (a) of this title and not exempt under section 1003 (b) of this title.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\"> Our conflict-based interpretation of the exception can be supported under an alternative analysis. We could conclude, as in the <em>Whaland </em>cases, that because \u00a7 47B regulates insurance it is automatically within the exception and thus removed from the operation of the preemption clause. That conclusion need not end the analysis. Laws that interfere with a congressional scheme of comprehensive regulation are preempted without any need for a preemption clause. See, e.g., <em>Burbank </em>v. <em>Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 624 (1973). A law which purported to regulate insurance but interfered with the congressional scheme of regulating the administration of employee benefit plans could be within the exception yet nonetheless preempted. As we noted before, \u201cSection 47B affects only the substantive content of plans \u2014 a subject completely untouched by ERISA\u2019s regulatory provisions.\u201d 385 Mass. at 607.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Wilkins, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO9\">(dissenting). I disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion that ERISA does not preempt the mandate of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 47B, as to minimum mental health care coverage under certain insurance policies. The Supreme Court\u2019s unanimous opinion in <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, </em>463 U.S. 85 (1983), indicates forcefully that that Court would not grant wide scope to the insurance exception expressed in ERISA \u00a7 514 (b) (2) (A). <em>Id. </em>at 104. The <em>Shaw </em>opinion tells us that exemptions, and, I think, exceptions from preemption are to be read narrowly because a contrary view would destroy the option of a multistate employer to have a uniform ERISA plan and because any special State requirement for a disability plan could be provided as a separate administrative unit. <em>Id. </em>at 105-108.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 47B, is not a law \u201cwhich regulates insurance\u201d within the meaning of ERISA \u00a7 514 (b) (2) (A). As applied to employers, \u00a7 47B concerns health benefits that an employer must provide, by insurance or otherwise, if the employer provides any such benefits at all, and as to employee benefits \u00a7 47B only incidentally regulates insurance. Section 47B represents precisely that form of local intrusion on ERISA covered benefit plans that ERISA intends to prevent. See <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kramarsky, </em>725 F.2d 146, 148 (2d Cir. 1983). Congress has adopted an all-inclusive preemption scheme, and it is now clear, in light of the <em>Shaw </em>opinion, that it is irrelevant whether State law dictating plan benefits conflicts with the substantive policies of ERISA.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
