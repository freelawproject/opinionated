Gioioso &amp; Sons, Inc. (Gioioso), sought relief in the Appeals Court, pursuant to the first paragraph of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, from a preliminary injunction issued by a Superior Court judge in an action by The Modem Continental Construction Co., Inc. (Modem Continental). The preliminary injunction restrains Lowell from awarding a contract to Gioioso or any other party for the construction of a regional and municipal interceptor<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> until the project is rebid in accordance with the requirements of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H. A single justice of the Appeals Court refused to order that the injunction be dissolved. However, because he considered the injunction as essentially dis-positive of the merits of the action, and because important questions of law were raised, he directed that the appeal pursuant to the second paragraph of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, be ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>pedited. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We perceive no error in the order enjoining Lowell, and remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">1. <em>Factual background and prior proceedings. </em>In the summer of 1983, Lowell invited bids for the interceptor project. The project will require construction of approximately two and one-half miles of sewer pipeline and two pumping stations. One prefabricated pumping station will be situated below ground. The other, the Beaver Brook station, combines a subterranean diversion structure with a pumping station constructed on top of it. The Beaver Brook station is the subject of the present controversy. Both of the pumping stations will contain equipment and are intended to be fully automated. The Beaver Brook station will also include certain amenities, such as telephones and a rest room.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The city\u2019s advertisements concerning the project.stated that Lowell would proceed \u201cin strict accordance\u201d with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44L, and other applicable laws.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201cInformation for Bidders\u201d section of the advertisement stated further that bidding would proceed in accordance with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44L,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number><em>and </em>G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Filed subbids were required only as to the Beaver Brook pumping station. In all other respects, the bidding and award procedure followed the requirements of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">At the bid opening, Gioioso was the apparent low bidder and Modem Continental the third lowest among the bids submitted. Modem Continental then protested that the project in its entirety should have been offered for bids under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, that bidder prequalification was required, that the bids must be rejected and the project rebid in accordance with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H. Following a hearing before Lowell officials affording the three lowest bidders an opportunity to present oral and written statements, Lowell rejected Modem Continental\u2019s contentions and affirmed its plan to award the contract to Gioioso. Modem Continental then submitted its protest to the Department of Labor and Industries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>(department),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which conducted an informal conference attended by Lowell, Modem Continental, Gioioso, and other interested parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The department issued an administrative decision stating that, because Lowell had offered for bids the project as a whole, it \u201chad no choice under the law but to bid pursuant to Chapter 149, Section 44A-H.\u201d The department reasoned that the Beaver Brook pumping station was a \u201cbuilding\u201d within the ordinary meaning of that word, and as a \u201cbuilding\u201d which costs more than $5,000, it would be subject to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H. The public works aspect of the project was not controlling. The department saw no limitation within G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, to contracts <em>\u201csolely </em>for the constmction of a public building.\u201d The department rejected Gioioso\u2019s argument that the dominant purpose of the contract, whether primarily for public buildings or public works, should control which statute applies. The department offered Lowell two bidding options. First, Lowell might offer for bids the entire project under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H. Alternatively, Lowell might split the project into separate public building and public work components, using the respective procedures of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, for the \u201cbuilding\u201d part of the project and G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M, for the \u201cpublic works\u201d component. The department ordered Lowell to reject all bids and to rebid the project in conformity with the options offered by the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The following week, Lowell notified the department in writing of its intent to award the interceptor project contract to Gioioso. Modem Continental then commenced this action for declaratory and injunctive relief seeking an injunction to order Lowell to refrain from awarding the contract until the project was rebid under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H. In affidavits submitted to the Superior Court, Lowell opposed Modem Continental\u2019s request for preliminary relief by stating that the delay caused by rebidding would cost an additional $25,000, require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>additional legal, engineering, and administrative efforts for which Lowell could not seek State or Federal reimbursement, require Lowell to bear the difference in cost between the original bids and the resubmitted bids, and subject the city to fines owing to delay in implementing pollution control measures. Further, Lowell represented that the division and other State agencies had advised the city that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, were inapplicable to the project.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Lowell\u2019s consulting engineers stated that subbids for Beaver Brook were recommended to Lowell only to enhance competition. The engineers had telephoned the division prior to Lowell\u2019s advertisement for bids, and were told bidder prequalification was not required. The consulting engineers cited the existence of serious health hazards posed by Lowell\u2019s river pollution problems, a delay of six months before commencing the project if rebidding were required, and enhanced nonreimbursable costs as reasons for not requiring rebidding. Furthermore, the engineers noted they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>had reviewed Gioioso\u2019s qualifications after the bid opening, and based on that review had recommended to Lowell that Gioioso receive the contract award. Gioioso\u2019s affidavit averred that it had made significant expenditures in bidding and in anticipation of commencing the project, that delays caused by rebidding would mean the project could not be undertaken until the following spring, that inflation would raise the contract price by ten per cent, that Gioioso had not been subject to prequalification on other sewer pipeline and pumping station projects, and that it previously had been prequalified by Lowell.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">The judge granted Modem Continental\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction without opinion or findings, and this appeal ensued. On appeal, Lowell and Gioioso press the following arguments: first, that Modem Continental lacks standing to request injunctive relief; second, that Modem Continental is estopped from requesting injunctive relief; third, that Modem Continental makes no showing of irreparable harm sufficient to obtain injunctive relief; fourth, that Modem Continental\u2019s contention that the project is subject to G. L. c. 149 is without merit; and fifth, that if G. L. c. 149 applies, deviations from its requirements were minor and do not require rejection of all bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">2. <em>Standing. </em>Lowell and Gioioso argue that Modem Continental lacks standing to pursue the instant action because Modem Continental has failed to allege irreparable harm as a result of Lowell\u2019s awarding the contract to Gioioso. The defendants confuse the issue of standing with the requirement of demonstrating irreparable harm in obtaining preliminary in-junctive relief. It is well established that parties challenging compliance with the bidding procedures set forth in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, need not meet rigid \u201cbut for\u201d standing requirements by asserting that if there had been compliance with the statute, they certainly would have been awarded the contract. The challenging party need show only that it possessed the potential to obtain the award. The right to consideration in the event the apparent low bidder is rejected is the interest protected by the flexible standing requirements of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H. <em>Quincy Ornamental Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number><em>Findlen, </em>353 Mass. 85, 87-88 (1967). If the situation were otherwise, the important role played by individual bidders in securing compliance with the bidding statutes and legislative policy objectives would be diminished.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">3. <em>Estoppel. </em>The defendants cite Modem Continental\u2019s failure to question Lowell regarding the applicability of pre-qualification procedures before the bid opening as requiring the application of the doctrine of estoppel to Modem Continental\u2019s case. The defendants assert that Modem Continental was obliged to notify Lowell during the bidding period of its belief that prequalification was necessary. This argument falls wide of the mark for two reasons. First, as the awarding authority, Lowell is charged with compliance with the bidding statutes; Lowell itself advertised that its procedures would comply with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H. There is no basis for believing that Lowell in any way relied to its detriment on Modem Continental. <em>Datatrol Inc. </em>v. <em>State Purchasing Agent, </em>379 Mass. 679, 690-691 (1980). Secondly, we do not perceive that Modem Continental\u2019s silence during the bidding procedure constitutes the type of conduct requisite to establish the defense of estoppel. It is impossible to imagine how the awarding authority, which is charged with statutory compliance and which represented to bidders its intent to comply with the statute, suffered any injury justifying assertion of this equitable defense. If by estoppel Lowell and Gioioso actually mean \u201claches,\u201d that argument has some substance, but will not carry the day. It is true enough that the problems presented by the instant litigation could have been averted had Lowell decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>before the bid opening, at Modem Continental\u2019s suggestion, to comply with prequalification requirements. This hypothetical solution, however, is merely that. We fail to see how Lowell has been injured by any inaction on Modem Continental\u2019s part. If Lowell had complied with the department\u2019s decision, much of the delay of which it now complains would have been avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">4. <em>Propriety of injunctive relief. </em>Lowell and Gioioso contend that Modem Continental failed to present sufficient evidence of irreparable harm to warrant preliminary injunctive relief. The defendants also assert that even if Modem Continental has sustained its burden, on balance Lowell and Gioioso will suffer greater injury, owing to the delays which rebidding will cause in commencing construction, the costs of rebidding, the inflationary impact of delay, and the harm to the public interest occasioned by continued pollution in the Merrimack River.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The standards for awarding or denying preliminary relief, and for appellate review of such decisions, are set forth in detail in <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>380 Mass. 609, 610-618 (1980). Our discussion in that case permits us to conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in granting injunctive relief. The department\u2019s directive indicates that Modem Continental had a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits. Second, if the contract were awarded to Gioioso without rebidding, Modem Continental\u2019s opportunity for consideration as a bidder would be forever lost, and its remedy at law for the damages incurred in preparing its bid falls far short of being the equivalent of the potential to win the contract. See <em>Paul Sardella Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Braintree Hous. Auth., </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 326, 333-335 (1975), <em>S.C., </em>371 Mass. 235, 243 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">On balance, the equities do not favor Lowell and Gioioso. First, had Lowell adhered to the department\u2019s decision and rebid the contract immediately, it is likely that Lowell and Gioioso would have been able to avail themselves of Gioioso\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>previously prepared prequalification statements.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Second, this court is unpersuaded that enhanced administrative costs are sufficient to justify the denial of injunctive relief where the agency\u2019s own actions have necessitated such expenditures. Cf. <em>Interstate Eng\u2019g Corp. </em>v. <em>Fitchburg, </em>367 Mass. 751, 760-761 n.16 (1975). The harm to the public by preserving the status quo must be viewed in light <em>of </em>the minimal harm that would have ensued had Lowell complied with the injunction rather than pursued this appeal. Finally, although the harm to Gioioso in having had its prior bid information made public is a detriment to it in the next bidding, Gioioso\u2019s individual interest is not sufficiently compelling to permit a deviation from the bidding statute\u2019s requirements. If some bidder inequality results from rebidding now, it is the result of the awarding authority\u2019s misperception of its duties. In sum, we perceive no abuse of discretion on the part of the judge in granting preliminary relief to Modem Continental.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">5. <em>Interpretation ofG. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M, and G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H. </em>The parties and amici curiae request this court to clarify the meaning of \u201cbuilding\u201d as used in the bidding statutes so that awarding authorities will be able to proceed with certainty in choosing the statute pursuant to which they will invite bids. Modem Continental argues that the pumping station is a \u201cbuilding\u201d in the ordinary sense of the word and that because the cost of the pumping station is significant in proportion to the entire project, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, must be applied. Lowell and Gioioso state that the \u201cfundamental purpose\u201d of the project should be determinative of the proper bidding statute. The Inspector General, as amicus, argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>that the pumping station is merely \u201cincidental\u201d to the sewer project. The Inspector General cites evidence of legislative intent to exempt \u201chorizontal construction\u201d from the revisions of G. L. c. 149, and urges this court to adopt the reasoning of the division, which would permit awarding authorities to determine whether a \u201cbuilding\u201d is \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201cincidental\u201d to resolve this problem. We disagree with all of these contentions, for they invite the court to legislate. In view of the plethora of cases in which the word \u201cbuilding\u201d has been construed, the difficulty which this everyday word, used in its \u201cordinary sense,\u201d has caused does not escape us.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, we are uncomfortable with the division\u2019s memorandum in that tests as to whether a building is \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201cincidental\u201d may promote the type of subjective judgments by awarding authorities that the comprehensive legislative scheme embodied in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, was intended to prevent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We think clarification of this issue is a matter for the Legislature, and we note that the subject of fair bidding procedures is one which is receiving ongoing legislative attention. See 1983 House Doc. No. 6450. We have previously noted that statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>must be interpreted as enacted and statutory omissions cannot be supplied by the court. See <em>Pacella </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>339 Mass. 338, 342 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">6. <em>Substantial statutory compliance. </em>Lowell and Gioioso argue that if this court were to hold, as it does, that c. 149 should be applied to this project, then rebidding is still unnecessary in view of Lowell\u2019s substantial compliance with statutory requirements. They point to Lowell\u2019s consulting engineer\u2019s verification of Gioioso\u2019s qualifications as support for the proposition that the contract award will in fact go to the lowest responsible and eligible bidder, thereby fulfilling the legislative purpose of c. 149. We cannot agree. We have repeatedly stated that the purpose of competitive bidding statutes is not only to ensure that the awarding authority obtain the lowest price among responsible contractors, but also to establish an open and honest procedure for competition for public contracts. <em>James J. Welch &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Deputy Comm\u2019 r of Capital Planning &amp; Operations, </em>387 Mass. 662, 666 (1982). Toward those ends, these statutes are to be construed strictly. <em>Poorvu Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Nelson Elec. Co., </em>335 Mass. 545, 552 (1957). We have distinguished matters of substance, requiring strict compliance, and matters of formality, which may be corrected without harm to statutory design. <em>Gil-Bern Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Brockton, </em>353 Mass. 503, 505-506 (1968). Bidder prequalification is no mere formality; it is a cornerstone of the competitive bidding statute. The good faith of Lowell is insufficient to overcome this substantial deviation from the statutory requirement. <em>Sweezey </em>v. <em>Mayor of Malden, </em>273 Mass. 536, 540 (1931). <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>253 Mass. 247, 254 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The interlocutory order on the preliminary injunction is affirmed.

The legislative enactment, \u201cAn Act to improve the system of public construction in the commonwealth,\u201d states as its purpose the provision of a system of public construction which reflects fair costs, professionalism, and accountability, and which \u201creduces opportunities for corruption, favoritism, and political influence in the award and administration of public contracts.\u201d St. 1980, c. 579, \u00a7 55. To that end, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A (2), requires that \u201cevery contract for the construction ... of <em>any building </em>by a public agency estimated to cost more than five thousand dollars shall be awarded to the lowest responsible and eligible general bidder on the basis of competitive bids in accordance with the procedure set forth in the provisions of section forty-four A through H, inclusive, of this chapter\u201d (emphasis added). Section 44D of c. 149 requires bidders to submit prequalification statements to the awarding authority (unless the bidder has filed such a statement with the authority or the division of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>capital planning and operations [division] within the previous year) along with applications to bid. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (1). The prequalification statement serves to certify the bidder\u2019s financial status, experience, and other information related to qualifications and responsibility. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (1) <em>(a). </em>The awarding authority (or the division) is charged with evaluating and rating all prequalification statements, and causing the publication of names of eligible bidders. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (3). After this process is completed, general bids may be submitted by prequalified bidders only. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (3), (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">In addition to the above procedure, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44F, requires submission of subbids for specified subtrades on all building contracts subject to G.

G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 39A. In 1982, a deputy commissioner of the division issued a memorandum concerning determinations by contract awarding authorities to proceed according to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, or to utilize G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M, involving less administrative complexity. The division took the position that the \u201ctechnical nature\u201d of a given project would dictate the applicable statute. Contracts for \u201cbuildings\u201d costing more than $5,000 require prequalification under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D; contracts for any \u201cpublic work\u201d not involving buildings or costing less than $5,000 may be bid under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M. According to the division, the determination whether a project involves a \u201cbuilding\u201d is the critical first choice in assessing the proper bidding procedure. Where projects may be of a mixed nature, the division distinguished building work which is \u201csignificant,\u201d thereby requiring implementation of c. 149 procedures, from that which is \u201cincidental.\u201d \u201cIncidental\u201d building work, involving a small cost in proportion to an entire project, could be bid under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M. Recognizing that many projects might not lend themselves to clear distinctions, the division advised awarding authorities that they were free to choose whichever statute reasonably related to the practical criteria they suggested. The division\u2019s memorandum effectively restates the advice of an earlier opinion of the Attorney General, wherein employee maintenance facilities budgeted at two to four percent of an entire dam project were considered insufficient to require characterization of the project as one for public buildings.

No. 12, at 151 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b852-6\"> In <em>Quincy Ornamental Iron Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Findlen, supra </em>at 87, this court stated: \u201cIt is well established that a bidder on a contract governed by G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44L, has standing to challenge the compliance of the awarding authority with the requirements of those sections.\" There is no question but that Modem Continental in fact was a bidder on the Lowell project. This court does not wish to encourage the litigation of petty grievances by disappointed bidders; however, the tradition of according standing so long as a project bid has been submitted has strong support in our case law. See <em>Datatrol Inc. </em>v. <em>State Purchasing Agent, </em>379 Mass. 679, 690 (1980), and cases cited; <em>Interstate Eng\u2019g Corp. </em>v. <em>Fitchburg, </em>367 Mass. 751, 755-756 n.6 (1975); <em>Industrial Eng\u2019g &amp; Metal Fabricators, Inc. </em>v. <em>Poorvu Constr. Co., </em>354 Mass. 287, 290 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b854-6\"> General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 44D, provides in part: \u201cNo . . . entity may bid on a general contract subject to the provisions of [section] forty-four A unless s/he shall furnish to the awarding authority . . . (i) a prequalification statement, <em>unless such . . . entity has filed a prequalification statement under the same name with any awarding authority subject to the aforesaid provisions or with the division of capital planning and operations within the past twelve months </em>...\u201d (emphasis added). Gioioso\u2019s affidavit indicates it had been prequalified by Lowell within the year prior to the department\u2019s decision. We fail to see <em>any </em>additional burden on Gioioso resulting from requiring prequalification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b855-5\">See, e.g., <em>Deary </em>v. <em>Dudley, </em>343 Mass. 192, 194 (1961) (sewer not a building); <em>James Constr.

Rep. A. G. Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 151-152 (1963). There the Attorney General declined to adopt a rigid view of the word \u201cbuilding,\u201d stating that a structure which cost only two to four percent of an entire project was merely an appurtenance, and did not necessitate application of c. 149 procedures. The difficulty with such an approach is readily apparent upon examination of the parties\u2019 representations in this case. In Gioioso\u2019s view, the pumping station cost represents eight per cent of the total bid; Modern Continental, however, calculates that the pumping station involves thirty-five percent of the project. Mathematical peregrinations of this sort could only breed further litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
