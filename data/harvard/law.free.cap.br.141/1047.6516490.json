GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1282-25\">This case began as a proof of claim filed in February 1989 by First City National Bank of Beaumont (\u201cthe Bank\u201d) in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding of Sam E. Ford and Marcia Ford. The trustee for the Fords\u2019 estate objected to the Bank\u2019s claim on the grounds that it is a \u201ccontingent claim\u201d and that, pursuant to section 502(c)(1) of Title 11, the Fords\u2019 estate is therefore liable only for an estimated portion of the Bank\u2019s claim. The bankruptcy court agreed and concluded that the Bank\u2019s claim must be estimated pursuant to section 502(c)(1). The Bank appealed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, which \u2014 finding that the Bank\u2019s claim is not contingent and, therefore, that the Fords\u2019 liability should not be estimated pursuant to section 502(c)(1) \u2014 vacated the bankruptcy court\u2019s order and remanded the case back to the bankruptcy court. 125 B.R. 735. The Fords appeal. Finding that the Bank\u2019s claim is not contingent, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">On November 14, 1988, the Fords filed a voluntary petition in Bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the United States Code. The Bank filed a proof of claim against the Fords\u2019 estate based on two notes \u2014 a real estate lien note in the original amount of $1,200,000<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a promissory note in the original amount of $308,903.67.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Bank\u2019s overall claim is for. $1,555,-489.48 \u2014 the total amount outstanding on these notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">On October 4, 1989, the trustee for the Fords\u2019 estate filed an objection to the Bank\u2019s claim pursuant to section 502(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, asserting that the Bank\u2019s claim is a \u201ccontingent claim\u201d \u2014 that is, a claim in which, pursuant to section 502(c)(1) of Title 11,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> outstanding liability is divisible by the number of signatures or makers of the underlying notes, and each maker is then responsible only for his or her estimated share.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court conducted a hearing on this objection, determined that the Bank\u2019s claim is contingent, and concluded that the claim must be estimated pursuant to section 502(c)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trustee does not argue that the Bank\u2019s claim is \u201cunliquidated\u201d for purposes of section 502(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">The Bank appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s final order to federal district court. The district court held that (1) the outstanding debt giving rise to the Bank\u2019s claim is not contingent, (2) the bankruptcy court, therefore, had no authority to employ a section 502 estimation of the Bank\u2019s claim, and (3) the Bank is entitled to the full amount of its proof of claim. Accordingly, the district court vacated the bankruptcy court\u2019s order and remanded the Bank\u2019s claim to the bankruptcy court. The Fords appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-10\">While bankruptcy does not wash away a creditor\u2019s state law rights and rem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>edies, it does alter the creditor\u2019s ability to enforce claims. <em>See In re Brints Cotton Mrkg., Inc., </em>737 F.2d 1338, 1341 (5th Cir.1984) (\u201c[W]hile state law ordinarily determines what claims of creditors are valid and subsisting obligations, a bankruptcy court is entitled ... to determine how and what claims are allowable....\u201d) (citation omitted). Accordingly, (a) the validity of the Bank's underlying claim and Mr. Ford\u2019s status as co-maker or guarantor is controlled by Texas state law,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (b) but whether the Bank is allowed to enforce its claim is a matter of federal law and the bankruptcy court\u2019s exercise of equitable powers. <em>See In re Shelter Enterprises, </em>98 B.R. 224, 229 (\u201cState substantive law determines the existence of a claim; however, its allowance or disallowance is a matter of federal law and is left to the bankruptcy court\u2019s exercise of equitable powers.\u201d), <em>amended on other grounds, </em>99 B.R. 668 (Bankr.W.D.Pa.1989) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-8\">We begin by determining the validity of the Bank\u2019s claim and Mr. Ford\u2019s status under Texas law. Mr. Ford signed the real estate lien note both individually and as a partner of the Jefferson Group.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the real estate loan explicitly provides that each maker is liable for the entire amount of the note. The Bank\u2019s promissory note states on its face that each maker is jointly and severally liable. Under Texas law, this makes Mr. Ford \u2014 along with his partners \u2014 a \u201cco-maker\u201d jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of the real estate note,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Mr. Ford and Martin are each fully liable for the entire amount of their promissory note. <em>See </em>Tex.Bus. &amp; Com.Code Ann. \u00a7 3.118(5) (West 1968) <em>(iquoted supra </em>note 7); <em>Clark v. Dedina, </em>658 S.W.2d 293, 298 (Tex.App. \u2014 Houston [1st Dist.] 1983, writ dism\u2019d) (\u201cA co-maker\u2019s liability to the payee is joint and several.\u201d), <em>citing Caldwell v.

(\u201cWhile each signer of a note is liable to the payee for the entire amount, ... generally, as between two signers, each is liable for one-half of the amount.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">Notwithstanding that state law controls the validity of this claim, what constitutes a \u201ccontingent\u201d claim for bankruptcy purposes is a bankruptcy law question. <em>See Shelter, </em>98 B.R. at 229. As acknowledged by the district court, this case is one of first impression \u2014 that is, the Bankruptcy Code does not define \u201ccontingent claim\u201d and no court has produced a conclusive definition of this term as it is employed in section 502(c)(1) of Title ll.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, we are not completely without guidance: \u201ccontingent\u201d has been judicially defined for other sections of the Bankruptcy Code. Specifically, courts have held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1285-8\">claims are contingent as to liability if the debt is one which the debtor will be called upon to pay <em>only upon the occurrence or happening of an extrinsic event </em>which will trigger the liability of the debtor to the alleged creditor and if such triggering event or occurrence was one reasonably contemplated by the debt- or and creditor at the time the event giving rise to the claim occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1285-9\"><em>In re All Media Properties, Inc., </em>5 B.R. 126, 133 (Bankr.S.D.Tex.1980) (emphasis added), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>646 F.2d 193 (5th Cir.1981).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Our task is to determine whether the district court correctly applied the definition of contingent claim developed and discussed for these other sections of the Bankruptcy Code to section 502(e)(1).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-10\">The Fords ask us to split the concept of contingency in two, limit application of the established definition of contingent claim applied by the district court as \u201ccontingent as to liability,\u201d push that definition aside for the Fords, and recognize a second type of contingency \u2014 that is, contingency as to amount or collection.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If adopted, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>approach would result in (1) recharacteriz-ing all joint-obligation promissory note debts as contingent, (2) augmenting the discretion of bankruptcy judges by allowing them to dice up debtors\u2019 liability for such notes, and (3) benefiting the other creditors of these debtors \u2014 that is, debtors who borrowed on the commitment of joint and several liability and find themselves protected against full liability by filing for bankruptcy \u2014 and/or the debtors themselves.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">We cannot oblige. Such an approach would strip creditors such as the Bank of the joint-and-several-liability protection they originally bargained for to secure their investment \u2014 that is, protection that is likely to have been a necessary precondition for their making such loans.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It would also shift the transaction cost of collecting on such outstanding obligations \u2014 a cost which presently enhances the incentive of debtors to undertake considerable joint obligations with caution\u2014 away from debtors and onto creditors.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> And finally, beyond creating a general disincentive for those who demand the security of joint and several liability against all co-makers before extending credit, such a change would create an incentive for comakers to file for bankruptcy as a means of shattering their bargained-for liability, thereby avoiding the cost of collecting from one another altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-13\">Moreover, the trustee\u2019s contention that the amount of the debtor\u2019s liability is uncertain focuses on the debtor\u2019s right to (and likelihood of) contribution from the other co-makers. Under Texas law, a comaker\u2019s right to contribution arises only after the co-maker has paid off the note in full. <em>See Caldwell v. Stevenson, </em>567 S.W.2d 278, 280 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Austin 1978, no writ); <em>see also Dittberner v. Bell, </em>558 S.W.2d 527, 534 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Amarillo 1977, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.) (\u201cWhile each signer of a note is liable to the payee for the entire amount, generally, as between two signers, each is liable for one-half of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>amount.\u201d) (citations omitted). Here, the debtor\u2019s right to pursue the other co-makers is independent of the creditor's right to payment of the debt, and in no way affects the creditor\u2019s right to pursue its claim for the full amount against any co-maker, including the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">We note that section 502(c)(1) is intended to permit estimation of claims the fixing of which might unduly delay the closing of the estate. This section of the Code serves at least two purposes. First, it is designed to avoid the need to await the resolution of outside lawsuits to determine issues of liability or amount owed by means of anticipating and estimating the likely outcome of these actions. By so doing, the trustee can more rapidly determine the payout to each creditor who, in the meantime, receives no interest on its claim. Second, section 502(c)(1) is designed to promote a fair distribution to creditors through a realistic assessment of uncertain claims. We recognize that our holding today appears to frustrate section 502(c)(l)\u2019s goal of accelerated payout to creditors. It is clear, however, that in cases such as the one before us where a claim, premised upon the debtor\u2019s joint and several liability as co-maker of a note, is neither \u201ccontingent\u201d nor \u201cunliquidated,\u201d estimation pursuant to section 502(c)(1) is simply inappropriate. The Bank, as well as all other creditors of this estate, must await payout on its claim until resolution of the trustee\u2019s suits against the other co-makers for contribution. Accordingly, we find that the Bank\u2019s claim is not contingent, and we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1283-11\">.

Specifically, the issue before the <em>Andrews </em>court was whether the policies that underlie the definition of contingent claim for section 109(e) and section 303(b)(1) purposes should also apply to section 502(c)(1). The court framed two possibilities \u2014 (1) that the narrow interpretation of \"contingent\" may be due to a policy of restricting the use of those code sections, and that (2) the paucity of cases interpreting section 502 may be due to an unwillingness to classify them as contingent. <em>See id. </em>A more obvious explanation for the paucity of case law on this issue is that co-makers who find themselves in bankruptcy are likely to be passed over by creditors seeking to target the comakers) most capable of paying the entire outstanding obligation.

We agree that such a change would enhance the discretion of the bankruptcy judge and benefit the Fords\u2019 other creditors, but we do not agree that such a change would \"produce no unjust consequences to the claimant.\u201d <em>Id.; see infra </em>notes 14-15 and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1286-16\">. This was recognized by the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-17\">In addition, from a purely equitable standpoint, it would appear to be unfair to deprive the bank creditor of the joint and several liability protection originally negotiated for on the part of this debtor by estimating the claim at something less than its full amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2j\"><em>Ford, </em>125 B.R. at 738.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1286-18\">. As the law now stands, creditors such as the Bank are able to collect the entire amount due for jointly-made obligations from any one comaker holding assets sufficient to settle the entire debt. Trustees for debtors such as the Fords \u2014 debtors who borrowed jointly with others only to find themselves forced to pay more than their proportionate share of that obligation \u2014 may then file contribution or indemnification actions to collect from their fellow comakers. By making the creditors of such jointly-made debts collect proportionate shares from each individual co-maker in order to realize the entire outstanding amount, the change the Fords propose would shift this collection cost away from the debtors and onto creditors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
