The complaint also alleged violations of the Spill Act, including that discharges of hazardous substances had occurred and that defendants had neither reported nor investigated those incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The expressed basis of the trial court\u2019s March 1, 2006 order was, <em>inter alia, </em>that the statutory authority conferred on DEP to seek injunctive relief in a civil action did not extend to compelling action such as remediation. In reconsidering the matter, the trial court adhered to its initial conclusion, but qualified the reasoning to opine that the statutory provisions at issue \u201cprohibit[ed DEP] from seeking a court ordered injunction for remediation in the first instance\u201d because DEP \u201cis compelled[,]\u201d first, \u201cto utilize its own environmental expertise and determine whether remediation is appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>When reviewing a trial court\u2019s interpretation of law we engage in a de novo consideration without affording any special deference to the trial court\u2019s views. <em>Manalapan Realty v. Township Committee of Manalapan Twp., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The trial court was well warranted in correcting its initial narrow view of the scope of the injunctive remedy provided by statute. Certainly, as a matter of definition and historic development, the injunctive remedy includes the power to order mandatory relief as well as prohibitory relief. <em>See Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>626 (3d ed.1969); <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>788 (7th ed.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">We disagree with the trial court\u2019s later view that, before DEP may file a civil action invoking the pertinent statutes and seeking injunctive relief remediating environmental violations, it must first employ its extensive regulatory power and \u201cenvironmental expertise and determine whether remediation is appropriate.\u201d The trial court opinion also states: \u201cIf the DEP makes this determination, it can then issue a directive to remediate the subject properties or even order the facility closed. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11f. Once this has occurred, the DEP can then seek to have its directives enforced.\u201d Unquestionably, this option is available to DEP, but the existence of such an alternative cannot be seen to bar DEP from availing itself, at its reasonable election, of another remedy clearly established in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11u, a direct civil action seeking injunctive relief. In construing the scope of the authority granted by the Legislature to an administrative agency, courts are obliged to afford a generous interpretation of the powers granted and, out of respect for the policy determinations of the Legislature and the role of the executive branch, to find valid any exercise of authority that is fairly within the scope of the legislative grant of authority and furthers the policies sought to be achieved. <em>See, e.g., Cedar Cove, Inc. v. Stanzione, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>202, 211-18, 584 A.2d 784 (1991); <em>Malone v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>Fender, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>129, 134-39, 402 A.2d 240 (1979); <em>see also Clymer v. Summit Bancorp, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>57, 792 A.2d 396 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">By their terms, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11f, upon which defendants relied before the trial court in advocating the position eventually adopted by that court, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11u, upon which DEP relied, were initially enacted at the same time as provisions of the Spill Act. They are differently premised, but co-exist as part of an overall statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">On its face, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11f addresses the scope of administrative remedies available to the Department when there has been a discharge of a hazardous substance. It enables the Department to move swiftly to deal with the discharge in a variety of ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11u deals with the steps authorized when other infractions are alleged, such as violations of Spill Act standards, regulations, or Department directives connected with Spill Act enforcement. It allows the filing of a civil action for injunctive relief and other remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The USTA has a provision comparably designed to provide the Department with all the remedial tools necessary to promote statutory compliance. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10A-24.6a authorizes a civil action for \u201cinjunctive or other appropriate relief to prohibit and prevent [ ] violation\u201d of that Act, contemplating that \u201cthe court may proceed in the action in a summary manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">The complaint in this matter sought remediation as well as other relief for violations of both the Spill Act and the USTA The statutes, dealing with closely related subject matters, must be read <em>in pari materia </em>to promote interpretive harmony and consistent application. <em>See American Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Division of Taxation, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>65, 79-80, 912 A.2d 126 (2006); <em>Ramapo River Reserve Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Borough of Oakland, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>439, 450-51, 896 A.2d 459 (2006); <em>Saint Peter\u2019s Univ. Hosp. v. Lacy, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>1, 14-15, 878 A.2d 829 (2005). To hold that the enforcement tools available to DEP are limited by one or another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>mechanism established in the several statutes that, together, govern the area, is to deprive the Department of the broad remedial sweep so evidently contemplated by the Legislature, especially where the relief sought cuts across and combines various ends contemplated in the statutes at hand and chooses, by way of procedural approach, from among the various remedial avenues authorized by statute. The scope of such powers, so manifestly designed by the Legislature to promote the public interest, should not be viewed with as grudging an approach as the trial court took here.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Even if we were to view the limitation set in place by the trial court as applying, severably, only to the scope of action allowed DEP in respect of the particular effort to seek remediation of direct Spill Act violations, as distinguished from other statutory or regulatory lapses also pled in the complaint, it is not reasonably possible to see the agency\u2019s choices to be as circumstantially circumscribed as the trial court held. It is not the place of a court to weigh the propriety of the remedial path chosen from among several nominally authorized by the same statute or cognate legislation, but rather only to determine whether the agency plaintiff has met whatever burdens of proof are assigned to it under law.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The trial court\u2019s ruling is reversed and the matter is remanded for such further proceedings as may be appropriate in the context of the civil action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
