The CCBSS terminated the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefit component of the Work First New Jersey (WFNJ) program<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that it had been paying for the benefit of J.M., a minor,- prior to the death of J.M.\u2019s mother because there was no blood or legal relationship between J.M. and M.F., a prerequisite for receipt of TANF benefits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">J.M. was born on June 28, 1995, to D.M. They both began to reside with M.F. in 1996. J.M. was not the biological son of M.F. J.M. is a special-needs child diagnosed with a specific learning disability who attends a special education class. M.F. and D.M. had one child in common, M.F., Jr., who was born after they began to cohabit. Although they never married, M.F. and D.M. lived together continuously as a family unit with the two children until the sudden, unexpected death of D.M. on March 5,2005, from a brain aneurism. M.F. at all relevant times provided J.M. -with financial and emotional support. Prior to D.M.\u2019s death, M.F. was receiving $305 per month in TANF benefits for both children. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Effective March 1, 2005, the CCBSS reduced the TANF benefits payable to M.F. to $154 on the ground that there was no blood or legal relationship between M.F. and J.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">It is undisputed that M.F. never adopted J.M., nor did he secure a judgment granting him legal guardianship. After D.M.\u2019s death J.M. continued to live with M.F., who continued to provide J.M. with financial and emotional support and in all respects acted as J.M.\u2019s father. Indeed, M.F. and J.M. apparently have a bonded parent-child relationship similar to that of father and son. No able and willing blood relatives have made themselves available to care for J.M. J.M.\u2019s putative biological father<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> passed away in 2004. Prior to his death, he had no relationship with J.M. and provided no financial support for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">After the death of D.M., the CCBSS notified M.F. on March 17, 2005, that his benefits changed from $305 to $154 effective March 1, 2005. M.F. timely appealed the CCBSS determination and the matter was referred to the OAL as a contested case. M.F. and the CCBSS agreed to submit the case on stipulated facts and sought a legal determination by the OAL of the impact of <em>V.C. v. M.J.B., </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>200, 748 A.2d 539, <em>cert. denied, </em>531 <em>U.S. </em>926, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>302, 148 L.Ed.2d 243 (2000), on the proper interpretation of the term \u201clegally related\u201d as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-34 and <em>N. J.A.C. </em>10:90-2.7(a). The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concluded that our Supreme Court\u2019s recognition of the legal rights of a \u201cpsychological parent\u201d to custody and visitation, <em>V.C., supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 230, 748 A.2d 539, should apply to the interpretation of the term \u201clegally related\u201d as used in the WFNJ/TANF. As a consequence, the ALJ concluded that the stipulated facts supported a conclusion that M.F. was a \u201cpsychological parent\u201d to J.M. and that such a parent was \u201clegally related\u201d within the meaning of the WFNJ/TANF, entitling M.F. to TANF benefits for J.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>On appeal by the CCBSS, the DFD Director rejected the decision of the ALJ, holding that \u201can assistance unit can not receive WFNJ/TANF benefits unless a blood or legal relationship has been established. Because there is no blood or legal relationship between [M.F.] and J.M., ... the agency acted correctly by denying him WFNJ/TANF benefits for J.M.\u201d Accordingly, the DFD Director affirmed the determination of the CCBSS. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">M.F. raises the following arguments for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">I. APPELLANT IS ENTITLED TO BENEFITS FOR THE CHILD PURSUANT TO NEW JERSEY\u2019S DOCTRINE OF DE FACTO OR PSYCHOLOGICAL PARENTHOOD.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">II. BECAUSE APPELLANT AND [J.M.] ARE LEGALLY RELATED BY VIRTUE OF APPELLANT\u2019S STATUS AS A DE FACTO OR PSYCHOLOGICAL PARENT PURSUANT TO NEW JERSEY LAW, THEY CONSTITUTE AN ASSISTANCE UNIT UNDER <em>N.J.SA </em>44:10-34 AND, THEREFORE, ARE ENTITLED TO ASSISTANCE UNDER THE WFNJ STATUTE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">III. THE STATE [\u2019]S REGULATORY INTERPRETATION OF THE STATUTE IS CONTRARY TO THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF THE ENABLING STATUTE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">IV. THE POSSIBILITY THAT APPELLANT MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS AS \u00c1 KINSHIP GUARDIAN DOES NOT MEAN THAT HE CANNOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR WFNJ/TANJ BENEFITS AS THE CHILD\u2019S DE FACTO OR PSYCHOLOGICAL PARENT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">In response to our request for additional briefing, M.F. also makes the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">I. J.M. IS ENTITLED TO BENEFITS AS A \"DEPENDENT CHILD ONLY\u201d PURSUANT TO <em>N.J.S.A </em>44:10-34 REGARDLESS OF THE STATUS OF ANY ADULTS WHO MAY BE LIVING WITH HIM AND REGARDLESS OF RESPONDENT\u2019S INTERPRETATION OF THE APPLICABLE ENABLING REGULATIONS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-12\">II. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, J.M. IS ENTITLED TO TANF BENEFITS BASED ON APPELLANT\u2019S STATUS AS A NON-NEEDY CARETAKER PURSUANT TO <em>N.JJAC.] </em>10:90-2.7(a)[ (3)(i) ](2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-13\">III. EVEN IF THE RELEVANT STATUTE <em>(N.J.SA </em>44:10-34) COULD BE DEEMED TO BE AMBIGUOUS IN ITS MEANING OR PURPOSE, IT MUST BE INTERPRETED IN APPELLANT\u2019S FAVOR, SINCE TO DO OTHERWISE WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE OVERARCHING LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE OF THE WFNJ STATUTORY SCHEME.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Eleven years ago, the United States Congress enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (the PRWOR Act). <em>Pub.L. No. </em>104-193, 100 <em>Stat. </em>2105. The PRWOR Act abolished the program for Aid to Families with Dependent Children and replaced it with a block-grant funding program designated as TANF. The purpose of the program \u201cis to increase the flexibility of States in operating a program designed to ... provide assistance to needy families so that children may be eared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 601(a). The Federal TANF regulations, 45 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 260.10 to 260.40 (2007), do not define \u201cfamily\u201d due to the strict limitations on federal regulatory power imposed by the PRWOR Act. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 617. The PRWOR Act, thus, leaves the definition of \u201cfamily\u201d to the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The following year New Jersey adopted the Work First New Jersey Act (the WFNJ Act). <em>L. </em>1997, c. 38<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (codified as amended at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-55 to-78). The Legislature found that the PRWOR Act \u201cestablishes the federal block grant for temporary assistance for needy families and provides the opportunity for a state to establish and design its own welfare program.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-56(a). It also found that \u201c[w]ork and the earning of income promote the best interests of families and children [and] [w]orking individuals and families needing temporary assistance should have the transitional support necessary to obtain and keep a job in order to be able to avoid cycling back onto public assistance.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-56(b), (c). The Legislature declared, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">The Work First New Jersey program established pursuant to this act incorporates and builds upon the fundamental concepts of the Family Development Initiative established pursuant to <em>P.L. </em>1991, <em>c. </em>523 (C.44:10-19 et seq.) in a manner that is consistent with the federal program of temporary assistance for needy families, by establishing requirements for: time limits on cash assistance; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>participation of recipients in work activities; enhanced efforts to establish paternity and establish and enforce child support obligations____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-56(h).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The WFNJ Act defined the term \u201cassistance unit\u201d to mean \u201ca single person without dependent children; a couple without dependent children; dependent children only; or a person or couple with one or more dependent children who are legally or blood-related, or who is their legal guardian, and who live together as a household unit.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-57. Thus, to be considered a family for WFNJ/TANF purposes, the family must meet the criteria for an eligible assistance unit. \u201cBenefits\u201d were defined to mean \u201cany assistance provided to needy persons and their dependent children and needy single persons and couples without dependent children under the Work First New Jersey program.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The term \u201cdependent child\u201d was defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">\u201cDependent child\u201d means a child:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">a. under the age of 18;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">b. under the age of 19 and a full-time student in a secondary school or an equivalent level of vocational or technical training, if, before the student attains age 19, the student may reasonably be expected to complete the student\u2019s program of secondary school or training; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-11\">c. under the age of 21 and enrolled in a special education program,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-12\">who is living in New Jersey with the child\u2019s natural or adoptive parent or legal guardian, or with a relative designated by the commissioner in a place of residence maintained by the relative as the relative\u2019s home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-13\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>44:10-57.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-14\">The Legislature also defined the term \u201clegal guardian\u201d as \u201ca person who exercises continuing control over the person or property, or both, of a child, including any specific right of control over an aspect of the child\u2019s upbringing, <em>pursuant to a court order.\u201d Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-15\">The WFNJ program replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>44:10-1 to-5 (repealed 1997), and other programs, including the Family Development Initiative, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-19 to-33 (repealed 1997). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-58(b). The Legislature required the DHS Commissioner to \u201ctake such actions as are necessary to implement and operate the program in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>accordance with the provisions of the federal [PRWOR Act].\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-58(a). The WFNJ Act placed responsibility for support squarely on adult persons in the family. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-59(a). Benefits were declared to be temporary and to \u201cserve the primary goal of fostering self-sufficiency.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-59(b). The WFNJ Act provided for cash assistance payments to applicants and required the DHS Commissioner to \u201cestablish regulations determining eligibility and other requirements of the Work First New Jersey program.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>44:10-59(e). More specifically, the WFNJ Act required the Commissioner, \u201cpursuant to the \u2018Administrative Procedure Act,\u2019 ... [to] adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this act.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Concomitant with the adoption of the WFNJ Act, the Legislature passed an implementing act concerning the administration of the WFNJ Act, imposing time limits on receipt of benefits, and amending a variety of related acts. <em>L. </em>1997, c. 87, \u00a7\u00a7 1-7, 17<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (codified as amended at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-71 to-78). The terms \u201cassistance unit,\u201d \u201cbenefits,\u201d \u201cdependent child,\u201d and \u201clegal guardian\u201d were defined in precisely the same manner as in the WFNJ Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-71. This act made county agencies \u201cresponsible for implementing the [WFNJ] program in accordance with regulations adopted by the commissioner and ensuring that all eligible persons residing in the county have access to benefits.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-73(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">In anticipation of the adoption of the WFNJ Act, the Legislature had earlier adopted two acts concerning welfare reform. <em>L. </em>1997, c. 13-14<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (codified as amended at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-34 to-54). One of these acts, <em>N.J.SA </em>44:10-34, contained definitions related to work activity, and the other, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-44, contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>definitions related to eligibility. These definitions mirror the definitions in the subsequently enacted WFNJ Act and its implementing legislation. <em>Compare N.J.S.A </em>44:10-34 <em>and N.J.SA </em>44:10-44 <em>with N.J.SA. </em>44:10-57 <em>and N.J.SA </em>44:10-71. Both acts required the Commissioner to adopt rules and regulations pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act to effectuate the purposes of both acts. <em>N.J.SA. </em>44:10-43; <em>N.J.SA. </em>44:10-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Consistent with these statutory mandates, the DHS Commissioner adopted rules and regulations applicable to the WFNJ program. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-1.1 to-18.9. The DHS regulation respecting eligibility requires a blood or legal relationship between the child and the person with whom the child lives: (a) Composition of the eligible WFNJ/TANF assistance unit is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">1. An eligible assistance unit under WFNJ/TANF shall be comprised of those individuals who are living together and functioning as one economic unit and whose relationship is based upon a blood and/or legal relationship. (A legal relationship is one that is created through marriage, adoption or legal guardianship procedures.) The eligible WFNJ/TANF assistance unit includes the parent(s), parent person(s) or legal guardian ... and his or her children up to the age of 18____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">3. The term \u201cparent\u201d shall refer to natural and/or adoptive parent(s), parent-person(s) or legal guardian(s). By law, certain relatives shall be recognized as taking the place of a parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">i. The term \u201cparent-person\u201d refers to any person related by blood, marriage or adoption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-11\">(1) An applicant who is a parent-person may apply for WFNJ/TANF benefits for a child(ren) and him or herself as a needy parent-person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-12\">(2) Non-needy caretakers and/or parent persons shall also be eligible to apply for WFNJ/TANF benefits for the children in their care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-13\">iv. A legal guardian, according to <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:3-38, refers to a person who has \u201cthe right to exercise continuing control over the person or property or both of a child which includes any specific right of control over an aspect of the child\u2019s upbringing, pursuant to a court order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-14\"><em>[N.JAC. </em>10:90-2.7.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-15\">M.F. contends that the regulations promulgated by the Commissioner are contrary to the express purpose <em>of </em>the WFNJ/TANF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>program because \u201c[a] significant number of the state\u2019s children are without a parent or blood relative who is willing or able to care for them.\u201d He urges that, like J.M., other adults voluntarily care for these children and \u201cassume the responsibilities of the child\u2019s absent parents.\u201d M.F. argues that the regulations \u201ccritically restrict[ ] the availability of TANF assistance for many of these children and their caregivers by narrowing, without legal justification, the meaning of the term \u2018legally related.\u2019\u201d Finally, M.F. contends that the Legislative findings regarding the importance of establishing and maintaining \u201csuccessful family life and childhood development,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10 \u2014 56(f), require a broad interpretation of the term \u201clegally related.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Appellate review of challenges to an administrative agency\u2019s rulemaking function is limited. \u201cAdministrative regulations are accorded a presumption of validity.\u201d <em>N.J. State League of Municipalities v. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>211, 222, 729 A.2d 21 (1999) <em>{League of Municipalities). </em>Moreover, \u201c[t]he party challenging their validity bears the burden of proving that the regulations are arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d Ibid.; <em>see also In re Amendment of N.J.A.C. 8:31B-3.31, 119 N.J. 531, 543-44, </em>575 A.2d 481 (1990); <em>N.J. Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers v. Long, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>544, 561, 384 A.2d 795 (1978) <em>(Hearing Aid Dispensers). </em>\u201cThat judicial deference to administrative agencies stems from the recognition that agencies have the specialized expertise necessary to enact regulations dealing with technical matters and are \u2018particularly well equipped to read and understand the massive documents and to evaluate the factual and technical issues that ... rulemaking would invite.\u2019 \u201d <em>League of Municipalities, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 222, 729 A.2d 21 (quoting <em>Bergen Pines County Hosp. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>456, 474, 476 A.2d 784 (1984)). Accordingly, we cannot substitute our judgment for that of the agency. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Dougherty v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>91 <em>N.J. 1, </em>6, 449 A.2d 1235 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">However, a regulation \u201c \u2018must be within the fair contemplation of the delegation of the enabling statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>League of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>Municipalities, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 222, 729 A.2d 21 (quoting <em>Hearing Aid Dispensers, supra, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>at 561-62, 384 A.2d 795). Additionally, \u201cthe absence of an express statutory authorization in the enabling legislation will not preclude administrative agency action where, by reasonable implication, that action can be said to promote or advance the policies and findings that served as the driving force for the enactment of the legislation.\u201d A.A <em>Mastrangelo, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>666, 683-84, 449 A2d 516 (1982). \u201c[T]he reviewing court may look beyond the specific terms of the enabling act to the statutory policy sought to be achieved by examining the entire statute in light of its surroundings and objectives.\u201d <em>Hearing Aid Dispensers, supra, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>at 562, 384 A.2d 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In defining the term \u201clegal guardian\u201d in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-2.7(a)(3)(iv), the DHS Commissioner resorted to the definition of \u201cguardianship\u201d found in our adoption laws at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-38(d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the WFNJ Act itself defines \u201clegal guardian\u201d as \u201ca person who exercises continuing control over the person or property, or both, of a child, including any specific right of control over an aspect of the child\u2019s upbringing, <em>pursuant to a court order.\u201d N.J.S.A </em>44:10-57 (emphasis added). The regulatory definition, \u201ca person who has \u2018the right to exercise continuing control over the person or property or both of a child which includes any specific right of control over an aspect of the child\u2019s upbringing, <em>pursuant to a court order,\u2019 \u201d N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-2.7(a)(3)(iv) (emphasis added), is virtually identical to the definition in the WFNJ Act. The regulatory definition of \u201clegal guardian\u201d in a manner identical to the WFNJ Act is, beyond peradventure, \u201cwithin the fair contemplation of the delegation of the enabling statute.\u201d <em>League of Municipalities, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 222, 729 A.2d 21 (citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>We recognize that we may \u201cexamin[e] the entire statute in light of its surroundings and objectives\u201d to determine whether the regulations give effect to the \u201cstatutory policy sought to be achieved.\u201d <em>Hearing Aid Dispensers, supra, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>at 562, 384 A.2d 795. However, we are not persuaded that the policy sought to be achieved by the WFNJ Act is inconsistent with the regulations. It is true that the Legislature was concerned with the importance of establishing and maintaining \u201csuccessful family life and childhood development.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10 \u2014 56(f). That policy, however, does not require a broad interpretation of the term \u201clegally related.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">At the time the WFNJ legislation was adopted, the laws concerning the creation of legal relationships between children and persons other than their biological parents, such as by adoption, <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:3-37 to-56, required a court proceeding. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-42. Furthermore, after the WFNJ Act was signed into law, the Legislature created \u201ckinship legal guardianships,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:12A-1 to-7,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as a vehicle to establish a \u201clegal relationship\u201d in situations where adoption was not feasible. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:12A-l(b). The Legislature intended such guardian-ships to be \u201can alternative, permanent legal arrangement for children and their caregivers.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>A caregiver who has been providing care for a child in a kinship relationship for twelve months may petition the court for a kinship legal guardianship. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B.T2A-2, -5. The Legislature provided a kinship relationship may exist between a child and a \u201cfamily friend\u201d where the latter is \u201ca person who is connected to a child or the child\u2019s parent by an established positive psychological or emotional relationship that is not a biological or legal relationship.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:12A-2. Thus, the Legislature incorporated the concept of \u201cpsychological parent\u201d recognized two years earlier by the Supreme Court in <em>V.C., supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 230, 748 A.2d 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>The State\u2019s children who are not living with their natural or adoptive parents are eligible for monthly cash subsidies under the Kinship Care Subsidy Program once the kinship legal guardianship has been established. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-19.1(a), (c). The subsidies are determined using WFNJ/TANF analyses. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-19.5. Thus, this subsidy program is complementary to and consistent with the WFNJ/TANF legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Giving \u201clegal guardian\u201d the broad interpretation urged by M.F. would undermine the child-protective benefits of adoption and kinship legal guardianship. As to the latter, in order to ensure the welfare of children who are not in the care of a parent, the Legislature has required that a petition for kinship legal guardianship include a \u201ckinship caregiver assessment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:12A-5(b). Such an assessment must contain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">(1) the full name and address of the person seeking to become the kinship legal guardian;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">(2) the circumstances of the kinship relationship;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">(3) the whereabouts of the child\u2019s parents, if known;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">(4) the nature of the parents\u2019 incapacitation, if known;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-11\">(5) the wishes of the parents, if known;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-12\">(6) the ability of the kinship caregiver family to assume permanent care of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-13\">(7) the child\u2019s property and assets, if known;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-14\">(8) the wishes of the child, if appropriate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-15\">(9) any current involvement of a child with the division if the child has an open division case and is actively receiving services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-16\">(10) certification from the caregiver that the caregiver has been providing care and support for the child, while the child has been residing in the caregiver\u2019s home, for at least the last 12 consecutive months;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-17\">(11) the results from a criminal history record background cheek and a domestic violence central registry check of the caregiver and any adult residing in the caregiver\u2019s household conducted pursuant to [N.J.S.A 30:4C-86];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-18\">(12) the results from a child abuse record check arranged for and coordinated by the division pursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A </em>30:40-86]; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-19\">(13) the results of the caregiver\u2019s home review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-20\">[/bid]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-21\">These requirements are obviously designed to ensure the welfare of children who are not in the care of their natural or adoptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>parents. In light of this statutory enactment and the Kinship Care Subsidy Program, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-19.1(a), (c), \u2014 19.5, which provides benefits similar to TANF, we cannot say that the definition of \u201clegal guardian\u201d in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-2.7 is \u201carbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d <em>League of Municipalities, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 222, 729 A.2d 21. To the contrary, we find that the definition reflects the Legislature\u2019s concern that persons, other than natural and adoptive parents, who receive financial subsidies for children be persons whom the child welfare system has investigated and found to be appropriate guardians.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We are also not persuaded that a broader definition of \u201clegal relationship\u201d is mandated by our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>V.C., supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 230, 748 A.2d 539, as urged by M.F. There, the Court was \u201ccalled on to determine what legal standard applies to a third party\u2019s claim to joint custody and visitation of her former domestic partner\u2019s biological children, with whom she lived in a familial setting and in respect of whom she claims to have functioned as a psychological parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, 748 A.2d 539. V.C. and M.J.B. were a lesbian couple and both cared for the twin children born to M.J.B. <em>Id. </em>at 206-07, 748 A.2d 539. At trial they testified to the various duties and responsibilities each assumed and to the affectionate relationship of both with the children. <em>Id. </em>at 207-09, 748 A.2d 539. Psychological experts at trial opined that there was a bonded relationship between the children and V.C., although their opinions differed regarding the effect of the termination of the relationship with V.C. <em>Id. </em>at 211-12, 748 A.2d 539. The trial court denied V.C.\u2019s application for joint custody and visitation, but we reversed the denial of visitation while affirming the denial of joint custody. <em>Id. </em>at 212-13, 748 A.2d 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Our Supreme Court recognized the line of cases finding psychological or de facto parent status and concluded that they were based on \u201ca recognition that children have a strong interest in maintaining the ties that connect them to adults who love and provide for them. That interest, for constitutional as well as social purposes, lies in the emotional bonds that develop between family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>members as a result of shared daily life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221, 748 A.2d 539. After finding that V.C. had standing to seek joint custody and visitation, the Court turned its attention to the manner in which a litigant \u201cmay establish that he or she has, in fact, become a psychological parent to the child of a fit and involved legal parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222, 748 A.2d 539. The Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-4\">the legal parent must consent to and foster the relationship between the third party and the child; the third party must have lived with the child; the third party must perform parental functions for the child to a significant degree; and most important, a parent^ehild bond must be forged. We are satisfied that that test provides a good framework for determining psychological parenthood in cases where the third parly has lived for a substantial period with the legal parent and her child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 223, 748 A.2d 539.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The Court analyzed the proofs required for each of the above prongs, <em>id. </em>at 223-27, 748 A.2d 539, and concluded that \u201c[t]he standards to which we have referred will govern all cases in which a third party asserts psychological parent status as a basis for a custody or visitation action regarding the child of a legal parent, with whom the third party has lived in a familial setting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227, 748 A.2d 539. Finally, the Court noted that \u201c[ejstablishing psychological parenthood is not an easy task and the standards we have adopted should be scrupulously applied in order to protect the legal parent-child relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230, 748 A.2d 539. Nothing in the case suggests, however, that psychological parenthood would create a legal relationship with a child, such as a right to joint custody or visitation, without a court order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Although the principles enunciated in <em>V.C. </em>might, on adequate proofs,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> permit a conclusion that M.F. is a psychological parent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>J.M., we conclude that the case is not on point here. The WFNJ/TANF legislation and regulations would not permit the CCBSS or the DFD to award benefits based on psychological parenthood because both the WFNJ Act and the regulations require third-party parental status to be established \u201cpursuant to a court order.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-57; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-2.7. As a consequence, we conclude that <em>V.C. </em>does not mandate agency recognition of psychological or de facto parenthood absent a court order determining such status.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">M.F. next contends that the CCBSS and the DFD erred in denying WFNJ/TANF benefits for J.M. because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-34 provides that an assistance unit may be comprised of \u201cdependent children only.\u201d As such, he argues that benefits to a dependent child only are payable <em>\u201civithout regard </em>to whether the child is living with an adult who may also qualify for benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">We begin our consideration of this argument by restating applicable legal principles. The judicial role in reviewing decisions of administrative agencies is restricted to the following four inquires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">(1) whether the agency\u2019s decision offends the State or Federal Constitution; (2) whether the agency\u2019s action violates express or implied legislative policies; (3) whether the record contains substantial evidence to support the findings on which the agency based its action; and (4) whether in applying the legislative policies to the facts, the agency clearly erred in reaching a conclusion that could not reasonably have been made on a showing of the relevant factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\"><em>(George Harms Constr. Co. v. N.J. Tpk. Auth., </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>8, 27, 644 A.2d 76 (1994).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Accordingly, \u201c[o]ur function is to determine whether the administrative action was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Burris v.

The precise issue is whether the findings of the agency could have been reached on the credible evidence in the record, considering the proofs as a whole. <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965). However, although we must give deference to an administrative agency charged with interpretation of the law, we are not bound by the agency\u2019s legal opinions. <em>Levine v.

In <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-34,-44 and-57, West Publishing Co. failed to separate the ending qualification from subsection (c) with a paragraph break,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> although it did include such a paragraph break in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-71.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We are satisfied from our reading of the original text of the pertinent statutes that in all four acts the Legislature had a paragraph break after the words \u201cunder the age of 21 and enrolled in a special education program,\u201d and before \u201cwho is living in New Jersey with the child\u2019s natural or adoptive parent or legal guardian.\u201d However, even if the Legislature had not begun the ending qualification as a new paragraph, we would nonetheless conclude that it modified all three categories of \u201cdependent child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u201cWhere a comma is used to set a modifying phrase off from previous phrases, the modifying phrase applies to all the previous phrases, not just the immediately preceding phrase.\u201d <em>Gudgeon v. County of Ocean, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 17, 342 A.2d 553 (App.Div.1975) (commenting in n. 1 thereto that \u201c[t]his is the converse of the general rule that qualifying words refer solely to the immediately preceding word.\u201d)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">\u201c[A] rule of grammatical construction ... dictates that separation of a qualifying phrase from antecedents by a comma evidences an intent that the phrase apply to all antecedents, instead of solely to the immediately preceding one.

Affairs Order of March 15, 1988, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>136, 141-42, 556 A.2d 807 (App.Div.1989) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\"><em>See also N.J. Bank v. Palladino, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>33, 45, 389 A.2d 454 (1978); <em>T.I. McCormack Trucking Co. v. United States, </em>251 <em>F.Supp. </em>526, 533 (D.N.J.1966) (\u201c[I]f [a] modifier is intended to relate to <em>more </em>than the \u2018last antecedent\u2019, a comma is used to set off the modifier from the entire series.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">We are, thus, persuaded that the ending qualification modifies all three subsections of the definition of \u201cdependent child\u201d because the four enactments not only separate the ending qualification as a new paragraph below subsection (c) in all four acts, but precede it by a comma. <em>See L. </em>1997, c. 13, \u00a7 1; <em>L. </em>1997, c. 14, \u00a7 1; <em>L. </em>1997, c. 37, \u00a7 1; <em>L. </em>1997, c. 38, \u00a7 3. This conclusion is consistent with the statutory scheme. The interpretation urged by M.F. would make TANF benefits available to any minor living with an adult even though there was no putative family relationship, such as a minor living with a friend over the age of eighteen. This is patently inconsistent with the legislative purpose to provide temporary assistance to needy <em>families. </em>As a consequence, we conclude that the CCBSS and the DFD did not act in an arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable manner in denying benefits because J.M. does not qualify for WFNJ/TANF benefits under the \u201cdependent child only\u201d category of an assistance unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">M.F. also contends the WFNJ/TANF benefits are payable to him as a non-needy caretaker pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:90-2.7(a)(3)(i)(2). A \u201c \u2018[n]on-needy caretaker\u2019 means a relative caring for a dependent child, or a legal guardian of a minor child who, in the absence of a natural or adoptive parent, assumes parental responsibility for such minor child.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:90-15.1. We have already discussed the definition of \u201cdependent child\u201d and do not repeat that discussion here. As to whether M.F. is \u201ca legal guardian of a minor child,\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:90-15.1 provides that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>\u201c \u2018[l]egal guardian\u2019 means a person who exercises continuing control over the person or property, <em>or </em>both, of a child, including any specific right of control over an aspect of the child\u2019s upbringing, <em>pursuant to a court order\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Here, again, J.M. is not a \u201cdependent child\u201d and M.F., in the absence of a court order, is not a \u201clegal guardian.\u201d The WFNJ/TANF benefits payable to M. F. were properly reduced by the CCBSS and the final administrative agency action of the DFD was correct. As a consequence, we do not find the denial of WFNJ/TANF benefits for J.M. to have been arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Lastly, M.F. argues that \u201c[a] significant number of the state\u2019s children are without a parent or blood relative who is willing or able to care for them.\u201d He contends that, like J.M., other adults voluntarily care for these children and \u201cassume the responsibilities of the child\u2019s absent parents.\u201d M.F. argues that the availability of TANF assistance for many of these children and their caregivers has been \u201ccritically restrict[ed] ... by narrowing, without legal justification, the meaning of the term \u2018legally related.\u2019 \u201d He urges that the Legislative findings regarding the importance of establishing and maintaining \u201csuccessful family life and childhood development,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>44:10-56(f), are inconsistent with the definition of the term \u201clegally related.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">\u201cGenerally, the wisdom, prudence and good sense of the Legislature in the enactment of law are not questions for the judiciary to resolve.\u201d <em>Wnuck v.
