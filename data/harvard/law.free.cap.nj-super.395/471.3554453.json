First, he challenges <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:18-9.6, which allows the ADTC administrator to prohibit ADTC inmates from \u201creceipt], possession], distribution], or display\u201d of \u201cnot sexually oriented material\u201d that \u201cwill impede the rehabilitation of inmate[s].\u201d He claims that the regulation is unconstitutional because it \u201crestricts inmate[s\u2019] rights under common law and the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d to the Federal Constitution. In filing the appeal, appellant relied upon the 1987 Supreme Court opinion in <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>78,107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). Second, he challenges the constitutionality of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:16-4.4, regulating exceptions to statutorily privileged inmate-therapist communications. Appellant asserts that that regulation \u201cvoids inmate-therapist confidentiality in contravention of protections offered by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d Final<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>ly, he challenges <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:4-4.1 *.260, which subjects an inmate \u201cto disciplinary action and a sanction\u201d for \u201crefusing to submit to mandatory medical or other testing[,]\u201d as \u201cinterfer[ing] with inmate rights under the common law and the Fourteenth Amendment to give informed voluntary consent to medical procedures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Appellant also attacks the three regulations under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In essence, appellant seeks to strike <em>N.J.AC. </em>10A:18-9.6 and <em>N.J.AC. </em>10A:16-4.4(c) through (f) as unconstitutional under both the federal and state constitutions, to modify subsection (g) of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A.16-4.4 to require notice to inmates that certain disclosures trigger the therapist\u2019s \u201cduty to warn[,]\u201d to modify subsection (h) of that regulation \u201cto provide that inmates be noticed that anything they say in therapy may be used against them later in civil commitment\u201d proceedings, and to strike a portion of <em>N.J AC. </em>10A:4-4.1 *.260.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">As to appellant\u2019s challenge to <em>N.J AC. </em>10A:4-4.1 *.260, we denied a stay of DNA testing on August 8, 2006 (filed August 15, 2006). Subsequently, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of DNA testing in <em>A A. v. Attorney General, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>128, 914 A.2d 260 (2007) and <em>State v. O\u2019Hagen, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>140, 914 A.2d 267 (2007). We therefore summarily reject the challenge to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:4-A1 *.260.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">As to the other points, on April 27, 2006, we adjourned this appeal and ordered supplementary briefs to be filed after the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Beard v. Banks, </em>548 U.S. -, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2572, 165 L.Ed.2d 697 (2006). Under <em>Beard, </em>courts must give \u201c \u2018substantial deference to the professional judgment of prison administrators[,]\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2578, 165 L.Ed.2d at 705 (quoting <em>Overton v. Bazzetta, </em>539 <em>U.S. </em>126, 132, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>2162, 2167, 156 L.Ed.2d 162, 170 (2003)), and restrictive regulations are permitted in the prison setting \u201cif they are \u2018reasonably related\u2019 to legitimate \u2018penological interests\u2019 and are not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>\u2018exaggerated response\u2019 to such objectives.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Turner, supra, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>at 87, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2261, 96 L.Ed.2d at 77-78) (citations omitted). In demonstrating that connection, the inmate has \u201cthe burden of persuasion[.]\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">In light of <em>Beard, </em>we reject the facial challenge to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:18-9.6 and conclude that there is a legitimate basis for the regulation\u2019s limitations on access to the magazines and literature at issue. Since Pennsylvania\u2019s ban on access to all newspapers and magazines by inmates of its Long-Term Segregation Unit was upheld on summary judgment in <em>Beard, </em>the limited access to literature challenged here should also be upheld, because it is similarly related to the need for \u201cspecialized treatment.\u201d As in <em>Beard, </em>the record, based on certifications of ADTC officials, is \u201cadequate\u201d to support the DOC\u2019s position as the regulation only reaches a limited group of inmates who require specialized treatment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2578-79, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 706. Appellant\u2019s state constitutional assertions also fail, because the state constitution provides no more protection than the Federal Constitution on these issues. <em>See In re Rules Adoption Regarding Inmate Mail to Attorneys, </em>120 <em>N.J. 137, </em>576 A.2d 274 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">We also uphold <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:16-4.4 in light of the challenge concerning the provision of psychological services to ADTC inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Appellant is presently incarcerated at the ADTC<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> serving an aggregate sentence of life imprisonment with twenty-five years parole ineligibility for aggravated sexual assault and other crimes.

If it is found that the defendant\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">conduct was characterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior and that the offender is amenable to sex offender treatment and is willing to participate in such treatment, the court shall, upon the recommendation of the [DOC], sentence the offender to a term of incarceration to be served in the custody of the commissioner [of the DOC] at the [ADTC] for sex offender treatment!.] <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>[N.J.SA </em>2C:47-3(b)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Parole from the ADTC is different than parole from other institutions, as it must \u201cbe based on a determination by the special classification review board that the offender has achieved a satisfactory level of progress in sex offender treatment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-5. A sentence to the ADTC as a sex offender usually results in the prisoner serving more \u201creal time\u201d than a similarly situated non-sexual offender sentenced to the same custodial term in the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections, because the inmate receives specialized treatment aimed at sexual offender rehabilitation. <em>See State v. Howard, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>113, 124-25, 539 A.2d 1203 (1988); <em>State v.

Farmer (Waterman III), </em>183 F.3d 208, 209, 211 (3d Cir.1999).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These regulations \u201csignificantly narrow[ed]\u201d the scope of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:47-10. <em>Ibid. </em>They provided definitions for statutory terms that were otherwise vague and ambiguous <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>10A:18-9.1, -9.2), prescribed procedures for notifying inmates of prohibited material <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>10A:18-9.3), imposed sanctions for statutory violations <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>10A:18-9.5), and exempted \u201call materials deemed to serve a legitimate rehabilitative purpose\u201d <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>10A:18-9.4). <em>Waterman III, supra, </em>183 F.3d at 211. Using the <em>Turner </em>analysis, both the statute and regulations were upheld as constitutional by the Third Circuit in an opinion by Judge (now Justice) Alito. <em>Id. </em>at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">However, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:18-9.6, the regulation challenged by appellant, was not specifically addressed in <em>Waterman III. </em>That regulation allows the ADTC to prohibit material that is not sexually oriented if it is deemed to \u201cimpede\u201d the inmates\u2019 rehabilitation. The regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">The provisions of this subchapter shall not preclude the Administrator or designee from prohibiting an inmate(s) at the [ADTC] to receive, possess, distribute, or display any material which is not sexually oriented material if the Administrator or designee, in consultation with the treatment staff, determines that the receipt, possession, distribution, or display of that material will impede the rehabilitation of the inmate(s).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\"><em>[N.J.AC. </em>10A:18-9.6.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Thereunder, according to the DOC, the ADTC mailroom has authority to screen publications and other materials sent to the inmates \u201cto ensure they do not endanger prison order and security, are not sexually oriented, and will not impede the rehabilitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>of the ADTC inmates.\u201d The State provides an undisputed explanation of how the ADTC staff screens inmate publications pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:18-9.6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">[Wlhen a publication may be inappropriate for the inmate population, the publication is routed to the treatment staff and/or the Administrator\u2019s Office to determine whether receipt, possession, distribution or display of the material will impede rehabilitation____When a particular publication is found to repeatedly contain material that will impede rehabilitation, it is placed on a prohibited publication list and the ADTC inmate population is notified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">The ADTC utilized confiscation forms when publications are taken and inmates may appeal the confiscation or prohibition of material by submitting Administrative Remedy Forms or by submitting a memorandum of appeal---- A due process procedure outlined in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:18-4.13, regarding appeal from decisions to withhold disapproved publications is available and was utilized by [appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">In his initial brief, appellant claims that <em>\u201cN.J.A.C. </em>10A:18-9.6 unconstitutionally restricts [ADTC] inmate[s\u2019] rights under the common law and the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d He argues that, because of the language of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:18-9.6, \u201call of the protections afforded by the constraining definitions of subchapters 18-9.1 through 9.3 are defeated as any material that falls outside the restrictive cloak of those subchap-ters may still be denied to an inmate if the Administrator deems that material likely to impede the rehabilitation of that inmate.\u201d He asserts that the effect of this regulation has been to deny ADTC inmates \u201cmagazines and periodicals not primarily sexually oriented,\u201d including <em>King </em>magazine, \u201cseveral issues\u201d of <em>Black Men\u2019s </em>magazine, <em>Sports Illustrated\u2019s </em>Swimsuit Edition, psychotherapy and medical books, classic literature, several mainstream movies, and CD players and CDs. The argument essentially attacks the regulation as unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, asserting that it has no reasonable relationship to a legitimate penological interest or the specialized treatment at the ADTC, principally because they are \u201cnon-pornographic, non-obscene and non-sexually oriented material\u201d and some censorship is premised on religious beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">The DOC argues that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:18-9.6 is \u201creasonably related to a legitimate penological interest[,]\u201d namely, maintaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>prison security and order and the rehabilitation of ADTC inmates. It also disputes several of appellant\u2019s factual allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">At the time the parties\u2019 initial briefs were filed, the controlling method for analyzing whether a prison regulation was constitutional was articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Turner v. Safley, supra, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>78, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64. However, as previously stated, a case addressing the core issues of <em>Turner </em>was decided by the Court last term after the parties filed their briefs. In <em>Beard v. Banks, </em>decided on June 28, 2006, the Court reaffirmed its prior decision in <em>Turner, </em>and further explained how to review constitutional challenges to prison regulations. <em>Beard, supra, </em>548 <em>U.S. </em>-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2572, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>697. We thereafter requested that the parties file supplemental briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">In his supplemental brief, appellant argues that the \u201cdefense of <em>[N.J.A.C.] </em>10A:18-9.6 fails to save [the] regulation from constitutional infirmity.\u201d He contends that the regulation is \u201cnot reasonably related to valid penal interests,\u201d the \u201clack of alternative means of exercising First Amendment rights invalidates subchap-ter 18-9.6[,]\u201d the \u201cimpact of accommodations of prisoner rights on staffiresources\u201d of invalidating the regulation would be to allow for clearer guidelines and would have no affect on treatment, and \u201cready alternatives\u201d to the regulation, such as rewriting it, are available \u201cat de minimus cost[J\u201d The DOC reasserts its earlier position that appellant\u2019s \u201cconstitutional challenge to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:18-9.6 should be dismissed[,] because the regulation is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest and it does not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Beard v. Banks </em>reaffirmed that the cases of <em>Turner v. Safley, supra, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>78, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2254, 96 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>64, and <em>Overton v. Bazzetta, supra, </em>539 <em>U.S. </em>126, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>2162, 156 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>162, continue to provide \u201cthe basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>substantive legal standards\u201d for analyzing the constitutionality of prison regulations. <em>Beard, supra, </em>548 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2577, 165 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 704. In <em>Beard, </em>the Court held that regulations denying prisoners in Pennsylvania\u2019s Long Term Segregation Unit, which is \u201creserved for the Commonwealth\u2019s \u2018most incorrigible, recalcitrant inmates[,]\u2019 \u201d all \u201caccess to newspapers, magazines, or personal photographs\u201d did not violate the inmates\u2019 First Amendment rights, as \u201cprison officials ... set forth adequate legal support for the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2576, 165 L.Ed.2d at 702-03. As such, although prisoners have First Amendment protections, \u201crestrictive prison regulations are permissible if they are \u2018reasonably related\u2019 to legitimate penological interests\u2019 ... and are not an \u2018exaggerated response\u2019 to such objectives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2578, 165 L.Ed.2d at 705 (quoting and citing <em>Turner, supra, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>at 87, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2261, 96 L.Ed.2d at 78).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Furthermore, the Court reaffirmed the use of the four factors set out in <em>Turner </em>to \u201c \u2018determin[e] the reasonableness of the regulation at issue\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-13\">[fjirst, is there a \u201c \u201cvalid, rational connection\u2019 between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it\u201d?

As such, the record demonstrates a \u201c 'valid, rational connection\u2019 between the prison regulationfs]\u201d giving the Administrator authority to prohibit certain materials which do not fit squarely within the definition of \u201csexually oriented\u201d and the government\u2019s interest in rehabilitation. <em>See Beard, swpra, </em>548 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>U.S. </em>at -, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2578, 165 L.Ed.2d at 705 (quoting <em>Turner, supra, </em>482 <em>U.S. at </em>89, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2262, 96 L.Ed.2d at 79).

Further, the second <em>Turner </em>factor is intended to be applied with deference to the expertise of corrections officials. <em>Turner, supra, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>at 90, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2262, 96 L.Ed.2d at 79 (citing <em>Pell v.

Here, inmates are not being barred from access to all publications and reasoning for the ban is given for the prohibited items in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>form of memoranda from prison administration. Rogers\u2019 affidavit further explains that magazines including the 2004 <em>Sports Illustrated </em>Swimsuit Edition, <em>\u201cSTUFF, Maxim, FHM, King, XXL, </em>[and] <em>Hot Male Couples: 2 </em>and <em>XT\u2019 </em>were banned as they were \u201cfound to repeatedly contain material that will impede the rehabilitation of the ADTC inmate(s) [and were] placed on a prohibited publication list.\u201d Further, an alternate means exists for inmates to exercise their right to read. They have access to non-sexually explicit and otherwise non-detrimental publications and materials. <em>See Beard, supra, </em>548 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2580, 165 L.Ed.2d at 707 (complete ban on newspapers and magazines is not per se unreasonable).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The third factor that must be considered is \u201cwhat \u2018impact\u2019 will \u2018accommodation\u2019 of the asserted constitutional right ... have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources generally[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2578, 165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 705 (quoting <em>Turner, supra, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>at 90, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2262, 96 L.Ed.2d at 79-80).

As to those claims, Judge Alito expressly stated that \u201cif the challenged statute withstands review under <em>[Turner v.] Safley, </em>it does not violate the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213 (citing <em>Turner, supra, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>at 89, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2262, 96 L.Ed.2d at 79). The court further noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">the substantial overlap between the [Turner] test and the doctrines of vagueness and overbreadth suggests that the Supreme Court did not intend for those doctrines to apply with independent force in the prison-litigation context. It would therefore be both redundant and inconsistent with <em>[Turner </em>v.] <em>Safley </em>to subject [an applicable regulation] to an independent challenge under the doctrines of vagueness and overbreadth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\"><em>[Waterman III, supra, </em>183 F.3d at 213.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Pryor nevertheless argues that inmates whose materials are banned under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:18-9.6 lack \u201cnotice or meaningful appeal\u201d in violation of procedural due process protections. He further argues that there are procedures when sexually oriented material is banned but no procedures when non-sexually oriented material is banned, granting greater due process protections under <em>N.JA.C. </em>10A:18-9.3 for review of decisions to withhold sexually oriented materials. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10A:18-9.3 (providing \u201cprocedures for notifying inmates of the withholding and removal of sexually oriented materials\u201d).

He asserts that subsections (d)-(f), which lay out how those individuals must determine whether reporting is necessary and how reporting, if required, should take place, impermissibly shift the treating therapist\u2019s duty to warn to other professionals and, in certain situations, the ADTC Administrator. According to Pryor, \u201c[sjections (d)-(f) further delegate the ultimate responsibility for making a <em>duty to warn </em>decision to someone other than the primary therapist.\u201d Appellant, therefore, asks us to strike the language contained in <em>\u201cN.J.A.C. </em>10:16-4.4(e) through (f) and modif[y][ ] subsection (g) to provide that the action stipulated must follow the decision of the primary therapist that a <em>duty to warn </em>situation exists and provide appropriate notification to the Administrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">\u201cIt is undisputed that the treatment a prisoner receives in prison and the conditions under which he is confined are subject to scrutiny under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Helling v.
