We reverse and remand the matter to DEP for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">Petitioner is the owner of Lot 10.04, Block 165, in Manasquan, beachfront property that has been utilized by petitioner and her family as a summer and sometimes year-round residence since 1968 when her parents purchased it. A single family, one and one-half story home was constructed on the property in 1947. The property, one of the largest beachfront lots in Manasquan, is one-hundred and sixty feet deep, running from the street on the west, to the beach front line on the east, and approximately forty-seven feet wide. With the exception of her neighbor\u2019s property immediately to the north, petitioner\u2019s property is surrounded by fully-developed lots each containing two dwellings, one fronting the ocean and the other directly behind the first and fronting First Avenue. The property is one of only a handful of beachfront properties in all of Manasquan with only one house constructed on the lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">The existing house, approximately fifty-two feet long and twenty-six feet wide, faces First Avenue and is separated from the street by a ten-foot concrete driveway leading to a garage. Including the wood deck on the back of the home, the entire existing structure covers less than one-half of the lot\u2019s length.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Consistent with the surrounding properties, petitioner sought to build a second home that faced the ocean on that portion of the property behind the current house. She intended to occupy it with her aged and ailing mother. She submitted an application to DEP for a CAFRA permit on May 2, 2004. On June 24, 2004, DEP conducted a site inspection of the property and concluded that a portion of the property \u201ceastward of the eastern face of the existing dwelling\u201d \u2014 where petitioner intended to build the new home \u2014 was located on a dune. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-3.16. DEP also determined that the proposed dwelling was located within the coastal high hazard area, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-3.18, and denied the application on August 2, 2004. Petitioner appealed and on September 12 and October 18, 2005, a hearing was held before an administrative law judge (ALJ) pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14F-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">At the hearing, petitioner identified photographs of her home and the surrounding properties taken over the years. Several of the photographs showed the beach stretching eastward from the rear of her house to the ocean in a generally flat expanse. Petitioner acknowledged, however, that several years ago Manas-quan constructed a dune \u2014 a \u201csand fence\u201d \u2014 on the easternmost boundary of her property in an effort to separate the beach from the private properties of petitioner and her neighbors. Over the years, the borough added additional sand \u201cfurther towards the ocean.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Petitioner testified as to her reasons for constructing a second home between the existing house and the dune, an area she described as flat. She noted that her parents had sacrificed for years in order to purchase the property and they had struggled financially to keep it intact and within the family rather than selling off pieces of it for financial gain. Petitioner also testified that given the health status of her mother, the existing house could \u201cnot accommodate her.\u201d She also noted that one of her neighbor\u2019s homes, \u201cfour or five houses\u201d from her, had been significantly reconstructed and built into the dune during the prior summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Keith Henderson, an attorney, testified as an expert witness on behalf of petitioner. Henderson practiced land use law in Manas-quan for over thirty years, and was familiar with the borough\u2019s zoning ordinance and the history of petitioner\u2019s property and the surrounding lots. Henderson testified that all these beachfront properties at the north end of Manasquan were once owned as one parcel by American Timber Company, and the company permitted its employees to construct modest homes and leased the land to its workers. Eventually, the company sold off the property, but not before subdividing its one large parcel into many smaller ones. This resulted in most of the subdivided lots, though not petitioner\u2019s, having two structures on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Henderson testified that petitioner\u2019s lot contained the required width, and almost twice the square footage necessary, to construct a second house under Manasquan\u2019s zoning ordinance. He opined that pursuant to the ordinance petitioner could build a second structure without subdividing the lot, though she would be required to obtain a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Petitioner\u2019s environmental expert, David Roth, testified. He conducted a site visit and reached several conclusions regarding petitioner\u2019s property and its location within the dune structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Roth noted that the property contained significant amounts of gravel. This was evidence, he concluded, that the proposed development area was not \u201csubject to the natural dune process,\u201d but, rather, was the result of man-made processes like construction activities. Roth described the general topography of petitioner\u2019s property as having \u201ca dune on its eastern edge\u201d that Roth believed was man-made, with an \u201cabrupt slope from its waterward side to its landward side.\u201d Roth testified that photographs taken of the area before 1990 show there was no dune on plaintiff\u2019s property at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Roth also testified that from the landward side of that dune, petitioner\u2019s property was \u201cgenerally flat\u201d and sloped less than one foot over the next seventy-two feet to the eastern edge of the existing home. Roth opined, therefore, that this area of proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>development was not on a dune because DEP\u2019s regulations required a dune to include a \u201crelatively steep\u201d oceanward and landward side.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Roth described the remainder of petitioner\u2019s property from the ocean side of the existing house as \u201cslop[ing] down to [the street].\u201d This incline along the street side of the property was more severe, was consistent with all the other properties along the street and was, in Roth\u2019s opinion, \u201can artifact of construction.\u201d Roth concluded that petitioner\u2019s proposed new house would be built \u201coutside of a dune area,\u201d because it was \u201clandward of the toe,\u201d or base, \u201cof the dune.\u201d Roth also concluded that the new house would not be in the \u201ccoastal high hazard area\u201d as defined by DEP\u2019s regulations. However, even if it was, Roth opined that petitioner met the criteria for the so-called \u201cinfill\u201d exception to the regulations. Given the intense development that surrounded petitioner\u2019s property, Roth contended that the construction of a second home would not cause any detriment to the existing dune structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">DEP\u2019s Colleen Keller of the agency\u2019s Bureau of Coastal Regulation testified as its expert in coastal planning and regulation. Keller conducted the primary review of petitioner\u2019s CAFRA application and had visited the property on various occasions. She testified that the entirety of petitioner\u2019s property was a dune, as defined by DEP\u2019s regulation, with its landward base at First Avenue. Keller opined that petitioner\u2019s home, along with the others along First Avenue, were actually built into the dune structure that existed prior to any of the development along First Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Keller also concluded that because petitioner\u2019s property was entirely on the dune, the proposed development was also within a coastal high hazard area. She further opined that petitioner could not comply with the \u201cinfill\u201d exception to the regulation because she had not subdivided the property and because the new structure would not be within one-hundred feet of the surrounding properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Keller acknowledged during cross-examination that in DEP\u2019s denial letter, which she prepared, in DEP\u2019s answers to interrogatories, which she completed, and in her expert report, she stated the dune extended to \u201cthe easternmost wall of the existing single-family dwelling,\u201d though she claimed that she never intended those statements to convey an opinion that the landward base of the dune was located at that point. Keller also agreed that the minimal slope in the area of proposed development was not \u201csteep,\u201d however, she attributed that to petitioner\u2019s activities, such as playing volleyball in that area. Lastly, Keller acknowledged that DEP\u2019s denial under the coastal high hazard rule was based solely upon the proposed construction being located on a dune, not within the so-called \u201chigh-velocity\u201d or \u201cV zone\u201d to which the agency\u2019s infill exception applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The ALJ rendered his initial decision on February 16,2006. He recognized that the primary dispute between the parties was \u201cthe location of the foot of the most inland slope [of the dune] ... in other words, the extent of the dune on petitioner\u2019s property.\u201d He acknowledged that the \u201cregulatory definition of \u2018dune\u2019 is not specific enough to answer the question concerning to what degree a slope no longer comprises the features of a dune.\u201d However, he did not believe the regulation\u2019s lack of \u201cgreater detail or specificity\u201d was reason to find it \u201cor [DEP\u2019s] interpretation thereof,\u201d \u201cso arbitrary ... as to render the agency action defective.\u201d Instead, the ALJ concluded that \u201cdue to the lack of specificity of these rules, the process of determining the extent of a dune should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">He concluded that the regulations\u2019 use of the term \u201crelatively steep\u201d did not support Roth\u2019s interpretation that the dune face had to have an \u201cabrupt\u201d change in steepness. Rather, the regulation supported DEP\u2019s conclusion that the entirety of petitioner\u2019s property was a dune because the use of the term \u201crelatively\u201d did not \u201crequire rigid adherence to the term\u201d steep, but rather \u201crelaxe[d] the characteristic[\u2019]s[ ] requirements.\u201d He concluded \u201cnothing in the regulation ... justifies] a finding that when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>slope of a dune changes, then the boundary of the dune necessarily follows.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The ALJ relied upon CAFRA\u2019s legislative history as support for the conclusion that petitioner would not suffer any adverse economic impact by the denial. He reasoned that she could simply expand her existing home rather than construct an entirely new one. However, he noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">The current development of the shoreline in petitioner\u2019s neighborhood is such that almost every other landowner has developed the same area on their property that petitioner now seeks in the present case. Thus, there may be a legitimate question as to the purpose and benefit of protecting this specific dune area when the surrounding properties have been, for the most part, developed for years. While the wisdom of the DEP\u2019s position in this case may be questionable, such concerns are more appropriate in the context of equity (or policy) and bear little impact on the legal arguments and analysis before this tribunal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Lastly, the ALJ determined that petitioner\u2019s property was in a \u201ccoastal high hazard area\u201d because it was entirely on a dune. He concluded that petitioner was not entitled to the \u201cinfill\u201d exception to the regulations because she failed to produce \u201cdirect evidence ... that the property was ... subdivided prior to July 19, 1993.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The ALJ\u2019s initial decision was fully adopted by DEP in its final agency decision of April 2, 2006, which noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"al0-dedup-0\">[t]he Department ... correctly addressed the full downward slope of the dune in question, from an elevation of twenty feet above sea level on the eastern boundary of the petitioner\u2019s property to an elevation of ten feet above sea level on the western boundary in determining that the entire property was part of the primary dune system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">DEP noted that the ALJ\u2019s initial decision \u201ccorrectly interpret[ed] the definition of dune in a manner that gives weight to the qualifying words in the regulations by requiring an assessment of each property on a case-by-case basis,\u201d striking a \u201cbalance\u201d between \u201cthe potential economic impact to property owners against the great benefits of protecting ocean and bayfront dunes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">DEP further concluded that \u201cthe issue of compliance with the Coastal High Hazard Rule is moot\u201d because petitioner\u2019s property was entirely on a dune; nevertheless, the agency determined that petitioner could not comply with the regulatory \u201cinfill\u201d exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>to the rule because she failed to demonstrate \u201cthe property was shown as a subdivided lot prior to July 1993.\u201d DEP denied petitioner\u2019s permit application and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">In reviewing decisions of administrative agencies, \u201c[o]ur function is to determine whether the administrative action was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Burris v. Police Dep\u2019t, Twp. of W. Orange, </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>493, 496, 769 A.2d 1112 (App.Div.2001) (citing <em>Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571, 580, 410 A.2d 686 (1980)). The burden of demonstrating that the agency\u2019s action was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable rests upon the person challenging the administrative action. <em>McGowan v.

New Jersey Div. of Motor Vehicles, </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>52, 56, 766 A.2d 312 (App.Div.2001) (quoting <em>In re Appeal by Progressive Cas. Ins. Co., </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>93, 102, 704 A.2d 562 (App.Div.1997)). Nevertheless, we are not bound by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>agency\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Levine v. State Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 32, 768 A.2d 192 (App.Div.2001) (citing <em>G.S. v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., Div. of Youth and Family, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>161, 170, 723 A.2d 612 (1999)); <em>see also Mayflower Sec. v. Bureau of Sec., </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>85, 93, 312 A.2d 497 (1973). Nor do we simply act as a rubber stamp of approval for the agency\u2019s decisions. <em>Henry, supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 579-80, 410 A.2d 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Petitioner argues that the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions are inconsistent with its regulatory definition of a dune. Secondarily, she argues that even if her property is in a coastal high hazard area, she is entitled to the infill exception because she meets the regulatory criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">DEP argues that its findings and conclusions are reasonably based upon the evidence adduced at the hearing and that petitioner\u2019s entire property is a primary frontal dune as defined by the applicable regulations. It further argues that petitioner has not met the requirements of the regulations regarding the infill excep- . tion.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">At oral argument, both sides conceded that the sole issue in the case is whether DEP correctly interpreted and applied the dunes rule to the facts of this case. We now comprehend these concessions to mean that both sides agree that consideration of the coastal high hazard and infill exception regulations is unnecessary. In other words, DEP acknowledges that it denied petitioner\u2019s application because the development was on a dune, and, hence, by definition, in a coastal high hazard area. DEP concedes that it failed to demonstrate any other basis for concluding that the property is in a coastal high hazard zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Likewise, petitioner acknowledges that if the development area is on a primary frontal dune, she must meet the strict requirements for development on a dune \u2014 that is \u201cthat [she] has no practicable or feasible alternative in an area other than a dune, and that [she] will not cause significant adverse long-term impacts on the natural functioning of the beach and dune system, either individually or in combination with other existing or proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>structures, land disturbances or activities.\u201d Her compliance with the infill exception would be superfluous if she could not meet these stringent criteria. Conversely, if her proposed development is not on a dune, it is not in a coastal high hazard area, and neither the restrictions of the dunes rule, nor the coastal high hazard area regulations, apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Thus, the parties acknowledge the sole question presented is whether DEP\u2019s determination that petitioner\u2019s entire property was a primary frontal dune as defined by its regulations was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">In enacting CAFRA, the Legislature found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">that certain portions of the coastal area are now suffering serious adverse environmental effects resulting from existing facility activity impacts that would preclude or tend to preclude those multiple uses which support diversity and are in the best long-term, social, economic, aesthetic and recreational interests of all people of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-10\"><em>[N.J.SA. </em>13:19-2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">The Legislature balanced, however, its desire to address the adverse environmental effects of coastal area development with recognized economic considerations for those who inhabited the coastal areas, noting CAFRA was intended to also</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaT\">encourage the development of compatible land uses in order to improve the overall economic position of the inhabitants of that area within the framework of a comprehensive environmental design strategy which preserves the most ecologically sensitive and fragile area from inappropriate development and provides adequate environmental safeguards for the construction of any facilities in the coastal area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq7\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">Each agency decision involving an application for development under CAFRA invokes these \u201ccompeting policy considerations.\u201d <em>In Re Cape May County Mun.

CAFRA\u2019s broad reach extends beyond protection of the environment in that it \u201c[s]pecifically [] delegates powers to the DEP and requires it to adopt rules and regulations governing land use within the coastal zone \u2018for the general welfare.\u2019 \u201d <em>Raleigh Ave. Beach Ass\u2019n v.

Thus, in regulating the construction of a single-family detached home as a permitted use in a coastal area, DEP decided that development was subject to the dunes rule only if it was located on a \u201ccontinuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand,\u201d with \u201crelatively steep water-ward and landward slopes,\u201d located \u201cimmediately landward of and adjacent to the beach,\u201d and \u201csubject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during major coastal storms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">DEP\u2019s rationale statement for its housing regulations expresses an attempt to balance competing environmental and economic concerns both as to location and use. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-7.2(f)12.

Petitioner contends the dune is limited to a discrete ridge of sand, generally along the property\u2019s eastern boundary and demarcated by a \u201crelatively steep waterward\u201d slope and a \u201crelatively steep landward\u201d slope. DEP contends that the entire property is a primary frontal dune with a steep waterward slope, then a sharp immediately adjacent landward slope, and then a continuation of that slope gradually over the next nearly one-hundred and sixty feet of petitioner\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">\u201cRegulations are subject to the same rules of construction as a statute,\u201d and \u201cshould be construed in accordance with the plain meaning of [their] language\u201d \u201cand in a manner that makes sense when read in the context of the entire regulation.\u201d <em>Medford Convalescent &amp; Nursing Ctr. v. Div. of Med. Asst. and Health Svcs., </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 5, 526 A.2d 1087 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>385, 508 A.2d 247 (1985). \u201cIn interpreting a statute courts should avoid a construction that would render \u2018any word in the statute to be inoperative, superfluous or meaningless, or to mean something other than its ordinary meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bergen Commer. Bank v. Sisler, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>188, 204, 723 A.2d 944 (1999) (quoting <em>In Re Estate of Post, </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>59, 72, 659 A.2d 500 (App.Div.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">The ALJ\u2019s initial decision and DEP\u2019s final decision construe the term \u201crelatively\u201d as limiting and modifying the term \u201csteep.\u201d Under this construction, DEP need not demonstrate that petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>er\u2019s entire property presented a steep landward slope because if that was intended, the regulation would have simply used the word \u201csteep\u201d with no modifier. While we appreciate this rationale, this construction is inadequate for purposes of a comprehensive interpretation of the regulation because it fails to give adequate meaning to all the terms DEP chose to use in describing a primary frontal dune.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Neither the initial decision by the ALJ nor the final agency decision attaches any particular meaning to the word \u201crelatively\u201d in the context of the regulation. The term means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">[I]n a relative manner; in relation or respect to something else; not absolute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\"><em>[Webster\u2019s Third New Int'l Dictionary </em>1916 (3d ed.1986).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Synonyms for \u201csteep\u201d include \u201cabrupt,\u201d \u201cprecipitous,\u201d or \u201csheer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2234.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">We imply from the ALJ\u2019s decision that he construed the phrase \u201crelatively steep\u201d as meaning the landward slope of the dune need not be steep in an absolute sense. However, such a construction provides little guidance because it assumes, in the end, that the landward slope of a primary frontal dune is steep relative to, or in relation or respect to, something else.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">That something else is never defined in the regulation. Petitioner has not sought to challenge the regulation as being unconstitutionally vague in this regard. <em>See In Re Adoption of Amendments to N.J.A.C., </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>371, 390, 772 A.2d 9 (App.Div. 2001) (holding \u201cchallenged [regulatory] language\u201d must be \u201c\u2018so vague that [a person] of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>State v. Lashinsky, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>1, 17, 404 A.2d 1121 (1989)). We, therefore, decline to directly address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">Nevertheless, we strive to accord a reasonable interpretation to the regulation that still serves the overarching statutory purposes of CAFRA We conclude, therefore, that the waterward and landward slopes of a primary frontal dune must abruptly incline and decline respectively compared with the rest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>subject property or with the other properties in the area immediately adjacent to the subject property. This interpretation accords significant protection to primary frontal dunes, as opposed to development on secondary or tertiary dunes or non-dune structures, from development as intended by the regulations, while at the same time allowing for \u201creasonable development\u201d that will \u201cimprove the overall economic position\u201d of coastal inhabitants on other areas adjacent to the primary frontal dune. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:19-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Considered in this light, we are convinced that the agency erred in concluding that petitioner\u2019s entire property was a primary frontal dune. First, the overwhelming percentage of the lot had a very gradual declining slope in elevation from east to west after a sudden, abrupt decline at its easternmost boundary line. This overall slope was not \u201crelatively steep\u201d compared to the sharp waterward side elevation and the sharp landward side decline of a ridge of sand located at the property\u2019s eastern boundary \u2014 the primary frontal dune as identified by petitioner\u2019s expert. In fact, most of this gradual slope occurred well after the point where petitioner sought to erect her second home. Instead, as Roth noted, the abrupt elevation and immediate adjacent decline of this ridge of sand were both \u201crelatively steep\u201d \u2014 as required by the regulations \u2014 when compared to the entire balance of petitioner\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Nor was the topographical decline of petitioner\u2019s property relatively steep when compared with any of the surrounding properties. The undisputed testimony from both sides was that the surrounding properties generally had similar sloping along First Avenue. There was no evidence in the record regarding the topography of the area on the western side of that street.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Because petitioner\u2019s entire property is not a primary frontal dune as defined by DEP, and because the proposed development will not be on a dune, the restrictions of the dunes rule do not apply. Since the development is not on a dune, the coastal high hazard rule does not apply either.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>We find additional support for our conclusion when we consider the fundamental unfairness that would result to this particular petitioner from an application of the dunes rule to this development. We note initially that the rule itself permits development on a dune where there is \u201cno practicable or feasible alternative in an area other than a dune,\u201d and where it will not cause \u201csignificant adverse longterm impacts on the natural functioning of the beach and dune system.\u201d DEP failed to adequately consider either of these factors in making its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In its denial letter, DEP found that \u201ca practicable alternative to the proposed construction ... would be the reconstruction of the existing home ... construction on a lot that is not a dune, the purchase of an existing house on a lot that is not a dune or the reconstruction of an existing house on a lot that is not a dune.\u201d This same language was contained in Keller\u2019s expert report that was admitted into evidence at the hearing before the ALJ who agreed that petitioner suffered no significant detriment because she could expand the existing house. DEP did not directly address the issue in its final agency decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">We note that expansion of an existing home in an area subject to CAFRA is regulated by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-7.9; <em>see also N.J.A.C. </em>7:7E-7.2(f). Pursuant to those regulations, any reconstruction occurring on a dune is exempt from the dunes rule if it meets additional criteria, one of which requires the development to be \u201clocated within the footprint of development of the existing single family home ... and/or on the landward side of the existing footprint of development____\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7 \u2014 9(d)3iii; <em>see also N.J.A.C. </em>7:7-7.2(f)2iii(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">While the record in this regard was not fully developed, we would note that petitioner\u2019s testimony regarding the inadequacy of the existing structure to meet her mother\u2019s medical needs was unchallenged. Furthermore, it is undisputed that the \u201clandward side\u201d of petitioner\u2019s existing structure consisted of approximately ten feet of concrete driveway. It would appear, therefore, that reconstruction of the home so as to comply with this exception to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the dunes rule presented difficulties that could not be so casually-dispatched.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Nor do we believe that the other alternatives DEP proposed, all of which essentially required petitioner to purchase other property, represent \u201cpractical or feasible alternative^]\u201d to petitioner\u2019s dilemma.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">We are also convinced that DEP failed to adequately consider whether granting petitioner\u2019s permit would cause \u201csignificant adverse longterm impacts on the natural functioning of the beach and dune system.\u201d Although this opinion was contained in rather conclusory language in Keller\u2019s report, the ALJ questioned \u201cthe wisdom of DEP\u2019s position\u201d by recognizing that such adverse consequences were unlikely given the scale of existing development all around petitioner. Even assuming DEP was correct in determining that the entirety of petitioner\u2019s property was a primary frontal dune, we are hard-pressed to understand how the erection of this modest home could have a significant adverse impact beyond what has already occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Our Supreme Court has noted that \u201c[a]ny administrative agency in determining how best to effectuate public policy is also limited by applying principles of fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. v. Stavola, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>425, 436 n. 2, 511 A.2d 622 (1986). \u201cWhen specific parties are particularly affected by a proposed rule, fair play and administrative due process dictate that an agency must conscientiously concern itself with and make reasonable efforts to accommodate the rights and interests of the affected individual and genuinely account for the individualized effect of its proposed action.\u201d <em>Bally Mfg. Carp. v. New Jersey Casino Control Comm\u2019n, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>325, 345, 426 A.2d 1000 (1981) (Handler, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">The lack of definitive standards in the regulation as it currently exists, under the unique facts of this case, further exacerbates the fundamental unfairness to this petitioner. <em>See Stavola, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 438, 511 A.2d 622 (holding in the context of a different CAFRA regulation that the lack of \u201cspecific standard[s] results in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>confusion to the public and to DEP\u201d). The lack of definition in the regulation may promote \u201can assessment of each property on a ease-by-case basis,\u201d a virtue extolled by DEP in its final decision, but it clearly results in the regulations\u2019 failure to provide \u201cthe public-at-large\u201d with meaningful guidance and predictability in an \u201cimportant area[ ] of social concern\u201d where DEP\u2019s \u201caction[s] ... have wide application.\u201d <em>Crema v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>286, 300, 463 A.2d 910 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">We therefore reverse and remand the matter to DEP for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
