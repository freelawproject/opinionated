City of Newark, </em>43 <em>N. J. Super. </em>546 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1957)), except as to the application of the statutory provisions contained in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-51 and 34:15-54. As to these sections, we conclude that they stand <em>in pari materia, </em>having been simultaneously enacted as part of the revision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, as included in <em>Title </em>34, <em>chapter </em>15 of the <em>Revised Statutes. </em>They should therefore be construed to give effect to both. <em>Cf. Crater v. County of Somerset, </em>123 <em>N. J. L. </em>407 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1939). This construction results in the preservation of the claimant\u2019s right to file a petition within two years after the last payment of compensation, notwithstanding the dismissal of his claim petition for want of prosecution under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-54, if such dismissal occurred within the two-year period. If such a dismissal occurs after the expiration of the two-year period, then the claimant still has the right to have his dismissed claim petition reinstated under that section for good cause shown within one year thereafter. Furthermore, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-54 does not provide for any effect or consequence of the dismissal as to the claimant\u2019s rights under any other provision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-51 makes no exception in respect to the application of the two-year provision by reason of any action which may have been taken under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Upon the opinion of Judge Eoley, to the extent adopted by us and for the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the County Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
