J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A-_\">This is an action upon an automobile liability insurance policy issued by the defendant to the plaintiff covering the latter\u2019s auto. The only question we shall pass upon relates to the significance of the word \u201cbusiness\u201d appearing in a declaration in the policy that the auto is to be used for \u201cpleasure and business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">The plaintiff, a rabbi of Paterson, Hew Jersey, in addition to attending to his religious duties, conducted a Hebrew school and, during July and August, a day camp on property owned by Ye Shiva in southern Hew York State. Eor the transportation of the children between their homes and the camp, not only had a bus been provided, but he also frequently used his own car. One child, while thus being taken from the camp to Paterson in his car, fell from it, and she and her parents brought suit against the present plaintiff, securing a judgment for $750. The insurer denied liability under the policy, and as a result the plaintiff was obliged to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>the judgment, as well as his attorneys\u2019 charge of $250 for their services. Thereupon he brought this action in a county district court to recover the $1,000 thus paid. The court, holding that plaintiff had not established coverage under the policy, gave judgment for the defendant. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The printed policy was so prepared as to contain certain blanks on the first page, which were filled in in typewriting, as indicated by the words italicized below and by the \u201cX\u201d mark inserted before the phrase \u201cpleasure and business\u201d; this first page bears the title \u201cDeclarations,\u201d and the agreement of insurance is expressly rested on them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">\u201cItem 1. Name of insured <em>Rabbi Charles Tannenbaum</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">Address <em>k\u00a5&gt; Hast 86th Street, Paterson,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">\n<em>Passaic County, New Jersey</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">Occupation of the named insured is <em>Self employed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\"># $ <em>v </em># S\u00ed !\u00a1! *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Item 5. The purposes for which the automobile is to be used are :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">[\u00ae] Pleasure and Business; [ ] Commercial .........</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-12\">Other .........................................</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-13\">(a) The term \u2018pleasure and business\u2019 is defined as personal, pleasure, family and business use. (b) The term \u2018commercial\u2019 is defined as use principally in the business occupation of the named insured as stated in item 1, including occasional use for personal, pleasure, family and other business purposes * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">Defendant contends that the word \u201cbusiness\u201d in the phrase \u201cpleasure and business\u201d has reference solely to the insured\u2019s occupation stated in item 1 of the policy, for, it is said, this is the only business of his within the contemplation of the parties at the time of the issuance of the policy, and indeed the very purpose of item 1 must have been to elicit information in connection with item 5. Accordingly, defendant argues, the word must be taken to refer to the plaintiff\u2019s business or vocation as a rabbi, and hence not to his operation of the day camp which is said to be (and we may assume it to be so for the purposes of this opinion) a wholly unrelated matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>It seems to us quite clear that this contention cannot be sustained. Item 5 of the policy places in juxtaposition the following three terms: (1) \u201cbusiness,\u201d stated generally and without the least qualification, see clause (a) ; (2) \u201cthe business occupation of the named insured as stated in item 1,\u201d see clause (b); and (3) \u201cother business purposes,\u201d that is, business purposes unconnected with the stated occupation, see clause (b). Having in mind the difference in the phraseology of these three terms, we see no warrant whatever for cutting down the full generality of the first term, as defendant would have us do, so as to render it a precise equivalent of the second term.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">So far as we have found, the point has not been decided. However such authority as has been located supports the view we have expressed. <em>Cf. Farmers Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange v. Calkins, </em>39 <em>Cal. App. 2d </em>390, 103 <em>P. 2d </em>230, 232, 233 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1940), indicating that the term \u201cbusiness\u201d in the phrase \u201cbusiness and pleasure\u201d includes the business of acting occasionally as a volunteer fireman for a small compensation and is not to be construed as having reference solely to the insured\u2019s stated occupation, <em>viz., </em>\u201crancher\u201d (compare <em>Pauli v. St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co., </em>255 <em>App. Div. </em>935, 8 <em>N. Y. S. 2d 691 (App. Div. </em>1938)); <em>Farm Bureau Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Manson, </em>94 <em>N. H. </em>389, 54 <em>A. 2d </em>580, 582 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947); <em>cf., </em>too, <em>Cohen v. Chicago Bonding &amp; Ins. Co., </em>146 <em>Minn. 222, </em>178 <em>N. W. </em>485 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1920). <em>Appleman, </em>in his work on <em>Automobile Liability Insurance, </em>31, 32, 34 (1938), noting the scarcity of authority, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">\u201cIf file endorsement is for \u2018pleasure and business\u2019 purposes all uses are included, except where the automobile becomes converted into a resillar commercial vehicle. * * * It is the intention of the framers [of the National Standard Policy] to permit a broad and liberal construction of these definitions * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">If it be argued that there is ambiguity in clause (a) of item 5, the answer is that the clause will then be taken most strongly against the insurer. <em>Jasion v. Preferred </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>Accident Ins. Co. of N. Y., </em>113 <em>N. J. L. </em>108, 114 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1934). As to whether such a clause, read with the familiar omnibus clause, provides coverage in connection with any business of a person using the car with the insured\u2019s permission (a point we need not pass upon), see <em>Georgia Casualty Co. v. Waldman, </em>53 <em>F. 2d </em>24, 25 (5 <em>Cir. </em>1931); <em>Zuvich v. Ballay, </em>149 <em>So. </em>281, 284 <em>(La. Ct. App. </em>1933) (\u201cuse of the car in question is limited not to the business or pleasure of the owner, but to business or pleasure generally\u201d); <em>Schultz r. Krosch, </em>204 <em>Minn. </em>585, 284 <em>N. W. </em>782, 783, 784 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In our opinion the term \u201cbusiness,\u201d as used in the \u201cbroad * * * formula\u201d <em>(Terrasi v. Peirce, </em>304 <em>Mass. </em>409, 23 <em>N. E. 2d </em>871, 873 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1939)) of \u201cpleasure and business,\u201d is not to be limited to the business occupation stated in item 1, nor to the insured\u2019s principal business. It might be added that there is no claim that the car was used for \u201ccommercial\u201d purposes, as defined in item 5(b) of this policy, a use which, it is said, calls for a higher premium; a commercial use would exist where a car is used \u201cprincipally\u201d in the business occupation specified in item 1, and only occasionally \u201cfor personal, pleasure, family and other business purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In view of these conclusions, we need not deal with the point presented in the supplemental briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Reversed, with directions to enter judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
