A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A7\">Plaintiff fell out of a roller coaster operated by the defendant at Palisades Amusement Park, April 23, 1954, sustaining severe bodily injuries. This is an appeal by the defendant from a judgment entered upon a jury verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor. At a previous trial a verdict for the plaintiff had been set aside by the trial judge as against the weight of the evidence. The instant verdict withstood a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-12\">On the date mentioned the plaintiff, a young woman, in company of a male friend, arrived at the amusement park at about 4:00 t?. m. After consuming a whisky highball at an open air bar and taking a ride on a ferris wheel, she and her friend went directly to the roller coaster. This device consists of a train of three cars, coupled together, and running <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>on tracks, which, is first pulled by electric power to an elevation and then permitted by gravity to plunge down and around a series of dips and curves of varying degrees. It is common knowledge that a roller coaster is one of the more thrilling types of \u201crides\u201d found in amusement parks and that its attraction lies in the exhilaration produced by the speed and suddenness of its movements.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">On this particular device each car has three seats. These are three feet wide. A stationary \u201csafety bar\u201d of tubular stainless steel is bolted to the back of each seat, extending over the well of the seat behind, so that it crosses laterally over the hips of the occupant, and about one foot away from the abdomen of the average occupant. The passenger is not strapped in.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">The coaster track is 2,600 feet in length, the curves banked to counteract centrifugal force. This apparatus, including the train, has been used continuously by defendant each season since 1944. There was no claim by the plaintiff of faulty construction of the device and there was expert proof on behalf of the defendant that it was \u201cthe safest type of construction * * * that is in operation today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">Plaintiff and her companion took one ride together. He was unwilling to take another, but she wanted to, so she stayed on the train, but changed her seat, so she testified, to another three or four seats toward the rear. Her account of the second ride was as follows. On the initial ascent she did not take hold of the bar, the rise being slow, but as the first plunge began she took hold of the bar, found it was loose (\u201cit jiggled back and forth\u201d) and let go of the bar because she \u201cdidn\u2019t feel it would sustain [her] weight, and [she] was afraid of falling out.\u201d She then held onto both sides of the car, but she was \u201cbeing pushed back and forth in the car\u201d and \u201cwas growing quite tired.\u201d She then testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-7\">\u201cWithout leaving go of my grip, I turned around in my seat, but holding on, and held onto the back of my seat, and there were some young ladies riding in a ear in back of me, and I tried to call to them to let them know of the difficulty that I was in, and they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>made some gestures, but I couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying; and then suddenly I felt a different lurch, rather strong, and I went out of the car; and that\u2019s all I remember.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">She further explained the \u201clurch\u201d as: \u201cIt was a different lurch and a sudden lurch. It was a different lurch than the turns or the curves that you go around.\u201d She testified, with corroboration from defendant\u2019s witnesses, that at no time did she stand up in the car. On cross-examination she admitted that at the first trial she had testified that \u201cI just felt a lurch and I went out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">Plaintiff had no supporting witnesses. Her companion on the day of the ride did not appear in her behalf. The trial court denied a motion for an involuntary dismissal at the end of the plaintiff\u2019s ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">Defendant produced as witnesses three teen-age girls who were the only other occupants of the coaster on the ride when plaintiff was injured. They were riding free, one of them being the daughter of a park employee. Their testimony was in substantial agreement, except that two of them said plaintiff went \u201cover the bar\u201d and out of the car, and the third that she \u201cwent out head first underneath the bar.\u201d The substance of the remainder of their testimony was that plaintiff did not change her seat between rides; that they warned her to hold onto the safety bar and she replied, \u201cMaybe with one hand\u201d; that as the ride began she shouted to her companion, \u201cWish mo luck\u201d; that there was nothing unusual or different about the ride, nor any sudden or unusual lurch; and that plaintiff was not holding the bar but was swaying from side to side in her seat before she fell out. They also testified that they tested the bar in the plaintiff\u2019s seat after the accident and found it was not loose. Each of the girls was an experienced roller coaster patron. IIow much experience on other roller coasters plaintiff previously had is unknown, but this was her first experience on defendant\u2019s coaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">Defendant also offered proofs by its staff personnel to the effect that the cars, tracks and safety bars were inspected daily; that the safety bar of the car in question was found to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>be firm immediately after plaintiff was injured; and that the same car has been used continuously since. Other details of their proof are recounted <em>infra. </em>Joseph A. McKee, associated with the management of the park, and purporting to be an expert in the construction and operation of roller coasters, testified that the purpose of the safety bar was to compel passengers to remain seated. \u201cIf the people remain in the seat, they will come home\u201d (arrive safely).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">The court denied a motion for dismissal at the end of the defendant\u2019s case, relying principally upon the applicability of the rule of <em>res ipsa loquitur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The grounds of appeal fall in three categories: (a) failure to dismiss for lack of evidence of specific negligence proximately causing the injury; (b) erroneous charge to the jury of the applicability of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>and reliance upon that rule in denying the motion for dismissal; and (c) miscellaneous other errors in the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">While defendant was not an insurer of its patrons\u2019 safety, <em>Schellack v. Biers, </em>109 <em>N. J. L. </em>61, 63 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1932), it was incumbent upon it to exercise reasonable care and diligence to keep and maintain the device reasonably safe for its intended purpose. <em>Ibid.; Friel v. Wildwood Ocean Pier Corp., </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>376 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1943); accord: <em>Griffin v. De Geeter, </em>132 <em>N. J. L. </em>381, 382 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1945); <em>Pona v. Boulevard Arena, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>148 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955). Patently reasonable care in this instance included affirmative efforts to inspect the device to see that it was operating with reasonable safety. 2 <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>\u00a7 300, <em>comment </em>(e). (1934); <em>Rakowski v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>5 <em>N. J. Super. </em>203, 207 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949), certification denied 3 <em>N. J. </em>502 (1950); 52 <em>Am. Jur. </em>293, <em>Theatres, </em>\u00a7 48 (1944); <em>Firszt v. Capitol Park Realty Co., </em>98 <em>Conn. </em>627, 120 <em>A. </em>300, 29 <em>A. L. R. </em>17 <em>(Sup. Ct. Err. </em>1923); <em>Carlin v. Smith, </em>148 <em>Md. </em>524, 130 <em>A. </em>340, 344, 44 <em>A. L. R. </em>193 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1925). If a defect is discoverable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>by proper and due inspection it is immaterial that defendant has no actual knowledge of it. Compare <em>Oelschlaeger v. Hahne &amp; Co., 2 N. J. </em>490 (1949), with <em>Van Slavaren v. F. W. Woolworth Co., </em>29 <em>N. J. Super. </em>197, 203 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954). Defendant itself offered evidence of its daily inspection of the entire area of the tracks and of inspection before operation each day of the particular device here used. More significantly, defendant\u2019s brakeman Caporale (operator of the coaster) testified to his practice of \u201cinspecting\u201d the safety bars after every ride. He said that while the cars were \u201cmoving down\u201d from discharge point to loading platform, he would \u201chelp it down\u201d by pulling on the bar, at the same time \u201cfinding out if it was loose,\u201d and that he \u201cdistinctly\u201d remembered performing this operation just before plaintiff\u2019s fateful ride; moreover, that he found the bar \u201cbolted fast\u201d upon inspection immediately after the accident. In view of plaintiff\u2019s testimony that the bar was in fact loose and that it \u201cjiggled,\u201d there consequently arose a question of credibility and the jury could have chosen to believe plaintiff. It being highly doubtful that the bar could have been \u201cfast\u201d when Caporale \u201cinspected\u201d it and loose when plaintiff first discovered the looseness, the jury could have inferred that Caporale, in performing his inspection, did not exercise the requisite amount of care. The duty to inspect includes, by its very nature, the duty to inspect properly. \u201cAn inspection must be adequate, according to the circumstances, to be reasonably careful.\u201d <em>Carlin v. Smith, supra </em>(130 <em>A. </em>at <em>page </em>344). A failure to inspect properly is at least as culpable as a failure to inspect at all. <em>Cf. M. Dietz &amp; Sons, Inc., v. </em>Miller, 43 <em>N. J. Super. </em>334, 338 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957). We conclude that the jury could have found that the bar was loose, that the condition was discoverable by a reasonably adequate inspection, and that an inspection was made but was not adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">Defendant apparently contends that the iooseness of the bar could not have proximately caused the injury, relying chiefly upon the testimony of McKee, implying that the bar is placed in the car only to prevent people from standing up, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>and that since the plaintiff did not stand np, the looseness of the bar conld not have contributed to the accident. However, we find it hard to believe that if plaintiff had maintained a firm grip on the safety bar, her susceptibility to the lurches and turns of the roller coaster and to the hazard of a fall from the car would not have been significantly diminished. The bar is usually called a safety bar, and common sense dictates that holding it is an aid to safety. This is corroborated by the admonitions of the three experienced girl riders to the plaintiff to hold the bar. The jury was specifically instructed that it would have to find that the looseness of the bar proximately caused the injury. The jury did not have to accept McKee\u2019s testimony literally. It was free to draw the inference that if plaintiff had held onto thg bar she would not have been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">Defendant also contends that plaintiff\u2019s failure to hold onto the bar was contributory negligence as a matter of law and was a contingency not foreseeable by the defendant. While defendant\u2019s witnesses testified, in effect, that plaintiff\u2019s failure to hold onto the bar was purposeful, this is emphatically denied by plaintiff. We cannot say that, as a matter of law, plaintiff acted unreasonably or unforeseeably, under the circumstances, when she elected, according to her testimony, to rely on holding onto the sides and back of the car rather than the \u201cjiggling\u201d bar, which she feared would not hold her weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the jury could have found that the looseness of the bar, if a fact, proximately contributed to the causation of plaintiff\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Had the looseness of the bar been the only theory upon which the jury was permitted to find liability, a jury verdict for the plaintiff would be supportable. However, the trial court submitted another theory of liability to the jury under the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>This we are constrained to hold was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Under the classic statement of the requirements of the rule of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>in addition to the element of control by the defendant of the instrumentality, it must appear that the injurious occurrence is one \u201cwhich in the ordinary course of things would not take place if the person in control were exercising due care.\u201d <em>Mumma v. Easton and Amboy R. R. Co., </em>73 <em>N. J. L. </em>653, 658 (E. <em>&amp; A. </em>1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">We do not find in the evidence any justification for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that there was that kind of occurrence insofar as the roller coaster itself, as distinguished from the plaintiff, over whom defendant had no control, 'was concerned. (Of course, the \u201cloose\u201d bar plays no part in this analysis.) The theory of the trial court was that McKee\u2019s testimony that the cars are constructed in such a manner that as long as the passengers remain seated they must complete the ride safely (\u201ccome home\u201d), coupled with plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to a \u201csudden,\u201d \u201cdifferent,\u201d and \u201cstronger\u201d lurch, and the admitted fact that she did not stand up, gave rise to the hypothesis of an unusual occurrence within the rule of <em>res ipsa. </em>We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">We have recently had occasion to stress that <em>res ipsa </em>cannot apply unless <em>the trial court </em>itself properly finds that the balance of probabilities from the proofs is that, in the ordinary course of things, that is, in general experience, the occurrence would not have happened if the defendant, in control of the instrumentality, had been exercising duo care. <em>Bornstein v. Metropolitan Bottling Co., </em>45 <em>N. J. Super. </em>365 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957). While many decisions in other courts have utilized <em>res ipsa </em>in cases involving roller coasters and other \u201cthrill\u201d rides, <em>Annotations, </em>98 <em>A. L. R. </em>557, 561 (1935) ; 61 <em>A. L. R. </em>1289, 1293 (1929), we have been unable to discover any New Jersey decision in that category wherein the doctrine was successfully invoked without specific proof of an aberration of some kind in the physical behavior of the device. The only such opinion cited to us wherein the doctrine appears to have been urged is <em>Adriance v. Schench Bros., </em>95 <em>N. J. L. </em>185 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1920). There plaintiff was injured while riding in an amusement device called a \u201cracer.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>There was no proof as to how the plaintiff was injured or in what way the machine went awry and caused the injury. There was only the bare fact that the plaintiff was \u201cdoubled up, bleeding.\u201d The court held <em>res ipsa </em>inapplicable, affirming a non-suit. Thus the mere fact that the injury occurred on an amusement device was held to be insufficient to warrant application of the doctrine.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\">\u201cIt is not the doing of an injury to person or property that evokes the application of the maxim <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>It is the <em>unusualness </em>and unexplained elements of the happening, within the knowledge and control of the defendant, from which the injury results.\u201d (Emphasis added) <em>McKinney v. Public Service Interstate Transp. Co., </em>4 <em>N. J. </em>229, 242 (1950).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Thus, in the present case, the fall is not the \u201cunusual occurrence\u201d; the fall is but the injury. Plaintiff must show an unusual occurrence with relation to the car, not merely with respect to the plaintiff. It has already been noted that plaintiff does not contend that the coaster was not properly constructed. Compare <em>Garafola v. Rosecliff Realty Co., Inc., 24 N. J. Super. </em>28 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952). While the percentage of roller coaster passengers who do not \u201ccome home\u201d <em>via </em>the appointed route is admittedly small, it cannot be said that, absent satisfactory proof of at least an \u201cunusual\u201d occurrence in the manner in which the device proceeded or functioned, the event precipitating this action, plaintiff\u2019s fall, was one which \u201cin the ordinary course of things\u201d would not take place if the defendant were exercising due care. Without a showing of such an aberration in the operation of the apparatus itself, we are of the view that the probabilities of defendant\u2019s negligence do not preponderate, and, we repeat, the court must decide this question of the probabilities for itself, when <em>res ipsa </em>is invoked. <em>Bornstein v. Metropolitan Bottling Co., supra. </em>There are other, more plausible explanations. The inference that plaintiff\u2019s own movements (considered apart from their alleged relationship to the asserted looseness of the bar), caused her to fall out, is stronger. See <em>Hollander v. Smith &amp; Smith, </em>10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>82, 89 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>(App. Div. </em>1950). These movements may have been due to bravado, the recent whisky highball, faintness for any reason, or sheer carelessness. It does not matter which.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The out-of-state decisions cited by plaintiff are entirely consistent with these conclusions. For example, in <em>O'Callaghan v. Dellwood Park Co., </em>242 <em>Ill. </em>336, 89 <em>N. E. </em>1005, 26 <em>L. R. A., N. S., </em>1054 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1909), the coaster came to a sudden stop; in <em>Brown v. Winnwood Amusement Co., </em>225 <em>Mo. App. </em>1180, 34 <em>S. W. 2d </em>149 <em>(K. C. Ct. App. </em>1931), there was an unusually violent jerk which raised plaintiff\u2019s body almost to an upright position and in a different direction than would the normally exerted centrifugal force; in <em>Eldred v. United Amusement Co., </em>137 <em>Or. </em>452, 2 <em>P. 2d </em>1114 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1931), a safety chain broke; in <em>Dickson v. Bounds, </em>190 <em>Ark. </em>86, 77 <em>S. </em>W. <em>2d </em>456 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1934), a water-toboggan slide jumped its tracks. See also <em>Bibeau v. Fred </em>W. <em>Pearce Corp., </em>173 <em>Minn. </em>331, 217 <em>N. </em>W. 374 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1928); <em>Pontecorvo v. Clark, </em>95 <em>Cal. App. </em>162, 272 <em>P. </em>591 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1928); <em>Carlin v. Smith, supra. </em>See also <em>Reinzi v. Tilyou, </em>252 <em>N. Y. </em>97, 169 <em>N. E. </em>101 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1929) (no discussion of <em>res ipsa, </em>however), and <em>Brennan v. Ocean View Amusements Co., </em>289 <em>Mass. </em>587, 194 <em>N. E. </em>911 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1935) (did not use <em>res ipsa, </em>but noted that other cases under similar facts had invoked the doctrine). In the <em>Brown </em>case, <em>supra </em>(34 <em>S. </em>W. <em>2d </em>at <em>page </em>152), it was specifically required that the plaintiff show that \u201cthe movement of the device was extraordinary for that particular mode of transportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">To supply the essential \u201cunusual occurrence\u201d plaintiff relies on her statement that she felt a \u201cdifferent lurch, rather strong\u201d (which she amplified, after further questioning by counsel, by saying it was a \u201cdifferent lurch than the turns or the curves that you go around\u201d), to show that the coaster behaved erratically. But lurches, as such, are not erratic or unusual on roller coasters. It is the lurches, the sudden movements, the rapid turns and plunges, which provide the very thrills which plaintiff was seeking. They are ordinary, not unusual, in such an apparatus. The distinction is between sudden movements which the very nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>of the activity entails and movements which are so unusual, even with such an activity or device, as to warrant the inference that the person in control of the conveyance departed from a reasonable standard of care. It must be remembered that the proprietor of an amusement park owes no duty to protect patrons from the obvious risks that are necessarily incidental to the use of the device. <em>Clayton v. New Dreamland Roller Skating Rink, Inc., </em>14 <em>N. J. Super. </em>390, 395 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951); <em>Griffin v. De Geeter, </em>133 <em>N. J. L. </em>381, 383 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1945). By the use of language like \u201csudden lurch,\u201d \u201cdifferent than the turns or curves you go around,\u201d and \u201crather strong,\u201d plaintiff was not, in our judgment <em>communicating the fact of an aberration </em>from the normal operation of the coaster sufficient to invoke the rule of <em>res ipsa. </em>This verbiage is but a mixture of naked conclusion and subjective impression. Compare the observation of Chief Judge Cardozo in <em>Murphy v. Steeplechase Amusement Co., </em>350 <em>N. Y. </em>479, 166 <em>N. E. </em>173, 174 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1939) : \u201cHe cannot help himself to a verdict * * * by * * * the facile comment that it threw him with a jerk.\u201d <em>Cf. Jackson v. Dreamland Coaster Co., </em>4 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>934 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1936) (not involving <em>res ipsa, </em>wherein the testimony specifically described the aberrant conduct of the roller coaster). Plaintiff\u2019s experience with roller coasters, and with this one in particular, was apparently limited. There was no objective or other corroboration of her description of the extremity of the lurch, and, if evidence of the defendant is to be considered, three of defendant\u2019s witnesses, who were experienced riders, said they experienced no unusual movements. Judge Cardozo went on to say in the <em>Murphy v. Steeplechase Amusement Co. </em>case, <em>supra </em>(166 <em>N. E. </em>at <em>page </em>174) (the facts of the case are not directly analogous) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-4\">\u201cOne who steps upon a moving belt and finds his heels above his head is in no position to discriminate with nicety between the successive stages of the shock, between the jerk which is a cause and the jerk, accompanying the fall, as an instantaneous effect. * * * If the movement was spasmodic, it was an unexplained and, it seems, an inexplicable departure from the normal workings of the mechanism. <em>An aberration so extraordinary, </em>if it is to lay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the basis for a verdict, should rest on something firmer than a mere descriptive epithet, a summary of the sensations of a tense and crowded moment.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">And see <em>2 Harper &amp; James, Law of Torts </em>(1956), \u00a7 19.2, <em>pp. </em>1065-6, and the cases cited at <em>p. </em>1065, <em>f.n. </em>9.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">As to the trial judge\u2019s partial reliance on McKee\u2019s testimony for concluding that <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>applied here, we have already stated our conclusion that his opinion that a rider could not fall out if she did not stand up is not in accord with common experience as to probability. Indeed it is belied by the central fact of this case. It does not strike us as warranting reliance for purposes of deciding that <em>res ipsa </em>applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">We cannot, of course, know whether, in finding for the plaintiff, the jury was relying on the evidence of specific negligence as to the loose bar or the circumstantial evidence of negligence constituted by the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>both theories being allowed by the court\u2019s charge. As it may well have been the latter, we are constrained to find the error in submission of that theory to the jury to have been prejudicial and to require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Defendant has offered certain additional objections to the charge of the court to the jury. In view of the conclusions already arrived at, these need no extended discussion. At one point the charge stated that defendant must exercise a \u201chigh degree of care.\u201d This is not the law of this State. However, no objection was taken to this portion of the charge, and we find no \u201cplain error,\u201d as the court later defined \u201chigh degree of care\u201d as \u201cthat degree of care which the circumstances justify and warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">Error was also urged as to an instruction that defendant has the burden of proving contributory negligence without first stating that this burden does not arise until plaintiff first proves negligence on defendant\u2019s part. But this was corrected by the court after objection by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The other objections to the instructions have been necessarily passed upon in the discussion of the loose bar and of the rule of <em>res ipsa loquitur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
