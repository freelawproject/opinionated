The Board of Veterans Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) denied her request, and the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d) affirmed the Board\u2019s denial. Because the Veterans Court did not err in finding that Ms. Echevarria-North failed to demonstrate entitlement to an earlier effective date, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-15\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b476-16\">Ms. Echevarria-North served in the United States Air Force from 1971 until 1979. On February 7, 2005, a VA regional office (\u201cRO\u201d) received a cover letter and copies of a VA Form 21-4138 completed by a representative of the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (the \u201cNew Jersey DMVA\u201d) on behalf of Ms. Echevarria-North. The handwriting on the form read: \u201cI am inquiring as to the status of a veteran\u2019s compensation claim that was filed with your office on 11/17/1999, for Upper Respiratory Infection Residual of Viral Syndrome Chronic/Bronchitis/Asthma.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Appendix (\u201cRA\u201d) 16. The statement also said that \u201c[t]his claim was stamped in at the Newark liaison [sic] office on 11/16/199[9]. Numerous inquiries inquiries [sic] have been made to your office via the Newark Liasion [sic] office to no avail (see attached cover letter).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The form is dated January 24, 2005, and it bears a signature that appears to read Edna H. Jones, \u201cVeterans Services Officer,\u201d followed by a stamp with the address of the New Jersey DMVA. <em>Id. </em>The signature is directly below a printed line stating that \u201cI CERTIFY THAT the statements on this form are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-17\">In 2006, the RO granted Ms. Echevarria-North service-connected benefits for bronchial asthma at a disability rate of 30%, effective February 7, 2005. Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>Echevarria-North appealed the RO\u2019s decision asserting that her effective date should be November 17, 1999, which is the date she contends she first filed her claim. In support of her assertion, Ms. Echevarria-North submitted a letter, dated November 17, 1999, from the New Jersey DMVA addressed to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Newark, New Jersey. The letter indicates that certain VA forms are enclosed and includes the following text in bold and underlined: \u201cNEW VETERAN\u2019S COMPENSATION CLAIM FOR UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTION RESIDUAL OF VIRAL SYNDROME/CHRONIC B RON CHITIS/ASTHMA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Below the date of the letter is a date stamp of \u201cNOV 19 1999.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The letter is signed by \u201cEdna H. Jones, Veterans Service Officer, Hudson County District.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The Board denied Ms. EchevarriaNorth\u2019s request for an earlier effective date, finding that \u201cthere is no evidence showing VA received a claim, formal or informal, for service connection for bronchial asthma prior to February 7, 2005,\u201d including no evidence that it received the November 17, 1999 New Jersey DMVA letter. RA 15. Although the letter had a date stamp of \u201cNOV 19 1999,\u201d the Board compared the date stamp on that letter to the date stamp used by the RO in Newark and concluded that the stamp on the letter was not an RO date stamp.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the stamp was not evidence that the RO received the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Ms. Echevarria-North appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Veterans Court, arguing, among others, that the Board: (1) failed to apply the presumption of regularity to the New Jersey DMVA, contending that there is a presumption that the New Jersey DMVA mailed the November 17, 1999 letter as part of its regular course of business; and (2) lacked a plausible basis for determining that certain informal communications did not constitute informal claims. As to the first argument, the Veterans Court found that, even if the presumption of regularity applied to the New Jersey DMVA, it would not affect the Board\u2019s conclusion that the RO never <em>received </em>the letter. The court described the issue as whether the presumption of receipt under the common law mailbox rule can be invoked in this case. It concluded that the presumption of receipt could not be invoked, \u201c[g]iven the Board\u2019s thorough discussion of the evidence, the parties\u2019 arguments, and review of the record before the Court.\u201d <em>Echevarria-North v. Shinseki, </em>No. 08-3172, 2011 WL 195531 *2 (Vet.App. Jan.21, 2011) (hereinafter, the <em>\u201cVeterans Court Decision </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">The Veterans Court rejected Ms. Echevarria-North\u2019s second argument for the same reason: because there is no evidence that the RO received her informal communications, the presumption of regularity would not affect the outcome of this ease. In addition, the Veterans Court noted that the presumption of regularity applies to the RO, and in this case there is a presumption that the RO, acting in the regular course of business and following regular processes, would have placed the communications at issue in a claims file if it actually received them. Ms. Echevarria-North timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">Our review of Veterans Court decisions is limited by statute. Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a), we may review \u201cthe validity of a decision of the [Veterans] Court on a rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>of law or of any statute or regulation ... or any interpretation thereof (other than a determination as to a factual matter) that was relied on by the Court in making the decision.\u201d Unless the appeal presents a constitutional issue, we \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). We review legal determinations by the Veterans Court under a <em>de novo </em>standard. <em>See Arzio v. Shinseki, </em>602 F.3d 1343, 1345 (Fed.Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">On appeal, Ms. Echevarria-North raises three issues, arguing that: (1) the Veterans Court failed to give the New Jersey DMVA the presumption of regularity that the VA enjoys; (2) the numerous inquiries about her claim, combined with the presumption of regularity for the New Jersey DMVA, should have been sufficient to confer an earlier effective date; and (3) the Veterans Court applied the wrong law because a case it cited, <em>Fithian v. Shinseki, </em>24 Vet.App. 146 (2010), post-dates the Board decision. In response, the government argues that this court lacks jurisdiction because the appeal requires us to apply the law to the facts of this case. For the reasons stated below, although Ms. Echevarria-North presents some issues within our jurisdiction, we find that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">As a starting point, the governing statute provides that \u201cthe effective date of an award based on an original claim ... of compensation ... shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(a). For disability compensation for direct service connection, unless the claim is received within one year of the veteran\u2019s discharge, the effective date is the \u201cdate of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.400(b)(2)(i). The Board\u2019s determination of an effective date is a finding of fact that the Veterans Court reviews for clear error, and it is a factual determination that is unreviewable by this court. <em>Butler v. Shinseki, </em>603 F.3d 922, 926 (Fed.Cir.2010); <em>Evans v. West, </em>12 Vet.App. 396, 401 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Ms. Echevarria-North\u2019s arguments relating to her effective date, and the Veterans Court\u2019s decision, turn on two related evidentiary presumptions: the presumption of regularity and the presumption of receipt pursuant to the mailbox rule. \u201cThe presumption of regularity provides that, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, the court will presume that public officers have properly discharged their official duties.\u201d <em>Miley v. Principi, </em>366 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed.Cir.2004) (citing <em>Butler v. Principi, </em>244 F.3d 1337, 1339 (Fed.Cir.2001)). \u201cThe doctrine thus allows courts to presume that what appears regular is regular, the burden shifting to the attacker to show the contrary.\u201d <em>Butler, </em>244 F.3d at 1340 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">The presumption of receipt derives from the common law mailbox rule. Under the mailbox rule, \u201cif a letter properly directed is proved to have been either put into the post office or delivered to the postman, it is presumed, from the known course of business in the post office department, that it reached its destination at the regular time, and was received by the person to whom it was addressed.\u201d <em>Rios v. Nicholson, </em>490 F.3d 928, 930-31 (Fed.Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Rosenthal v. Walker, </em>111 U.S. 185, 193, 4 S.Ct. 382, 28 L.Ed. 395 (1884)). This rule creates a rebuttable presumption of fact that the letter was received. <em>Rios, </em>490 F.3d at 932-33 (citing <em>Rosenthal, </em>111 U.S. at 193, 4 S.Ct. 382). The mailbox rule itself derives from the presumption of regularity because it is premised on the notion that \u201c[p]ostal employees are presumed to discharge them duties in a proper man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>ner.\u201d <em>Charlson Realty Co. v. United States, </em>384 F.2d 434, 442 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">In this case, the Veterans Court explained that, as it relates to the VA, \u201cit is presumed that VA, acting in its regular course of business and following its regular processes, would have placed such correspondence [from Ms. Echevarria-North] in her claims file and acted on it in some way \u2014 if it had actually received it.\u201d <em>Veterans Court Decision, </em>at *3 (citing <em>Fithian v. Shinseki, </em>24 Vet.App. 146, 151 (2010)). Ms. Echevarria-North does not challenge the application of the presumption of regularity to the VA. Rather, she argues that the New Jersey DMVA, as a public agency, should be given the same presumption of regularity as it relates to mailing \u2014 i.e., a presumption that a dated letter bearing the New Jersey DMVA letterhead was actually sent, and that it was sent on the date indicated. In other words, she effectively argues for a rule of law that the presumption of regularity should serve automatically, and without more, to trigger the presumption of receipt by the VA when there is evidence of a dated letter from a public agency (here, the New Jersey DMVA letter). Because this argument involves an interpretation of a rule of law, we have jurisdiction to resolve this issue. We cannot agree, however, with Ms. Echevarria-North\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The presumption of regularity does not attach to every action taken by a public agency, only to those actions that, for example, are part of the agency\u2019s \u201cofficial duties\u201d or \u201cknown course of business,\u201d or that constitute \u201cministerial steps.\u201d <em>See Rios, </em>490 F.3d at 930-31 (referring to the \u201cknown course of business\u201d of the post office); <em>Miley, </em>366 F.3d at 1347 (referring to the presumption of regularity being used to establish that \u201ccertain ministerial steps were taken\u201d). The question of whether the New Jersey DMVA normally sends this type of correspondence as a matter of its regular business or as a ministerial action requires background evidence, such as whether a letter sent to a liaison office automatically is forwarded to the federal VA, whether this letter simply was a draft or whether it was final, the file in which this letter was found (e.g., a claims file that would contain all sent correspondence), and the like. <em>See, e.g., Miley, </em>366 F.3d at 1347 (presumption of regularity properly applied to support that the Board mailed a notice of decision, based on factual findings about the Board\u2019s administrative practice at the time and that the notice was designated to be mailed with other documents that were in fact mailed). Whether specific evidence of an agency\u2019s normal course of business is sufficient to trigger the presumption of regularity is a factual determination beyond our jurisdiction. We decide, however, that, unless it is clear or undisputed that a certain duty is within an agency\u2019s regular course of business or simply a ministerial action, the presumption of regularity requires at least some evidence of the agency\u2019s regular course of business to support its invocation. Accordingly, we do not adopt the rule of law that Ms. Echevarria-North urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">To the extent Ms. EchevarriaNorth argues that the evidence in her case otherwise is sufficient to invoke the presumption of receipt, she raises a question of fact, or an application of law to fact, that is beyond our jurisdiction. <em>See Savitz v. Peake, </em>519 F.3d 1312, 1316 (Fed.Cir.2008) (\u201cAlthough Mr. Savitz has requested that we make an independent determination that his evidence is sufficient to create a presumption of receipt under the mailbox rule, that is a factual determination that is</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>not within our jurisdiction to make.\u201d). The Veterans Court in this case expressly determined that the record did not support invocation of the presumption of receipt. <em>Veterans Court Decision, </em>at *2 (\u201cGiven the Board\u2019s thorough discussion of the evidence, the parties\u2019 arguments, and review of the record before the Court, the Court concludes that the presumption of receipt cannot be invoked in this case.\u201d). Although the Veterans Court\u2019s discussion perhaps could have been more thorough,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> its ultimate conclusion is not within our jurisdiction to review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Savitz, </em>519 F.3d at 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Finally, we reject Ms. EchevarriaNorth\u2019s assertion that the Veterans Court erred when it cited <em>Fithian v. Shinseki, </em>24 Vet.App. 146 (2010), a case that post-dates the Board\u2019s decision. We treat this assertion as an argument that the Veterans Court improperly applied a point of law retroactively, but we find that this argument is without merit. The <em>Fithian </em>case only discusses the well-established presumption of regularity and relies on cases that pre-date the Board\u2019s decision for the law it applies, such as <em>Marsh v. Nicholson, </em>19 Vet.App. 381, 385 (2005), and <em>Rios v. Mansfield, </em>21 Vet.App. 481, 482 (2007). Thus, the Veterans Court did not error when it cited that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">For the reasons stated above, the decision of the Veterans Court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"AKK\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\">. The Board believed that the date stamp was from the New Jersey DMVA liaison office indicating receipt of the letter from the New Jersey DMVA\u2019s Jersey City office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\">. For example, the court expressly could have considered that the same New Jersey DMVA representative appears to have signed both the 1999 letter and the 2005 statement certifying that the 1999 letter was filed, and that the New Jersey DMVA apparently submitted multiple status inquires.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b480-12\">. To the extent Ms. Echevarria-North contends that the \"numerous inquiries\u201d about her 1999 letter constitute an informal claim, that is a factual determination beyond our jurisdiction. <em>See Moody v. Principi, </em>360 F.3d 1306, 1310 (Fed.Cir.2004). In addition, we note that none of these inquiries appears in the record before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
