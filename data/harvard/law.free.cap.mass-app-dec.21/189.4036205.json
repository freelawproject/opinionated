The evidence does not warrant a finding for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">2. The evidence requires a finding for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">He found for the defendant <em>without making findings of facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">The report states that it contains all the evidence material to the questions reported. The plaintiff claims to be aggrieved by the allowance of said two requests for rulings. In allowing these requests the judge ruled that a finding for the defendant was required <em>as a matter of law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">As there was a collision the usual questions of due care on the part of the plaintiff and negligence of the defendant are raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>and ordinarily these are issues of fact for the jury, or a judge sitting without jury. <em>Hennessey v. Taylor, </em>189 Mass. 583; <em>Nash v. Heald, </em>306 Mass. 518, 520; <em>Brightman v. Blanchette, </em>307 Mass. 584, 586, 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In a case heard by a judge without a jury he acts in a dual capacity. He must not only lay down correct and applicable rules of law, but must perform the additional function of finding the facts. <em>John Hetherington &amp; Sons Ltd. v. William Firth Co., </em>210 Mass. 8, 18.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">\"The principle has been laid down by repeated decisions that a trial judge sitting without a jury must correctly instruct himself as to the governing rules of law and must pass upon pertinent requests for rulings of law presented him for this purpose in such a way as to make plain that he has not fallen into error.\u201d <em>Povey v. Colonial Beacon Oil Co., </em>294 Mass. 86, 93.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\"> Whether the defendant was negligent in parking its taxicab on a busy highway without lights as was done in this case, and whether the plaintiff was contributorily negligent were questions of fact to be decided by the Court upon consideration of all the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom. <em>Stickel v. Cassasa, </em>268 Mass. 59; <em>Rizzo v. Ahearn, </em>278 Mass. 5; <em>Kelsall v. N.Y., N.H. &amp; H.R.R., </em>196 Mass. 554. Since the trial judge made no findings of facts we cannot definitely state on what basis he allowed the defendant\u2019s requests. Did he find that the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>fendant was not' negligent or that the plaintiff was negligent and his negligence contributed to his damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\">First, was the defendant negligent? Being parked at night without lights the defendant was violating G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 85, \u00a715, and c. 90, \u00a77. <em>Com. v. Henry, </em>229 Mass. 19; <em>Jacobs v. Moniz, </em>288 Mass. 102, 104; <em>Ouellette v. Sherrin, </em>297 Mass. 536; <em>Price v. Pearson, </em>301 Mass. 260. The violation of these statutes was evidence of negligence. <em>Tevyan v. Hemingway Bros. Interstate Trucking Co., </em>284 Mass. 441; <em>Renaud v. N. E. Transportation Co., </em>286 Mass. 39; <em>Cutler v. Johansson, </em>306 Mass. 466; <em>Monroe v. Vassalotti, </em>1960 Adv. Sh. 655. But such violations in themselves were not necessarily negligence \u2014 <em>Wynn v. Sullivan, </em>294 Mass. 562, and cases cited, for it is not enough to show the violation of the statutes, the plaintiff has the further burden to prove that that condition was actually a proximate cause contributing to his damages. <em>Wall v. King, </em>280 Mass. 577; <em>Leveille v. Wright, </em>300 Mass. 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">In some .cases the court has ruled that such condition was sufficient to make out a jury question as to the negligence of the defendant. <em>Woolner v. Perry, </em>265 Mass. 74; <em>Price v. Pearson, </em>301 Mass. 260. On the other hand the taxicab might have been disabled just before the collision. The statute requiring lights on a motor vehicle after sunset does not require the impossible. There is nothing in the report to show how long it had stood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>in the roadway. The operator of the taxicab might not have had a reasonable length of time to arrange for lights or flames after the taxicab became disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Was the plaintiff contributerily negligent? The Staretz\u2019 automobile had stopped without colliding with the taxicab. If the plaintiff had stopped his automobile instead of trying to pass the Staretz automobile to the right and then to the left, there would have been no collision. There seems to be only one conclusion which we think the judge had in mind, that is, that the defendant could have avoided the collision if he had not been driving so fast or so close to the Staretz automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">While it might have been error on the part of the trial judge to find for the defendant <em>as a matter of law, </em>we think it was not prejudicial error as the evidence warranted a finding for him on the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In this case the court could have denied the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings stating either that he found that the defendant was not negligent, or that he found that the plaintiff was negligent and that his negligence contributed to his injury, or, better still, he could have treated the requests as waived in view of his finding for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">But since the evidence as reported was ample to support a finding for the defendant, we do not feel that a new trial is necessary in this case, and, therefore, the report is to be dismissed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Mayland P.
