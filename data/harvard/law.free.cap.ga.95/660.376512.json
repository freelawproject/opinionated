March term, 1894.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b676-10\">Suit was brought in a justice\u2019s court on a note attached to the summons, for $93.57 principal, with interest from maturity, and \u201call cost of collection, including ten per cent, attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Judgment was rendered for $93.57 principal, and $1.70 costs; and execution issued accordingly. It yras levied, and defendant interposed an affidavit of illegality on the ground that the judgment was void for want of jui'isdiction in the justice\u2019s court. This was overruled, and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b676-11\">James II.

The fact that after suit was brought for the principal debt and the attorney\u2019s fees as stipulated in the note, the claim for the latter was abandoned and judgment rendered only for the amount of the principal debt, with intei\u2019est thereon, without attorney\u2019s fees, would not cure the defect resulting from the infirmity in the original suit. The jurisdiction of the court being dependent upon the amount of principal <em>claimed </em>in th\u00e9 original suit, and not upon the sum for which plaintiff finally obtained a judgment, the recovery of a less sum as expressed in the judgment leaves that judgment nevertheless void. See <em>Almand </em>v. <em>Almand &amp; </em>George, 95 <em>Ga. </em>204; see also 73 <em>Ga. </em>240. <em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
