Direction is therefore given that if the plaintiff, during the term at which the <em>remittitur </em>from this court shall be entered, will make and file such a renunciation and amend the judgment already rendered in her favor accordingly, that judgment shall stand affirmed; otherwise, the judgment below is reversed.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b721-7\">March 25, 1895.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AJcR\">Brought forward from the last term.

The language in which the objection is expressed is not very apt; but its obvious meaning is, that the verdict includes both principal and interest in one gross sum, and that unless corrected, the judgment entered thereon would bear interest against the defendant upon both the pi\u2019incipal and interest of the balance of the original debt after deducting the credits. In point .of fact, the judgment entered in this case does allow interest on the entire amount recovered. It is true the judgment recites that the $82.55 is \u201cthe principal sum,\u201d but a calculation will show that this recital is manifestly incorrect, and that the sum recovered necessarily includes both principal and interest. Although the notes do stipulate for compound interest, and granting that this, is legal, as was intimated in <em>Hadden </em>v. <em>Larned, </em>87 <em>Ga. </em>642, it will be observed there was not, as seems to have been true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>in that case, any stipulation in the notes that the interest accrued up to judgment should bear interest, but simply that the interest should be compounded annually, beginning on the 6th day of January, 1892. Giving to the plaintiff the fullest benefit of the stipulations in the notes, there could he no right whatever to have the interest accrued up to any other day become principal and bear interest as such. Therefore, on the 23d day of January in any year, there would inevitably be at least a small amount of interest included in the total amount due upon the notes; and as the verdict in this case was rendered on the 23d day of January for the gross amountthen due on the notes, a part of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery was undoubtedly interest. As already stated, however, the only prejudicial result to the defendant would be charging him with interest on interest, as well as interest on the principal of the debt; and as this result can, at the plaintiff\u2019s option, be obviated, we have given direction that if, during the term at which the <em>remittitur </em>from this court shall be entered in the court below, she will make and file a renunciation of all future interest upon the judgment, and have the judgment itself amended accordingly, there shall be no new trial; otherwise, the judgment of the court below must be reversed. A somewhat similar state of affairs was presented in the case of <em>Buice </em>v. McCrary, 94 <em>Ga. </em>418, and the difficulty was removed by a direction substantially the same, in effect, as that now given.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with direction.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
