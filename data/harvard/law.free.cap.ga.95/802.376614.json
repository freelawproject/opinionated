We think the better view, and the one supported by the-weight of authoiv ity, is that such a stipulation does not impair the negotiable character of the paper. Our code defines a promissory note to be,\u201ca written promise made by one or more to pay to another, or order, .or bearer, at a specified time, a specific amount of money, or other articles of value.\u201d (\u00a72774.) It is defined by Story to be \u201c a written promise by one pei\u2019son to pay to another person therein named, or order, a fixed sum of money, at all events and at a specified time,-or at a time which must certainly arrive.\u201d (Story, Prom. Notes, p. 2.) The note in question conforms to all these requirements. It is certain as to the payee, as to the time of payment, and as to the amount. \u25a0 The stipulation as to costs and attorney\u2019s fees is not a part of the main engagement, but .relates to the Remedy in case of failure to comply with the contract, and is intended to compensate for the expense resulting from its breach. It does not become effective unless there is a failure to pay at the time specified; and it caunot then affect its negotiability, for negotiability in the full commercial sense ceases \u00e1t maturity. As has been well said by Mr. Daniel in his work on Negotiable Instruments (vol. 1, \u00a762a, 4,ed.), \u201c it seems paradoxical to hold that instruments evidently framed as bills and notes are not negotiable during their currency, becausg when they cease to be cnrreut they contain a stipulation to defray the expenses of collection.\u201d So far from tending to check the circulation of the paper, such a provision adds to its value and thus renders it more available for commercial purposes.

We think the fact that the plaintiff was represented in this action by an attorney was sufficient, without further evidence, to authorize the court to so instruct the jury.
