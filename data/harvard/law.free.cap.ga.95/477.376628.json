Where, in a trial for rape, the contention of the accused was that he had no connection whatever Avith the perpetration of the offense, it was error, in charging the jury with reference to the alleged crime, to use the following expressions: \u201cNow you will have reference and cognizance of the evidence in the case which connects the defendant with it.\u201d \u201c But if you do not believe that upon consideration of the\u2019whole evidence and weighing the whole of it, that the defendant\u2019s testimony outweighs that of the State, which places the man (the accused) there at the time, then you should not believe the <em>alibi.\u201d </em>The expressions contain intimations of opinion on the part of the presiding judge that the accused was connected with the perpetration of the crime and that he was present at the place where it was committed; and therefore, under section 3248 of the code, a new trial must be granted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b493-6\">.2.
