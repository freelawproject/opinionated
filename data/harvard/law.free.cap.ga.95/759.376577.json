No cotton inside of the compress building was injured or destroyed. At the time of the fire there was inside the building cotton of the value of $83,910.80, upon which there was \u201cspecific\u201d insurance to the amount of $83,500; and on the platform was cotton of the value of $38,231.03, upon which there was \u201cfloating\u201d insurance to the amount of $23,000. The insured brought an action against the insurance company, claiming an indebtedness under the policy of $197.95, and obtained a verdict accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">It will be observed that the total value of the property insured in part by this policy was $122,141.83, and the whole amount of insurance covering this property was $106,500. The company limited its liability by the two stipulations above quoted, neither of which is in the least degree doubtful or uncertain in its meaning. On the contrary, the terms of the contract are perfectly plain and unambiguous. It is a thoroughly well settled rule of law that in the interpretation and enforcement of contracts, the cardinal rule is to ascertain and carry out the intention of the parties; but it is also an equally well settled rule that this intention is to be arrived at from the language of the contract itself, and not otherwise, when the meaning of that language is absolutely clear and free from doubt. Consequently, in such case, parol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>evidence cannot be resorted to either for the purpose of ascertaining the actual intention of the parties, if different from that plainly expressed in the contract, or of varying or explaining the plain meaning of the contract itself. We deem it entirely unnecessary to fortify these propositions either by reasoning or the citation of authoi\u2019ity.</p>\n<p id=\"Als\">Applying the law as above stated to the facts of the present case, it will readily be seen that the company had the right to limit the amount it would have to pay on account of loss, by invoking the provisions of either of the two above quoted .stipulations; and naturally it would choose to adjust its liability under that one which would make its loss the less. How this would work will be at once perceived by stating two proportions under the old \u201crule of three\u201d as laid down in the arithmetic. Thus, under the first stipulation, the proportion would be: As <em>face of policy </em>($1,000) <em>is to the whole value-($122,141.83), so is proportion of loss </em>($62.62+) <em>to whole loss-</em>($7,649.07). And under the second stipulation it would be thus: As <em>face of policy </em>($1,000) <em>is to whole insurance </em>($106,500), <em>so is proportion of loss </em>($71.82+) <em>to whole loss-</em>($7,649.07+). Therefore, the loss falling upon the company under the first stipulation would be $62.62, and under the second stipulation, $71.82. The former being-the lesser amount, fixes'the exact measure of the company\u2019s liability according to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The court, over the defendant\u2019s objection, admitted evidence the tendency of which was to show an intention on the part of the parties to the contract differing from that above indicated, and which consequently, in its effect, really varied the terms of the policy. This,, for the reason already stated, was error. The exact-amount of the company\u2019s liability was as above shown,, and it was easily ascertainable from the terms of the policy itself in connection with the other facts herein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>stated. The verdict should have been for precisely that amount. <em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
