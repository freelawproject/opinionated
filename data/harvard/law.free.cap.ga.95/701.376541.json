The issue being whether a bill of sale from a mercantile firm to a creditor was executed and delivered upon a <em>bona fide </em>contract of absolute sale, or upon a secret agreement that this creditor, out of the proceeds of the property conveyed, was to pay a debt due another creditor of the firm ; and there being both parol and documentary evidence bearing directly upon this issue, there was no error in refusing to charge a written request which limited the jury, in determining the question involved, to a consideration of the bill of sale and the parol evidence explanatory of the same.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b717-7\"><em>2. </em>There was evidence sufficient to warrant the verdict.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b717-8\">March 25, 1895.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"A5d\">Brought forward from the last term.
