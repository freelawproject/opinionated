Moore argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b928-15\">Moore pleaded guilty in 2004 to conspiracy to possess and possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a), (b)(l)(A)(i) &amp; (iii), 846, and possession with intent to distribute a quantity of cocaine, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C). The presentence investigation report provided a base offense level of 36, United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2) (Nov.2004), increased it by two levels for possession of a firearm, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and reduced it by three levels for Moore\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. With a total offense level of 35 and a criminal history of V, the report listed a guideline range between 262 and 327 months of imprisonment. Moore\u2019s cocaine base offenses required a minimum sentence of ten years of imprisonment, while his cocaine offense had a statutory maximum sentence of twenty years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-16\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that Moore \u201cfac[ed] almost the next 20 years of [his] young life in a Federal penitentiary[,] ... [b]ut ... [was] also required to nevertheless take into account the factors in Title 18 of the United States Code, section 3553(a).\u201d The court considered evidence that Moore\u2019s mother was addicted to crack cocaine when Moore was born, granted Moore a downward variance, and sentenced him below the guidelines to three concurrent terms of 180 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>In 2008, Moore moved to reduce his sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Moore argued that he was entitled to a two level reduction of his base offense level, which provided a guideline range between 188 and 235 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (Supp. Nov. 1, 2007). Moore requested that the district court sentence him to 122 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The district court appointed a public defender to represent Moore, instructed the United States Probation Office to provide a supplemental presentence investigation report, and ordered the parties to respond to the supplemental report. The government responded that Amendment 706 applied to Moore and stated that the district court could vary downward from the amended guideline range, but argued that Moore should receive at least a sentence of 142 months of imprisonment. Moore argued for a maximum sentence of 135 months of imprisonment, based on his background and his conduct while in prison, and the disparity between sentencing ranges for crack and powder cocaine discussed in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">The district court granted Moore\u2019s motion and reduced his sentence to 135 months of imprisonment. The court determined that Moore was \u201celigible ... for a reduction in his base offense level pursuant to Amendments 706 and 711 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002) (citing <em>United States v. Pelaez, </em>196 F.3d 1203, 1205 (11th Cir.1999)). We review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">Moore challenges his reduced sentence on two grounds. First, Moore argues that the district court failed to consider the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), when the district court recalculated his sentence. Second, Moore argues that the district court failed to consider his post-sentencing conduct. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">Moore\u2019s argument about the effect of <em>Kimbrough </em>is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009). We explained that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), excised only those provisions applicable to an original sentencing hearing and did not address the separate provision that allows a district court to reduce a sentence based on retroactive amendments of the Guidelines, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). <em>Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1192-93. <em>Kimbrough, </em>which applied <em>Booker, </em>likewise did not affect requests to modify a sentence. <em>Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1193-94. The district court could not rely on <em>Kimbrough </em>to reduce Moore\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">The district court was not required to grant Moore a greater reduction of sentence. A district court may reduce a term of imprisonment when the guideline range is lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). After the district court recalculates the sentence under the amended guidelines, it must decide, in the light of the statutory sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), \u201cwhether, in its discretion, it will elect to impose the newly calcu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>lated sentence under the amended guidelines or retain the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(B). Any reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which preclude a \u201cfull resentencing of the defendant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(3); <em>see Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. Section 1B1.10 counsels against, but does not prohibit, the reduction of a non-guideline sentence: \u201cif the original term of imprisonment constituted a non-guideline sentence determined pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a further reduction generally would not be appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Moore\u2019s sentence is reasonable. The district court reviewed the supplemental presentence investigation report and Moore\u2019s response to the report, which detailed his post-sentencing conduct. After due consideration of those arguments, the district court reduced Moore\u2019s sentence to 135 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Moore\u2019s reduced sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
