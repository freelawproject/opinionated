In February 2008, at a time when he had no actions pending, Padilla filed a motion requesting production of the grand jury testimony from his criminal case. Padilla has not provided a valid jurisdictional basis for his motion. <em>See United States v. Carvajal, </em>989 F.2d 170, 170 (5th Cir.1993). Even if it is assumed that a jurisdictional basis for the motion exists, the district court properly denied that motion because Padilla failed to show a particularized need for the grand jury transcripts. <em>See United States v. Miramontez, </em>995 F.2d 56, 59-60 (5th Cir.1993). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
