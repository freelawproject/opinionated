Bell appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his renewed and supplemented motion for a new trial and his post-trial motion for discovery. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-17\">This is Bell\u2019s third motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. At Bell\u2019s trial, Dwight Mallary testified as a confidential informant for the government. Mallary testified that he purchased crack cocaine from Bell during two controlled buys on March 8, 2000 and April 27, 2000. The factual and legal basis for Bell\u2019s current motion is that the government suppressed material evidence that Mallary was a drug dealer and allowed Mallary to give perjured testimony by omitting his involvement in drug dealing. Bell attached a transcript of Mallary\u2019s testimony in a different trial in which Mallary admitted to being employed by a drug dealer at a car wash and conspiring to purchase cocaine from that drug dealer between March and July 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-18\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bell\u2019s latest Rule 33 motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The timing of the government\u2019s awareness of Mallary\u2019s drug dealing and the impact of such impeachment evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>on the jury\u2019s verdict were fully considered by the district court and this Court in relation to Bell\u2019s two prior motions for a new trial. In particular, this Court previously concluded that the government became aware of Mallary\u2019s drug dealing only after Bell\u2019s trial, <em>United States v. Bell, </em>54 Fed.Appx. 933 (11th Cir.2002), and that information about Mallary\u2019s drug dealing was merely cumulative impeachment evidence and would not have produced a different result at trial, <em>United States v. Bell, </em>144 Fed.Appx. 64 (11th Cir.2005). These prior holdings became the law of the case. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>429 F.3d 1032, 1035 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe law of the case doctrine bars relitigation of issues that were decided, either explicitly or by necessary implication, in an earlier appeal of the same case.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And, for the reasons stated in those prior opinions, Bell\u2019s proffer of Mallary\u2019s testimony about his drug dealing did not warrant a new trial. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that to warrant a new trial, a defendant must show, inter alia, that the new evidence was \u201cnot merely cumulative or impeaching,\u201d was \u201cmaterial to issues before the court\u201d and \u201cwould probably produce a different result\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion in denying Bell\u2019s motion for post-trial discovery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), Bell sought an order compelling the government to disclose all information relating to Mallary\u2019s history as an informant. Bell claimed that this information contained suppressed, material evidence of which the defense was unaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\"><em>Brady </em>applies after trial only \u201cwhen it is discovered that the prosecution had material information of which the defense was unaware.\u201d <em>United States v. Arias-Izquierdo, </em>449 F.3d 1168, 1189 (11th Cir.2006). Because <em>Brady </em>is not a discovery device, discovery should not be ordered \u201cbased upon mere speculation as to whether the material would contain exculpatory evidence....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">Here, Bell\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim was based on mere speculation. Furthermore, as discussed above, this Court previously has concluded that the government did not suppress evidence of Mallary\u2019s drug dealing or knowingly use perjured testimony at Bell\u2019s trial. Thus, even if the requested documents discredited Mallary, Bell\u2019s claim that they would establish a <em>Brady </em>violation is unsupported.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-11\">. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d 1154, 1163 (11th Cir.2002). We review application of the law of the case doctrine <em>de novo. United States v. Bobo, </em>419 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b890-5\">. At times, the parties have characterized the bar to relitigating these issues as \"res judica-ta.\u201d However, res judicata does not apply here because Bell seeks to modify a judgment in the same case. <em>See United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1560 n. 3 (11th Cir.1997). We conclude that the district court's ruling that the issues raised had \"already been fully considered and resolved against Bell,\u201d is more properly characterized as an application of the law-of-the-case doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b890-11\">. We review the denial of a defendant's post-trial motion for discovery for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Espinosa-Hernandez, </em>918 F.2d 911, 913 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b890-12\">. Bell's notices of appeal also designated the denial of his motions for reconsideration of the above-mentioned orders. However, because Bell's appellate brief did not address these rulings, Bell has waived any argument with respect to them. <em>See United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1242-43 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
