Luck-ie appeals the decision of the Administrative Review Board of the United States Department of Labor (\u201cARB\u201d) dismissing Luckie\u2019s whistleblower retaliation claim brought under the Surface Transportation Assistance Act (\u201cSTAA\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31101 et seq., against his former employer, United Parcel Service (\u201cUPS\u201d), interve-nor in this matter. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">Luckie was notified on 1 November 2001, that he had been selected for a lateral transfer to a larger district with greater responsibility. The transfer was unacceptable to Luckie because of child-custody issues. Luckie was notified that, if he would not agree to relocate, he had the option of accepting (i) a temporary demotion that involved no relocation and would allow him to remain on the promotion list; or (ii) a severance package. On 9 November 2001, Luckie rejected all options; UPS treated this rejection as a voluntary resignation and terminated his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">Luckie initiated this suit claiming UPS\u2019s insistence that he could not stay in his position as District Security Manager for Alabama and the Florida panhandle was in retaliation for complaints he had raised about UPS\u2019s handling of a fire incident on 30 October 2001. Luckie\u2019s claim is based on the STAA. Under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(a), an employee may not be discharged, disciplined, or otherwise discriminated against because the employee filed a complaint or began a proceeding related to a violation of a commercial motor vehicle safety regulation. An employee covered by the STAA who believes he has been discriminated against for engaging in activity protected under the whistleblower provisions of the STAA may file a complaint with the Department of Labor. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">OSHA, a Department of Labor agency, investigated Luckie\u2019s complaint; it concluded that Luckie was not an \u201cemployee\u201d under the STAA and, as such, the whistle-blower protections of the STAA had no application to Luckie. At Luckie\u2019s request, a de novo hearing was held before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(b)(2)(B). The ALJ issued a recommended decision and order concluding that Luckie was a covered employee under the STAA, that he engaged in protected conduct under the STAA, and that he suffered an adverse employment act in retaliation for that conduct. The ALJ awarded Luckie $123,200.00 in compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">UPS appealed to the Department of Labor\u2019s Administrative Review Board (\u201cARB\u201d). The ARB rejected the ALJ\u2019s recommendation; it reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision and dismissed Luckie\u2019s complaint. The ARB concluded that (i) Luckie was not a covered employee under the STAA; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>(ii) even if Luckie was a covered employee, he engaged in no protected activity under the STAA; and (iii) even if Luckie was a covered employee who had engaged in protected activity, he failed otherwise to establish his case by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The usual rules applicable to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act govern review of cases arising under the STAA. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(d). The legal conclusions of the ARB are due to be affirmed unless they are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2). The ARB\u2019s factual findings must be accepted unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole, <em>see id., </em>but the ARB is required to consider as conclusive the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact if those findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1978.109(c)(3). While we only are authorized to review the ARB\u2019s decision, <em>see </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 31105(d), that review must be mindful of the ARB\u2019s obligation vis \u00e1 vis the ALJ\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Luckie began his career with UPS in 1975 as a part-time package uploader while attending college and succeeded through a number of promotions to management-level assignments. At the time of his separation from UPS, Luckie was District Security Manager for territory that included Alabama and the Florida panhandle, a position he had held since 1994. As District Security Manager, Luckie\u2019s chief responsibilities related to resolving customer claims for lost, stolen, or damaged packages. In the course of his employment, Luckie sometimes handled damaged packages in performing security checks and in resolving damage claims. Luckie also was charged with conducting investigations into incidents of employee theft and violations of UPS\u2019s sexual harassment, honesty and integrity policies, as well as overseeing certain security measures at UPS facilities in his area. Luckie\u2019s position largely was administrative; he managed a staff of 20 to 25 employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">A person seeking to avail himself of the whistleblower protections of the STAA must be an \u201cemployee\u201d as defined in section 31101.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ determined that Luckie was an \u201cemployee\u201d because he was a \u201cfreight handler\u201d by virtue of his package handling; or because of his security responsibilities, Luckie was an individual who directly affects commercial safety, or both. The ARB concluded that substantial evidence failed to support the ALJ\u2019s critical findings and that the ALJ erred in his legal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">About the ALJ\u2019s characterization of Luckie as a \u201cfreight handler,\u201d the ARB concluded that the ALJ\u2019s factual findings about Luckie\u2019s package handling responsibilities misstated the record evidence: where the ALJ found Luckie\u2019s testimony on this point to be unrefuted, the ARB concluded the record revealed much evidence to the contrary. According to the ARB, as a department head, Luckie\u2019s occasional touching of packages \u2014 unrelated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>uploading, unloading, or the sorting of packages \u2014 failed as a matter of law to qualify Luckie as a freight handler under the STAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">About the ALJ\u2019s alternative reasoning that Luckie was \u201can individual who directly affected commercial safety,\u201d the ARB noted that the STAA requires more for coverage as an employee than that found by the ALJ: the individual must directly affect \u201ccommercial motor vehicle safety.\u201d The ALJ failed to consider whether Luck-ie\u2019s security responsibilities directly affected commercial motor vehicle safety. Reviewing the record, the ARB concluded <em>as a matter of law </em>that Luckie\u2019s job responsibilities \u2014 which affected worker safety in UPS facilities \u2014 did not directly affect safety on the highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">After review of the record, we conclude that the ARB committed no error: even accepting the factual findings of the ALJ, Luckie was not a covered employee under the STAA. The ARB\u2019s legal conclusion that these factual findings were insufficient to trigger the STAA\u2019s protections is supported by substantial evidence and is not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. <em>See Yellow Freight Systems, Inc. v. Reich, </em>8 F.3d 980, 984 (4th Cir.1993). In the light of the deference due the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the statute, the decision is due to be affirmed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-7\">. In relevant part, the STAA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-8\">(2) \"employee\u201d means a driver of a commercial motor vehicle ..., a mechanic, a freight handler, or an individual not an employer, who-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-9\">(A) directly affects commercial motor vehicle safety in the course of employment by a commercial motor carrier; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-13\">(B) is not an employee of the United States Government, a State, or a political subdivision of a State acting in the course of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31101(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b918-8\">. Because Luckie\u2019s claim is uncovered by the STAA, we have no occasion to consider (i) whether the activity he engaged in was protected; (ii) whether he suffered an adverse employmenl act; and (iii) whether a causal relationship was shown between the claimed protected activity and the claimed adverse act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
