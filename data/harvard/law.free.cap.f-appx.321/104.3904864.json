R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We agree with the decision of the District Court and will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>i</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In October 1987, Washam was convicted in the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas (DCCCP) of first-degree murder, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. He received no relief on direct appeal and, between 1991 and 2006, filed several petitions for post-conviction relief, both at the state and federal levels. All such petitions were denied or dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In August 2007, Washam filed a civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Washam\u2019s complaint alleges that his constitutional rights were violated by the \u201cmalfeasance\u201d of Louis Stesis, a Delaware County Assistant District Attorney; the \u201cnonfeasance\u201d of Deborah Gaston, the Director of the Office of Judicial Support for the DCCCP; and the \u201cmisfeasance\u201d of Karen Cuba, the Administrator of the Jury Commission for the DCCCP. In effect, Washam argues that the Defendants\u2019 acts amount to a <em>Batson </em>violation. Stesis, followed by Gaston and Cuba, filed motions to dismiss Washam\u2019s complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which the District Court granted. Washam filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">A federal court must dismiss the complaint or appeal of a plaintiff proceeding <em>in fornia pauperis </em>if the action is \u201cfrivolous.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). The United States Supreme Court clarified this standard in <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989), stating that a complaint is frivolous \u201cwhere it lacks an arguable basis either in law or fact.\u201d 490 U.S. at 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we exercise plenary review over the District Court order granting the Rule 12(b)(6) motions. <em>See McGovern v. Philadelphia, </em>554 F.3d 114, 115 (3d Cir.2009). \u201cWe accept all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in [Washam\u2019s] favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Washam is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>we construe his pleadings liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 521, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972). \u201cThe District Court\u2019s judgment is proper only if, accepting all factual allegations as true and construing the complaint in the light most favorable to [Wa-sham], we determine that [Washam] is not entitled to relief under any reasonable reading of the complaint.\u201d <em>McGovern, </em>554 F.3d at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">The District Court reasoned that Washam\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint is barred on three grounds. First, Washam\u2019s claim is barred by the statute of limitations. A two-year statute of limitations applies to \u00a7 1983 claims arising from conduct in Pennsylvania. <em>See Sameric Corp. of Delaware, Inc. v. Philadelphia, </em>142 F.3d 582, 599 (3d Cir.1998). A \u00a7 1983 \u201ccause of action accrues when the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury upon which [the] action is based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The District Court determined that because Washam seeks relief based on an alleged <em>Bals\u00f3n </em>violation at his 1987 murder trial, his complaint was filed long after the expiration of the limitations period. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">We also agree with the District Court\u2019s determination that Washam\u2019s claim is barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Under <em>Heck, </em>a plaintiff may not pursue a claim under \u00a7 1983 for actions that would directly or implicitly call into question the validity of his conviction unless he demonstrates that the \u201cconviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Because Washam\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint seeks relief for conduct that he alleges resulted in an improper conviction due to a <em>Batson </em>violation, and because that conviction still stands, dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Finally, the District Court reasoned that Washam\u2019s claim must be dismissed because all three defendants are entitled to immunity. Defendants Gaston and Cuba are entitled to judicial or quasi-judicial immunity, which applies to court staff acting in their official capacities. <em>See Marcedes v. Barrett, </em>453 F.2d 391, 391 (3d Cir.1971). Likewise, because prosecutors have absolute immunity from civil suits under \u00a7 1983 for their performance of typical prosecutorial functions and activities, Defendant Stesis is entitled to prosecutorial immunity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, </em>509 U.S. 259, 272-73, 113 S.Ct. 2606, 125 L.Ed.2d 209 (1993); <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). We agree with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Accordingly, Washam\u2019s complaint \u201clacks an arguable basis [ ] in law,\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989), and we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\">. Notably, Stesis was not even the prosecutor involved in Washam\u2019s murder trial. Rather, he represented the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in Washam\u2019s PCRA proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\">. Washam also seeks to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his \u201cmotion in opposition\u201d to the Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motions. The District Court correctly denied his motion as moot because the Rule 12(b)(6) motions were granted one month prior to Washam\u2019s opposition, and concluded that his motion could not be construed as a motion to reconsider under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) because it was untimely. As such, an appeal from that order would also be frivolous under <em>Neitzke.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
