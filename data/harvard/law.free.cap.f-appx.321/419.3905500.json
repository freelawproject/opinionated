Lopez-Castas\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that his sentence was unreasonable, largely because the district coui-t failed to consider his alcoholism as a mitigating factor and because his criminal history was not understated by the Sentencing Guidelines since it was considered in calculating his base offense level as well as his criminal history score.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-22\">The district court considered Lopez-Castas\u2019s history and characteristics, specifically noting his lengthy record of convictions (18 criminal history points, and three unscored convictions from the mid-1990s); numerous aliases, false birth dates, and social security numbers; and multiple pri- or removals. The district court found that the sentence was warranted \u201cto protect the public from further crimes.\u201d Although the district court imposed a sentence that was higher than the guidelines range after finding that the Guidelines did not adequately express Lopez-Castas\u2019s criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>history, \u201cthe district court thoroughly and adequately articulated several \u00a7 3553(a) factors that justified the variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 625, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Lopez-Castas has not shown that the sentence was substantively unreasonable and an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 805-08; <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-17\">. The district court accepted the PSR\u2019s unchallenged guideline range calculation of 33 to 41 months' confinement, noting also the PSR's observation that appellant\u2019s criminal history category might be considered to authorize an upward departure as not adequately reflecting the seriousness of appellant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood he would commit future crimes. The court, however, did not expressly impose a guideline \u00a7 4A1.3 \"departure\u201d <em>as such, </em>but rather expressly sentenced under the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court also expressly noted that appellant was \"a real menace to the American people and citizens when you're here by the use of drugs, alcohol and criminal conduct.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
