In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b843-10\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">This case is before us on petition for review and cross-application for enforcement of an order of the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d). The only issue pending in this petition is whether the NLRB reasonably determined that William A. Greene and Cynthia Greene (\u201cthe Greenes\u201d) failed to establish that the NLRB\u2019s associate chief administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) abused his discretion by denying their motion for continuance of an October 30, 2002, compliance hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">We review for abuse of discretion an administrative law judge\u2019s refusal to grant a hearing continuance. <em>NLRB v. Miami Coca-Cola Bottling Co., </em>360 F.2d 569, 576 (5th Cir.1966).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-17\">After reviewing the record, and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that there is no reversible error. Interestingly, in their petition, the Greenes do not contest any portion of the second supplemental decision and order in which the NLRB determined that they were personally liable for their company\u2019s back pay obligation. Moreover, the exact amounts of those obligations were previously enforced by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Carpenters &amp; Millwrights, Local Union 2471 v. NLRB, </em>481 F.3d 804 (D.C.Cir.2007). Hence, the NLRB requests that if we reject the Greenes\u2019 due process argument, then the NLRB is entitled to summary enforcement of its order in full. <em>See NLRB v. Dynatron/Bondo Corp., </em>176 F.3d 1310, 1313 n. 2 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-18\">On the merits of the Greenes\u2019 motion to continue, the NLRB found that the Greenes failed to establish that the ALJ abused his discretion by denying their motion. The Greenes\u2019 motion to continue only claimed that lead counsel had an unnamed scheduling conflict on the hearing day and that the Greenes had insufficient time to prepare a defense because the compliance specification was 26 pages long and covered back pay for 118 employees. The ALJ denied the motion, finding that the Greenes had not established good cause for delaying the case, which had been actively litigated since 1999. More specifically, the ALJ asserted that Greenes\u2019 counsel had given no particulars regarding his asserted calendar conflict, nor had he suggested what issues, if any, complicated his hearing preparation other than the length of the compliance specification. In a motion for reconsideration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>the Greenes did not cure their earlier deficiencies. Importantly, the Greenes did appear at the hearing, testified, and put on a defense, represented by another lawyer in the same law firm. Consequently, the NLRB found that the ALJ did not abuse his discretion and that the Greenes\u2019 due process rights were not violated. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Moreover, the Greenes have failed to assert \u2014 let alone establish \u2014 the requisite \u201cpositive showing of prejudice\u201d needed to support a finding that an ALJ abused his discretion. <em>See Daylight Grocery Co. v. NLRB, </em>678 F.2d 905, 910 (11th Cir.1982). Accordingly, we deny the Greenes\u2019 petition for review but grant the cross-application for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED, CROSS-APPLICATION FOR ENFORCEMENT GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
