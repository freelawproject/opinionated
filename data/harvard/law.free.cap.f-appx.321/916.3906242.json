Crawford guilty of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1). Because Crawford had previously been convicted of three felony drug offenses, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>was subject to the penalty prescribed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), and the court sentenced him to prison for a term of 235 months. He now appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Crawford challenges his conviction on three grounds, two of which merit discussion <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (1) the evidence was insufficient to prove that he \u201cpossessed\u201d the firearm for purposes of \u00a7 922(g), and (2) the district court erred by instructing the jury that one may constructively possess an object by exercising dominion or control over the vehicle in which the object is located. We consider them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the sufficiency of evidence to support a conviction. <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>318 F.3d 1030, 1036 (11th Cir.2003). We take \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the government, with all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in the government\u2019s favor,\u201d <em>Ortiz, </em>318 F.3d at 1036 (quotation omitted), and, doing so, we affirm the conviction if \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>187 F.3d 1269, 1270 (11th Cir.1999) (quotation omitted). Crawford argues that the evidence failed to show that he had the intention or power to exercise dominion or control over the firearm because police officers prevented him from placing his hand on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">To convict a defendant under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), the government must prove (1) the defendant was a convicted felon, (2) the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm or ammunition, and (3) the firearm or ammunition was part of interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Palma, </em>511 F.3d 1311, 1315 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 215, 172 L.Ed.2d 161 (2008). \u201cPossession can be shown by circumstantial as well as direct evidence ... [and] can be either actual or constructive\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>906 F.2d 1531, 1535 (11th Cir.1990) (citations omitted). \u201cA defendant has constructive possession if he exercises ownership, dominion, or control over the firearm. A defendant also has constructive possession if he has the power and intention to exercise dominion or control.\u201d <em>United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229, 1235 (11th Cir.2004) (citations omitted). Constructive possession exists when a defendant \u201chas knowledge of the thing possessed coupled with the ability to maintain control over it or reduce it to his physical possession even though he does not have actual personal dominion,\u201d or has \u201cownership, dominion, or control over the contraband itself or dominion or control over the premises or the vehicle in which the contraband was concealed.\u201d <em>United States v. Derose, </em>74 F.3d 1177, 1185 (11th Cir.1996) (quotation omitted). Mere presence near contraband, or awareness of its location, is insufficient to establish possession. <em>United States v. Gardiner, </em>955 F.2d 1492, 1495 (11th Cir.1992). A firearm \u201cneed not be on or near the defendant\u2019s person in order to amount to knowing possession.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir.2004). A defendant can have \u201cknowing possession of a firearm when driving a car with the weapon beneath the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>Crawford rammed the vehicle he was driving into a police car. After the police appx*oaehed his vehicle and while he was still in the driver\u2019s seat, the police observed a firearm on the floor in front of the adjacent passenger\u2019s seat. Crawford argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that he had the intention or power to exercise dominion or control over the firearm because the officers prevented him from placing his hand on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">We disagree. The evidence showed that Crawford had the ability and the intention to grab the firearm. Since he does not dispute the remaining elements of the \u00a7 922(g) offense, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to convict him knowing, constructive possession of the firearm. <em>Jury instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Crawford argues that the court\u2019s instruction that a person who \u201chas both the power and the intention to exercise dominion and control over an object or over a vehicle in which the object is located, ... is in constructive possession of it\u201d was misleading and inaccurate. Specifically, he contends that the instruction was not the Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction for the \u00a7 922(g) offense, and thus allowed the jury to convict him without proof that he knew the firearm was present in the car he was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Crawford did not object to the instruction; we therefore review it for plain error. For an error to be \u201cplain,\u201d it \u201cmust either have been clear under the law at the time the error was made, or clearly contrary to the law at the time of the appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Prieto, </em>232 F.3d 816, 823 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">A person has constructive possession over an object if he has knowledge of the object and \u201cownership, dominion, or control over the [object] itself or dominion or control over the premises or the vehicle in which the [object] was concealed.\u201d <em>De-rose, </em>74 F.3d at 1185. Mere presence near an object is insufficient to establish possession. <em>Gardiner, 955 F.2d </em>at 1495. The pattern jury instruction on the meaning of constructive \u201cpossession\u201d is, in relevant part, as follows: \u201cA person ... who has both the power and the intention to later take control over something ... is in constructive possession of it.\u201d Pattern Crim. Jury Instr. 11th Cir. SI 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">Although the court deviated from the pattern jury instruction, the instruction was a correct statement of the law. In sum, the instruction was not erroneous, much less plainly so.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">Crawford challenges his sentence as unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He says that it was greater than necessary and unjustified in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. In particular, he argues that (1) the statutory minimum sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment would have been adequate, (2) his sentence was disproportionately higher than sentences of more violent offenders and other armed career criminals, such as he, and (3) his status as an armed career criminal was based on predicate crimes that he committed when he was relatively young and immature.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">If the district court committed no significant procedural error at sentencing, we evaluate a sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, considering the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection,\u201d namely to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The record reflects that the court considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, particularly Crawford\u2019s history and characteristics, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the needs to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities, deter Crawford, and protect the public. In light of these factors and the range of reasonable sentences, it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to conclude that a prison term of 235 months, the low end of the Guidelines sentence range, was necessary to comply with the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. We therefore reject Crawford\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">For the foregoing reasons, Crawford\u2019s conviction and sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-9\">. Crawford moved the district court to dismiss the indictment on the ground that \u00a7 922(g) was unconstitutional, exceeding the limits of the Commerce Clause. He conceded that this challenge was foreclosed by Eleventh Circuit precedent. We reject the challenge for that reason. <em>See e.g., United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 388, 390 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that the statute was facially valid, and that, \"[b]ecause the government demonstrated that the firearm possessed by [the defendant] previously had traveled in interstate commerce, the statute is not unconstitutional as applied to him\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
