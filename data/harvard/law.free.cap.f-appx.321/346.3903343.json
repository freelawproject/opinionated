The district court denied Jones\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, concluding in relevant part that Jones\u2019s assertion that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to give Jones proper advice that would have enabled him to make an informed decision whether to have the trial court or the jury assess punishment was procedurally defaulted. Jones contends that this claim, raised for the first time in a supplement to Jones\u2019s first state postconviction application, was not procedurally defaulted. Because the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals \u201cdenied\u201d Jones\u2019s first postconviction application, it did not explicitly rely on a state procedural rule to adjudicate Jones\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. <em>See Miller v. Johnson, </em>200 F.3d 274, 281 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Glover v. Cain, </em>128 F.3d 900, 902 (5th Cir.1997). Moreover, there is no evidence that Texas courts consistently hold that supplements to a pending first postconviction application are successive, and no rule requires such a dismissal in a noncapital case. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>Martin v. Maxey, </em>98 F.3d 844, 847 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The respondents contend for the first time on appeal that Jones\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition is untimely because Jones failed to notify the district court that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had ruled on his second state postconviction application before the district court awarded a stay in the federal proceedings so that Jones could exhaust his state remedies through that second application. The respondents alternatively assert that the one-year period continued to run when Jones failed to notify the district court of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s ruling within thirty days. Because the respondent has raised these claims for the first time on appeal and Jones did not have notice or an opportunity to respond to this assertion, we decline to exercise any jurisdiction to consider the claim at this time. <em>See Fisher v. Texas, </em>169 F.3d 295, 300-02 (5th Cir.1999). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings in light of this ruling.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-13\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
