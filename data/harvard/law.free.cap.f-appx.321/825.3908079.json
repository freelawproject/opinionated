This ruling was made during a jury trial involving losses resulting from the destruction of a residence by fire. The jury returned verdicts in favor of State Farm by virtue of its findings that Hall and her husband deliberately burned or procured the burning of their home, Hall had made fraudulent misrepresentations on her claims and that State Farm was entitled to recover some $102,449 it had paid to a mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>There is simply no merit in any of the contentions being made in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
