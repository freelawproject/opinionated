In short, Crosswhite alleges that LIC improperly influenced Ren-tech, its insured, to place Crosswhite on unpaid leave \u2014 a move that ultimately led to his resignation \u2014 because of his confidential position with Rentech and close relation to two individuals (his wife and stepson) who were suing Rentech in a separate case at the time. The district court granted summary judgment to LIC based largely on Crosswhite\u2019s inability to offer evidence to support his claim. Crosswhite concedes a lack of evidence, but blames it on the district court\u2019s refusal to require LIC to produce its claims file on the action involving Crosswhite\u2019s relatives. Given that Crosswhite\u2019s only challenge on appeal is to this discovery order \u2014 as opposed to the existence of any other evidence in his favor \u2014 and that such orders are reviewed with deference, we affirm the district court\u2019s discovery order and entry of judgment for LIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Rentech hired Crosswhite in 2001. During his employ, Crosswhite served as Ren-tech\u2019s vice president and chief financial officer. In August 2006, Rentech put Crosswhite on unpaid leave for an indefinite period. Rentech\u2019s stated reason was a conflict of interest because Crosswhite held a job with access to Renteeh\u2019s sensitive financial information while his stepson, Preston Teel, and his wife, Lesa Cross-white, were suing Rentech in a separate lawsuit. The relatives\u2019 action involved a serious work accident in 2005 involving Teel, who also worked for Rentech. It was first filed in February 2006, sought at least $10 million in relief, and was pending at all relevant times. In January 2007, Crosswhite and Rentech entered into an agreement that permanently terminated Crosswhite\u2019s employment and exchanged a lump sum severance payment for a release. The release did not include LIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">In April 2007, Crosswhite filed this action against LIC in state court. LIC promptly removed. In his complaint, Crosswhite alleges that LIC, which insured Rentech at various times, arranged to have Crosswhite put on unpaid leave in August 2006 to induce his wife and/or stepson to drop their action. Crosswhite claims that LIC\u2019s actions constituted tor-tious interference with his employment contract and that LIC was therefore responsible for his August 2006 leave and termination five months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">After a period of discovery, LIC filed a motion for summary judgment. LIC asserted that Crosswhite\u2019s claim fails because: 1) there was no evidence of willful or intentional interference, 2) LIC denied indemnity to Rentech on the relatives\u2019 action and withdrew defense coverage in that case months before Rentech put Cross-white on leave, and 3) there was no admissible evidence that LIC\u2019s conduct caused damage to Crosswhite given his negotiated severance agreement, or that Crosswhite was damaged in light of that agreement. In a two-page response to LIC\u2019s motion, Crosswhite offered no evidence, but simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>professed an inability to respond in light of the district court\u2019s refusal to compel production of LIC\u2019s claims file on his relatives\u2019 case. Crosswhite then argued that, due to a lack of access to the claims file, he \u201chas no choice but to allow the motion for summary judgment to go uncontested so [he] can appeal the court\u2019s order denying [his] motion to compel discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The district court granted LIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on July 28, 2008. The district court found that \u201c[b]y [Cross-white\u2019s] failing to come forward with even so much as an affidavit or citations to his own deposition in an effort to create a genuine issue of material fact, [LIC]\u2019s evidence and arguments go without rebuttal.\u201d As to the claims file in his wife and stepson\u2019s case, on May 20, 2008, the court denied Crosswhite\u2019s motion to compel and granted LIC\u2019s motion for a protective order covering that file and related information on a declaratory judgment action for insurance coverage of the relatives\u2019 case. The court\u2019s May 20, 2008 order did not detail its reasoning, only that it \u201ceonsider[ed] all relevant arguments and evidence.\u201d The district court did, however, make an exception for information not \u201cprotected by legal privileges\u201d \u201cto the extent it concerns ... Crosswhite\u2019s employment issues with [Rentech].\u201d In seeking protection of non-employment information from the collateral actions, LIC had argued that the materials were covered by the work-product doctrine or attorney-client privilege, and, in support, provided a detailed privilege log. As to good cause in support of the protective order, LIC cited the unfair advantage Crosswhite\u2019s relatives would gain and the prejudice LIC would suffer in the then-pending actions. For his part, Crosswhite argued that the information sought was \u201cnecessary\u201d for him to prepare his case because his \u201cclaims relate directly to conduct engaged in by [LIC] ... in connection with the defense\u201d of the relatives\u2019 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">On appeal, Crosswhite does not actually appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Rather, his sole point of error is that \u201c[t]he trial court erred in not requiring [LIC] to produce its claims file in the state court litigation involving Lesa Crosswhite and Preston Teel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">This court reviews grants of summary judgment <em>de novo. Ford Motor Co. v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>264 F.3d 493, 498 (5th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). This court \u201cmay affirm summary judgment on any legal ground raised below, even if it was not the basis for the district court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Performance Autoplex II Ltd. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>322 F.3d 847, 853 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Notwithstanding its <em>de novo </em>review of summary judgment on the whole, this court reviews discovery orders for abuse of discretion \u2014 a fact both parties concede. \u201cThe district court has broad discretion in discovery matters and its rulings will be reversed only on an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Scott v. Monsanto Co., </em>868 F.2d 786, 793 (5th Cir.1989). Because the only ground raised on appeal by Crosswhite concerns the district court\u2019s refusal to allow discovery of certain collateral case information, we review this appeal for abuse of discretion. <em>See Sanders v. Shell Oil Co., </em>678 F.2d 614, 618 (5th Cir.1982) (reviewing protective order under abuse of discretion standard). Crosswhite concedes judgment in the absence of the information at hand, while remand \u2014 and not reversal and entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>of judgment \u2014 would be necessary if we were to find the information discoverable, because it is not yet in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide, \u201c[ujnless otherwise limited by court order, ... [pjarties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense....\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 26(b)(1). Nevertheless, the Rules also provide that \u201c[ojrdinarily, a party may not discover documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or its representative (including the other party\u2019s attorney ... insurer, or agent).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26(b)(3)(A). A party may move to compel production of materials that are within the scope of discovery and have been requested but not received. Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a). Yet, a court may decline to compel, and, at its option or on motion, \u201cmay, for good cause, issue an order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden ..., including ... forbidding inquiry into certain matters, or limiting the scope of disclosure or discovery to certain matters.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(c)(1)(D); see <em>also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a)(5)(B). The grounds for a protective order can include privileged or work-product material, but can also include the improper sharing of confidential information between litigants in separate cases. <em>See Scott, </em>868 F.2d at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Based on our review of the privilege log, there appear to be three different sets of materials at issue. The first consists of documents dated from January 2001 to September 2004, which largely concern claims investigator \u201cevidence.\u201d The second set consists of documents dated from June 2005 to October 2005, which concern coverage of a \u201cclaim\u201d; the injury to Cross-white\u2019s stepson that gave rise to the collateral legal action occurred on June 3, 2005. The third set consists of documents dated February 2006 to November 2007, which concern the \u201ccase\u201d and its underlying claim; the relatives\u2019 action was first filed on February 6, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Turning to the first set of materi<em>als </em>\u2014 ie., from January 2001 to September 2004 \u2014 their nature is unclear. They do not seem to concern the relatives\u2019 action in any direct sense, particularly given that they pre-date Teel\u2019s injury. It appears unlikely that they would be considered part of the relatives\u2019 \u201cclaims file\u201d \u2014 ie., the target of the motion to compel and protective order \u2014 in any event. Nevertheless, because neither party briefed the question, either on appeal or in the district court, we decline to address the issue here. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a) (providing briefing requirements). The parties assume that the only materials at issue are those concerning the \u201cdefense of the [relatives\u2019] case,\u201d as Crosswhite puts it in his brief. Even if we were to independently review these materials, we cannot hold that the protective order, which covers \u201cthe insurance adjuster claim files\u201d but excludes information \u201cconcernfing] ... Crosswhite\u2019s employment issues with his former employer,\u201d constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Garrett, </em>571 F.2d 1323, 1326 (5th Cir.1978) (\u201c[E]rrors made with regard to the allowance of discovery do not require reversal unless they result in substantial prejudice to a party\u2019s case.\u201d). Crosswhite was still free to inquire, whether from the documents at issue or alternative discovery, into materials with legitimate connections to his claim of employment interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">As to the second and third sets of materials in the <em>log </em>\u2014 ie., from June 2005 to October 2005 and February 2006 to November 2007 \u2014 these are coverage and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>litigation materials, respectively. As to coverage, the work-product doctrine can cover insurers in their investigative roles, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3)(A), and given the nature of the case \u2014 coverage of the crushing of a child laborer\u2019s hands while cleaning a dangerous machine \u2014 expectation of litigation was reasonable. <em>See Dunn v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>927 F.2d 869, 875 (5th Cir.1991) (work-product doctrine applies if there was \u201ca solid basis to question [the plaintiffs] insurance claim\u201d). As to the litigation documents, a more clearly protected area of work product could scarcely be found given that, by them nature, these are materials \u201cprepared in anticipation of litigation.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3)(A). An open question, and one which occupies the bulk of the parties\u2019 briefs is whether such work-product protection extends to the present case. Yet, it is unnecessary to resolve this issue because we conclude, for the reasons stated above, that the district court\u2019s order does not constitute an abuse of discretion in any event. <em>See Sanders, </em>678 F.2d at 618 (\u201cA trial court enjoys wide discretion in determining the scope and effect of discovery ... [i]t is, in fact, unusual to find an abuse of discretion in discovery matters.\u201d); <em>see also Scott, </em>868 F.2d at 792 (\u201cEven when based on a conclusory statement of cause, discovery orders ... are rarely reversed for an abuse of discretion.\u201d). The protective order permits inquiry into the employment-related matters at issue in Crosswhite\u2019s complaint and excludes only privileged materials or those that are unrelated to his employment and would provide an undue advantage to related adversaries of LIC in an unrelated case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In sum, because of the prospect of undue advantage involved and the fact that relevant, non-privileged, employment-related materials were still fair game, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to compel and issuing the protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s discovery order and grant of summary judgment to LIC.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
