We granted Mitchell\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability (COA) for the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-9\">(1) whether the district court addressed only the issue of whether counsel was ineffective for advising Mitchell to plead guilty to the crime of illegal reentry, and failed to address the issue of whether counsel was ineffective for misadvising Mitchell regarding the length of the sentence he was facing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-10\">(2) whether in light of <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc), </em>the district court was required to address all of the claims raised Mitchell\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-11\">(3) if so, whether the district court\u2019s order should be vacated and remanded because it failed to address all of the claim\u2019s raised in Mitchell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">Mitchell argues that the district court failed to resolve one of two claims articulated in his \u00a7 2255 motion and contends that we must vacate and remand to the district court for consideration of the remaining claim. He specifically argues that the district failed to address whether Mitchell\u2019s trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for misadvising Mitchell regarding the length of the sentence he was facing. The government responds that Mitchell abandoned this argument based on the testimony he gave at the evidentia-ry hearing concerning the advice his trial counsel gave him regarding potential sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 2255 motion, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo. Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). The scope of review is limited to the issues specified in the COA. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">In <em>Clisby, </em>we exercised our supervisory powers over the district courts and instructed them \u201cto resolve all claims for relief raised in a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1988), regardless whether the habeas relief is granted or denied.\u201d 960 F.2d at 936. We defined a \u201cclaim for relief\u2019 as \u201cany allegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn allegation of one constitutional violation and an allegation of another constitutional violation constitute two distinct claims for relief, even if both allegations arise from the same alleged set of operative facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a district court fails to address all of the claims in a habeas petition, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-16\">The district court failed to address, in violation of <em>Clisby, </em>Mitchell\u2019s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for misadvis-ing him regarding the length of his potential sentence, and we disagree with the government that Mitchell abandoned this claim. He raised this claim in his memorandum in support of his \u00a7 2255 motion and answered questions about it at his evidentiary hearing, thereby not indicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>a clear intent to abandon this claim. <em>See Pollock v. Birmingham Trust Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>650 F.2d 807, 811 (5th Cir.1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand the remaining claim for consideration by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-17\">. The decisions of the former Fifth Circuit rendered before October 1, 1981 are binding on this circuit. <em>Bonner v.
