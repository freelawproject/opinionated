Because Mascorro-Chavarria had a prior conviction for aggravated robbery, his offense level was adjusted upwai\u2019d by 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The district court sentenced Mascorro-Chavarria to a 70-month term of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-24\">Mascorro-Chavarria argues that his sentence was greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Mascorro-Chavar-ria concedes that this court ordinarily applies a presumption of reasonableness to within-guideline sentences. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 388 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), he con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>tends that the presumption should not apply in this case because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564. Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine Guidelines, the Court simply ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the craek/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338-39. The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Mascorro-Chavarria\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Ccmvpos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338; <em>Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66. As Maseor-ro-Chavarria concedes, his argument that he deserved a lesser sentence based upon the disparity in fast track early disposition programs is foreclosed by <em>Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 563 n. 4. Because Mascorro-Chavarria has not shown that his sentence is unreasonable, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
