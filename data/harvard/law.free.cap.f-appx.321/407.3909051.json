He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-24\">We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28 (5th Cir.1994). The court \u201cmay not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except\u201d in certain circumstances. \u00a7 3582(c). The court is authorized to reduce a term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentencing range has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission\u2019s amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-25\">In general, Amendment 706 reduced the base offense levels set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to crack cocaine offenses. However, the base offense level for offenses involving 4.5 kilograms or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>more of crack cocaine is unchanged. Dun-kins was held accountable for more than 20 kilograms of crack cocaine. As a result of a prior retroactive amendment to the Guidelines, his base offense level was 38. Under the new amendments to \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(l), Dunkins\u2019s base offense level remains 38. Thus, his base offense level is unaffected by Amendment 706 to \u00a7 2Dl.l(e) and, concomitantly, the applicable guidelines range of imprisonment was not lowered as a result of the amendment. Because \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorizes a sentence reduction only when the sentencing range is lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Dunkins\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">To the extent that Dunkins argues that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in the light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we do not reach this argument because Dunkins is not eligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Dunkins\u2019s motion for further relief, seeking to correct his presentence report, is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-17\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
