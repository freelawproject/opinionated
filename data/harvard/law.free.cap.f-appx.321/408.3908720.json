Hartin argues that he is entitled to have his sentence reduced in light of Amendment 518 to the Sentencing Guidelines. He asserts that Amendment 518 is a \u201cclarifying\u201d amendment, and thus it can be applied retroactively despite its omission under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. He requests that this court remand his case to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant may have his sentence modified if he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based upon a sentencing range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission. The district court may grant a reduction if consistent with the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). This court reviews a district court\u2019s refusal to lower a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(e)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Amendment 518, which became effective November 1, 1995, was already in effect when Hartin was sentenced. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C., amendment 518; <em>Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 29. Additionally, the Sentencing Commission has stated in \u00a7 1B1.10 that unless an amendment is listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c), a reduction based on the amendment under \u00a7 3582(c) is not consistent with the policy statement of \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)). Amendment 518 is not listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c) <em>&amp; </em>comment. (n.l(A)) (May 2008). Further, we have held that, except on direct appeal, a clarifying amendment is not retroactively applied unless the amendment is listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hartin\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 28. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
