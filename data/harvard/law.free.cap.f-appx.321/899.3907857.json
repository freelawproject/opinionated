Grafton argues that the district court abused its discretion and violated his right to procedural due process by denying his motion without holding a hearing and without the benefit of an updated presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). Grafton also argues that the district court abused its discretion by not considering all of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and placing too much weight on his post-sentencing conduct when it found that even though Grafton was eligible for a sentence reduction, his sentence would not be reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">\u201cIn a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009) (internal quotations omitted). \u201cOnce it is established that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 applies, a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). However, where the issue presented involves a legal interpretation, review is <em>de novo. United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178 (11th Cir.2003). Furthermore, we consider questions of constitutional law <em>de novo. United States v. Brown, </em>364 F.3d 1266, 1268 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">II. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">Ordinaiily, a district court cannot modify a term of imprisonment once imposed. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), [however,] a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an aEeady incarcerated defendant when that defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Here, it is undisputed that Grafton was eligible for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-15\">Any sentencing reduction, however, must be consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements direct that a defendant is not entitled to a full resen-tencing during \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. The Commission\u2019s policy statement further provides that district courts are to determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the subsequently amended provision had been in effect at the time the defendant was originally sentenced. This is achieved by substituting the amended provision for the corresponding guideline provision that was applied when the defendant was sentenced, while leaving all other guideline application decisions unaffected. Thus, a district court may not reconsider any of its original sentencing determinations other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>than the provision subject to the amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-5\"><em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254 (11th Cir.2009) (citations, quotations, and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">When determining whether a reduction is warranted and to what extent to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence if a reduction is warranted, the district court should consider multiple factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1257 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B))). The court must consider the statutory factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and the public safety. The court may also consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">III.Lack of a Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43, which governs when the defendant must be present at criminal proceedings, states that \u201c[ujnless this rule ... provides otherwise, the defendant must be present at ... sentencing.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(a)(3). However, Rule 43 provides an exception for proceedings involving the reduction of a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">\u201cUnder the Due Process Clause, a defendant is guaranteed the right to be present at any stage of the criminal proceeding that is critical to its outcome if his presence would contribute to the fairness of the procedure.\u201d <em>United States v. Parrish, </em>427 F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). We have stated that \u201cother circuits have noted that the right to be present under the Due Process Clause is narrower than the right to be present under Rule 43.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">Because Grafton did not have an absolute right to a hearing before the district court decided his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and there was no factual dispute in the pleadings before the court, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion or violate Grafton\u2019s right to procedural due process by denying the motion without a hearing or the benefit of a new PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">IV. District Court\u2019s Explanation</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">\u201c[A] district court commits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability \u2014 -if any \u2014 of \u00e9ach of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">Here, we conclude from the record that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it relied on Grafton\u2019s post-sentencing conduct to deny his motion because it considered all of the relevant factors and adequately explained its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b927-16\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Grafton\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
