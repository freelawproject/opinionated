Amendment 709 modified the instructions for computing criminal history in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, and Galvez contends that the amendment should be applied to his case retroactively in order to recalculate his criminal history score. <em>Id. </em>We review the denial of a motion to reduce a sentence under section 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Mueller, </em>168 F.3d 186, 188 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Pursuant to section 3582(c)(2), a defendant may have his sentence modified if he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based upon a sentencing range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission. The district court may grant a reduction if it is \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In this case, the applicable policy statement is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Section 3582(c)(2) applies only to retroactive guidelines amendments, as set forth in the section 1B1.10. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.10(a), (c); <em>United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217-18 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">The Sentencing Commission has stated that, unless an amendment is listed in section lB1.10(e), it is not consistent with the policy statement in section 1B1.10 and may not be relied upon to reduce a sentence pursuant to section 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A); <em>see also Drath, </em>89 F.3d at 218. Amendment 709 is not listed in section lB1.10(c), therefore it has no retroactive effect and provides the district court with no authority to reduce Galvez\u2019s sentence. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Galvez\u2019s section 3582(c) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\">. Galvez has not appealed his referenced conviction or sentence and has not challenged either under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b432-14\">. As the district court correctly noted in denying Galvez's motion for reconsideration, because neither of Galvez\u2019s said offenses involved cocaine base or crack cocaine, Guidelines Amendment 706, effective November 1, 2007, cited by Galvez in his motion for reconsideration, is inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
