Believing that this range overrepresented her involvement in the fraud, the district court varied downward under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 and sentenced Estrem-era to only 15 months imprisonment. Still unsatisfied, she contends that the district court procedurally erred in attributing to her the entire amount of loss from the credit card fraud without first determining the scope of her involvement in the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-16\">Although we review the district court\u2019s loss calculation only for clear error, we review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court misapplied the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. McCrimmon, </em>362 F.3d 725, 728 (11th Cir.2004). The guidelines provide for an increase in the defendant\u2019s base offense level based on higher amounts of loss. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l). The amount of loss attributable to a defendant includes \u201call acts and omissions committed, aided, [and] abetted ... by the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-17\">In conspiracy cases, the loss caused by the defendant may also include \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal enterprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). When assessing \u201cthe loss amount attributable to a particular defendant convicted of a conspiracy offense,\u201d the district court must first determine \u201cthe scope of the criminal activity the defendant agreed to jointly undertake.\u201d <em>McCrimmon, </em>362 F.3d at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-18\">Estremera argues that the district court failed to make that necessary finding, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>without it erred in attributing to her the entire amount of the loss caused by the credit card fraud scheme. That argument fails. The sentencing guidelines state that \u201ca defendant may be accountable for particular conduct under more than one subsection.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 cmt. n. (b)(1). Even assuming that the district court erred in \u201cnot mak[ing] individualized findings regarding the scope of the defendant\u2019s criminal activity,\u201d we can still uphold the sentence if the record otherwise supports the loss attribution. <em>See United States v. Matthews, </em>168 F.3d 1234, 1247 (11th Cir.1999) (upholding defendants\u2019 sentences where the record supported the district court\u2019s determination of the drug quantities attributed to them). Here the record does just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">In addition to pleading guilty to the conspiracy charge, Estremera pleaded guilty to two counts of aiding and abetting credit card fraud. It is undisputed that the credit card fraud she aided and abetted caused a $155,000 loss. Because the sentencing guidelines state that loss may be attributed to a defendant based on acts that she aided and abetted, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(1)(A), the district court did not err in attributing to Estremera the entire $155,000 loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
