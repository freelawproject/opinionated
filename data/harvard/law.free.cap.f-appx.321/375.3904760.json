Myers is effectively challenging the district court\u2019s certification that he should not be granted IFP status because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">The evidence at summary judgment showed that Myers sought to challenge EISD\u2019s hiring decision for the 2005-2006 school year more than 300 days after he learned that he had not been hired for the position. That challenge was untimely. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 626(d)(1)(B), 633(b); <em>Vadie v. Miss. State Univ., </em>218 F.3d 365, 371 (5th Cir.2000). As for the hiring decision for the 2006-2007 school year, EISD presented summary judgment evidence that it did not hire Myers because the other candidate was more qualified, having more recent experience in both agriculture and pedagogy and more positive references. Myers\u2019s evidence of his own qualifications was insufficient to rebut that evidence. Moreover, other than his subjective opinion, Myers did not offer any evidence that EISD did not hire him because of his age or race. Thus, Myers did not satisfy his burden of showing that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether EISD intentionally discriminated against him based on his age or race. <em>See McCoy v. City of Shreveport, 492 F.3d </em>551, 556-57 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Ross v. Univ. of Tex. at San Antonio, </em>139 F.3d 521, 525-27 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-18\">Because there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and EISD was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the district court\u2019s determination that Myers\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith was correct. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-19\">Because Myers has failed to show that he has a nonfrivolous issue for appeal, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith. Myers\u2019s request to proceed IFP is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
