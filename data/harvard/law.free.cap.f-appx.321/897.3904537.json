George appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his <em>pro se </em>motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>to reduce his life sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8582(c)(2). The district court found that, given the quantity of crack cocaine for which George was responsible, Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines did not lower his guideline range, and, therefore, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) did not authorize a sentence reduction. On appeal, George argues that the district court had the authority under \u00a7 3582(c) to reduce his sentence, in light of a continuing crack/powder sentencing disparity and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines reduced base offense levels for certain crack cocaine offenses, as reflected in the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2008). Amendment 706, which is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c), was made retroactive by Amendment 713. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c) (2008). Before the amendment, base offense level 38 applied to drug offenses involving 1.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. <em>See, e.g., </em>U.S.S.G. <em>\u00a7 </em>2Dl.l(c)(l) (1995). As a result of the amendment, base offense level 38 now applies to an offense involving 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(l) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In such a case, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, after considering applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on retroactive reduction of sentences, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjvF\">In a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), [and] any such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1) (2008). However, a reduction in the term of imprisonment is not consistent with the Guidelines policy statement, and therefore not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), if \u201c[a]n amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that only retroactively applicable amendments \u201cthat have the effect of lowering the sentencing range upon which a sentence was based, may be considered for reduction of a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">A \u00a7 3582(c)(2)- motion to reduce sentence does not provide the basis for <em>de novo </em>resentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(3); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>addition, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not provide an independent basis for reducing a sentence pursuant to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>Id. </em>Section 3582(c)(2) does not \u201cgrant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">We recently decided <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1367-69 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Jones, </em>Amendment 706 did not lower the defendant\u2019s base offense level because he was responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 1368-69. We held that, despite <em>Booker, </em>a court cannot reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) unless the defendant had been sentenced based on a sentencing range that had later been lowered by the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 1369. In another recent decision, we rejected a defendant\u2019s argument that <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481, provided an independent basis for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 985-86 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">We conclude from the record here that the district court was not authorized to reduce George\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering his guidelines range. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough </em>does not affect this conclusion. Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not misinterpret its authority or abuse its discretion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, we affirm George\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
