He argues that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence that was greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-24\">Pina argues that this court should not afford the sentence a presumption of reasonableness because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not supported by empirical data and national experience upon which the Sentencing Commission typically promulgates guidelines. He cites <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), in support of this argument. However, <em>Kimbrough </em>said nothing of the applicability of the appellate presumption of reasonableness. The Sentencing Commission\u2019s reasons for the amendment to \u00a7 2L1.2 suggest that the 16-level increase for certain aggravated felonies was formulated in the manner described in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2463-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), which held that such presumptions were permissible. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 632. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by our decisions in <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008), and <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Pina has failed to overcome the presumption that his within-guidelines sentence was reasonable. <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338-39. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that tills opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
