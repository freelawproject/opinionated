After review, we DENY the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">Vukaj, a native and citizen of Albania, filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal in 2001 alleging persecution based on religion, nationality, political opinion, and membership in a particular social group. Administrative Record (\u201cAR\u201d) at 197-242. In June 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) personally served Vu-kaj with a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) charging him with removability under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182 (a)(6) (A) (i), as an alien entering the United States without having been admitted or paroled by an immigration officer. <em>Id. </em>at 243-44. The NTA contained information regarding: (1) the date, time, and place of the removal hearing; (2) the consequences of failing to appear at the hearing; and (3) Vukaj\u2019s duty to inform the court of any changes to his address or telephone number.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AL0\">Vukaj failed to appear at the November 2004 removal hearing, and the IJ ordered him removed <em>in absentia. Id. </em>at 193-94. Vukaj moved to reopen the proceedings based on exceptional circumstances, alleging that he had relocated to Michigan in September 2004 and had consulted with an individual representing himself to be a qualified immigration attorney about his case. <em>Id. </em>184-87. This individual, who unbeknownst to Vukaj was not authorized to practice law, advised Vukaj that he would file a motion to change venue on Vukaj\u2019s behalf and that the date, time, and place of the new hearing in Michigan would be sent to Vukaj. <em>Id. </em>at 185. In reliance on these representations, Vukaj waited to receive a new hearing date from the immigration court in Michigan. <em>Id. </em>Vukaj stated that he would have appeared at the 17 November 2004 removal hearing but for his having received erroneous ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>vice from his putative attorney. <em>Id. </em>He further alleged that he had not been advised, and was thus unaware, that he was required to notify the immigration court if his address changed during the pendency of his removal proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The IJ denied Vukaj\u2019s motion, stating only that \u201c[n]o exceptional circumstances ha[d] been set forth as to why [Vukaj] failed to appear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177-78. On appeal to the BIA, Vukaj argued that the misleading advice he received from the individual posing as an immigration attorney constituted exceptional circumstances, and, further, that because the individual was not actually an attorney, the procedural requirements set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (B.I.A.1988) for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel should not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 155-56, 166-67. The BIA remanded the case to the IJ \u201cfor inclusion of an appropriate decision\u201d after finding that the record was insufficient to permit meaningful review. <em>Id. </em>at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">On remand, Vukaj filed an affidavit with the IJ stating that in 2004 he paid an individual named \u201cDanny,\u201d who claimed to be an attorney, $5000 to represent him in his removal proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 72-73. \u201cDanny\u201d told Vukaj that he would file a motion to have Vukaj\u2019s case transferred to Detroit, Michigan and advised Vukaj that he did not have to appear before the immigration court in Florida. <em>Id. </em>at 73. The IJ declined to consider the affidavit and found that Vukaj, who made no allegation that he failed to appear due to serious illness, could not demonstrate exceptional circumstances based on the alleged ineffective assistance of a non-lawyer because he \u201cha[d] made no effort whatsoever to comply with the <em>hozada </em>requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32-33. Specifically, the IJ noted that (1) Vukaj\u2019s motion to reopen did not identify the name or address of the individual who allegedly deceived him; (2) there was no evidence that the alleged non-lawyer had been notified of the allegations against him and afforded an opportunity to respond; and (3) there was no evidence that a complaint was ever filed with the appropriate state disciplinary authority. <em>Id. </em>The IJ further found that because the NTA expressly instructed Vukaj to submit a change-of-address form if he moved during the course of the removal proceedings, there was no merit to Vukaj\u2019s claim that he had no notice of that requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 33. The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s findings and this petition followed. <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">Vukaj argues in his petition for review that the ineffective assistance he received from \u201cDanny\u201d constituted an exceptional circumstance sufficient to rescind the IJ\u2019s <em>in absentia </em>removal order. He further asserts that because \u201cDanny\u201d was not a lawyer, it was impossible to comply with <em>hozada\u2019s </em>procedural requirements for establishing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">When the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without issuing a separate opinion, as it did in this case, the IJ\u2019s decision becomes the final order subject to review. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(per </em>curiam). We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir.2008). Our review under this standard is limited to determining whether the IJ exercised his discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">Motions to reopen are generally disfavored, especially in removal proceedings. <em>See Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(per curiam). </em>Accordingly, an alien who seeks to reopen the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>proceedings following entry of an <em>in ab-sentia </em>removal order must show that his failure to appear was due to \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); <em>see Montano Cisneros, </em>514 F.3d at 1226.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ineffective assistance of counsel can qualify as an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d for purposes of rescinding an <em>in absentia </em>order under \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C) where the alien (1) establishes that his failure to appear was the result of counsel\u2019s deficient performance <em>and </em>(2) satisfies the procedural requirements set forth in <em>Lozada. See In re Grijalva-Barrera, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 472, 473-74 (B.I.A.1996); <em>Montano Cisneros, </em>514 F.3d at 1226-27. Under <em>Lozada, </em>in order to prevail on a motion to reopen based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must: (1) support his motion with an affidavit that includes a statement setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel and the representations counsel did or did not make to the alien in this regard; (2) show that his former counsel was informed of the allegations of ineffective assistance and allowed an opportunity to respond; and (3) indicate in the motion whether a complaint was filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding the representation, and if not, why not. 19 1. &amp; N. Dec. at 639.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have held that the BIA does not abuse its discretion by filtering ineffective-assistance claims through the <em>Lozada </em>requirements when considering a motion to reopen. <em>See Gbaya v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>342 F.3d 1219, 1223 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">Although we have not explicitly held that <em>Lozada </em>applies to claims of ineffective assistance rendered by non-attorneys, such a conclusion was at least implicit in our decision in <em>Montano </em>Cisneros,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In that case, petitioners who had hired a \u201ccon artist\u201d claiming to be an immigration attorney filed a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, arguing that them putative attorney had advised them that they did not need to attend the removal hearing before the IJ. <em>Montano Cisneros, </em>514 F.3d at 1225. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s finding that petitioners\u2019 election to follow the non-lawyer\u2019s advice did not amount to exceptional circumstances. <em>See id. </em>at 1225-26. On review, we observed that the case was factually \u201cvery similar\u201d to <em>Grijalvcu-Barrera, </em>in which the BIA had held that the respondent, whose lawyer had erroneously advised him that there had been a continuance and that he did not need to appear at the immigration court, had established that his failure to appear was a result of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d sufficient to reopen the <em>in absentia </em>removal proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1227; <em>see Grijalva-Barrera, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 473-74. We held that the BIA, whose decision was \u201cbereft of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>mention of <em>Grijalva-Barrera,\" </em>had abused its discretion in failing either to follow its own past precedent or to provide a reasoned basis for departing therefrom. <em>Montano Cisneros, </em>514 F.3d at 1227. In concluding that <em>Chijalva-B a\u00f1era </em>was controlling precedent that the BIA was not permitted to ignore in ruling on petitioner\u2019s motion, we drew no distinction between claims of ineffective assistance rendered by lawyers and claims of ineffective assistance rendered fraudulently by persons engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. <em>See Montano Cisneros, </em>514 F.3d at 1227 (noting that, \u201c[l]ike the applicant in <em>Gnjalva-Barrera, </em>Petitioners here have satisfied <em>[Lozada\u2019s </em>] procedural requirements and substantively allege their attorney told them not to attend the hearing\u201d). Insofar as <em>Montano Cisneros </em>thus suggests that there is no material difference between the two claims for purposes of establishing exceptional circumstances in a motion to reopen, we cannot say that the IJ\u2019s finding, that Vukaj was required to comply with <em>Lozada\u2019s </em>procedural requirements even though his putative attorney was not authorized to practice law, was arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Vukaj petitions us for review of the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen based upon exceptional circumstances. Although Vu-kaj\u2019s allegation of exceptional circumstances depended entirely on a claim of ineffective assistance rendered by his putative attorney, he made no attempt to satisfy the <em>Lozada </em>requirements for establishing such a claim. Accordingly, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-14\">.
