The proof showed that plaintiff had been employed by the defendant as a collector, and as security for the faithful performance of his duties had deposited the sum of $400. The plaintiff, having quit the defendant\u2019s employment, brought this suit, and prior to the time of the trial the defendant had paid plaintiff $350 of the deposit. An inquest was taken, and judgment was given for $50 and costs in favor of the plaintiff. The court refused to insert a clause in the judgment authorizing the arrest and imprisonment of the defendant, although the summons served was properly indorsed, and the plaintiff appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">The court below evidently concluded that, the amount of recovery being less than $100, no body execution could be issued. Municipal Court Act, \u00a7 56, subd. 3. This action falls under subdivision 2 of that section, and the judgment should have contained a clause authorizing the arrest and imprisonment of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">Judgment modified, by inserting therein the words, \u201cDefendant subject to arrest and imprisonment,\u201d and, as modified, affirmed, with costs to appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
