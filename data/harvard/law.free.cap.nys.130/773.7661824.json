At 75 sessions evidence was taken aggregating some 3,070 pages, some printed and some typewritten, or about 41 pages per session. In addition, one day, from 11 a. m. to 2 p. m., and another from 10:30 to 2 p. m., were devoted to viewing the property; one day, 10 to 2, and three other days, 11 a. m. to 3 p. m., to executive sessions. On three or four days when evidence was taken there was also an executive session, and another day was in part devoted to the preparation of the award and report. There were some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>34 adjournments by consent, 6 at the instance of the corporation counsel, 2 to permit consideration or decision of questions by the commissioners, 2 to await action of engineer, 2 by reason of absence of a commissioner, 3 by reason of commissioners\u2019 illness, 12 upon request of claimant\u2019s counsel, 3 or more for absence of counsel, 3 on account of cold room, 3 by reason of witness\u2019 illness or inability to testify, 3 or more because there was no work. The corporation counsel offered some objection to or disapproval of 4 adjournments; on 2 occasions the commissioners asked for afternoon sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The affidavit of the commissioner in every instance shows at what hour the commission met, but so often omits the hour of adjournment that the length of many of the sessions does not appear. But the average length indicated by the hours given in the history of 36 sessions is roundly 2 hours and 45 minutes, or less than one-half of a usual court day. I am not inclined to place the fault entirely upon the commissioners. They observed the system that has obtained in such proceedings. They were largely dependent upon the material furnished by the corporation counsel and the claimants, and those representing the interests of the city permitted the proceeding to drag through the days and years. What testimony they saw fit to provide for a session the commission took and then adjourned. On some days there was none, on some days a little, and on some a fair amount. While the average was about 40 pages, on March 22d, in some 4% hours, they took 114 pages of evidence; on April 11, in 4 hours, they received 97 pages; while on April 13, in 4 hours and 20 minutes, the record shows 145 pages. If there was anything to do, they did it. If not,'they adjourned. It is just to notice that, regardful of public criticism of commissions in general, they did, as early as December 3, 1909, express readiness to proceed daily and their \u201cdesire to sit every day until the whole thing is completed, and, if that can be done, I will be very much obliged to the corporation counsel, the representative of the city, and also the office of Mr. Flannery\u201d; and again on December 7th, the commissioners asked the counsel to \u201cbe ready four days a week and proceed as rapidly as possible.\u201d But the loitering continued, and on January 4th the commissioners expressed their disapproval of the short sessions. And still the proceeding went forward with much of its former somnolence.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The representative of the city, when not consenting to or asking or abetting adjournments, joined in the general indolent conduct of the proceedings, seldom objecting to abbreviated or unemployed sessions, or opposing so mildly that the motion of the city to remove the commissioners as late as April, 1910, suggests a suitor disappointed by the rulings quite as much as the tardiness of the commission. This attempt to eliminate officers, properly nonconformable to the city\u2019s apprehension of the law and participants in its desultory and dilatory disposition of the matters in hand, delayed the sessions to October 27. 1910. The necessity and result of the disciplinary action of the city may be noted. In 13 sessions 437 pages of evidence were taken, or an average of 34 pages per session, and the commissioners sat 18 hours and 10 minutes, or an average time of 1 hour and 24 minutes for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>session. This excludes some parts of these days given to executive meetings. After the sessions were renewed on October 27th, the corporation counsel consented to or requested at least 10 adjournments and objected to none. The opposition of the city to the payment of the sum granted may be dutiful, but an exhibition of readiness and rigorous prosecution of the proceeding might have made its present attitude unnecessary. But the commissioners had the power to organize their business and insist upon punctual attendance by the parties, prompt submission of the evidence under the penalty that follows default, and when they ask for compensation their complaisance or submission cannot be substituted for the action that the law demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Tor the 75 days, while they were engaged for an average time of less than 3 hours, they should be paid for a half day\u2019s work at the rate of $50 per day, or $1,875; for the 6 days devoted to views and executive session they should be paid $300; and for days when they took evidence and also held executive sessions, and for those necessary adjournments on account of sickness or other cause excusably preventing a full day\u2019s service, $300 more may be added, making the allowance for each commissioner for services $2,475, and.the order, as so modified, should be affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
