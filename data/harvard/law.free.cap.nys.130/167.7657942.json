It is true that it has been held repeatedly that section 1, subd. 19, of the Municipal Court act is limited by the provisions of the other sections named in respect of motions of the character provided for in such sections. There is, however, no provision limiting the general power awarded by section 1, subd. 19, to vacate a judgment entered on confession. The order appealed from, therefore, seems to have been fully authorized, and to have been granted on a sufficient affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-18\">The order, however, undertakes to set aside the confession itself, a proceeding not authorized by the Code (see, also, Pelgram v. Ehrenzweig, 58 Misc. Rep. 195, 109 N. Y. Supp. 55), and that provision must be stricken out, and the order, as so modified, affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
