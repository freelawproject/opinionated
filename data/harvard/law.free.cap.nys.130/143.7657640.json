Plaintiff claims that prior to the expiration of defendant\u2019s previous lease, namely, October 1, 1910, she renewed the same for a term of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-15\">It is not necessary to enter at length into the merits \u00f3f the controversy or the credibility of the respective witnesses, because it is apparent that the alleged renewal lease was void under the statute of frauds, because it attempted to create an estate or interest in real property for a term exceeding one year, and was not \u201csubscribed by the person creating the same, or by his lawful agent thereunto authorized by writing,\u201d as required by section 242 of the real property law. The objection was properly taken by answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-16\">As the action is brought upon a lease, it is unnecessary to consider whether the correspondence between the parties might be adequate to prove a_ contract to lease under section 259. But, were that question presented by the case, as it is sought to be by respondent\u2019s brief, I doubt whether the correspondence could be so interpreted. See Jewett v. Griesheimer, 100 App. Div. 210, 91 N. Y. Supp. 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-17\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
