Under the circumstances, the case of Hausman v. Herdtfelder, 81 App. Div. 46, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>80 N. Y. Supp. 1039, as pointed out in Hess v. Investors\u2019 &amp; Traders\u2019 Realty Co., <em>67 </em>Misc. Rep. 390, 123 N. Y. Supp. 243, has no application. The learned trial judge also took this view of the right of the broker to recover his commission, because he declined to dismiss the complaint as against the other defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The serious point at issue is raised by the exception to the dismissal of the complaint as against the defendant Michael Rosenthal on the ground that \u201cit appears from the plaintiff\u2019s own witness that Mrs. Rosenthal was the owner of the property, and that the doctor was acting as her agent in this transaction.\u201d Plaintiff, however, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">\u201cI had a conversation with Michael Rosenthal and Bessie Rosenthal as to who owned the property. He told me the two were the owners, but she is the owner of record. She was there. She said there is no difference, me or my husband. He does the work for me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Upon this statement, it cannot be said that plaintiff offered no evidence either of ownership by the defendant respondent or of authorization by him on his own account to sell the property. There was clearly sufficient evidence on this issue to go to the jury. r Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
