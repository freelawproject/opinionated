The action was brought on May <em>27, 1907, </em>to recover damages for personal injuries sustained through the alleged negligence of the defendant. On the bringing of the action, the plaintiff secured an order of arrest against the defendant, by virtue of which the defendant was arrested and held to bail in the sum-of $500. He was released on giving a surety company\u2019s bond, upon which he has been obliged to pay an annual premium of $10 a year ever since. The plaintiff gave a notice of trial for the April term of 1908, but apparently filed no note of issue to place his case upon the calendar. He did nothing further until October, 1909, when he noticed the case for trial. His client was absent from the state at that time, and the case was stricken ' from the calendar, in which condition it remained until the defendant made this motion in May, 1911. The plaintiff shows no reasonable cause whatever for his long delay. In view of the fact that he caused the defendant to be arrested and put to bail, the least he could have done would have been to bring his action promptly to trial at one of the numerous terms of this court in Westchester county in the meantime. While we are loath to interfere with the discretion of the Special Term in matters of this kind, we feel this case presents a situation in which the motion to dismiss should have- been granted. The order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to prosecute is granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-16\">WOODWARD, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
