After a trial the court gave judgment in favor of plaintiff for the sum of $57.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">It is evident from a reading of the record that the court omitted to give the defendant credit for the sum of $20, concededly paid to the plaintiff by the defendant. The plaintiff, as one item of her claim, sold to one Ansorge a bill of goods amounting to $233.48. Of these goods $117.30 in amount were returned. By the terms of the agreement between the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-16\">\u201cHalf the commissions shall be paid on receipt of. any order, and the other half on receipt of check from the customer to whom the goods were sold.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-17\">The commissions, therefore, to which plaintiff was entitled, should have been computed upon only $116.15 worth of goods, and the amount allowed plaintiff on this sale should have been but $5.80, instead of $11.25, allowed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-18\">Judgment modified, by reducing the same to the sum of $31.26 and appropriate costs in the court below, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
