Patrick J. Egan was the general contractor and William J. Durfey and Lucretia D. Ash were the owners of the premises, the remaining parties defendant being lienors subsequent to the plaintiff. It was stipulated that the amount due from the owners was $825, \u201cand that the said sum of eight hundred and twenty-five dollars is applicable to the payment of the mechanic\u2019s liens filed by the plaintiffs and defendants lienors above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>named which may be adjudged valid,\u201d etc. It was also \u201cconceded by all parties appearing on the trial of this action that the work, labor, and services for which a claim against the defendant Patrick J. Egan, and an alleged lien filed by them respectively against the property of the owners, the defendants Durfey and Ash, was done and performed to the satisfaction of the owners and contractor,\u201d so that it would appear from the stipulations that the question of the validity of the several liens was left open to the determination of the court as between the plaintiff and the several lienors. It was upon this theory that the court at Special Term acted, and this was the only question which was, by the stipulations, left open. The court has found that the lien filed by' the plaintiff was invalid, and has directed the apportionment among the several defendant lienors, the plaintiff appealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The ground of the decision of the court against the lien of the plaintiff is that the petition alleged, in the alternative, that \u201cthe labor performed and to be performed, and the materials furnished and to be furnished, excavation for cellars and the furnishing of sand and gravel used in the erection of certain stores * * * Elatbush avenue, Brooklyn, and the agreed price and value thereof is fifteen hundred and eighty-six 5%oo dollars,\u201d and that this failed to comply with the requirements of the law, as laid down in Finn v. Smith, 186 N. Y. 465, 79 N. E. 714. There can be no serious question that, if this was all that the notice contained, it would be fatally defective. Felgenhauer v. Haas, 123 App. Div. 75, 77, 108 N. Y. Supp. 476. The notice, however, contained these additional averments: That \u201cthe amount unpaid to the lienor for such labor and materials is four hundred and fifty-six D%oo dollars,\u201d and that the \u201ctime when the first and last items of work were performed and materials furnished, is work began Oct. 29, 1908, ended March 31st, 1909.\u201d There is not, as in Felgenhauer v. Haas, supra, any allegation that the work and materials was \u201cactually used and employed in the erection of buildings,\u201d etc. The most that can be spelled out of the averments of the complaint is that the \u201clabor performed and to be performed, and the materials furnished and to be furnished,\u201d is of the \u201cagreed price and value\u201d of $1,586.56, and that the \u201camount unpaid to the lienor for such labor and materials is\u201d $456.56. There is not in the averment that \u201cthe time when the first and last items of work were performed and materials furnished is work began October 29, 1908, ended March -31, 1909,\u201d any statement of the material fact that all of the work had been performed and all of the materials furnished, which went to make up the agreed value of $1,586.56. This, we apprehend, is the real requirement of the statute; that it shall state the fact to be that so much of labor has been performed, or so much of material has been furnished for the work in question; and that a certain amount remains unpaid, and while the statute is to be liberally construed, where there is a failure to set out these facts in plain language, or by fair and necessary inference, the notice of lien is fatally defective, and gives rise to no cause of action to foreclose the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is probably true that a statement that work and materials to a given amount had been performed and supplied would answer the requirements without a separation of the items, but we find no authority which holds that, where there is a failure to show that the materials and labor have been supplied, a lien attaches. The statute contemplates that work and materials may be furnished subsequent to the filing of the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is proper, therefore, that the notice should contain the whole amount of the contract, the agreed price, the proportion which has been performed, the portion still to be performed, the amount which has been earned, the sum which has been paid on account, the amount due and unpaid when the notice was filed, and the amount which will be due when the contract is wholly completed. Hurley v. Tucker, 128 App. Div. 580, 585, 112 N. Y. Supp. 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> In the case now under consideration, the plaintiff states the full amount of his contract, states that \u201cwork began Oct. 29, 1908, ended March 31st, 1909,\u201d but he nowhere states that all of the work and materials have been furnished. He simply says that \u201cthe amount unpaid to the lienor for -such labor and materials is $456.56,\u201d but this refers to the \u201clabor performed and to be performed, and the materials furnished and to be furnished,\u201d and, so far as the notice shows, only an insignificant portion of the labor and materials may have been furnished. Indeed, there is no positive averment that any of the materials have been furnished, for he merely says that the \u201ctime when the first and last items of work were performed and materials furnished is work began October 29, 1908, ended March 31, 1909,\u201d without the slightest reference to the furnishing of any materials whatever, though it appears he was to furnish \u201csand and gravel used in the erection of certain stores,\u201d and it is not even alleged that such stores have been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> This is a statutory matter, and, while the statute is to be liberally construed, we believe that no case will be found where the averments of the petition have been permitted to be helped out by evidence upon the trial. Indeed, appellant concedes that this cannot be done, but he urges that the stipulation of the parties \u201cthat the work, labor, and services for which.a claim against the defendant Patrick J. Egan, and an alleged lien filed by them respectively against the property of the owners, the defendants Durfey and Ash, was done and performed to the satisfaction of the owners and contractors,\u201d operated to supply the failure to aver that the work had been completed. It is to be observed, however, that the stipulation makes no reference whatever to materials furnished. It merely has reference to the \u201cwork, labor and services,\u201d which \u201cwas done and performed to the satisfaction of the owners,\u201d etc., but this is far from showing that the plaintiff had furnished any materials, or that all of the labor and materials contemplated by his contract had been made use of by the defendant owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs, the costs to be paid by appellant personally, as the fund is not\" sufficient to fully pay all of the claims which rest upon valid liens. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
