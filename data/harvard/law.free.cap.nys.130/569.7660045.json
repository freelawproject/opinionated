The action was tried, and in October following a judgment rendered in favor of Greenbaum, as receiver, for the amount claimed. An appeal was taken to the Appellate Term, and while the same was pending rms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>action was commenced for the purpose of setting aside the agreement upon which the judgment in the City Court action had been obtained; the plaintiff alleging that such agreement was obtained by fraud practiced upon him, which entitled him to a rescission, the judgment demanded. The Appellate Term reversed the judgment of the City Court and ordered a new trial. Thereupon the plaintiff moved in this action to stay the receiver from prosecuting the action in the City Court. The motion was granted, and the appeal is from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> This court has several times said that the trial of an action cannot be stayed in this way. The power of the court to stay pro1 ceedings or control the trial of an action is one which must be exercised in the action itself (Raymore Realty Co. v. Pfotenhauer-Nesbit Co., 139 App. Div. 126, 123 N. Y. Supp. 875; North Central Realty Co. v. Blackman, 129 N. Y. Supp. 1005, decided at the May, 1911, term, not yet officially reported), and, where it is sought to enjoin parties from proceeding in another action, such relief must be by injunction in an action where such relief is demanded in the complaint (Belasco Co. v. Klaw, 98 App. Div. 74, 90 N. Y. Supp. 593; Webster v. Columbia National Life Ins. Co., 131 App. Div. 837, 116 N. Y. Supp. 404, affirmed 196 N. Y. 523, 89 N. E. 1114).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Under the authorities cited the court could not, by an order in this action, stay the trial of the City Court action. Nor could it enjoin the prosecution of that action by an order in this, because no such relief is demanded in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">It follows that the order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
