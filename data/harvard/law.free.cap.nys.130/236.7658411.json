The important issue, whether plaintiff acted as principal, or merely as agent of defendant, in the transaction, seems to have been decided in plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">The other crucial question was whether plaintiff performed his agreement, which he himself admits was to deliver the business to defendant, and that the lease of the stable from the owner of the building to the previous owner of the riding academy \u201cwas to be turned over as part of the sale.\u201d There was no proof by plaintiff that he had delivered a bill of sale of the assets to defendant, nor that he had procured from the previous owner of the academy an assignment of his interest in the lease, nor the consent of the landlord to such an assignment. Plaintiff testified repeatedly without objection that he had put defendant \u201cin possession.\u201d When defendant attempted to prove that the owner of the building would not consent to a transfer of the lease to defendant, and that plaintiff had so told defendant, objection to the testimony as immaterial and irrelevant was made by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and sustained over defendant\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">Although defendant\u2019s counsel failed to object to much testimony that was palpably incompetent, and failed to move to dismiss, either at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case or the whole case, and failed to except to part of the charge of the learned trial judge in which infirmities in plaintiff\u2019s case were ignored, the exceptions before noted seem to me to require a reversal. It was a vital part of plaintiff\u2019s case to prove performance of his contract in the terms in which he himself stated it to have been made. Regardless of the probative value of plaintiff\u2019s testimony concerning performance, defendant was entitled to disprove it, and the exclusion of the testimony offered to that end was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">GUY, J., concurs.
