On June 4, 1910, two days before the rendition of the judgment and a number of days before the issue of the execution under section 1391, the judgment debtor assigned to Nellie Levy, his wife, \u201call moneys due me which have accrued or may hereafter accrue by reason of my earnings, wages, or salary from the Chic Dress Company.\u201d Since June 1, 1910, $20 a week has been paid by defendant to judgment debtor\u2019s wife pursuant to such assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> \u201cAn assignment of wages to be earned in the future is, at most, an executory agreement to transfer them when earned. It creates no lien on them, except when and as they come into existence by being earned.\u201d In re Lineberry (D. C.) 183 Fed. 339, 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In Re Black, 138 App. Div. 562, 123 N. Y. Supp. 371, it was held that a judgment debtor, having legal title to wages or salary, may not disobey an order for his examination in supplementary proceedings, by transferring them to his wife by virtue of a prior assignment of all his future wages until all his debt to her should be paid. The court says (138 App. Div. 564, 123 N. Y. Supp. 373) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">\u201cAn assignment of something which has no present, actual, or even potential existence when the assignment is made does not operate to transfer the legal title to that thing when it does come into existence. Field v. Mayor, etc., 6 N. Y. 186 [57 Am. Dec. 435]; McCaffrey v. Woodin, 65 N. Y. 459 [22 Am. Rep. 644]. Such an instrument, if made in good faith for a valuable consideration, and not void as against public policy, operates as an executory contract to transfer such after-acquired property, and creates an equitable lien thereon. * * * But the legal title remains in the assignor. Hovey v. Elliott, 118 N. Y. 124, 136 [23 N. E. 475].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">See, also, Cooper v. Douglass, 44 Barb. 410, 416, 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Appellant\u2019s authorities from other states, whose homestead and other exemptions from execution and whose garnishee policy differs from our own public policy, partly depend upon the different public policy of those states, and partly upon the fact that under the laws of some states, if one of the debtor\u2019s creditors, as well as his employer, accepts an assignment of future wages in absolute payment of a debt, another creditor is not in a position to question it.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
