Upon the return of the summons oral pleadings were indorsed upon the record, and to the complaint the defendant interposed a demurrer, which was sustained, with leave to the plaintiff to plead over. The plaintiff thereupon filed a written verified complaint, and the defendant filed an unverified answer containing a general denial. Thereupon, against the objection of the defendant, the court gave a judgment in favor of the plaintiff upon his verified complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">This was error. The plaintiff should have been put to his proof. Unless a verified complaint is served with the summons, an unverified answer put the plaintiff to his proof.
