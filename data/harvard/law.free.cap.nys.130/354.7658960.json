The plaintiff was arrested and taken before a magistrate, and after examination was held to await the action of the grand jury. Aside from the damages suffered by the plaintiff, the principal question litigated was the existence of probable cause for the arrest of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> At the close of the charge, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked the learned trial court to instruct the jury \u201cthat the fact that the justice held the plaintiff to await the action of the grand jury is presumptive evidence of probable cause.\u201d This was refused and an exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">It is expressly held in Schultz v. Greenwood Cemetery, 190 N. Y. 276, 83 N. E. 41, that the holding of a plaintiff in an action for malicious prosecution, by a magistrate, after examination into the facts, to await the action of the grand jury, is prima facie evidence of probable cause for prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">The language of the request was that it was \u201cpresumptive evidence\u201d of probable cause. Strictly speaking, \u201cpresumptive\u201d evidence has a broader significance than \u201cprima facie\u201d evidence; but as ordinarily used the terms have practically the same meaning. The law gave to the defendant, notwithstanding the plaintiff was obliged to prove want of probable cause, such benefit upon that issue as might flow from the fact that a magistrate after examination had held the plaintiff to await the action of the grand jury. The request to charge being substantially correct in form, we think it was such error to refuse it as requires a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">The judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
