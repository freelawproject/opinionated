We think, however, that the trust attempted to be created in the sixth and seventh clauses of the will is valid. This trust does not direct any accumulation of income, but, because it makes any payment of income or from the corpus absolutely dependent upon the discretion of the trustees under defined conditions, it may be said that it sanctions an accumulation of income during a period which is not measured by a minority. To this extent the accumulation would be unlawful. . Under these circumstances, the accumulation, if any resulted, would go to those entitled to the next eventual estate, who in this cape, as the will is now construed, would be the next of kin of the testatrix. The trust in question can continue, however, certainly as to the corpus of the trust fund during the period defined by the will. In this_ respect the trust in question is quite similar to the class, well recognized as valid, known as \u201cspendthrift trusts.\u201d We think that Holland v. Alcock, 108 N. Y. 312, 16 N. E. 305, 2 Am. St. Rep. 420, cited by the learned surrogate, does not apply here, for in that case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>there were no definite beneficiaries of the attempted trust, while- here the contemplated beneficiaries are fully defined by the will as being the next of kin of the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court should be so modified as to declare valid the trust set forth in the sixth and seventh clauses of the will, and, as so modified, affirmed, with costs and disbursements of the appeal payable out of the estate to.all the parties who have filed briefs on this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
