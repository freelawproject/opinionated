They asked the driver for a ride. He stopped, and the plaintiff and her companions climbed into the seat. They then proceeded southerly upon the track until they were overtaken by a south-bound car. The motorman sounded his gong as a signal to the driver to get off the track and let the car go by. A truck going in the same direction on the westerly side of the track prevented the driver of the milk wagon from turning to the right. He therefore turned to the left, and was attempting to cross the north-bound track, into the roadway beyond, when the rear end of the wagon was struck by one of the defendant\u2019s cars coming from the south, and the plaintiff was thrown out and injured. It also appeared that for more than 400 feet north from the point of collision the tracks were practically straight, that the motorman had an unobstructed view of the track during the whole of this distance, and there was evidence from which it might be fairly inferred that he made no effort to stop the car or to avoid the accident. The plaintiff testified that the car was going very fast when it was 250 feet away, that \u201cit was going at the same rate of speed 10 feet away from me,\u201d and that it was not stopped until it had gone 10 or 12 feet beyond. I think that these facts were sufficient to justify a finding that the defendant\u2019s motorman was negligent in the management of his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">It follows that the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
