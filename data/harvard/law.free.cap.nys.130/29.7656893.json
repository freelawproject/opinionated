The case was submitted to the jury fully and fairly by the learned trial court, and we find no reversible error in the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-19\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> One incident of the trial requires comment. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence in rebuttal, counsel for the plaintiff put the trial counsel for the defendant upon the stand, and the following is a record of the proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-20\">\u201cQ. It is a fact, is it not, that in your opening address to the jury on behalf of the defendant you stated that you would introduce as a witness Mr. Richard Webber, and would show by him that the things which the plaintiff claimed with respect to his connection with Webber &amp; Co. were not so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-21\">\u201cCounsel for Defendant: We object to such a statement as irrelevant, incompetent, and immaterial. (Objection sustained; exception.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201cQi Then I will ask you: What did you state with respect to that: (Same objection, ruling, and exception.) Q. I will ask * * * if you caused a subpoena to be issued for Richard AVebber? (Same objection, ruling and exception.) Q. I will ask if Mr. Richard Webber was in this courtroom day before yesterday at 3 o\u2019clock, and if after the adjournment of the court you talked with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u201cCounsel for the Defendant: I make the same objection,, and I now ask to withdraw a juror, on, the ground that counsel has violated the rules of law and evidence in asking these questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">\u201cThe Court: The motion to withdraw a juror is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\u201cCounsel for Defendant: I except.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">\u201cThe Court: And the objection to the question is sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">That the conduct of the counsel for the plaintiff was unjustifiable is obvious; that the objections to the questions asked were properly sustained there can be no question; that the purpose of the counsel propounding them was to create a prejudice, which he hoped to be to his advantage, is clear. The ordinary plea of excessive zeal in the heat of a hotly contested trial is here unavailing, because in many pages of his brief on appeal the offending counsel undertakes to justify his conduct. There is no justification therefor. It was reprehensible, without a shadow of excuse, and we condemn it.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">In the face of repeated warnings by this court and the Court of Appeals, some trial counsel continue to imperil the interests of their clients by questions, statements, and conduct deliberately calculated and intended solely to excite unfair prejudice. In Cosselmon v. Dunfee, 172 N. Y. 507, 65 N. E. 494, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-11\">\u201cWhile the learned trial justice made a proper disposition of the matter, nevertheless the propounding of the question was calculated to convey an improper impression to the jury. * * * The practice of asking a question that counsel must be assumed to know cannot be answered is highly reprehensible, and, where the trial court or Appellate Division is satisfied that the verdict of the jury has been influenced thereby, it should, for that reason, set aside the verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">In Scott v. Barker, 129 App. Div. 241, 113 N. Y. Supp. 695, this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-14\">\u201cWe think counsel should learn that the verdict is not the only thing to obtain in a trial in a court of justice, but that it must be obtained in an orderly and proper manner, and that, if counsel transcend just and proper bounds, the result obtained by such methods cannot stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-15\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> But the case at bar took five days to try, and the trial justice denied the motion to withdraw a juror, and also denied the motion to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial. He must, therefore, in the exercise of his discretion, have determined that the verdict reached by the jury had not been influenced by the matter complained of. We are not prepared to say that he erred, and on this ground alone reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-16\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs and disbursements to the respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
