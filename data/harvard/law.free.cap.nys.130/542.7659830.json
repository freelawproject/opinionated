The action is for assault. The defendant was a resident of this county and could have been served therein; but, hearing that plaintiff proposed to commence an action, he voluntarily appeared. The plaintiff recovered judgment for less than $500. The case was one which could have been brought, except for the amount claimed, in the City Court of the city of New York, and the defendant\u2019s contention is that, since the recovery was less than $1,000, the plaintiff is entitled to recover no costs. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3228, subd. 5. The plaintiff, however, insists that the subdivision above referred to applies only when the defendant shall have been \u201cpersonally served with process,\u201d which was the language of the section of the Code when this action was begun in September, 1909. The language of the present section is \u201cserved with process.\u201d Laws 1910, c. 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">So far as concerns the present appeal, we do not consider that this change in phraseology is significant. The question is whether or not the subdivision of section 3228 applies to a case in which the defendant was present in the county and could have been personally served with process, but was not served because he voluntarily appeared. Section 424, Code Civ. Proc., provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-11\">\u201cA voluntary general appearance of the defendant is equivalent to personal service upon him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">We think that this section should be given its full significance in the present case. The purpose of the statute (subdivision 5, \u00a7 3228) was to relieve the congested calendars of the Supreme Court in New York county by compelling, so far as practicable, actions to be brought in the City Court of New York, if within its jurisdiction. In considering its language, the evil sought to be remedied must be kept in mind. Seymour v. Wheeler, 137 App. Div. 52, 122 N. Y. Supp. 183. It needs no citation of authority to sustain the familiar .rule that, where a case is brought within the intention of the framers of a statute, it is within the statute, although by a technical interpretation it is not within its letter. Clearly the present case falls within the intent of the subdivision referred to, and must be considered as governed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">Order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
