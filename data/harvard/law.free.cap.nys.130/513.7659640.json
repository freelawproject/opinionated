The plaintiff was guilty of gross loches, which is entirely unexplained and unexcused. For this reason the motion should have been denied. Gamble v. Lennon, 9 App. Div. 407, 41 N. Y. Supp. 277; Martin v. McCurdy, 120 App. Div. 665, 105 N. Y. Supp. 474. The respondent contents herself upon this appeal by advancing the untenable proposition that, as the order appealed from is a discretionary one, no appeal lies to this court. Counsel forgets that this court is a branch of the Supreme Court, and vested with the jurisdiction vested in the Supreme Court, and that in its appellate capacity it possesses, and not infrequently exercises, jurisdiction to review the discretion of the Special Term. This seems to us to be a case in which we ought to exercise that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
