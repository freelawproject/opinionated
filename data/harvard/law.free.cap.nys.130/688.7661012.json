The plaintiff, when bowling in a public bowling alley slipped and ran a splinter into his foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-20\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The obligation of the defendants was that of reasonable care and prudence lest their premises might injure the plaintiff when in \u00e1 reasonable contemplated use thereof. Larkin v. O\u2019Neill, 119 N. Y. 221, 23 N. E. 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-21\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The rule in question arises when the occurrence as proved points necessarily to negligence of some kind on the part of the defendant. Robinson v. Consolidated Gas Co., 194 N. Y. 37-41, 86 N. E. 805, 28 L. R. A. 586; Griffen v. Manice, 166 N. Y. 188, 59 N. E. 925, 52 L. R. A. 922, 82 Am. St. Rep. 630. The mere fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>the occurrence was in the premises of the defendants does not raise any presumption of wrongdoing.' Curran v. Warren Chemical &amp; Manufacturing Co., 36 N. Y. 153. The splinter was but a small slender bit of wood. There was no proof of its existence for any period prior to the occurrence, so that proper care could have removed it, or that it was of such probable origin that proper inspection could have discovered it. And there is no proof that the alley was defective in construction or condition so that such a splinter might be a natural result of some defect thereof. The plaintiff and his companions had used the alley on this very occasion for some time before the occurrence. I fail to see, then, that this mishap as proved points necessarily to any actionable neglect on the part of the defendant. Moreover, the plaintiff and his companions were in the immediate lawful possession and use of the premises when the accident happened. See Bevan on Negligence (3d Ed.) 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">I advise that the judgment be reversed, and that a new trial be ordered ; costs to abide the event.
