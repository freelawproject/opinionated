KELLOGG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AchB\">The action was tried and a motion upon the judge\u2019s minutes for a new trial was made and argued. A dispute arose as to the testimony of the witness Duprey. The court directed written briefs to be submitted and that counsel furnish that portion of the testimony of said witness which referred to the speed at which the crane was moving just prior to the time of the accident. Thereupon the plaintiff ordered the stenographer to furnish the testimony of Duprey; but the stenographer furnished the minutes of the entire trial. The testimony of Duprey was submitted to the court, and the plaintiff in his brief made numerous quotations from and references to the testimony of other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">The clerk included in the disbursements $55.29, the cost of the stenographer\u2019s minutes, and $10, the fee of a referee who was appointed at the instance of the plaintiff to take the evidence of his testator before action brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-14\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The Special Term refused to strike from the bill of costs these two items or to order a retaxation with reference thereto. As to the referee\u2019s fees, I think the order is right. It is unnecessary to consider whether technically these fees are fixed by section 3296 or are to be fixed by the court under subdivision 3 of section 3251 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The Special Term, after hearing, refused to strike them out and therefore passed tipon their reasonableness and, having found them reasonable, was not required to order a re-taxation with reference to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">We held at our last March term, in Federal Smelting Co. v. Security Steel &amp; Iron Co., 129 N. Y. Supp. 1121, that stenographer\u2019s fees obtained for use upon another trial were not taxable, following Hudson v. Erie R. R. Co., 57 App. Div. 98, 68 N. Y. Supp. 28, and Herrmann v. Herrmann, 88 App. Div. 76, 84 N. Y. Supp. 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-16\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In the case at bar, it was unnecessary to obtain the stenographer\u2019s minutes for use upon the hearing of the motion for a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>trial. The court had practically passed upon that subject by requiring only certain parts of Duprey\u2019s testimony to be furnished. If the minutes, other than the parts of Duprey\u2019s testimony required, were furnished by mistake, that is no reason why they should be taxed as a disbursement in the case, and the fact that the plaintiff referred to them in his brief does not change the situation. The $55.29 was, therefore, erroneously taxed by the clerk. The plaintiff, however, was authorized to tax as a disbursement the reasonable cost of the minutes of the testimony of D-uprey which was furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Pursuant to stipulation, the evidence of the witness Banks was read upon the second trial from the stenographer\u2019s minutes, and the amount of witness fees saved thereby is in excess of the cost of the minutes of his testimony upon the first trial. Under the circumstances, I think it is also proper to tax the fees of the stenographer in furnishing the testimony of this witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The order appealed from is affirmed as to the referee\u2019s fees and reversed as to the stenographer\u2019s fees, and the matter remitted to the county clerk, with direction to retax the stenographer\u2019s fees allowing only the cost of the testimony of Duprey and Banks. No costs of this appeal are allowed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
