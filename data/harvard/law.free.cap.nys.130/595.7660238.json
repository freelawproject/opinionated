The learned trial court charged the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-18\">\u201c 6 * * if you find from the evidence in this case that this car slowed down to, as has been testified, <em>a </em>walk of a child <em>or </em>a person, then I charge you that as a matter of law he is not guilty of contributory negligence. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-19\">To this part of the charge the defendant duly excepted. The evidence in this case presented a sharp conflict of fact, and we think that the charge of the learned trial court was erroneous and prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-20\">. Under the facts of this case, it was for the jury to determine as a matter of fact from the evidence presented whether the plaintiff was or was not guilty of negligence which contributed to the accident. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Upon this question presented by the evidence, the defendant was entitled to the judgment of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.
