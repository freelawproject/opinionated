The facts are, in substance, that in April, 1890, the defendant and nineteen others contracted for the purchase of 600 acres of land near Portland for the sum of $130,000, payable $3,000 down and the balance in installments. To effect and carry out the purchase and the subsequent sale of tbe land, the plaintiff corporation was organized with a capital stock of $130,000, divided into 20 shares of $6,500 each, whereupon tbe defendant and tbe other parties interested with her in the purchase subscribed for one share each, and received from the corporation a certificate of stock stating tbat it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>assessable as follows: $1,875 on receipt of the certificate, $1,650 one year from April 28, 1890, $1,500 and $1,475 in two and four years thereafter, together with interest on deferred payments at the rate of 7 per cent per annum, payable quarterly, and one twentieth of such taxes as may be assessed against the real estate owned by the association. The land was thereafter purchased and deeded to the corporation, and it executed its note, secured by a mortgage on the property, to the vendor, for the balance due on the purchase price. The plaintiff subsequently levied and collected assessments from its several stockholders amounting in the aggregate to $100,000, which was applied on its indebtedness. Prior to March 16, 1897, the defendant, as such stockholder, paid all assessments due on her stock except $1,779.49, and on that day, in consideration of such deferred payment, she made, executed, and delivered to the corporation the following instrument in writing:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-4\">\u201c$1779.49.

The complaint is in the usual form, and the answer sets up several defenses: (1) That a court of equity has no jurisdiction, and that plaintiff\u2019s remedy is by sale of the certificate of stock in the manner provided in the instru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ment of writing referred to; (2) that the balance of $30,000 still due from the plaintiff on the land purchased by it is owing by the defendant and five other subscribers to the stock of plaintiff, who axe each wholly insolvent and unable to pay any part thereof; that fourteen of the remaining stockholders are solvent, and able to contribute their share to the payment of said indebtedness; and the answer therefore prays that they be made parties to the suit, and required to contribute their proportionate share of such indebtedness; and (3) that $90,000, and not $130,000, was the true purchase price of the land, and the difference of $40,000 was, without the knowledge of the defendant, charged and received as rebates and commissions from the owner of the land by some of the other stockholders, who should be made parties to this suit, and required by a decree to account to the corporation for the sums so received by them. A demurrer was sustained to the answer, and, defendant declining to plead further, a decree was entered in favor of the plaintiff as prayed for in the complaint, from which the defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AXU\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-4\">For appellant there was an oral argument by <em>Mr. Benjamin B.

Shares of stock, though somewhat intangible in their nature, are personal property, and there is nothing in their intrinsic character to prevent a mortgage of them by a proper instrument evidencing such intention. In <em>Hembree </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>16 Or. 153, 156 (19 Pac. 73), a similar instrument was construed to be a chattel mortgage. There as here the instrument contains all the attributes of a chattel mortgage, and the only material difference lies in the fact that the instrument there construed covered ordinary goods and chattels, while the present instrument embraces shares of stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-8\">That shares of stock may be the subject of a chattel mortgage, we cite the following in addition to the numerous authorities cited in appellant\u2019s brief: Cook, Stock and Stockh, \u00a7 464; 5 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (2 ed.), 975, and cases cited in notes 3 and 4; <em>Megear </em>v. <em>Etiwanda Water Co. </em>76 Cal, 537 (9 Am. St. Rep. 245).</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>At common law all forms of personal property could be mortgaged, and, in the absence of statutory limitation upon the forms of property that may be mortgaged, any transfer of any personal property as security for debt should be construed to be a chattel mortgage, if so intended by the parties thereto, and such intention is to be ascertained, in the first instance, from the form and nature of the instrument by which the security is effected. The instrument in litigation shows such intention. The nature of the personal property covered should not be permitted to defeat that intention. The logical effect of the construction adopted by the court is that shares of stock, on account of their peculiar nature, cannot be mortgaged, though the instrument of transfer may have all the attributes, both in form and substance, of a chattel mortgage, and clearly evidences an intention to mortgage the same.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-4\">For respondent there was an oral argument by <em>Mr. Wm.

Laws), as interpreted in <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>McCalley, </em>8 Or. 124, can be foreclosed only in the manner stipulated, since plaintiff has possession of the property; while for the plaintiff the contention is that the transaction was a pledge, and not a mortgage. Speaking generally, the distinction between a mortgage and pledge of personal property is that in the former the thing pledged must be delivered to the pledgee, while in the latter the possession may remain with the mortgagor. It is often difficult to determine whether a given transaction is a mortgage or a pledge when possession of the property is delivered to the creditor. But the general rule is that an assignment and transfer of shares of stock in a corporation by a debtor as security for a debt is a pledge, and not a mortgage. Indeed, it is said by Mr. Cook that \u201cit is difficult to ascertain from the cases how shares of stock may be mortgaged; and a few early decisions, which held certain transactions to be mortgages, would to-day be held to be pledges\u2019\u2019: Cook, Stock and Stockh, \u00a7 464. Mr. Edwards, in his work on Bailments (2 ed.), \u00a7 219, says: \u201cShares of stock in a corporation are now, and have been for many years, habitually pledged as collateral security for money loaned. The pledge is made by a direct transfer of the scrip in writing, with an authority to effect a transfer in due form on the books of the corporation; and in his note for the sum loaned the borrower further authorizes the pledgee to sell the stock. The effect of the transaction is not a mortgage, but a pledge of the stock to secure the prompt payment of the money borrowed. On account of its incorporeal nature, property in stocks cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>be' otherwise delivered. The delivery of the scrip alone is not considered sufficient, because it does not of itself enable the pledgee to sell the stock and apply the proceeds to pay the debt. * The contract of pledge is entirely consistent with the owner\u2019s right as a stockholder. Until the pledge is rendered available by a foreclosure, he remains a member of the corporate body, interested in its management.\u201d And Mr. Jones, in his work on Pledges (section 153), says that the transfer of the legal title to the stock to the pledgee is not inconsistent with the existence of a pledge, but, on the contrary, it cannot generally be pledged without a written transfer of the title, because it is not capable of manual delivery; and \u201cin general it may be said that any transfer as collateral security of shares in a corporation, made in the ordinary form of an indorsement of a certificate, or by delivery of it with a power of attorney to make a transfer upon the books of the corporation, or by an actual transfer upon the books, is a pledge, and not a mortgage; and it is immaterial in this respect whether such transfer appear to be absolute or is expressed to be made as security.\u201d Within these authorities we think the transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant as set out in the pieadings constituted a mere pledge of the stock, coupled with 'a right to sell it in case of default; and such a construction was given by this court to practically a similar transaction in <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>15 Or. 98 (14 Pac. 814, 15 Pac. 137, 386).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> The other questions require but a brief notice. The defendant is sued upon a written contract or agreement for the payment of money secured by the deposit of her stock as collateral security. Upon this contract the plaintiff has a right to maintain a suit without regard to the solvency or insolvency of the other stockholders, and there is no right of contribution between stockholders which can be enforced therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> The other matter is a question between the corporation and the stockholders. If there is a right of action against them to recover the money which it is alleged they received as commission or rebates from the vendor of the land, it rests in the corporation, and cannot be the subject of adjudication in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>suit to enforce payment of an indebtedness from the defendant to it. From these views it follows that the decree of the court below must be affirmed, and it is so ordered. Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
