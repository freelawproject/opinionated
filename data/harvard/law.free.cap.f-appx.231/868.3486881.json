We find no reversible error; we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-24\">In October 2002, the former Immigration and Naturalization service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued Kodra, a native and citizen of Albania, with a Notice to Appear, charging him with removability under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, as an alien present in the United States without having been admitted or paroled. Kodra appeared before an IJ, conceded' removability, and applied for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) and the United Nations Conven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>tion Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In his asylum application and at the hearing before the IJ, Kodra contended, as a member of the Albanian Democratic Party, he had been subjected to persecution by officials of the then-governing Socialist Party. Kodra stated that he observed voter fraud by members of the Socialist Party during the October 2000 elections. Kodra contends that the alleged persecution began after he indicated his willingness to testify about the fraud in court. He points to three episodes during which the state prosecutor threatened Kodra with jail and bodily harm and accused him of having given false testimony. On one occasion in February 2001, two police officers beat Kodra for about ten minutes until he agreed to sign an affidavit contradicting his earlier accounts of voter fraud. Kodra reported the incident to the Democratic Party and filed a complaint in court against the prosecutor\u2019s office. He later abandoned the complaint and left Albania after the prosecutor pressured him to withdraw the charges and threatened him with imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">In addition to his own testimony, Kodra introduced into the record a copy of his Democratic Party membership card; an official notice of Kodra\u2019s appointment as an election observer for the October 2000 election; a \u201cNote of Protest\u201d from the Democratic Party about the February 2001 beating; a discharge sheet from Kodra\u2019s hospital visit after the beating; and the State Department\u2019s 2003 Country Report and 2004 profile of asylum claims and country conditions for Albania. Based on this evidence, the IJ denied Kodra\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal under the INA and the CAT. On appeal, the BIA adopted and affirmed the decision of the IJ, specifically noting that the Democratic Party was one of the largest parties in Albania. Kodra now appeals the IJ and BIA\u2019s denial of his asylum claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">Where the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001). We review the IJ\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence test, accepting such findings unless the record \u201ccompels\u201d reversal. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005). We review the IJ\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">Section 208 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158, vests DHS and the Attorney General with discretion to grant asylum to \u201crefugees,\u201d or persons who are unable or unwilling to return to their country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). An alien who establishes that he suffered past persecution is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). An alien may otherwise establish a well-founded fear of future persecution by showing that he subjectively fears persecution and that an objectively reasonable possibility exists that he will suffer persecution upon removal. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(i); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Korda failed to establish past persecution based on his political opinion. We have previously observed that \u201c \u2018persecution\u2019 is an \u2018extreme concept,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>... and ... \u2018[m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (alteration in original)(quoting <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000)). The incidents to which Kodra testified do not amount to past persecution: although the prosecutor threatened Kodra several times, Kodra received only minor injuries on just one occasion and was never detained or imprisoned. <em>See Prela v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 515, 518 (7th Cir.2005) (no past persecution where alien stopped and interrogated several times, detained once for twenty-four hours, and beaten so that he suffered injury to his hands); <em>Tawm v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 740, 742-44 (8th Cir.2004) (no past persecution where alien detained and beaten, but suffered no serious injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Neither does the record compel the conclusion that Kodra established an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution. The State Department reports indicate that there were no cases of political killings, disappearances, or prisoners from 2001 to 2003 and that \u201c[tjhere are no indications that the Socialist Party ... is engaged in a pattern of repression or violent behavior against its opponents.\u201d <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (concluding that such evidence was sufficient to rebut an alien\u2019s claim of reasonable fear of future persecution). And nothing evidences that Kodra\u2019s position in the Democratic Party was such that the Socialist Party\u2014which is not the current governing party in Albania <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u2014-would single him out for persecution now, more than five years after he left the country. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232 (\u201c[T]he evidence does not indicate [that the alien\u2019s] notoriety as an activist would outlast her four-year absence from Colombia.\u201d). We therefore conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of Kodra\u2019s asylum claim and order of removal. Accordingly, Kodra\u2019s petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-14\">. In March 2003, the enforcement functions of the INS were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b895-7\">. Kodra\u2019s brief does not specify any points of error for his claims of withholding of removal under the INA and the CAT; he has therefore waived arguments on those issues. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1282 n. 12 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b896-5\">.
