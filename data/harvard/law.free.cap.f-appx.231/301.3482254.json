The Government sought to have White\u2019s sentence enhanced under the Armed Career Criminals Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), asserting that White had previously been convicted on three separate occasions for \u201cserious drug offense[s]\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A). The district court granted the enhancement and sentenced White to 235 months imprisonment. White appeals only his sentence, contending that the Government failed to prove that one of his three prior convictions\u2014an October 2003 conviction for manufacturing or distributing an unlawful substance in Maryland\u2014qualified as a serious drug of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>fense for purposes of \u00a7 924(e). For the reasons that follow, we vacate White\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense under the ACCA. <em>United, States v. Williams, </em>326 F.3d 535, 537 (4th Cir.2003). To qualify as a serious drug offense, a prior conviction must have carried a maximum statutory penalty of at least 10 years imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). In deciding that White\u2019s 2003 conviction qualified as a serious drug offense, the district court considered two documents: (1) a \u201cTrue Test Copy\u201d from the District Court of Maryland, which revealed that White had been previously convicted of \u201cCDS MANUFACT/DISTNARC-ATT\u201d and (2) a \u201cStatement of Probable Cause,\u201d which detailed the circumstances surrounding White\u2019s prior arrest. However, the district court did not clearly enunciate its rationale for granting the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The True Test Copy contains references to numerous arcane acronyms and codes, which the Government contends, if correctly deciphered, clearly establish that White\u2019s prior conviction carried a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years under the applicable Maryland statute. If the Government is correct, our categorical approach would dictate that the 2003 conviction was a serious drug offense and the enhancement was proper. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (discussing the categorical approach). However, the very limited record before us fails to identify sufficiently the Maryland materials needed to decipher the information contained in the True Test Copy. Thus, without some additional development of the record, we simply cannot determine from the True Test Copy whether White\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a serious drug offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The Statement of Probable Cause does not provide the basis for an enhancement. This document lacks any stamp or seal of any Maryland court and bears no indication that it was a sworn statement. Further, the record does not indicate that the Statement of Probable Cause was ever incorporated into the charging papers for the 2003 conviction. Therefore, the Statement of Probable Cause cannot form the basis of White\u2019s enhancement. <em>Cf. United States v. Simms, </em>441 F.3d 313, 315-18 (4th Cir.2006) (upholding sentencing court\u2019s reliance on a sworn affidavit and other materials that were stamped by the state court and incorporated into the charging documents).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Accordingly, we vacate White\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion, including a determination as to whether the True Test Copy, when interpreted in light of the relevant Maryland authority, mandates that White\u2019s 2003 conviction carried a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
