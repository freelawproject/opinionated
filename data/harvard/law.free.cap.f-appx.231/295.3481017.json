We conclude Pyne is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">A writ of prohibition should not issue unless it \u201cclearly appears that the inferior court is about to exceed its jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Smith v. Whitney, </em>116 U.S. 167, 176, 6 S.Ct. 570, 29 L.Ed. 601 (1886). Because it is a drastic remedy, a writ of prohibition should only be granted when the petitioner\u2019s right to the requested relief is clear and indisputable, <em>In re Vargas, </em>723 F.2d 1461, 1468 (10th Cir.1983); <em>In re Missouri, </em>664 F.2d 178, 180 (8th Cir.1981), and there are no other adequate means of relief, <em>In re Bankers Trust Co., </em>775 F.2d 545, 547 (3d Cir.1985). A writ of prohibition may not be used as a substitute for the normal appellate process. <em>Missouri, </em>664 F.2d at 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Pyne has failed to demonstrate that he is entitled to the relief he seeks. Therefore, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny Pyne\u2019s motion for release and petition for a writ of prohibition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
