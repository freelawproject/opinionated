Garcia asserts that the district court erred by imposing an increase for obstruction of justice and by denying a decrease for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Garcia contends that his sentence is so \u201cunconstitutionally excessive\u201d as to be cruel and unusual, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Because Garcia\u2019s constitutional challenge is raised for the first time, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358-59 (5th Cir.2005). To obtain relief, Garcia must demonstrate error that is clear and obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Villegas, </em>404 F.3d at 358. If these conditions are met, we may exercise discretion to notice the forfeited error provided that the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 858-59 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">The district court sentenced Garcia at the bottom of the applicable sentencing guidelines range; the Guidelines are a \u201cconvincing objective indicator of proportionality.\u201d <em>United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, </em>987 F.2d 1129, 1134 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Garcia\u2019s sentence is not grossly disproportionate to his offense and does not violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>121 F.3d 928, 943 (5th Cir.1997) (citing <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980)). Garcia has not shown error, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">Findings regarding obstruction of justice and acceptance of responsibility are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Outlaw, </em>319 F.3d 701, 705 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>303 F.3d 606, 646 (5th Cir.2002). The district court\u2019s findings are plausible in light of the record as a whole and are not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Myers, </em>198 F.3d 160, 164 (5th Cir.1999). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
