We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b874-23\">Club Harem, owned and operated by Hugh Johnson Enterprises, Inc., is the only licensed adult-entertainment establishment in Winter Park, Florida. The property on which the club is located has been used for adult entertainment, non-obscene erotic dancing, for approximately thirty years. Previously, Club Harem was licensed by Orange County and operated under its adult-entertainment code. In 2003, the City of Winter Park annexed the property on which Club Harem is located and other properties on Lee Road west to Interstate 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-24\">On March 17, 2006, Club Harem was raided by Winter Park police. Various arrests of patrons and employees occurred. Thereafter, Club Harem\u2019s attorney contacted the attorney for the City of Winter Park to ascertain whether the city was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>contemplating or intending to initiate licensing penalties against the nightclub. Following requests for documents, counsel for Club Harem learned that (1) at a meeting at Winter Park police headquarters on December 22, 2005, a detective had stated that the city would like to prevent Club Harem from doing future business by having its license revoked, (2) a document instructed that a determination of whether Club Harem\u2019s city occupational license could be revoked be made, and (3) a response letter dated September 5, 2006, from the assistant city attorney to Club Harem\u2019s counsel\u2019s letter asking if the city intended to pursue a licensing action against the nightclub, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-5\"><em>Please be advised that there is no pending proceeding to revoke Club Harem\u2019s license. </em>However, the City of Winter Park will continue to seek to enforce all of its laws, ordinances, or regulations against any party who appears to be in violation of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-6\">As such, if Club Harem is in violation of any of the City of Winter Park\u2019s laws, ordinances, or regulations, the City of Winter Park reserves all of its rights to take the appropriate enforcement action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">R1-1 at Tab C (emphasis added). Rather than face the loss of its license under an allegedly unconstitutional ordinance, Club Harem sought a declaratory judgment and injunction, which would decide that the Winter Park Adult Entertainment Code, sections 14-50 (Suspension) and 14-51 (Revocation), are unconstitutional and unenforceable. The district judge granted Winter Park\u2019s motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and concluded that Club Harem\u2019s action was not ripe for adjudication and that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">We review the granting of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) <em>de novo </em>and apply the same legal standard used by the district court. <em>Hoffman-Pugh v. Ramsey, </em>312 F.3d 1222, 1225 (11th Cir.2002). \u201c \u2018When considering a motion to dismiss, all facts set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint are to be accepted as true and the <em>court </em>limits its consideration <em>to the </em>pleadings and exhibits attached thereto.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thaeter v. Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office, </em>449 F.3d 1342, 1352 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). Based on the facts as stated in the complaint and attached exhibits, the threshold decision is ripeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">The United States Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts by permitting them to consider only disputes that rise to the level of being \u201cCases\u201d or \u201cControversies.\u201d U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2; <em>National Adver. Co. v. City of Miami, </em>402 F.3d 1335, 1338 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citing <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 559-60, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1170, 126 S.Ct. 1318, 164 L.Ed.2d 48 (2006). \u201cThe ripeness doctrine protects federal courts from engaging in speculation or wasting their resources through the review of potential or abstract disputes.\u201d <em>Digital Properties, Inc. v. City of Plantation, </em>121 F.3d 586, 589 (11th Cir.1997). The two-step \u201cripeness inquiry requires a determination of (1) the fitness of the issues for judicial decision, and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\u201d Id. The court must determine \u201c \u2018whether there is sufficient injury to meet Article Ill\u2019s requirement of a case or controversy and, if so, whether the claim is sufficiently mature, and the issues sufficiently defined and concrete, to permit effective decisionmaking by the court.\u2019 \u201d Id. (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>The plaintiff corporation in <em>Digital Properties </em>sought to open an adult book and video store, although Digital had obtained prior legal advice that the municipal zoning code did not allow adult book and video stores anywhere in the city. Based on the rationale that the restriction made the zoning code unconstitutional and unenforceable, Digital filed in federal court a case challenging the municipal zoning scheme as unconstitutional. The city filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under the ripeness doctrine, and the district judge granted the motion in part because Digital\u2019s \u201crush to the courthouse was premature.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">On appeal, we concluded that Digital had failed to present a ripe claim for review, because it did not pursue its claim with the requisite diligence to show that a mature claim or controversy existed. <em>Id. </em>at 590. We reasoned \u201cthat Digital\u2019s presumption of constitutional infirmity bred impatience and prompted it to file an unripe claim,\u201d when the ripeness doctrine requires a formalized decision from a governmental authority, \u201cand its effects [must be] felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 135, 148-49, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967)). We explained that \u201cDigital\u2019s impatience <em>precluded </em>the formation of a concrete case or controversy\u201d; because there was no tangible controversy, the federal courts were without authority to act. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Therefore, we concluded that Digital\u2019s \u201canticipated belief\u2019 that the city would interpret its code in a way that violated Digital\u2019s rights was insufficient to meet the ripeness standard; consequently, there was no subject-matter jurisdiction over the dispute. <em>Id. </em>We have recognized that, to challenge the constitutionality of government action, a proponent has the obligation to obtain a conclusive and definitive government decision regarding the alleged unconstitutional application of the legislation questioned.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>National Adver., </em>402 F.3d at 1340 (citing <em>Digital Properties, </em>121 F.3d at 590).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">The Winter Park Adult Entertainment Code, attached to Club Harem\u2019s complaint, states the procedures for suspension and revocation of an adult entertainment license in sections 14-50 and 14-51. An adult-entertainment license may be suspended for thirty (30) days for \u201cthree or more violations of article VI of the Orange County Adult Entertainment Code\u201d within a two-year period, if there is a conviction. Winter Park Adult Entertainment Code \u00a7 14-50(e)(l). After a first suspension, then another conviction can result in a ninety-day suspension. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 14-50(c)(2). Finally, if a license has been suspended for ninety days, and there is within two years of the conviction leading to that suspension another conviction, then the license can be suspended for 180 days. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 14-50(c)(3). Absent false information in the application process, an adult-entertainment license can be revoked only if, within two years of the conviction that led to the 180-day suspension, there is another conviction. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 14\u201451(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>Club Harem has not alleged that there have been any suspensions or convictions under the Winter Park Adult Entertainment Code. All that Club Harem\u2019s complaint alleges is that the City of Winter Park has an inchoate desire to use the city\u2019s Adult Entertainment Code to revoke Club Harem\u2019s license based on a comment by a detective of the Winter Park Police Department that he would like to see the revocation process occur. Absent from the complaint is any allegation that the city has taken identifiable steps to revoke Club Harem\u2019s license. Moreover, in response to inquiry by Club Harem\u2019s counsel, the assistant city attorney responded that no revocation proceeding regarding Club Harem was pending. Consequently, the city has taken no concrete or cognizable action to suspend or revoke Club Harem\u2019s license. Because it has suffered no action to suspend or revoke its license whatsoever from Winter Park through its adult entertainment ordinance, Club Harem\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of the Winter Park Adult Entertainment Code is premature and unripe for adjudication. Therefore, the district judge properly dismissed Club Harem\u2019s complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Club Harem has appealed the dismissal of its complaint challenging the constitutionality of the Winter Park Adult Entertainment Code. Because the city has taken no steps to suspend or revoke Club Harem\u2019s adult entertainment license, Club Harem\u2019s request for preliminary constitutional adjudication of the ordinance is not ripe, and subject-matter jurisdiction is lacking. Accordingly, the district judge\u2019s dismissal of Club Harem\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-5\">. The city has argued that Club Harem has confused an occupational license for a business with an adult-entertainment license. Its contention is that the reference to a business license in Club Harem\u2019s correspondence with the city\u2019s attorneys, attached as exhibits to its complaint, means an occupational license rather than an adult-entertainment license. Counsel for Club Harem refutes this assertion in his reply brief. Reply Br. at 5-6. Because Club Harem is the only licensed adult entertainment business in Winter Park, we conclude that the business license that Club Harem is challenging in its complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief is its license for adult entertainment and not its occupational license required for all businesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
