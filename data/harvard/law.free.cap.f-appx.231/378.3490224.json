Ayala argues that the district court erred by denying him a downward adjustment based on acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">To qualify for a downward adjustment based on acceptance of responsibility, the defendant must clearly demonstrate acceptance of responsibility for his offense. <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>237 F.3d 693, 694 (5th Cir.2001); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Considerations include whether the defendant truthfully admitted or did not falsely deny any additional relevant conduct for which he is accountable under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. <em>Pierce, </em>237 F.3d at 695. In reviewing a sentencing court\u2019s determination of acceptance of responsibility, this court gives \u201cmore deference to the finding than would be given under a clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The district court did not deny Ayala an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction because Ayala raised a Sixth Amendment challenge to the for-profit determination. Rather, the court determined that Ayala had falsely denied relevant conduct for which he was accountable, namely the commission of the offense for profit. Ayala\u2019s argument that he should not have been denied the adjustment based on his Sixth Amendment argument is thus without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Ayala\u2019s argument that he did not personally profit from the offense and thus could not have been denied the reduction is likewise without merit. The record supports the determination that Ayala was going to personally profit from the offense. Ayala thus falsely denied relevant conduct for which he was accountable under \u00a7 1B1.3. <em>See Pierce, </em>237 F.3d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
