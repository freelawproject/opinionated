His constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Reyna Pulido contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Reyna Pulido properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Reyna Pulido additionally argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines by characterizing his state felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Given the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), Reyna Pulido is correct. <em>See United States v. Estrada-Mendoza, </em>475 F.3d 258, 259-61 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1845, 167 L.Ed.2d 340 (2007). His conviction is affirmed. His sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-33\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
