On appeal, Patterson raises three claims. First, she argues that the evidence did not support the district court\u2019s \u201cdeliberate avoidance\u201d jury instruction. Second, she asserts the district court violated her Sixth Amendment rights during jury deliberations by improperly responding to the jury\u2019s question concerning the amount of heroin involved in the underlying offenses. Finally, Patterson challenges the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>court\u2019s denial of a minor-role reduction at sentencing. After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">We review jury instructions de novo to determine whether they misstate the law or mislead the jury to the prejudice of the objecting party. <em>United States v. Chandler, </em>996 F.2d 1073, 1085 (11th Cir.1993). \u201cWe will not reverse a conviction unless we find that issues of law were presented inaccurately or the charge improperly guided the jury in such a substantial way as to violate due process.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d 1552, 1564 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Ordinarily we review a court\u2019s response to a jury question for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1279 (11th Cir.2004). However, where, as here, an appellant presents different arguments on appeal regarding why the district court\u2019s action was improper, our review is for plain error. <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo demonstrate plain error, [Patterson] must show: (1) an error; (2) that is plain; (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. If the defendant satisfies those three prongs, we may then employ our discretion to note that error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1279-80 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">We review a district court\u2019s factual determination regarding whether a defendant is eligible for a reduction for role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 934 (11th Cir. 1999) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">The relevant facts are these. On December 22, 2005, Patterson and codefendants Lizza Cepeda, Maritza Rivera, and Rubby Rios, were charged in a multi-count indictment arising out of their involvement in smuggling heroin, while traveling on cruise ships, from Aruba to Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Patterson was charged with the following crimes: (1) conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), and 846 (Count 1); and (2) attempting to possess with the intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), and 846 (Count 5). After initially pleading guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, Patterson withdrew her plea and the case proceeded to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-13\">Prior to trial, the government submitted a motion and supporting memorandum of law requesting that the district court give a jury instruction on \u201cdeliberate ignorance\u201d or \u201cconscious avoidance.\u201d The government argued that because there was evidence of both actual knowledge and deliberate ignorance, it should be allowed to pursue both theories. The government also filed a Rule 404(b) Notice of Intent to offer extrinsic-act evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-14\">During the trial, Special Agent Selwyn Smith, of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), testified that in December 2005, he and other law enforcement agents boarded a cruise ship that had just arrived at Port Everglades after having traveled to Aruba. Their purpose was to perform random customs searches for illegal narcotics. During their search of the room occupied by Patterson\u2019s codefendants, Maritza Rivera and Lizza Cepeda, the agents discovered heroin hidden within various personal items, including perfume bottles, sandals, pants, and a CD case. Subsequent laboratory analysis re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>vealed that the net weight of the heroin totaled 3.1 kilograms.</p>\n<p id=\"A0-\">After Rivera and Cepeda were read their Miranda rights, they told the agents that a man named \u201cCarlos,\u201d who lived in Colombia, had paid for their cruise to Aruba where they obtained heroin from a man named \u201cMauricio.\u201d They had been promised $10,000 each for transporting the heroin into the United States. They both agreed to cooperate with law enforcement and to conduct a controlled delivery of the heroin in the South Florida area. Rivera subsequently placed calls to Carlos and Mauricio, indicating that she and Cepeda were fighting, and that they needed someone to pick up the drugs soon. Carlos told Rivera to call \u201cLa Mona,\u201d who later was identified as co-defendant Rios, to arrange for a pick-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Thereafter, an undercover agent, acting as Cepeda, called Rios, who said she would come to a Miami hotel and transport Cepeda and the drugs to the New York/New Jersey area, where Cepeda could secure her $10,000 payment for the smuggling job. Defendant Patterson drove Rios to the Miami hotel where the undercover agent had checked into a room. Patterson waited in her car in the parking lot while Rios met with the undercover agent in the hotel room. After entering the room, Rios inspected the contents of a bag the undercover officer gave to her. As part of the controlled buy, law enforcement had filled the bag with items containing fake heroin. As Rios pulled the items out of the bag, law enforcement entered the room and arrested her.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">Patterson, who was still waiting in her car in the parking lot, also was arrested. In Patterson\u2019s car, the arresting officers discovered car rental documents, suitcases with clothes, and a heat sealing machine. The rental documents indicated that Patterson had rented the car at Miami International Airport on the same day that the meeting at the hotel had been arranged. The agents also discovered a Western Union money transfer, in the amount of $920, payable to Patterson, and another, in the amount of $900, payable to Rios.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">When she was arrested, Rios agreed to cooperate with law enforcement and admitted that she had taken three cruises, two of which entailed smuggling drugs into the United States. Agents learned from cruise-line records that Patterson had purchased the tickets for Rios\u2019s second cruise, and, immediately after the cruise, Patterson had rented a car for 10 days and drove it over 3,000 miles. Patterson also had purchased a hotel room in New Jersey three days after she rented the car, and 15 phone calls were made to \u201cConsuelo\u2019s\u201d phone number from the hotel room. The cruise-line records also indicated that in September 2005, Rios and Patterson went on another cruise to Aruba.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">Special Agent Loni Forgash, the undercover ICE agent who posed as Cepeda during the investigation, testified that when she met with Rios in the hotel room prior to Rios\u2019s arrest, Rios told her not to be nervous because the most difficult part of the drug smuggling scheme\u2014getting through the Port\u2014was over. Rios also said that she and \u201cthis other lady [who] always traveled together have done this in the past and ... that on this trip they were actually going to get the money\u2014 that we were going to get the money as soon as we arrived in New York.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">The government also presented the testimony of codefendants Cepeda and Rios. Cepeda testified that during the December 2005 cruise, she and Rivera had attended a meeting with Mauricio at a McDonald\u2019s in Aruba, at which time he gave them bags containing the heroin. They were told that they would receive instructions from Carlos once the cruise was over, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>they were going to be paid between $8,000 and $10,000 for the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Rios testified that she had known Patterson for almost three years, during which they had taken cruises in September 2004, April 2005, and September 2005. When Rios met Patterson, \u201cCarlos\u201d had asked her (Rios) to recruit other people to participate in the drug smuggling conspiracy. Patterson was an appealing recruit because of her looks and the fact that she was American and used a wheelchair, thus allowing her to enter the country without being searched. Rios characterized Patterson\u2019s wheelchair-bound status as a \u201cbig plus.\u201d Rios approached Patterson and asked her to come to Aruba to meet Mauricio. Patterson purchased the tickets for the September 2004 cruise with her credit card, and \u201cCarlos\u201d reimbursed her. When the two women arrived in Aruba, they met Mauricio at a McDonald\u2019s, and he took them to his apartment where he told them that on future trips, they would receive several items from him, including perfumes, shoes, and cameras. Rios remembered Patterson asked Mauricio whether he would pay for lawyers if there was a problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">After the initial meeting with Mauricio, Patterson agreed to the plan and told Rios that she was comfortable going on the April 2005 cruise because she was sick (and in a wheelchair), and, therefore, they would \u201calways go first.\u201d Patterson made the travel arrangements, and, once in Aruba, they again met Mauricio at the McDonald\u2019s and went to his apartment where he gave them shoes, a purse, and perfumes, all of which contained drugs. Rios and Patterson put the items in bags and hung them from Patterson\u2019s wheelchair. When they went through customs at Port Everglades, they went to a special elevator and were not searched because Patterson was in a wheelchair. They then traveled to New Jersey where Rios delivered the drugs. The next day, \u201cConsuelo\u201d met Rios in the hotel lobby and paid her $20,000 to be split between herself and Patterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Rios described the third cruise that she and Patterson took in September 2005. Again, Patterson made the reservations for the trip and purchased the tickets through her travel agency. At another meeting at the McDonald\u2019s in Aruba, Mauricio gave them items, including perfumes and a CD player, that contained drugs. During the ship\u2019s stop in Puerto Rico, Rios delivered the drugs to a man at a shopping center. They were each paid $13,000 for their smuggling services.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">As for Rios\u2019s and Patterson\u2019s involvement in the December 2005 cruise taken by Cepeda and Rivera, Rios testified that in the afternoon of December 12, 2005, she was contacted from Colombia by \u201cCarlos\u201d who told her that she needed to rent a ear and pick up Cepeda at a hotel in Miami and take her and some drugs to New York. Rios told Carlos that she did not have a credit card, and, therefore, she would need to speak to \u201cCathy,\u201d whom she trusted and with whom she previously had \u201cdone business.\u201d After the phone call, Rios contacted Patterson, who agreed to accompany Rios to pick up a woman and some drugs at a Miami hotel and transport them to \u201cConsuelo\u201d in New York. Rios told Patterson that Carlos would pay each of them $1500, plus $1000 for travel expenses, and that some of the money had been wired in advance from New York. While Rios was at Patterson\u2019s house, \u201cCarlos\u201d called again and told Rios to make sure there were five packages. Rios then spoke to either Cepeda or Maritza, and arranged to meet them at the Miami hotel the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Rios received another call from \u201cCarlos\u201d the next morning. He explained that Rios and Patterson would be transporting sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>en, as opposed to five, packages of heroin. When Patterson picked Rios np that morning, Rios informed Patterson about the changed amount, and Patterson asked whether Carlos would pay them for the extra two packages. Rios assured Patterson that Carlos would pay them extra. Rios also testified that during a conversation with Patterson, after they were arrested at the Miami hotel, they had agreed to \u201cstick together\u201d and never talk about their previous trips.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Officer Tracy Land, of the Broward County Sheriffs Office, testified that he interviewed Patterson at the Miami hotel after her arrest, and, once the interview was over, he gave Patterson an opportunity to make changes to his written notes. According to her statement, which Officer Land read into the record, Patterson was driving Rios to New York because Rios did not have a credit card. Patterson admitted that she had a \u201cgeneral idea\u201d that Rios was transporting drugs, and that Rios \u201cpossibly\u201d had drugs in a pair of shoes she had bought in Aruba. Patterson also said that during one of their prior cruises, Rios had met with a man in Aruba. Patterson said that she thought the meeting \u201cmight be about a drug deal.\u201d Patterson also described a second cruise in which she believed that there \u201cpossibly w[ere] drugs\u201d in a large bronze cologne bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">After the government rested, Patterson testified in her own defense. She claimed that at no point after she met Rios sometime in mid-2004 did Rios ever discuss the drug business. When Rios invited Patterson to accompany her on a cruise shortly after they met, Patterson thought she had been invited only because Rios had no one else to go with her, and when Rios asked Patterson to make the arrangements and pay for the cruise because she did not have a credit card, Patterson agreed based on her understanding that Rios would reimburse her. Patterson also claimed that during her various cruises to Aruba, she had never met with anyone concerning drugs. Patterson said that she never agreed to help Rios smuggle drugs into the U.S. or to transport them from Florida to New York, and that Rios never paid her any money, except to reimburse her for travel expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"AV3Q\">Patterson also gave her version of the events leading up to her arrest in December 2005. She had planned to take a food sealer to her sister in Gainesville when Rios asked her to go to New York. Rios told Patterson that they were going to take someone with them who did not have proper identification to buy a plane ticket, but Rios did not tell her that the person would be carrying drugs. Patterson rented the car later that night, and, after she picked Rios up the next morning, they drove to a hotel in Miami to pick up the other passenger. When they got to the hotel, Rios went inside while Patterson waited in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Patterson testified that once she had been arrested and removed from her car, she began to feel extremely dizzy due to her diabetes and the fact that she had not eaten. She claimed she informed agents of this fact, but they took her to a hotel room and began screaming at her about her involvement with the drugs. She could not remember what she said during her interview, and testified that she had been unable to read her statement because she did not have her glasses. She told the agents that she had been on previous trips with Rios, but she did not admit to having knowledge of any drugs. She also testified that she did not say anything to Rios in prison about trying to conceal information from the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">During the government\u2019s rebuttal, Special Agent David Mitchell, of the Drug Enforcement Administration, testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>he was present when Patterson was arrested at the Miami hotel. After her arrest, the arresting officers allowed Patterson to sit in a chair and use the bathroom before taking her upstairs to a hotel room. Special Agent Mitchell did not witness anyone abusing Patterson, and he never heard her complain of pain or discomfort. Another special agent\u2019s testimony was consistent with Special Agent Mitchell\u2019s version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">After the close of evidence, Patterson objected to the proposed jury instruction on deliberate ignorance. The court overruled the objection without explanation. During closing arguments, Patterson urged that she should not be punished for being gullible and naive.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The district court\u2019s charge to the jury included the following jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqe\">[W]ith respect to the issue of [Patterson\u2019s] knowledge in this case, if you find from all the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that [Patterson] believed that she was at the hotel to pick up and transport a controlled substance for delivery to a location outside south Florida, and deliberately and consciously trying to avoid learning the specifics pertaining to the controlled substance, in order to be able to say if apprehended that she did not know what she would be transporting, you may treat such deliberate avoidance of positive knowledge as the equivalent of knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-6\">In other words, you may find that a defendant acted knowingly if you find beyond a reasonable doubt either, one, that the defendant actually knew that she was to transport and deliver controlled substances, or that she deliberately closed her eyes to what she had every reason to believe was the fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxHx\">The jury verdict form provided a place for the jury to indicate whether it found Patterson guilty of Count One. If the jury found Patterson guilty of Count One, then a second section provided a place for the jury to mark whether it found her guilty of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute: (1) 1 kilogram or more of heroin; or (2) 100 grams or more of heroin. Similarly, if the jury found Patterson guilty of Count Five, then the jury had to indicate whether the offense involved: (1) 1 kilogram or more of heroin; or (2) 100 grams or more of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">During deliberations, the jury submitted the following two questions to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADz\">Why do we have a choice of the amount of the controlled substance on the verdict form? What do the 100 grams or more have to do with the case if the amount seized was 3 kilograms?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">The district court informed the parties it would respond with the following answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATEM\">Three (3) kilograms is equal to 3000 grams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-10\">If you should find beyond reasonable doubt that the Defendant is guilty of either Count 1 or Count 5, or both, then you must also find the amount\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5s\">that is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-11\">more than 1 kilogram</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABk\">more than 100 grams</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxDU\">3 kilograms is obviously more than either 1 kilogram or 100 grams.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">Patterson requested that the court also instruct the jury that it needed to rely on the instructions already given, and she argued that by telling the jury that three kilograms equaled 3,000 grams, the court was bringing in extraneous information. The court responded that the proper answer to the jury\u2019s question was that the amounts were listed only because the jury\u2019s finding on drug amount was relevant for sentencing, but indicated it would not so inform the jury as to the use of drug amount at sentencing because that infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>mation was not relevant to the jury\u2019s fact-finding. The district court overruled Patterson\u2019s objection and provided the above-quoted response to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">The jury found Patterson guilty on both counts. On the verdict form, the jury indicated that it found the offenses involved \u201cone kilogram or more,\u201d as opposed to \u201c100 grams or more,\u201d of heroin. Patterson then proceeded to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended a base offense level of 34, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), because the offense involved 3.1 kilograms of heroin. The PSI recommended no adjustments to the base offense level. With a total offense level of 34, and a criminal history of I, Patterson faced a Guidelines range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">In response to Patterson\u2019s objection to the PSI\u2019s failure to recommend a mitigating-role adjustment, pursuant to \u00a7 3B 1.2(a), the probation officer noted that each of the co-defendants was equally culpable because they were all couriers in the conspiracy. According to the PSI, co-defendants Rivera and Cepeda pled guilty to Counts 1 and 4 of the indictment and Rios pled guilty to Counts 1 and 5. All three of Patterson\u2019s co-defendants received 48-month terms of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">At the sentencing hearing, Patterson argued she was entitled to a minor-role adjustment because she was called at the last minute to help Rios drive, and she and Rios were going to receive only $1,500, while Rivera and Cepeda were supposed to split $10,000. The district court found that Patterson had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she was entitled to a mitigating-role reduction because all of the participants were equally culpable.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">After the court said it had considered the parties\u2019 arguments, the PSI, and the statutory factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), it found that a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range was sufficiently punitive and would deter Patterson and others from committing similar crimes. The court sentenced Patterson to two concurrent 151-month terms of imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">First, Patterson argues that the district court reversibly erred by including in its charge to the jury an instruction on deliberate indifference. We have held that \u201c[a] deliberate ignorance instruction is appropriate when the facts support the inference that the defendant was aware of a high probability of the existence of the fact in question and purposely contrived to avoid learning all of the facts in order to have a defense in the event of a subsequent prosecution.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d 1552, 1564 (11th Cir. 1994) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Such an inference can be supported by either direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>United States v. Arias, </em>984 F.2d 1139, 1143 (11th Cir.1993). Although the instruction is not appropriate when the \u201crelevant evidence points only to <em>actual knowledge, </em>rather than deliberate avoidance,\u201d <em>see Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d at 1564-65 (quotation omitted), the instruction is properly given if the evidence supports <em>both </em>actual knowledge <em>and </em>deliberate ignorance. <em>Arias, </em>984 F.2d at 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">Here, we readily conclude the district court did not err by giving the deliberate avoidance instruction because the evidence squarely pointed towards both actual knowledge and deliberate avoidance. Patterson\u2019s primary theory of defense was that she was ignorant of the purpose not only of the road-trip to New York in December 2005, but also of the multiple cruises she took with Rios as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>as the first road-trip to New York, in April 2005. However, the government presented extensive evidence to the contrary, most notably during Rios\u2019s testimony about Patterson\u2019s direct knowledge of the drug-smuggling purpose of their cruises and road-trips. Even if the jury discounted Rios\u2019s testimony, it surely could have found Patterson was aware of a high probability that the purpose of the trip was to deliver drugs, and she purposely contrived to avoid learning about the trip\u2019s details in order to have a defense to criminal prosecution. Cf. <em>Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d at 1564. Even by Patterson\u2019s own account, she was asked to rent a car and drive codefendant Rios and a stranger hundreds of miles to New York with little more than a day\u2019s notice. As for her other trips with Rios, Patterson testified that she was never present when drugs were discussed or exchanged. Indeed, she testified that Rios never mentioned drug smuggling to her. On this record, the jury could have found that Patterson had attempted to avoid learning the details of the scheme, particularly in light of her own testimony that she was never present when drugs were discussed or transferred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Patterson also challenges the district court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s questions concerning whether it had a choice as to \u201cthe amount of the controlled substance on the verdict form\u201d and whether the 100 grams was relevant to the case if the amount seized was 3 kilograms. Again, the district court\u2019s response was this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-7\">Three (3) kilograms is equal to 3000 grams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-8\">If you should find beyond reasonable doubt that the Defendant is guilty of either Count 1 or Count 5, or both, then you must also find the amount\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap1\">that is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-9\">more than 1 kilogram more than 100 grams</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-10\">3 kilograms is obviously more than either 1 kilogram or 100 grams.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">On appeal, Patterson argues that because the jury was still deliberating over the weight of the drugs when it submitted the questions, and it had not indicated that it was considering holding Patterson accountable for 3 kilograms of heroin, the district court\u2019s answer to the question constituted reversible error because it assumed the jury had found Patterson guilty. We disagree. Simply put, the district court\u2019s response did not assume that the jury was going to find Patterson guilty, and it did not improperly suggest a finding regarding the amount of drugs because: (1) it is undisputable that 3 kilograms is more than 1 kilogram or 100 grams; and (2) the jury\u2019s question stated that the crime involved the seizure of 3 kilograms of heroin. Moreover, even if the district court did err in its response, it did not commit <em>plain </em>error because the only genuine issue in dispute was Patterson\u2019s knowledge. At no point did Patterson assert a defense based on, or otherwise challenge, the amount of heroin involved in the offense. On this record, she cannot establish error, let alone plain error, based on the district court\u2019s answer to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Finally, Patterson argues that she was entitled to a minor-role reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, because: (1) she only participated in the conspiracy to transport the drugs for a brief period; (2) she was the least culpable of the individuals involved; and (3) she did not have any understanding or knowledge of the criminal enterprise. Again, we review a district court\u2019s factual determination regarding whether a defendant is eligible for a reduction for role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 934 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>We have noted that \u201ca trial court\u2019s choice between \u2018two permissible views of the evidence\u2019 is the very essence of the clear error standard of review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939. We will not find clear error unless we are \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir. 2005) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">In determining a defendant\u2019s role in an offense, a district court (1) <em>must </em>consider the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which he has been held aceountable at sentencing, and (2) <em>may </em>also consider his role as compared to that of other participants in his relevant conduct. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940, 944. The proponent of a role adjustment bears the burden of establishing his role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">Here, Patterson was held accountable for only 3.1 kilograms of heroin, which was the amount that she and her codefendants were attempting to transport when they were arrested at the Miami hotel in December 2005. Patterson\u2019s role in the transportation of those drugs from Florida to New York was integral to the criminal enterprise because Rios did not have a credit card or any other means to pay for the transportation, and, according to Rios\u2019s testimony, she would not have been able to transport the drugs to New York if Patterson had not agreed to rent the car and drive. Although Patterson contends that she was less culpable than the other codefendants, the record does not compel this conclusion, especially considering that there would have been no transportation for the drugs from Miami to New York without her participation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>the district court did not clearly err by denying her request for a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-6\">. Moreover, even if the district court erred by instructing the jury on deliberate avoidance, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because Rios\u2019s testimony provided strong evidence that Patterson had actual knowledge that the purpose of the trip was to transport heroin. <em>United States v. Schlei, </em>122 F.3d 944, 973 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that if a district court gives an erroneous instruction on deliberate ignorance, but there is also strong evidence of actual knowledge of the crime being committed, any error will be deemed harmless).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b913-7\">. We are unpersuaded by Patterson\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of her sentence. She suggests that her sentence of 151 months was unreasonably longer than her co-defendants\u2019 48-month sentences. \u201cAfter the district court has accurately calculated the Guideline range,\u201d we review the final sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir. 2005). The factors that act as a guide in determining whether a sentence was reasonable are found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1246. One of these factors is \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). We have held that the \"[d]isparity between the sentences imposed on codefendants is generally not an appropriate basis for relief on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Regueiro, </em>240 F.3d 1321, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2001). Also, \u201cwhen the district court considers the factors of \u00a7 3553(a), it need not discuss each of them ... an acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s argument and the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) is sufficient.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"APj\">Here, the disparity between Patterson\u2019s sentence and that of her three codefendants' is easily explained because her codefendants cooperated with agents during the investigation and accepted responsibility for their actions, while Patterson took no responsibility for her actions, and maintained that she was innocent throughout a jury trial. Moreover, the district court stated that it had considered the parties\u2019 arguments and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. On this record, Patterson\u2019s sentence, which was at the low end of the advisory Guideline range, was reasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
