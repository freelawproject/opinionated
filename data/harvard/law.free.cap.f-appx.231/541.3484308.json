Romero-Reyes conceded removability and applied for cancellation of removal. An immigration judge denied his application for cancellation of removal because Romero-Reyes had not \u201cestablished that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to Romero-Reyes or his family. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). Counsel for Romero-Reyes filed a notice of appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cthe Board\u201d), but he did not pursue the case. The Board dismissed the appeal as abandoned on July 22, 2005. Romero-Reyes subsequently obtained new counsel and successfully moved to reinstate his appeal. On appeal to the Board, Romero-Reyes argued that his prior counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance at his removal hearing denied him a full and fair opportunity to present his claim. The Board rejected this argument in a decision dated July 13, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-19\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), Romero-Reyes had thirty days in which to petition for judicial review of the Board decision. Romero-Reyes did not file the present petition for review until Tuesday, August 15, 2006. His petition for review was untimely, and we therefore lack jurisdiction to hear it. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
