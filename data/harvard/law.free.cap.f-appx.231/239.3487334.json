The district court dismissed the appeal as moot because the funds had been fully distributed to nonparty creditors, and, even if Halkas were to prevail on appeal, the district court would be unable to fashion any effectual relief. Halkas has noted her appeal to this court, and the trustee in bankruptcy has moved to dismiss the appeal as moot. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, although we deny the trustee\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal, we summarily affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Halkas v. Grigsby, </em>Nos. 8:06-cv02744-DKC; BK-01-23321 (D.Md. Feb. 15, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
