Flores asserts that the IJ abused her discretion in denying Flores\u2019 motion to continue for adjudi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>cation of an 1-130 petition for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">We have reviewed the record and find no abuse of discretion in the IJ\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29 (2006); <em>Onyeme v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.1998). The remaining claims set forth in Flores\u2019 brief were not raised before the Board of Immigration Appeals. As such, they have not been administratively exhausted and we lack jurisdiction to review them. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000). With regard to Flores\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we note that she has also failed to comply with the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (B.I.A. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
