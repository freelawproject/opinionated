Currence moved to suppress the crack found in the handlebars of his bicycle on the grounds that the warrantless search violated the Fourth Amendment and that the search did not fall within any of the exceptions to the warrant requirement. The district court granted the motion to suppress, and the Government appealed. We held that the search of the handlebars was permissible as a search incident to arrest, reversed the district court\u2019s ruling on the motion to suppress, and remanded for further proceedings. <em>United States v. Currence, </em>446 F.3d 554, 557-59 (4th Cir.2006) <em>(\u201cCurrence I\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">On remand, Currence was convicted on both counts after a bench trial. Currence appeals his conviction, asserting that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. He relies on the arguments presented to the court in <em>Currence I. </em>The Government asserts on appeal that Currence is precluded from challenging the validity of the search in this appeal because it was litigated in <em>Currence I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">We agree with the Government. In <em>Currence I, </em>we rejected the claims Currence now seeks to raise in this appeal. Thus, we find that Currence\u2019s challenge to the search is barred by the law-of-the-case doctrine and that none of the exceptions applies. <em>See United States v. Aramony, </em>166 F.3d 655, 661 (4th Cir.1999) (discussing doctrine and exceptions thereto); <em>see also Invention Submission Corp. v. Dudas, </em>413 F.3d 411, 414-15 (4th Cir.2005) (discussing mandate rule), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1090, 126 S.Ct. 1024, 163 L.Ed.2d 854 (2006). Accordingly, we affirm Currence\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
