Maldonado contends that the district court erred in treating his Texas burglary of a habitation conviction as a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). As Maldonado con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>cedes, his argument has been rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. ValdezMaltos, </em>443 F.3d 910, 911 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 265, 166 L.Ed.2d 205 (2006); <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1199,126 S.Ct. 1398,164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Maldonado also challenges, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than as elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This issue is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Maldonado contends that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Maldonado properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
