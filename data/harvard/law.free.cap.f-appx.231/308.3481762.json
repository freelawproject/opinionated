The overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act require an employer to pay covered workers \u201cat a rate of not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). Appellant argues that his \u201cregular rate\u201d should have been calculated by dividing his weekly salary by the number of hours he worked per week-a rate which exceeded minimum wage. He explains that his overtime wages should have been calculated based on this rate and the number of overtime hours work.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">The district court, however, assumed that the plaintiff was hired for the minimum wage, and that any extra money provided by his fixed salary was intended to <em>partially </em>compensate for overtime. The district court calculated the overtime rate based on the minimum wage, and deducted from plaintiffs overtime wages the partial compensation. As a result of the district court\u2019s approach, plaintiff argues that he is owed an additional $6,804.85 in wages and $6,804.85 in liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-17\">There was a trial below and testimony about the parties\u2019 intent. Yet the plaintiff argues that \u201cit is indisputable that the district court was itself <em>deeming </em>the Plaintiffs hourly wage to be the minimum wage of $5.15 as <em>a matter of law, </em>rather than finding that this wage somehow represented the intent of the parties.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-18\">We disagree. The district court found that \u201cthe twice monthly payments were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>intended </em>to cover all hours worked, including regular hours and overtime.\u201d (emphasis added). It further found that \u201cthe raises were <em>intended </em>to compensate plaintiffs for overtime hours worked.\u201d (emphasis added). Plaintiffs efforts to transform this into a legal question are inconsistent with the record. We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, which plaintiff does not even attempt to show. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-12\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
