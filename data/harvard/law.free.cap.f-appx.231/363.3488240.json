Both Falcetta and appellee David K. Chapman are residents of Texas; consequently, diversity jurisdiction does not exist. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332; <em>Getty Oil Corp. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>841 F.2d 1254, 1258-59 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Falcetta conclusionally asserts that his claim presents a federal question. However, his allegations of \u201clegal malpractice\u201d demonstrate that his claim is for negligence, which does not give rise to a claim under federal or constitutional law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was not error. This appeal is without arguable merit, is frivolous, and is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The dismissal of the instant appeal counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Falcetta is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will be barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
