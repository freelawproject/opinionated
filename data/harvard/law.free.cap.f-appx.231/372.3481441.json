Pena-Lopez first argues that the district court erred in assessing a 16-level \u201ccrime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>of violence\u201d enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 based on his prior felony conviction for sexual assault of a child under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.011(a)(2). According to Pena-Lopez, such an offense does not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). As Pena-Lopez concedes, we review this argument for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 310 (5th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The district court committed no error, plain or otherwise. A violation of \u00a7 22.011(a)(2) \u201cmeet[s] a common-sense as well as a generic, contemporary definition of statutory rape.\u201d <em>United States v. Alvarado-Hernandez, </em>465 F.3d 188, 189-90 (5th Cir.2006). It is thus the equivalent of an enumerated offense that triggers the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Pena-Lopez also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Pena-Lopez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
