Kafu seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and granting summary judgment in favor of defendant on his claims of religious and gender discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (2000). We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-21\">Under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), a notice of appeal must be filed within thirty days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered. The district court\u2019s order dismissing Kafu\u2019s claims was entered by the district court on February 7, 2007. Kafu did not file his notice of appeal until March 13, 2007. Accordingly, we find Kafu\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s February 7, 2007 order is untimely, and dismiss the appeal as to that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-22\">Because the district court\u2019s order denying his motions to amend and suppress was entered on February 12, 2007, we find Kafu\u2019s notice of appeal was timely as to that order. We nonetheless affirm that order for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Kafu v. Kelly Servs., </em>No. 3:04-cv-23360-CMC (D.S.C. Feb. 12, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-23\">Accordingly, we dismiss in part and affirm in part. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
