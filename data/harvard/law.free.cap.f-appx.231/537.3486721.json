The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him within the advisory Guidelines range to 51 months in prison and 3 years of supervised release. Perry challenges that sentence on appeal. His counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has moved to withdraw, and Perry has filed a pro se supplemental brief. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">First, the district court\u2019s discretionary denial of Perry\u2019s downward-departure motion is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Morell, </em>429 F.3d 1161, 1164 (8th Cir.2005). Also, Perry has not overcome the appellate presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his sentence by showing that the court committed a clear error of judgment in determining that a within-Guidelines-range sentence was appropriate despite his poor health. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1003-04 (8th Cir. 2005). Next, the district court was entitled to engage in judicial fact-finding within an advisory Guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Fazio, </em>487 F.3d 646, 657 (8th Cir.2007). Last, Perry has not made a substantial threshold showing that the government acted unconstitutionally or in bad faith by not filing a substantial-assistance downward-departure motion. <em>See United States v. Marks, </em>244 F.3d 971, 976 (8th Cir.2001). After reviewing the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we conclude that there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-13\">. The Honorable Ortrie D.
