His wife testified that she knew of Robert\u2019s plans to file for bankruptcy but wanted no part of it. The record reflects that Robert Meredith is a sophisticated businessman. He was earning $15,000 per month at the time of his filing, and he has previously filed for bankruptcy protection in several of his past business ventures. From this, the bankruptcy court inferred that Meredith intended to conceal assets and denied discharge. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A); <em>see also Cadle v. Pratt, </em>411 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>F.3d 561, 565 (5th Cir.2005). The district court also denied discharge on the ground that Meredith refused to obey an order of the court, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 727(a)(6)(A), and on the ground that he concealed or failed to preserve records from which his financial conditions might be ascertained. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 727(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Meredith argues that it is irrational to risk so much in order to protect so little, explaining that the community property is \u201cof little cumulative value, and dwarfed by the debt to be discharged in the case.\u201d Love is an irrational commitment. The bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion that Meredith intentionally concealed assents in order to protect his wife is supported by the record, particularly by her testimony. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
