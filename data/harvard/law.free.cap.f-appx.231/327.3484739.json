We affirm the district court\u2019s order and judgment for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">Anne Joseph filed an application for disability insurance benefits on April 11, 2001. In the application, Joseph alleged that she began having back, neck, and shoulder problems on October 12, 1999, following an automobile accident. Joseph further alleged that she had been unable to work since March 24, 2000, after a series of surgeries to address the accident-related injuries. Joseph\u2019s application for disability insurance benefits was denied initially and denied again upon reconsideration. Joseph then requested and was granted a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-16\">On September 27, 2002, a hearing took place before an ALJ to adjudicate whether Joseph qualified for disability insurance benefits. At the hearing, Joseph testified and presented medical evidence. The ALJ, after considering the testimony and reviewing the extensive medical record, concluded that Joseph was indeed disabled beginning March 24, 2000, \u201cdue to symptoms commensurate with surgical recovery.\u201d However, the ALJ also found that subsequent to June 12, 2001, Joseph experienced a medical improvement related to her ability to work, and thus was no longer disabled. Therefore, the ALJ rendered a partially favorable decision to Joseph, granting a \u201cclosed period of disability\u201d and conferring disability insurance benefits for the period commencing March 24, 2000, and ending June 12, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-17\">Joseph appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Appeals Council, contending that her disability had not ended in June 2001 but rather was ongoing. The Appeals Council found no basis for modifying the decision. Following the decision by the Appeals Council, Joseph filed suit in district court. The district court, after referring the matter to a magistrate for recommendation, concluded that Joseph\u2019s complaint contained no merit. The district court dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>missed the suit and granted judgment to the Commissioner. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">This court has jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions of United States district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Appellate review of decisions by the Commissioner of Social Security is limited to two inquiries: (1) whether the proper legal standard was applied; and (2) whether substantial evidence supports the decision. <em>Waters v. Barnhart, </em>276 F.3d 716, 718 (5th Cir .2002) (citing <em>Estate of Morris v. Shalala, </em>207 F.3d 744, 745 (5th Cir.2000)). Substantial evidence requires \u201cmore than a mere scintilla\u201d of evidence. <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 889, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (quoting <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). Substantial evidence \u201cmeans such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This court may not re-weigh the evidence in the record or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner. <em>Harris v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 413, 417 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Joseph raises a single point of error on appeal: that substantial evidence did not support the ALJ\u2019s finding of non-disability as of June 12, 2001. Thus, we consider whether substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Joseph was no longer entitled to disability benefits on the termination date selected by the ALJ. <em>See Waters, </em>276 F.3d at 718 (approving appellate review of substantial evidence in Social Security disability cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">A. Termination of Benefits Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">When an ALJ grants disability insurance benefits to an applicant for a closed period of disability, two decision-making processes occur. <em>See Waters, </em>276 F.3d at 719 (describing the differences between a \u201ctypical disability case\u201d and a \u201cclosed period case\u201d). First, the ALJ finds the applicant disabled and grants benefits. <em>See id. </em>Second, the ALJ engages in the termination decision-making process to find that the disability ended at some date prior to the hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">Under this latter process, disability benefits may be terminated if there is substantial evidence demonstrating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-13\">(A) there has been any medical improvement in the individual\u2019s impairment or combination of impairments (other than medical improvement which is not related to the individual\u2019s ability to work), and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-14\">(B) the individual is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(f)(1). The burden rests on the government \u201cto show that the claimant\u2019s disability has ended as of the cessation date.\u201d <em>Waters, </em>276 F.3d at 717. Consequently, benefits may be terminated if the Commissioner proves (1) that there has been a medical improvement related to the ability to work and (2) that the beneficiary can engage in substantial gainful activity. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(f); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1594(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-16\">The Social Security implementing regulations define a medical improvement as a \u201cdecrease in the medical severity of [the] impairment(s) which was present at the time of the most recent favorable medical decision\u201d of disability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1594(b)(1). The determination of \u201ca decrease in medical severity must be based on changes (improvement) in the symptoms, signs and/or laboratory findings associated with [the] impairment(s).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, a medical improvement is related to the ability to do work if the im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>provement creates an \u201cincrease in [the] functional capacity to do basic work activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1594(b)(3). Finally, this court defines substantial gainful activity as \u201cwork activity involving significant physical or mental abilities for pay or profit.\u201d <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). The ability to engage in substantial gainful activity is determined through an \u201cobjective assessment of [the] functional capacity to do basic work activities\u201d and a consideration of vocational factors. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1594(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">B. Substantial Evidence Supports a Finding of Medical Improvement Related to the Ability to do Work</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In the instant case, the ALJ found that Joseph experienced a medical improvement related to her ability to do work as of June 12, 2001. In particular, the ALJ found that the \u201cmedical record documents good recovery from surgery and improvement in both shoulder and neck symptoms, without evidence of neurological deficits.\u201d Additionally, the ALJ found that the medical record contained no objective evidence subsequent to June 12, 2001, substantiating \u201crecurrent or worsening symptoms.\u201d The ALJ concluded that Joseph had regained the capacity to perform light work, subject to certain restrictions, as of the benefits termination date.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">A review of the medical record reveals that the ALJ\u2019s assessment was apparently based on a surgery follow-up note dated June 12, 2001, written by Dr. Wilkinson, the physician who performed surgery on Joseph in March and June of 2000. In the note, Dr. Wilkinson states that Joseph is \u201cdoing well\u201d and describes her range of movement as \u201csurprisingly good.\u201d Dr. Wilkinson further explains that Joseph can engage in \u201calmost normal activity.\u201d However, the note also cautions about repetitive movements, especially with respect to lifting motions. From this follow-up note, the ALJ concluded that a medical improvement had occurred and that Joseph could return to work subject to the restrictions described by Dr. Wilkinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">First, we agree with Joseph\u2019s contention that Dr. Wilkinson\u2019s use of the phrase \u201c[i]n general she is doing well\u201d does not constitute evidence of an improvement in symptoms or signs. This is because Dr. Wilkinson used identical or equivalent language in follow-up notes written during the period of disability identified by the ALJ. In fact, Dr. Wilkinson apparently began every follow-up note with a generic statement that Joseph was doing \u201cwell\u201d or \u201cbetter.\u201d In light of the fact that the same phrase appeared in the last follow-up note written during the period of disability, the language shows at best a continuation of the same signs or symptoms, not an improvement as required under the implementing regulations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1594(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Other language appearing in the June 12, 2001 follow-up note, however, provides more than a scintilla of evidence in support of a medical improvement related to the ability to do work. As a whole, the followup note documents the considerable extent of recovery by Joseph and could reasonably be taken as evidence of a medical improvement. Dr. Wilkinson describes Joseph as having a \u201csurprisingly good\u201d range of movement and engaging in \u201calmost normal activity.\u201d Such openly positive language does not appear in prior follow-up notes written by Dr. Wilkinson and represents a departure from the more cautious statements in previous evaluations. A reasonable mind could accept the description of Joseph\u2019s range of motion and activity level as depicting improvements in the signs or symptoms associated with a surgical recovery. Moreover, Dr. Wilkinson\u2019s evaluation, especially of Joseph\u2019s ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>do near normal activity, could reasonably indicate an improvement in Joseph\u2019s capacity to perform light work. Therefore, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that Joseph experienced a medical improvement related to her ability to work as of June 12,2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Notwithstanding the follow-up note, Joseph contends that a prescription note written by Dr. Wilkinson directing Joseph to remain off work conclusively shows that she was still disabled. The prescription, also written on June 12, 2001, reads: \u201c[c]ontinue off work status pending next appt. on 10-9-01 9am.\u201d First, as correctly noted by the Commissioner, this evidence was not before the ALJ at the time the ALJ rendered its decision. Nonetheless, even if the prescription note had been before the ALJ, under this court\u2019s precedent Dr. Wilkinson\u2019s opinion on Joseph\u2019s ability to work would not have been entitled to any special weight. <em>See Frank v. Barnhart, </em>326 F.3d 618, 620 (5th Cir.2003); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e)(3). A treating physician\u2019s <em>medical opinion </em>is entitled to special weight, but the determination of any <em>legal </em>conclusions (such as the ability to work) are reserved to the Commissioner. <em>Frank, </em>326 F.3d at 620; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e)(1). The presence of this particular prescription note does not diminish the substantial evidence supporting a finding of non-disability, nor is this prescription note determinative in the <em>ALJ\u2019s </em>disability inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">C. Substantial Evidence Supports a Finding of the Ability to Engage in Substantial Gainful Employment</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Finally, the ALJ found that Joseph could engage in substantial gainful employment because she could return to her past relevant work as a Chinese linguist. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1594(f)(7) (\u201c[The Commissioner will] consider whether you can still do work you have done in the past. If you can do such work, disability will be found to have ended.\u201d). At the hearing before the ALJ, Joseph\u2019s employment record established that she had previously worked as a Chinese linguist. Joseph\u2019s linguistic work qualified as \u201cpast relevant work\u201d under the applicable regulatory definition. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1560(b)(1). A vocational expert testified that the restrictions recommended by Dr. Wilkinson did not preclude Joseph from working as a Chinese linguist. Based on this testimony, the ALJ concluded that Joseph possessed sufficient residual functional capacity to undertake light or sedentary work, including past relevant work as a Chinese linguist. We find no error in the ALJ\u2019s reasoning and agree that substantial evidence supports the finding that Joseph could engage in substantial gainful employment as of June 12, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">We hold that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Joseph was no longer disabled as of June 12, 2001. The district court\u2019s order and judgment are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
