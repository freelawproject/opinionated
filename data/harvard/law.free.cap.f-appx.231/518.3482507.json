Davis (Davis) appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentence of 108 months\u2019 imprisonment after the court granted the government\u2019s Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b) motion to reduce Davis\u2019s sentence for his post-sentencing substantial assistance. Davis\u2019s counsel filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), seeking permission to withdraw and arguing Davis\u2019s extensive cooperation warranted a greater reduction. Counsel\u2019s argument is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Coppedge, </em>135 F.3d 598, 599 (8th Cir.1998) (per curiam) (holding a challenge to the extent of a sentence reduction upon the government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion was unreviewable because the appeal was not based on any criteria listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)); <em>United States v. Haskins, </em>479 F.3d 955, 957 (8th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (concluding the court lacks jurisdiction to consider the reasonableness of a sentence following a Rule 35(b) reduction; <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), did not expand \u00a7 3742(a) to include appellate review of discretionary sentencing reductions).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. We affirm, and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-12\">. The Honorable Joseph F. Bataillon, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
