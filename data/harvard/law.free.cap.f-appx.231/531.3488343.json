Henderson pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) by possessing a firearm after having incurred convictions for three specified felonies in Missouri state courts. His base offense level was set at 24 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) because his offense followed at least two felony convictions for crimes of violence, one of which was identified in the presentence report as Tampering First Degree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Henderson to 77 months in prison. On appeal, he challenges the base offense level of 24, arguing that first-degree tampering under Missouri law is not a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Henderson\u2019s argument is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>417 F.3d 990, 999 (8th Cir.2005) (holding that risks associated with Missouri offense of tampering by operation \u201care sufficient to warrant classifying it as a violent felony\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 285, 166 L.Ed.2d 218 (2006); <em>United States v. Sprouse, </em>394 F.3d 578, 580 (8th Cir.2005) (because Guidelines definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is identical to statutory definition of \u201cviolent felony,\u201d same analysis applies); <em>United States v. Leathers, </em>354 F.3d 955, 959 (8th Cir.2004) (one panel cannot overrule decision of another).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Regardless, the tampering conviction aside, Henderson admitted in his plea agreement that he had prior convictions for attempted robbery and unlawful use of a weapon, which we note qualified him for a base offense level of 24 under section 2K2.1(a)(2). <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>462 F.3d 899, 901 (8th Cir.2006) (unlawful use of weapon is crime of violence), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1500, 167 L.Ed.2d 239 (2007); <em>United States v. Bacon, </em>94 F.3d 158, 161 &amp; n.2 (4th Cir.1996) (defendant\u2019s attempted-robbery conviction was crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, comment. (n.l)).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-11\">. The Honorable Catherine D. Perry, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
