Second, Chen challenges the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding as to his assertion that he currently is a practitioner of Falun Gong. He argues that the BIA failed to discredit his evidence of membership with specific and cogent reasons, relying instead on its adverse credibility finding related to his arrest in China.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-18\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA found that the IJ did not clearly err, but it also made additional findings and found that discrepancies in Chen\u2019s account of his travel through Japan were not directly relevant to his asylum petition. Therefore, we review the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>The Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if an alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. In order to carry this burden, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (internal quotations and citations omitted). The substantial evidence test is deferential and does not allow \u201creweigh[ing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). \u201cCredibility determinations likewise are reviewed under the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). A credibility determination may not be overturned unless the record compels it. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201c[A]n adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application\u201d when there is no other evidence of persecution. <em>Id. </em>However, an adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the BIA\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by the asylum applicant. <em>Id. </em>The \u201cIJ [or BIA] must still consider all evidence introduced by the applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The record demonstrates that Chen had the opportunity at his hearing to clarify any inconsistencies in previous sworn documents and to develop further his arguments for eligibility for asylum. However, he did not fully develop his arguments for eligibility for asylum. The inconsistencies surrounding his accounts of his arrest and membership in Falun Gong support the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-15\">. Chen has abandoned his claims for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. Chen states, in part, that he is appealing the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of those claims and includes law relating to withholding of removal and the CAT, but he does not argue how he met the higher standard of proof required by withholding of removal, why he was entitled to relief under the CAT, or how the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision denying his request for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. Because he does not present arguments for his claims of withholding of removal and relief under the CAT, we hold that Chen has abandoned them. <em>See Rowe v. Schreiber, </em>139 F.3d 1381, 1382 n. 1 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that issues not argued on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
