We have reviewed the record and the briefs filed by the parties and we affirm the dismissal order substantially on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Byrd v. Johnson, </em>No. 8:05-cv-02389-AW (D.Md. Apr. 7, 2006). However, we note that, contrary to the district court\u2019s conclusion, the issue of the appointment of the Chapter 11 trustee had not been decided in Ralph Byrd\u2019s pri- or appeal; rather, the district court dismissed the prior appeal as moot, with the understanding that Byrd\u2019s challenge to the propriety of the trustee\u2019s appointment would be presented to the bankruptcy court in the context of whether fees should be awarded. We agree, however, with the district court\u2019s dismissal of this portion of the appeal, on the modified basis that it is interlocutory, rather than based on res judicata. <em>See In Re: Computer Learning Ctrs., Inc., </em>407 F.3d 656, 660 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>In Re: Boddy, </em>950 F.2d 334, 336 (6th Cir.1991)). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
