Wood pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, and he was sentenced based on the determination in the presentence report that the offense involved 15 kilograms of cocaine base. Wood argues that Amendment 591 dictates that he must be resentenced because his indictment did not charge him with 15 kilograms of cocaine base and he did not admit to this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-21\">Wood\u2019s argument is without merit. Amendment 591 applies to the determination of the appropriate Chapter Two offense guideline section, and Wood was properly sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, the appropriate offense guideline section for his conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Amendment 591 is irrelevant to the determination of base (or specific) offense levels within the applicable offense guideline section or to any consideration of relevant conduct. U.S.S.G. App. C, Amendment 591 (Nov.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-22\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance in lieu of filing a brief is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
