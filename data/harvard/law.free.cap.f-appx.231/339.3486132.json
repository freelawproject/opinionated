Wang was sentenced to 100 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Wang argues that the imposed sentence was unreasonable because (1) there was an unwarranted disparity between his sentence and his codefendant\u2019s sentence, (2) his sentence failed to reflect his rehabilitative progress following his original sentencing, and (3) his sentence should have been lower in light of the weak evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-19\">Wang correctly concedes that his first argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Duhon, </em>440 F.3d 711, 720 (5th Cir.2006). His remaining arguments fail to show that his sentence was unreasonable, especially in light of the great deference accorded under <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-20 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 828, 126 S.Ct. 43,163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-20\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
