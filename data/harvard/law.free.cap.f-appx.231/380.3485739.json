Clark, federal prisoner # 57808-080, appeals the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging his 1994 guilty-plea conviction of bank robbery and his 204-month prison sentence. Clark contends that his sentence was unconstitutional in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and that he should be permitted to assert his <em>Booker </em>claim in a \u00a7 2241 proceeding under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Because <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>are not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review, Clark cannot show that he should be permitted to assert his claims under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005); <em>ReyesRequena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-21\">Clark\u2019s most recent \u00a7 2241 petition is only his latest of several frivolous attempts to circumvent the statutory limitations on filing successive \u00a7 2255 motions. Clark is hereby warned that future frivolous filings in this court or in the district court will invite the imposition of sanctions, including monetary penalties and restrictions on his ability to file actions and appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-22\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
