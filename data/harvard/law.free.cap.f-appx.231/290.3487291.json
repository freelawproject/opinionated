The district court sentenced Baker to 336 months in prison, three years of supervised release upon his release from prison, and ordered Baker to pay $6,271,791.14 in restitution. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-22\">Counsel for Baker has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that he has found no meritorious issues for appeal, but stating that Baker wishes to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence brought against him at trial, and the reasonableness of his sentence with respect to the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) and in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Baker was advised of his right to file a pro se <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>supplemental brief but has not done so. The Government declined to file a responding brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">A review of the record reveals the Government produced ample evidence from which a reasonable finder of fact could conclude Baker\u2019s guilt of the crimes with which he was charged. Additionally, we find Baker\u2019s sentence is reasonable because a sentence imposed \u201cwithin the properly calculated Guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable,\u201d and there is no evidence to rebut the presumption in this case. <em>United States v. Green, </em>486 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). The district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, considered the guidelines range, and weighed all of the relevant factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Therefore, we find Baker\u2019s sentence as ordered by the district court is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for review. We therefore affirm Baker\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client in writing of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may renew in this court his motion for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
