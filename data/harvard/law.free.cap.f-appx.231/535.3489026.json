The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Holmes to mandatory consecutive prison terms of 240 months, the statutory minimum, on the drug conviction and 60 months, the statutory minimum, on the firearm conviction; he was sentenced to concurrent supervised-release terms of ten years and three years, respectively. On appeal, Holmes\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising issues under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), and with regard to the admission of evidence. Holmes has submitted letters to this court which raise issues related to those already raised by his counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Concerning the <em>Batson </em>claim, the district court correctly denied Holmes\u2019s challenge to the government\u2019s use of peremptory strikes against three venire persons. <em>See United States v. Pherigo, </em>327 F.3d 690, 695 (8th Cir.2003) (clear error standard of review). On appeal, Holmes specifically challenges the use of the peremptory strike against a certain black venire woman. However, the government presented a race-neutral reason for the strike and had also used its peremptory strikes against similarly-situated white venire persons. Holmes failed to show that this proffered explanation was pretext for discrimination. <em>See United States v. Maxwell, </em>473 F.3d 868, 871 (8th Cir.2007) (explaining the process and burdens in presenting a <em>Batson </em>challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Holmes\u2019s motions in limine to exclude the introduction of a prior drug conviction or his 2003 tax returns. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>428 F.3d 1165, 1171 (8th Cir.2005) (abuse of discretion standard of review); <em>United States v. Molina, </em>172 F.3d 1048, 1054-55 (8th Cir.1999) (upholding admission of trafficking and possession convictions from ten years prior to offense charged to refute defendant\u2019s assertion that she was innocent bystander in drug transactions); <em>United States v. Trotter, </em>889 F.2d 153, 155 (8th Cir.1989) (evidence that defendant failed to file tax return was probative of net worth and relevant to defendant\u2019s claim that money found with drugs was not product of drug distribution).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">After conducting a careful, independent review of the record, including the transcripts of the trial and the sentencing, in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>sues. Thus, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm. We deny appellant\u2019s second motion to supplement the record.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-11\">.
