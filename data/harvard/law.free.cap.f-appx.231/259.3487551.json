Green appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming a magistrate judge\u2019s revocation of Green\u2019s supervised release and imposition of a ten-month term of imprisonment. Counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no non-frivolous grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the magistrate judge abused its discretion in revoking Green\u2019s supervised release and whether the sentence imposed is plainly unreasonable. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-23\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in revoking Green\u2019s supervised release. We further find the sentence imposed by the magistrate judge, and affirmed by the district court, was not plainly unreasonable because it is below the statutory maximum sentence of one year and within the advisory guideline range of seven to thirteen months. <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4 (a) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-26\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
