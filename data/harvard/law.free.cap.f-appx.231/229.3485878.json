On appeal, Garcia-Flores asserts the district court erred in sentencing him under an unconstitutional mandatory guidelines scheme and failed to adequately explain its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) factors. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-22\">We find that the district court properly applied the federal sentencing guidelines and considered the relevant sentencing factors before imposing Garcia-Flores\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). Additionally, we find that the sentence imposed, which Garcia-Flores admits was within a properly calculated guidelines range, was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.) (holding a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Garcia-Flores\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
