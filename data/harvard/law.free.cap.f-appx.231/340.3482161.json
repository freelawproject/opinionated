Watkins argues that he was improperly sentenced based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>on a drug amount and type not specified in his indictment. He also argues that the district court improperly intimidated him into withdrawing this objection at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Addressing Watkins\u2019s claim of improper intimidation first, we conclude that he has not shown any improper intimidation by the district court. The district court correctly explained that by falsely denying his relevant conduct, Watkins was risking a finding that he had not fully accepted responsibility for his offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.l(a)) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Because the record demonstrates that Watkins voluntarily withdrew his objection to the determination of his relevant conduct, we conclude that he has waived this issue on appeal. Waived objections are unreviewable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Musquiz, </em>45 F.3d 927, 931-32 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
