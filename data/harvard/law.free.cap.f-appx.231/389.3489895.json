The IJ had determined that Guevarra was statutorily eligible for relief under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 (NACARA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l), but exercised discretion and denied Guevarra relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-22\">Guevarra argues that the IJ lacked statutory authority to exercise discretion and committed \u201cfundamental error\u201d by failing to determine whether Guevarra had previously been granted asylum. But, Guevarra did not present these claims to the BIA, which has adequate mechanisms to address the errors alleged. As such, Guevarra\u2019s claims are unexhausted, so we lack jurisdiction to review them. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>see Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-453 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 389-90 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-23\">Guevarra also challenges the IJ\u2019s discretionary denial of relief. We have has no jurisdiction \u201cto review ... any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1229(b).\u201d \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). Notwithstanding Guevarra\u2019s attempt to circumvent this jurisdictional bar pursuant to \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) by characterizing his claims as questions of law, we lack jurisdiction to hear his claims. <em>See Andrade v. Gonzales, </em>459 F.3d 538, 542 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 216 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-24\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
