After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-25\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b914-26\">Defendant Cruz-Natal pled guilty to defrauding the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cDHHS\u201d) by submitting false claims to Medicare for medical equipment on behalf of unknowing beneficiaries and receiving reimbursements from Medicare for the cost of the medical equipment. At Cruz-Natal\u2019s initial sentencing, the district court imposed a 72-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>In a prior appeal, this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s guidelines calculations except the application of a special-skill enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.8. Accordingly, the Court vacated Cruz-Natal\u2019s 72-month sentence and remanded with directions for the district court to consider the corrected advisory guidelines range of 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and to impose a reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">At resentencing, the district court heard argument from the parties as to what a reasonable sentence would be. The government requested a sentence within the advisory guidelines range. Cruz-Natal asked to be sentenced to time served because she had \u201clearned her lesson\u201d and needed to begin working to pay the court-ordered restitution. In the alternative, Cruz-Natal asked for a 57-month sentence, at the low end of the advisory guidelines range. Cruz-Natal addressed the district court directly, stating her remorse and that she would never break any law again. Cruz-Natal asked to be released so she could begin working and repay the money she owed. She also asked the district court to take into consideration that her elderly mother was sickly and \u201cneeds [her] very badly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The district court stated that it had considered the parties\u2019 statements, the presentence investigation report and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court also stated that, while it had sympathy for Cruz-Natal\u2019s circumstances, it believed that a guidelines-range sentence was appropriate \u201cgiven the crime that was committed and the criminal history of the defendant and the need to protect the public from other crimes.\u201d The district court sentenced Cruz-Natal to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered restitution in the amount of $1,081,714.41. Cruz-Natal filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">On appeal, Cruz-Natal argues that her sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider sufficiently her argument in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a sentence for reasonableness in light of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). We have concluded that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, an indication that the district court has considered a defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is sufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">We review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245-46 (11th Cir. 2005). This \u201c[r]eview for reasonableness is deferential .... and when the district court imposes a sentence within the advi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>sory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Here, Natal-Cruz has failed to show that her sentence is unreasonable. Contrary to Natal-Cruz\u2019s assertion, the district court acknowledged and explicitly considered Natal-Cruz\u2019s arguments in mitigation, stating that it sympathized with Natal-Cruz\u2019s circumstances. The district court also considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, noting specifically Natal Cruz\u2019s criminal history, the nature and circumstances of her offense and the need to protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(C). On the record before us, we cannot say that Natal-Cruz\u2019s 60-month sentence, near the low end of the advisory guidelines range, is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-8\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed [treatment]; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range ... ;(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apl9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
