Harris fails to show that the district court erred when it rejected his claim that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated when he was ordered to work with an axe in the rain. See <em>Jackson v. Cain, </em>864 F.2d 1235, 1246 (5th Cir.1989). He also fails to show that medical treatment was delayed in violation of the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Vamado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). The district court\u2019s dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">This court\u2019s affirmance of the district court\u2019s dismissal of Harris\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Harris is warned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
