The district court determined at sentencing that Medley\u2019s offense involved at least $70,000 in actual loss, but not more than $120,000, and pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 2B1.1 (b)(1)(E) (2005), increased the base offense level of seven, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 2B1.1 (a)(1), by eight levels to fifteen. Because of an intervening arrest between the time of the guilty plea and the sentencing hearing, Medley did not receive an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Medley\u2019s prior criminal conduct yielded a criminal history category of IV. The total offense level of fifteen and criminal history category of IV resulted in a sentencing range of thirty to thirty-seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">The district court sentenced Medley to thirty-seven months in prison, and ordered restitution in the total amount of $142,780.15. On appeal, Medley raises two issues relating to the district court\u2019s calculation of loss. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">The district court\u2019s finding at sentencing as to the amount of loss suffered by a victim is a finding of fact reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217-18 (4th Cir.1989). The government has the burden to establish the \u201camount of loss\u201d by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>882 F.2d, 902, 907 (4th Cir.1989). Under USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, comment., n. 3(A)(1) (2005), \u201cactual loss\u201d is defined as \u201cthe reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\u201d \u201c[R]easonably foreseeable pecuniary harm\u201d is defined as pecuniary harm that the defendant knew or, under the circumstances, reasonably should have known, was a \u201cpotential result of the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, comment., n. 3(A)(iv). \u201cActual loss\u201d may be reduced by \u201cthe amount the victim has recovered at the time of sentencing from disposition of the collateral.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, comment., n. 3(E)(ii). Finally, a sentencing court \u201cneed only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,\u201d given the \u201cavailable information.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, comment., n. 3(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">Medley first argues that \u201camount recovered\u201d under USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, comment., n. 3(E)(ii) could mean the gross sale price of the collateral, or the net sale price taking into account some, but not all, of the settlement charges the victim payed to effect the sale. Specifically, Medley asserts that property management charges and the real estate commission paid by the mortgage company should not have been considered in calculating the amount of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Medley\u2019s argument is without merit. Medley was loaned $426,000. In order to mitigate the loss, the mortgage company sold the collateral. We find the court did not clearly err by finding it was reasonably foreseeable that the mortgage company would incur property management fees and a real estate commission in order to sell the collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Second, Medley argues the Government failed to prove the fees paid to the realtor and management company were reasonable and necessary. We find that Medley\u2019s arguments are conclusory and without merit, as the district court\u2019s findings were based on adequate and rehable evidence submitted by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
