In his petition, Williams asserts the district court erred in ordering restitution without considering Williams\u2019 and his codefendants\u2019 abilities to pay and without specifying for which portion of the restitution amount each codefendant was responsible. The district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Williams\u2019 petition for lack of jurisdiction, reasoning that Williams had failed to show he could bring his restitution challenge in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">A motion to vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence under \u00a7 2255 is the typical vehicle for challenging the constitutional validity of a federally imposed conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 629 (11th Cir.1990). Generally, such challenges can be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition only if they satisfy the savings clause in \u00a7 2255, which requires a prisoner to show that \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 5; <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Dohrmann, </em>however, we implied that a federal prisoner could challenge the restitution portion of his conviction and sentence in a \u00a7 2241 petition even when he had not satisfied \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause. <em>See </em>442 F.3d at 1280-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">In light of <em>Dohrmann, </em>the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of Williams\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction was arguably erroneous. <em>See </em>442 F.3d at 1280-81. However, we can affirm the district court\u2019s decision on any ground supported by the record. <em>See Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1351 (11th Cir.2004). Here, the record demonstrates that Williams\u2019 restitution challenge is without merit. Specifically, Williams argues the district court erred (1) in failing to consider his and his codefendants\u2019 ability to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>restitution and (2) in failing to specify the amount of restitution for which each codefendant was responsible. Because Williams\u2019 offenses involved crimes against property codified in Title 18, however, the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA) required the district court to order restitution in the full amount of the loss and precluded the district court from considering Williams\u2019 and his codefendants\u2019 ability to pay. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663A(a)(1); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>289 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th Cir.2002) (holding the MVRA divests the sentencing court of \u201cany discretion to contemplate the defendant\u2019s financial situation in making such order\u201d). Furthermore, the district court had discretion to order Williams and his codefendants to pay the restitution amount jointly and severally. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(h). Thus, Williams\u2019 challenges to the restitution order fail. Accordingly, we construe the district court\u2019s dismissal as a denial of Williams\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition and affirm. <em>See Cani v. United States, </em>331 F.3d 1210, 1216 (11th Cir.2003) (construing a district court\u2019s dismissal as a denial and affirming the district court\u2019s order); <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000) (reviewing the availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 <em>de novo).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-9\">. After the district court dismissed Williams' \u00a7 2241 petition, he submitted a motion for reconsideration attempting to show why \u00a7 2255 relief was inadequate or ineffective, which the district court summarily denied. In his notice of appeal, Williams designated both the underlying dismissal and the denial of his motion for reconsideration. On appeal, however, Williams failed to discuss the denial of his motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, he has abandoned that appeal and we do not address it. See <em>Marek v. Singletary, </em>62 F.3d 1295, 1298 n. 2 (11th Cir.1995) (holding \"[\u00a1Issues not clearly raised in the briefs are considered abandoned\"). Likewise, although Williams also raised a fine challenge and an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim in his \u00a7 2241 petition, he failed to address those issues on appeal, such that he has abandoned them and we do not address them. <em>See id. </em>Finally, on appeal, Williams discussed two arguments, based on the Double Jeopardy and Equal Protection Clauses, not discussed in his \u00a7 2241 petition. Because he raised these arguments for the first time on appeal, he has waived them and we do not address them. <em>Dohrmann v. United States, </em>442 F.3d 1279, 1282 (11th Cir.2006) (refusing to address an argument raised for the first time in a federal prisoner\u2019s appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b966-14\">.
