We dismiss in part and deny in part his petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Atsiz first contends the BIA\u2019s seven-sentence affirmance of the Immigration Judge (IJ) decision violates his constitutional rights to due process, including meaningful review and an individualized determination. \u201cTo demonstrate a violation of due process, an alien must demonstrate both a fundamental procedural error and that the error resulted in prejudice.\u201d <em>Lopez v. Heinauer, </em>882 F.3d 507, 512 (8th Cir.2003). \u201cAn alien has no constitutional or statutory right to an administrative appeal. Any rights to an administrative appeal are created by regulations issued by the Attorney General, and under the regulations, aliens have no right to a full opinion by the BIA\u201d <em>Loulou v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 706, 708 (8th Cir.2003); <em>see also Ngure v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 975, 981 (8th Cir.2004) (\u201cAs a matter of constitutional law, the alien is entitled only to a reasoned decision from the <em>agency, </em>not from a particular component of the agency.\u201d). Atsiz\u2019s due process claim fails because Atsiz does not contend the IJ decision deprived him of due process, and we find the BIA effectively adopted the IJ\u2019s findings, which we review as part of the final agency decision. <em>See Gemechu v. Ashcroft, </em>387 F.3d 944, 947 (8th Cir.2004) (\u201cTo the extent that the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s findings, we review those IJ findings as part of the final agency decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">Atsiz next contends the IJ improperly required him to prove he would be tortured <em>because of </em>his ethnicity or religion, something not required for deferral of removal under CAT. <em>See Matter of S-V-, 22 </em>I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 1306, 1311 (B.I.A.2000) (en banc) (noting the respondent in a CAT proceeding \u201cis not required to demonstrate that he or she would be tortured on account of a particular belief or immutable characteristic.\u201d) Atsiz raised this challenge in his first appeal to the BIA. The BIA remanded the matter after finding the IJ improperly discredited Atsiz\u2019s testimony, stating, \u201cIn light of our clear error finding, we find it appropriate to remand this case for further consideration of whether the respondent proved it more likely than not he will be tortured if returned to Turkey.\u201d J.A. at 81. When the IJ again denied deferral of removal under CAT on remand, Atsiz appealed to the BIA but did not challenge the legal standard applied by the IJ on remand in either the two-page explication of the issues challenged in the notice of appeal, <em>id. </em>at 34-35, or in his fifteen-page brief. <em>Id. </em>at 5-19. As a consequence, we are without jurisdiction to review this challenge. <em>Sultani v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 878, 884 (8th Cir.2006) (\u201cFailure to raise an issue before the [BIA] constitutes a failure to exhaust administrative remedies and deprives this court of jurisdiction to hear the matter.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">Finally, Atsiz argues the IJ failed to consider all the evidence presented and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>failed to consider the cumulative probability of torture in violation of applicable regulations and case law. We lack jurisdiction to review these challenges because \u201cwe do not have jurisdiction to review a final order against an alien who was found removable for having committed an \u2018aggravated felony,\u2019 with the exception of \u2018constitutional claims or questions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Xiong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 530, 534 (8th Cir.2007) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)). Atsiz contends <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam), supports his view we have jurisdiction over these challenges. The <em>Ramadan </em>court determined \u201cquestions of law\u201d include \u201cthe application of statutes and regulations to undisputed historical facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654. While not controlling law, Atsiz urges we adopt the reasoning in <em>Ramadan </em>and reach the merits of his attacks on the IJ\u2019s decision. But Atsiz \u201ccannot ... secure review by using the rhetoric of a \u2018constitutional claim\u2019 or \u2018question of law to disguise what is essentially a quarrel about fact-finding.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 330 (2d Cir.2006). At bottom, Atsiz disagrees with the IJ\u2019s interpretation and use of and weight given his testimony, his expert\u2019s testimony, and condition reports for similarly situated persons in Turkey. These are factual determinations over which we have no jurisdiction. <em>See Hanan v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 834, 836-37 (8th Cir.2006) (holding court lacked jurisdiction over habeas claim brought by alien, inasmuch as claim came down to challenges to IJ\u2019s factual determination that it was not likely the current government of the removal country would seek to torture alien if he was returned and, thus, did not depend upon any constitutional issue or question of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Accordingly, we grant the motion to dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction except as to the due process challenge, which we deny.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
