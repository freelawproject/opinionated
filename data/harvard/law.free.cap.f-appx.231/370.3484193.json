Estrada\u2019s sentence was increased due to a prior conviction for the Florida felony of aggravated battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-18\">Estrada contends that his Florida conviction was not a crime of violence (COV) under the Sentencing Guidelines because the conviction could have resulted from mere contact with a weapon, without harm or the use of force. A \u201cconviction for aggravated battery under [this] specific subsection of Florida law qualifies as a COV because it has as an element at least a threatened use of force\u201d because touching with a weapon constitutes \u201ceither actual or threatened use of physical force.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez, </em>479 F.3d 345, 349 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-23\">Estrada also challenges, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-24\">Estrada\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Estrada properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-25\">The Government\u2019s motion to supplement the record is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
