We conclude that Robinson is not entitled to mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-24\">Mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief sought. <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). Further, mandamus is a drastic remedy and should only be used in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). Because this court does not have jurisdiction to grant mandamus relief against state officials, <em>Gurley v. Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, </em>411 F.2d 586, 587 (4th Cir.1969), the relief sought by Robinson is not available by way of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-25\">Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the petition for writ of mandamus, as supplemented. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-26\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
