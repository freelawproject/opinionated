On appeal, Manley argues that the district court (1) erred in calculating his advisory guidelines range; and (2) imposed an unreasonable sentence. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b897-14\">On May 6, 2005, Defendant Manley contacted an undercover FBI Cyber Crime/Innocent Images Task Force Agent (\u201cUCA\u201d) in an America Online chat room. The UCA was posing as a 33-year-old female with a 12-year-old daughter. Through a series of online chats, Manley expressed his desire to engage in sexual activity with both the UCA and her daughter and advised that the UCA also could have sex with Manley\u2019s 12-year-old son.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Manley sent the UCA multiple emails containing images of child pornography, including some images of Manley\u2019s son with his penis exposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-15\">Manley, who resided in Texas, arranged to meet the UCA and her daughter on May 20, 2005, at a restaurant near Atlanta, Georgia. Manley was arrested by FBI Agents at the restaurant without incident. A subsequent search of Manley\u2019s hotel room resulted in the seizure of several items, including a laptop computer, two \u201cthumb drives,\u201d and several items associated with sexual activity. It was later determined that Manley\u2019s laptop computer and one of the thumb drives contained a total of 401 images of child pornography, including some images of Manley\u2019s son.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">A federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment, charging Manley with (1) using a means of interstate commerce to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b); (2) transporting child pornography in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(l); and (3) distributing child pornography in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2)(A). Manley pled guilty without a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended a base offense level of 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(a). The PSI also recommended the following enhancements to Manley\u2019s base offense level: (1) 4 levels, pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(l)(A), because the offense involved a minor who had not attained the age of twelve years; (2) 2 levels, pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A), because the offense involved the commission of a sexual act or sexual contact; (3) 2 levels, pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3), because the offense involved distribution; (4) 4 levels, pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(4), because the offense involved material that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence; (5) 2 levels, pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(5), because Manley was the parent of a minor involved in the offense; and (6) 2 levels, pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(6)(B), because Manley used a computer to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct. After application of these various specific offense characteristics, Manley\u2019s adjusted offense level was 48. The PSI then recommended that Manley\u2019s offense level be (1) reduced by 3 levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, for acceptance of responsibility; and (2) enhanced by 5 levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.5(b), because Manley was considered a repeat and dangerous sex offender against minors under the Sentencing Guidelines. Accordingly, Manley\u2019s total offense level was 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The PSI also concluded that Manley had a total of 11 criminal history points, including 2 points for committing the instant offense while Manley was on parole, resulting in a criminal history category of V. With a total offense level of 50 and a criminal history category of V, Manley\u2019s advisory guidelines range was life imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the combined statutory maximum sentence for Manley\u2019s three counts of conviction was 70 years\u2019 imprisonment; thus Manley\u2019s advisory guidelines sentence also was 70 years, or 840 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">At sentencing, Manley raised several objections to the PSI. In relevant part, Manley objected to (1) the 4-level enhancement that was based on his offense involving images that portray sadistic or masochistic conduct; and (2) the 2-point increase to his criminal history score for committing the instant offense while on parole. The district court overruled these objections. In accordance with the PSI, the district court determined that Manley had a total offense level of 50, a criminal history category of V, and a maximum punishment of 70 years\u2019 or 840 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">Manley then raised the following matters for the district court\u2019s consideration in determining an appropriate sentence: (1) the conditions of Manley\u2019s pre-trial confinement, because he was kept in a United States Penitentiary as opposed to a local or regional jail, and therefore, subjected to harsher conditions than most pre-trial defendants; (2) the fact that Manley was 64 years old and that prison will be hard and have a \u201cmore significant impact\u201d on him because of his age; and (3) that Manley should be sent to a facility where he can get treatment instead of being placed in a traditional incarceration setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">In response, the government argued that Manley\u2019s statement of apology was \u201cdisingenuous,\u201d and that the statutory maximum sentence of 70 years\u2019 imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>ment was appropriate given the seriousness <em>of </em>the offense, the need <em>for </em>deterrence, and the need to protect society from further crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">In deciding what punishment to impose, the district court commented that Manley had a predisposition to certain urges that could not be healed adequately by mental health treatment and, given his age, did not appear to diminish with the passage of time. The district court stated, therefore, that \u201cincapacitation drives the sentence,\u201d and that \u201cManley can\u2019t be allowed out under conditions that he might present a threat to children.\u201d The district court noted, however, that \u201c[a]s a practical matter, any substantial sentence will amount to a life sentence,\u201d and that imposing an 840-month sentence would look like \u201cgrandstanding\u201d and could cast a bad light on the judicial system. Finally, the district court noted that the victims of Manley\u2019s abuse were seeking retribution, and that Manley\u2019s sentence could provide a general deterrence effect. Accordingly, the district court sentenced Manley to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count One and 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts Two and Three, all to run concurrently, as well as 10 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Manley now appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">On appeal, Manley argues that the district court erred by (1) applying a 4-level enhancement to his offense level based on its finding that his offense involved material that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence; (2) adding 2 points to his criminal history score for committing the instant offense while on parole; and (3) imposing an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">We need not address Manley\u2019s first two arguments because, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the district court erred in the two calculations in issue, any such error was harmless. Even without the 4-level enhancement for material that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct and the 2 criminal history points, Manley still would have had a total offense level of 46 and a criminal history category of IV, which would have resulted in the same advisory guidelines sentence\u2014life imprisonment, reduced to 840 months\u2019 imprisonment on account of the applicable statutory maximum. Therefore, the district court\u2019s guidelines calculations as to these two issues, even if erroneous, did not affect Manley\u2019s substantial rights and would not require a reversal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">As for Manley\u2019s final argument, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must consider the correctly calculated advisory guidelines range and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir. 2005). Although the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Instead, indications in the record that the district court considered facts and circumstances falling within \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors will suffice. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786; <em>Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">After review, we conclude that Manley has not shown that his 360-month sentence is unreasonable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>correctly determined that Manley\u2019s advisory guidelines sentence was 840 months\u2019 imprisonment, but nevertheless sentenced him to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, a substantial amount below the guidelines sentence. Furthermore, although the district court did not, and was not required to, discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, the record clearly indicates that the district court considered several facts and circumstances falling within \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors, including (1) Manley\u2019s age and the fact that his deviant urges have not diminished with the passage of time, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1); (2) the need for the sentence to protect the public from further crimes through the incapacitation of Manley, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C); (3) the need for the sentence to provide just punishment for the offense, including providing retribution for Manley\u2019s victims, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A); and (4) the need for the sentence to provide adequate deterrence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B). Moreover, by sentencing Manley below the recommended guidelines sentence, the district court not only took into account the Sentencing Guidelines, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(4), but also the need for the sentence to promote respect for the law, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). Under the facts and circumstances of this case, Manley has failed to show that his 360-month sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-11\">. Although Manley reported to the UCA that his son was 12 years old, it was later determined that Manley's son was born on August 10, 1993, and therefore, was only 11 years old at the time of the offense in May 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b898-8\">.
