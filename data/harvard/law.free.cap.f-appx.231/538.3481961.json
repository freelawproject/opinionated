Potwin claims, among other things, that at his federal sentencing hearing the court ordered the BOP to credit him the time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">We agree with the district court that Potwin\u2019s argument fails because the time at issue had been credited by the State of Texas to his state parole-violation sentence and may not be double counted. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b) (\u201cA defendant shall be given credit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences ... that has not been credited against another sentence.\u201d); <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 337, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992) (\u00a7 3585(b) makes clear that defendant cannot receive double credit for detention time). We also agree with the district court that the Attorney General through the BOP (not the sentencing court) has the authority to award credit under section 3585(b) for time served. See <em>id. </em>at 333-36, 112 S.Ct. 1351; <em>cf. United States v. Bradley, </em>978 F.2d 1029, 1030-31 (8th Cir.1992) (vacating district court\u2019s orders denying defendants credit for time served in state custody because BOP had authority to make determination and had concluded credit was deserved).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-11\">. The Honorable James M. Moody, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, adopting the findings and recommendations of the Honorable John F. Forster, Jr., United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
