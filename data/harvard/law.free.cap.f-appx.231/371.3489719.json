He argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him a minimal or minor role adjustment to his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Soto-Martinez contends that he was a mere courier who was substantially less culpable than other participants in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and review factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). Pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2, a district court may decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by four levels if the defendant was a minimal participant in the criminal activity or by two levels if the defendant was a minor participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">As Soto-Martinez\u2019s role in the offense was not minimal or minor, the district court did not clearly err in denying him a role adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See United States v. Atando, </em>60 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Nevarez-Arreola, </em>885 F.2d 243, 245 (5th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 137-38 (5th Cir.1989). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
