Alaran was sentenced to time served, which was five months of imprisonment. On appeal, he argues that: (1) there was insufficient evidence to show he knew the visa at issue was fraudulent, and (2) the district court erred by declining his instruction on \u201cmistake of fact.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">First, viewing the evidence as required, <em>Glasser v. United, States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), we find that there was sufficient evidence of Alaran\u2019s mens rea or \u201cguilty knowledge\u201d regarding the falsity of his visa. <em>See United States v. Oloyede, </em>982 F.2d 133, 137 (4th Cir.1992) (discussing guilty knowledge element); <em>Bland v. United States, </em>299 F.2d 105, 108 (5th Cir.1962) (same). Second, we do not find that the district court abused its discretion in denying Alaran\u2019s proposed instruction on \u201cmistake of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 384 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Alaran\u2019s conviction for visa fraud. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
