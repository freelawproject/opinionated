Our review discloses that the issues raised by petitioners on appeal relate only to the Board\u2019s order of May 10, 2006, affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of relief from removal. Because petitioners did not timely petition for review of the May 10, 2006 order, we do not have jurisdiction to review it. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). To the extent that petitioners\u2019 contentions allege error in the Board\u2019s denial of the motion to reconsider and reopen, our review discloses no abuse of discretion. <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See Granilina v. Gonzales, </em>Nos. A95-237-487; A95-237-489 (B.I.A. July 20, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
