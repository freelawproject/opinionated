In his first appeal, we vacated Ale-man\u2019s life sentence because the district court did not give him notice that it intended to upwardly depart from the then-mandatory guidelines sentence and because the court misapplied the guidelines in upwardly departing. <em>United States v. Aleman, </em>No. 02-16621, at 3-11, 99 Fed.Appx. 879 (11th Cir. Mar. 1, 2004). We remanded and instructed the district court to re-sentence Aleman within the then-mandatory guidelines range of 121 to 151 months imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 11,13.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-19\">The court held a re-sentencing hearing on September 20, 2004. At that hearing, Aleman objected that application of the sentencing guidelines to his case violated the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court\u2019s then-recent decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The district court overruled his <em>Blakely </em>objection, noting that this Court had held in <em>United States v. Reese, </em>382 F.3d 1308 (11th Cir.2004), <em>vacated, </em>543 U.S. 1114, 125 S.Ct. 1089, 160 L.Ed.2d 1058 (2005), that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely </em>did not apply to the federal sentencing guidelines. The court then sentenced Ale-man to 151 months in prison, the high end of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-20\">Aleman did not file a notice of appeal within 10 days of his re-sentencing. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i) (\u201cIn a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>case, a defendant\u2019s notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 10 days after ... the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed....\u201d). Instead, almost a year later, he moved to file an out-of-time appeal, which the district court treated as a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. On June 13, 2006, the court granted Aleman\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, vacated his sentence, and summarily reimposed the same 151-month sentence in accordance with our remand instructions in the first appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Aleman appeals this most recent 151-month sentence. He contends that the district court committed both statutory and constitutional <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>error because he was sentenced under the then-applicable mandatory guidelines regime and his mandatory sentence was enhanced based on facts not admitted by him or found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">We take as a given that the court committed statutory and constitutional <em>Booker </em>error in sentencing Aleman, and we will assume that his <em>Blakely </em>objection at the September 2004 sentence hearing was sufficient to preserve the <em>Booker </em>issue at the June 2006 hearing where the district court reinstated after <em>Booker </em>what it had done when it first sentenced him before <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">We agree with the government that even if the district court committed statutory and constitutional <em>Booker </em>error at the re-sentencing, and even if the errors were properly preserved for appeal, they were nevertheless harmless. To establish that a statutory <em>Booker </em>error is harmless, the government has the burden to show that, viewing the sentence proceedings in their entirety, the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s sentence, or had but a very slight effect. <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cIf one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and alterations omitted). To show that a constitutional <em>Booker </em>error is harmless, the government has the greater burden to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1291-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">Here, the government has met its burden as to both harmless error standards. At the September 2004 re-sentencing hearing, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-10\">[O]h, let me find just, so I can eliminate this business the Appellate Court always comes up with when they want to change something the Trial Court has done, they are saying \u201cThe Judge didn\u2019t know he could do certain things. The Judge didn\u2019t know he had discretion to do something\u201d or \u201cThe Trial Judge, obviously, just didn\u2019t understand the full parameters of his authority. He has only done it for 40 years. So, therefore, he probably is confused that he has discretion to do this and to do that and to do the other thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-11\">Let me assume for purposes of this sentencing that I have the discretion to depart downward or upward. Let me assume I have discretion to hold the Guidelines unconstitutional and/or constitutional except as bound by U.S. versus Reese, and I certainly respect that opinion and take that into consideration. Let me assume that I have all the authority in the world, just like I did the first 15 years that I sentenced people before the Guidelines came into effect so we won\u2019t have to deal with that issue on appeal that \u201cOh, the Judge didn\u2019t know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>he had the authority to do all these things.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-5\">So, I find in the best light of everything favorable to the defendant, favorable to everybody, the best I can do is \u201cOkay. I have got all the authority I need.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-6\">I am going to apply the Guidelines ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">(R6:19.) We read the court\u2019s comments to mean that if it had complete discretion to sentence the defendant, unconstrained by any notion of a mandatory guidelines regime, it would still give the defendant a guidelines sentence, as it did here. There is nothing to indicate that the court had changed its mind at the re-sentencing hearing in 2006 and every reason to believe that it had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">The district courts in <em>Mathenia </em>and <em>United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) made comments similar to the ones the court did here. In those cases, we held that the courts\u2019 statements that they would impose the same sentence on the defendant even if the guidelines were not mandatory rendered any statutory or constitutional <em>Booker </em>error harmless because it did not affect the courts\u2019 ultimate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">In <em>Mathenia, </em>for example, the district court said that \u201cif the Supreme Court affirms the decision in <em>Booker </em>and holds that, under <em>Blakely, </em>the United States Sentencing Guidelines are unconstitutional, then I would nonetheless consider the guidelines as\u2014for their persuasive value or as advisory, and the sentence I would impose would be the same.\u201d 409 F.3d at 1291. We said that the court\u2019s statutory <em>Booker </em>error in sentencing the defendant pursuant to mandatory guidelines was harmless because \u201cthe sentencing judge told us that whether the guidelines were mandatory as they were <em>pre-Booker, </em>or advisory as they are <em>post-Booker, </em>[the defendant]^ sentence would be the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292. \u201c[T]he government ha[d] demonstrated with fair assurance that the district court\u2019s error of applying the guidelines in a mandatory fashion did not affect, or had but a slight affect, on [the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">And in <em>Robles, </em>the district court, after committing a constitutional <em>Booker </em>error in enhancing the defendants sentence under a mandatory guidelines regime based on facts not admitted by the defendant or found by a jury, said that \u201cmy sentence would be the same regardless of whether <em>Blakely </em>had invalidated the guidelines or not, because I would apply them as guidelines and reach the same conclusion that I will here today.\u201d 408 F.3d at 1326 (emphasis omitted). On appeal, we held that the court\u2019s error was harmless because \u201cwe do not have to wonder what sentence the district court would impose if it treated the guidelines as guidelines, because we already know the court would impose the same sentence. Thus, we can conclusively say the error did not affect [the defendant\u2019s] substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">In this case, as in <em>Mathenia </em>and <em>Robles, </em>we do not have wonder about what sentence the district court would impose if the guidelines were advisory and the court had post <em>-Booker </em>discretion to sentence the defendant. The court told us that if it \u201chad all the authority in the world,\u201d it would still give Aleman the same 151-month sentence. Accordingly, any statutory or constitutional <em>Booker </em>errors the court made were harmless in that they did not affect the defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">Aleman also contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We have held, however, that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, there was no obligation, as Aleman suggests, that the district court state that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing the 151-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">The operative question for our purposes is whether this sentence was reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We conclude that it was. On five different occasions, Aleman was paid to captain a go-fast boat smuggling a total of 118 illegal aliens from Cuba into this country. On one smuggling trip, Aleman was spotted by the Cuban Boarder Guard. As the Cuban officials chased his boat, Aleman shot at them with a pistol and forced some of the illegal aliens he was smuggling to go overboard into the water so that the Cuban officials would be distracted with rescuing them. During all this commotion, a women he was smuggling was struck on the head and had to be tended to by another alien who was a doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Aleman dropped this boatload of aliens on an island in the Bahamas and told them he would return in the evening to complete the trip to the United States. Three days later, the United States Coast Guard picked up the aliens on the island. They had survived by eating cacti and snails, but not the woman who had been injured. Without medical held, she had never regained consciousness and had died.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">We, like the district court, consider Ale-man\u2019s criminal conduct to be very serious. He committed multiple felonies, used a gun in the commission of one felony, could have caused an international incident, and left a boatload of desperate people, including one who was seriously injured, on a deserted island for days with no food or medical attention. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (\u201cThe court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant ....\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) (and shall consider \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d). Aleman\u2019s 151-month prison sentence at the upper end of his advisory guideline range was more than reasonable, in his favor. Indeed, any lesser sentence would have been unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-7\">. <em>United States v.
