Angel argues that his prior Florida offenses of aggravated battery and aggravated assault are not crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>of violence and therefore the district court erred when it enhanced his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). He also argues that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and subsequent Supreme Court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In <em>United States v. Dominguez, </em>479 F.3d 345, 347-49 (5th Cir.2007), this court considered and rejected arguments similar to those presented by Angel regarding his aggravated battery conviction. As in <em>Dominguez, </em>479 F.3d at 348-49, Angel\u2019s aggravated battery conviction is a crime of violence because it had as an element at least a threatened use of force. The district court therefore did not err when it increased Angel\u2019s offense level 16-levels pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). As the district court properly determined that Angel\u2019s aggravated battery conviction is a crime of violence, we need not consider whether Angel\u2019s aggravated assault conviction is a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Angel\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Angel contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Angel properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
