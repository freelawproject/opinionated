Evans contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and to address his argument that his guidelines sentence was greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing. The 21-month sentence imposed by the district court was at the low end of the advisory guidelines range and did not exceed the statutory maximum term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">This court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction on its own motion if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Article III, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to actual cases and controversies. <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). The case-or-controversy requirement demands that \u201csome concrete and continuing injury other than the now-ended incarceration or parole\u2014some \u2018collateral consequence\u2019 of the conviction\u2014 must exist if the suit is to be maintained.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Evans has served the sentence that was imposed upon the revocation of his supervised release. The judgment revoking Evans\u2019s term of supervised release imposed no further term of supervised release. Accordingly, there is no case or controversy for this court to address, and the appeal is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
