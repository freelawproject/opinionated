Specifically, Cottone complained that the restitution order violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>(2004) , and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) .</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The district court found that Cottone could not rely on \u00a7 2241 to challenge the legality of his sentence because he failed to satisfy 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause. On appeal, Cottone argues that the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dodd v. United States, </em>545 U.S. 353,125 S.Ct. 2478, 162 L.Ed.2d 343 (2005), in conjunction with the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, violates the Suspension Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">We review \u201cde novo a district court\u2019s dismissal of a section 2241 petition on the pleadings.\u201d <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). The district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain Cottone\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because his contentions regarding restitution did not satisfy the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement of \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2241(c); <em>United States v. Hatten, </em>167 F.3d 884, 885 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Segler, </em>37 F.3d 1131, 1137-38 (5th Cir. 1994). Moreover, we have held that claims based on <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>do not satisfy the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Cottone\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is DENIED, and its motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
