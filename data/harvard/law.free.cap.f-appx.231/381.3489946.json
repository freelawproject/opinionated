The district court applied the 16-level enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) and sentenced Ayala to 37 months of imprisonment. Ayala argues that the district court erred by imposing the enhancement based on the court\u2019s determination that his prior Texas state conviction for robbery qualified as a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Robbery is an enumerated crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. l(B)(iii)). This court recently held in <em>United States v. Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>469 F.3d 376, 378-82 (5th Cir.2006), that the definition of robbery under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 29.02 substantially corresponds to the generic, contemporary meaning of robbery and thus qualifies as an enumerated offense under \u00a7 2L1.2. Accordingly, Ayala\u2019s assertion that the district court erred in applying the 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2 based on his prior robbery conviction is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Ayala also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional. Ayala\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Ayala contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Ayala properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
