[W. A. McGugin, as trustee of the Bankrupt\u2019s estate, (Trustee)] ... is not personally liable for any taxes which hereafter may be assessed against this Estate.\u201d The District Court on review by order dated December 18, 1972, held that the Referee was without jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief and reversed the Referee\u2019s order on the authority of <em>In re Statmas-ter Corporation, </em>465 F.2d 978 (5th Cir. 1972) [hereinafter <em>Statmaster].</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Trustee appeals. We note this Court\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 47, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-19\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b347-20\">We garner from the contentions of the parties a single issue on this appeal, namely: whether the Referee held jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate, upon the application and allegation of the Trustee and without prior claim, notice of deficiency or assessment by the IRS, that no amount of federal income tax had accrued against the Bankrupt\u2019s estate <em>after bankruptcy </em>and to order, that the Trustee is not personally liable for any such federal income taxes which hereafter may be assessed against the Bankrupt\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-21\">PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE REFEREE AND DISTRICT COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b347-22\">On April 20, 1972, the Trustee filed his \u201cSecond Petition for Order to Show Cause to Fix and Determine Amount of Tax, if any, Owed by Trustee and Bankruptcy Estate, and for Bar Order\u201d against the District Director of Internal Revenue, Internal Revenue Service of the United States of America (IRS), and Franchise Tax Board of the State of California (Tax Board) alleging that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>The sole asset of the Bankrupt was an interest in the income of a certain Smathers trust being administrated in the State of New York, from which the Bankrupt had assigned and set over tinto the Trustee ten percent (10%) \u201cof each income distribution as the same may be or become available to [Bankrupt] . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">He had received total \u201cincome directly from the Smather\u2019s Trust, of $7,967.25\u201d and had filed with IRS Form 1041 (federal) and with the Tax Board Form 541 (state) for 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, and 1971 which disclosed the aforesaid receipts of income, but reported \u201cNo tax Due\u201d; and Further, that the Bankrupt\u2019s \u201cestate is ready to be closed and it is necessary . that a final determination be made ... of any and all taxes owed by said Trustee to [the United States or California]; . . . [Further] that there-[Was] no tax due, owing or unpaid to [IRS or the Tax Board] which accrued after [bankruptcy] as a cost of administration, or otherwise . . ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The Trustee prayed for an order fixing and determining the amount of tax and other liability of the Trustee accruing (after bankruptcy) to the IRS or the Tax Board to be the sum of \u201cnothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The Tax Board appeared and reported that no income taxes were due. The IRS appeared and objected to the jurisdiction of the Referee, contending that since IRS had not filed with the Bankruptcy Court any claim for or asserted by notice of deficiency, assessment or otherwise an unpaid income tax against the Bankrupt\u2019s estate or the Trustee, there was no \u201cactual controversy\u201d before the court. Further, the Congress had not by any specific statute clearly waived the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity from suit; accordingly, the Referee was without jurisdiction to determine the amount or legality of any unpaid tax due to the United States or to release the Trustee from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">It appears from the record that the Trustee had requested IRS to audit the returns as filed, and IRS had throughout the period asserted it had no such duty and steadfastly declined to do so until it so elected.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Following a hearing, the Referee entered his order above referred to wherein it was first recited that \u201cthe Trustee [had] put \u2018Off Calendar,\u2019 as to the United States of America, the Petition to Fix and Determine the amount of tax, if any, owed by Trustee and Bankruptcy Estate and for Bar Order . .\u201d and then additionally ordered \u201cthat should it later be determined that any tax liability has been incurred by the Trustee herein in favor of the United States of America, upon notification thereof by either the Trustee or by the Taxing Agency the Credit Manager\u2019s Association of Southern California shall pay said claim out of the assets then in its hands, giving it such priority as it may be entitled to under Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">CONTENTION OF THE PARTIES</p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">On appeal, IRS reiterates the identical contention urged before the Refereee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>and District Court on review as above outlined.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The Trustee contends:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">First, that the Referee was vested with jurisdiction to entertain the petition and to hear and determine the amount or legality of any accrued and unpaid federal income tax under and pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 ll(a)(2A); and</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Secondly, his prayer for an adjudication that the amount of taxes payable was \u201cnothing\u201d and protective relief were put \u201cOff Calendar\u201d; hence, the Referee did not hear and determine any question arising as to the amount or legality of any unpaid tax, but only exercised his jurisdiction to \u201cdetermine actual and necessary costs and expenses\u201d incurred in the administration of the estate, which necessarily included any taxes accruing after bankruptcy, Section 62a of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 [hereinafter \u00a7 102]; <em>McColgan v. Maier Brewing Co., </em>134 F.2d 385 (9th Cir. 1943) [hereinafter <em>McColgan, </em>and to windup and close the estate expeditiously, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 75(a)(1). Accordingly, claims the Trustee, the District Court misconstrued the issues and erroneously. considered the petition as a claim for declaratory relief which is barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, and the order reversing the Referee\u2019s order should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\"> It is important to note at the outset the responsibility of the Trustee in bankruptcy with reference to accrued and unpaid federal income taxes. A trustee in bankruptcy is not personally liable for federal taxes accruing either before or after bankruptcy except as may be imposed by the provisions of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 192 (liability of fiduciaries) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6012(b) (trustees having possession of property of a corporation). However, the trustee for the estate of an individual bankrupt must file a tax return on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. <em>See </em>Rev. Rule 68-48, 1968-1 C.B. 301, 302. The estate of an individual in bankruptcy is not a taxable entity separate from the person for whom the fiduciary is acting, I.R.S.Reg. \u00a7 1.641(b)(2), and the bankrupt must file his own Form 1040 tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">Generally speaking, taxes accruing <em>after bankruptcy </em>are dealt with differently under the Bankruptcy Act than taxes accruing <em>prior to bankruptcy. </em>Taxes against a bankrupt\u2019s estate accruing after bankruptcy are taxable and payable as costs of administration under \u00a7 102, <em>McColgan, </em>and thus are placed in the first class of priority among bankruptcy claims, whereas taxes accruing prior to bankruptcy are provable debts of the bankrupt subject to the fourth class of priority among bankruptcy claims. Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 104 [hereinafter \u00a7 104], The courts have not always noted the distinction. See 3A Collier on Bankruptcy 1 64.106 at 2101 (14th ed. rev. 1972). Therefore, the Trustee\u2019s fiduciary consideration and the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s treatment of accrued and unpaid federal income taxes in relationship to the Bankrupt\u2019s estate must be framed and geared to the <em>prior </em>or <em>after </em>bankruptcy tax classification, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">We agree with the Trustee that the Second Petition did not present a mere claim for declaratory judgment; however, we cannot accept the Bankrupt\u2019s overly simplified premise that the tax question was an item of a cost of administration. We are satisfied that implicitly within the Referee\u2019s order that \u201cthe Trustee ... is not personally liable for any taxes which hereafter may be assessed against this Estate\u201d is an exercise of judicial authority to hear and determine that no federal income tax had accrued during the period of time involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">The. issue on appeal is narrowed by IRS\u2019s briefing statement that it is undisputed that \u201cthe Bankruptcy Court has plenary power to hear and determine tax controversies (\u00a7\u00a7 102 and 104, \u00a7 ll(a)(2A), and \u00a7 6871(b) of the Internal Revenue Code), but just as it was clear Congress intended bankruptcy courts to pass upon tax matters accruing prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>bankruptcy only if an actual tax liability had been ascertained by the District Director and a proof of claim had been filed by the Commissioner, it is equally evident that Congress intended the same procedure with respect to tax matters accruing after bankruptcy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">This Court has today rejected that premise of an IRS self-imposed \u201cproof of claim\u201d restriction or prerequisite upon the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 ll(a)(2A) to hear and determine the amount and legality of unpaid income tax indebtedness accruing prior to bankruptcy, and the dischargeability thereof under Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended in 1966 and 1970, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(a) and (c), and held that such jurisdiction was vested by Congress in the Bankruptcy Court whether or not IRS had made prior claim, notice of deficiency or assessment for unpaid income tax. <em>In re Gwilliam, </em>519 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1975) (No. 74-2350).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We discern no logical reason why the expressed language of \u00a7 ll(a)(2A) should not be read and applied with equal force and effect to federal income taxes accruing after bankruptcy, and we subscribe to Professor Collier\u2019s teaching that \u201cthe immaterial elements not affecting the [Bankruptcy Court\u2019s] jurisdiction include the following: ... (3) whether the tax arose prior to or after bankruptcy.\u201d <em>Gwilliam, supra </em>at 409; 3A Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 64.407 at 2234 \u2014 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">We here hold that the absence of a prior IRS claim, notice of deficiency or assessment does not impede or vitiate the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court under \u00a7 ll(a)(2A), separate and apart from its jurisdiction under \u00a7 102, to hear and determine the amount or legality of any unpaid federal income taxes accruing after bankruptcy, and to relieve the Trustee from liability therefor as an item of cost or expense of his administration upon appropriate order of closure of the bankruptcy proceedings and discharge of the Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Finally, we conclude that the order of the District Court dated December 18, 1972 was erroneous and is reversed, and the order of the Referee dated June 22, 1972 is reinstated and validated.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-16\">. <em>Statmaster </em>interpreted the legislative history behind the enactment of \u00a7 ll(a)(2A) to be in conflict with \u201c[a] broad reading of [\u00a7 1 l(a)(2A) which] would appear to give the bankruptcy court jurisdiction where no claim has yet been filed by the Internal Revenue Service, <em>In re Curtis, </em>W.D.Mich. 1969 \u2014 1 U.S.T.C. \u00b6 9433.\u201d However, <em>Statmaster </em>found at 981 that it was not \u201cnecessary to resolve [that] issue in [its] disposition of the . . case,\u201d or at 982 the \u201cquestion' of governmental immunity or the substantive question of. a trustee\u2019s liability for tax on income arising during the period of liquidation of the bankrupt estate,\u201d and held that the relief sought by the Trustee was \u201ca mere declaratory judgment as to the tax effects of a proposed [corporate reorganization]\u201d for which the Referee lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b348-8\">. The Trustee, remaining creditors, and the Credit Manager\u2019s Association of Southern California (Credit Association) agreed with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court that the Trustee should assign and set over unto the Credit Association the balance of his total receipts after paying and distributing portions thereof as ordered by the Bankruptcy Court and his right, title, and interest in and to ten percent (10%) of the Bankrupt\u2019s interest in future payments from the Smathers trust for distribution to the creditors and beneficiaries pursuant to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order of distribution. In effect the Credit Association was substituted as trustee pursuant to agreement and the Bankrupt\u2019s estate and proceedings closed with a release of the Trustee. We do not deem this unilateral substitution of trustees and provision for substituted funds for the payment of any federal income taxes which may be later determined to have accrued against the Bankrupt\u2019s estate and moneys to be binding upon the IRS. See Liability of Fiduciaries, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 192. In any event we believe the arrangement is immaterial and of no import to the issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
