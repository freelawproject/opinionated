The challenged orders \u2014 Order 72-12-29, December 8, 1972, and Order <em>74r-</em>5 \u2014 17, May 3, 1974 \u2014 rejected the recommendations of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) that competitive nonstop authority be certificated between San Diego and Denver.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ had selected Continental to provide the competitive service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-24\">Petitioner contends that the Board\u2019s order should be set aside on the ground that the CAB \u201cfailed to give adequate weight to the statutory mandate favoring competition\u201d and \u201cfailed to engage in reasoned decision-making.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board responds that its orders were adequately supported by the need for caution at a time when the industry was \u201cplagued by retrenchment and lagging traffic growth\u201d and by the \u201ccrucial problem of diminished fuel supplies.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-25\">We find that, as a general matter, \u00a7 102 of the Federal Aviation Act requires the Board to foster competition as a means of enhancing the development and improvement of air transportation service on routes generating sufficient traffic to support competing carriers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are cognizant that in some cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>cumstances the other considerations set forth in \u00a7 102 may conflict with and predominate over the public interest in competition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Board urges in effect that here the need to foster sound economic conditions in view of the industry\u2019s financial posture and the fuel situation overrides the benefits of competition. After a careful examination of the record, we conclude that the Board\u2019s position is not supported by substantial evidence and that its rejection of competitive nonstop service in the San Diego-Denver market is not in accord with the public interest considerations set forth in \u00a7 102 of the Act. Accordingly, we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with Part IV of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">We begin with a summary of the seven years of administrative proceedings culminating in the orders under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">The challenged orders are the last of a series of CAB rulings entered in the Additional Service to San Diego Case. That proceeding arose out of an application filed by United Air Lines on January 12, 1967, requesting permission to provide nonstop service in several San Diego markets.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On May 26, 1967, the CAB issued a show cause order which rejected United\u2019s San Diego-Denver nonstop request, but proposed to give United nonstop authorization for the San Diego-New York and San Diego-Chicago routes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In response to the City of Denver\u2019s petition for reconsideration, the Board <em>sua sponte </em>issued a second order to show cause why Western Air Lines, the primary San Diego-Denver carrier, should not be permitted to provide nonstop service in that market.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s proposals prompted numerous objections and competitive filings from other airlines. By order of April 3, 1968, the CAB instituted the Additional Service to San Diego Case, setting a consolidated hearing on applications for nonstop authority between San Diego and New York/Newark, Washington/Baltimore, Chicago and Denver.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-16\">Following the submission of briefs by numerous carriers and local groups and three days of hearings, the ALJ issued his initial decision on September 4, 1969. The ALJ recommended that competitive nonstop authority be authorized in all four markets under consideration. With regard to the San Diego-Denver market, he adopted the Bureau of Operating Rights\u2019 forecast that there would be \u201cnot less than 100,335 passengers in 1970.\u201d Based on this \u201cconservative\u201d estimate he found \u201cample traffic to support two carriers on an economic basis without regard to the support of through traffic flowing over the route.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The ALJ se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>lected Western and Continental to provide the competing nonstop service. Western was a \u201clogical choice\u201d because it carried the great bulk of the San Diego-Denver passengers on its one stop flights routed via Phoenix.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Continental was chosen ahead of United, TWA and Air West as the second carrier because of United\u2019s past \u201crecord of neglect and indifference\u201d toward the market and because of Continental\u2019s superior proposed pattern of service; attractive fare schedules; substantial beyond market benefits; and history as \u201can extremely vigorous, aggressive, and efficient carrier.\" <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">The CAB exercised its right of discretionary review of the ALJ\u2019s initial decision, issuing its opinion on April 9, 1970.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Board adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding the need for competitive nonstop service in the Chicago, New York/Newark, and Washington/Baltimore markets but decided, by a vote of 3 \u2014 2, to certificate only one nonstop carrier, Western, in the San Diego-Denver market. This departure from the ALJ\u2019s determination rested primarily on the majority\u2019s view that \u201cthe examiner\u2019s forecast may be too optimistic\u201d given \u201cthe recent lag in nationwide traffic growth.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although the CAB noted that a competitive authorization would provide a spur to better service and significant benefits to beyond segment markets, it concluded that Western\u2019s possible \u201csizeable operating loss if competitive service is instituted\u201d in conjunction with the adequacy of Western\u2019s proposed service to meet the needs of the market rendered a denial of a competing nonstop carrier certification \u201cmore consistent with the goal of fostering sound economic conditions in air transportation. \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The dissenting Board members emphasized that the projection of 100,335 passengers (275 per day) in 1970 was \u201ca very conservative estimate\u201d which did not include either \u201ctrue San Diego passengers who are reported as Los Angeles passengers (because they traveled from Los Angeles to San Diego by surface transportation or intrastate airlines) or \u201cthe substantial number of passengers carried between these points who will move beyond Denver to points on the routes of both Western and Continental.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, the dissent noted that within the past year the Board had made grants of competitive nonstop service in a number of substantially smaller markets.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>A number of parties, including Continental, sought reconsideration of the Board\u2019s determination. Petitioner claimed that the majority lacked substantial evidence to support its determination that the traffic forecast of the ALJ and the Bureau of Operating Rights was too optimistic. It noted that the lag in national traffic had not affected the market at issue \u2014 the San Diego-Denver market had grown 34% between 1967 and 1968 and both San Diego and Denver experienced an increase in total traffic well in excess of the national average. Continental reinforced its argument by pointing out that the traffic estimates of three other carriers paralleled or exceeded the ALJ\u2019s forecast and that the ALJ\u2019s figure was significantly understated because of the factors noted by the dissenting members.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">The CAB, by order of June 5, 1970, deferred action on the petitions to reconsider certification of a second nonstop carrier between San Diego and Denver. In its Supplemental Opinion and Order on Reconsideration of March 23, 1971, the Board, by an identical 3 \u2014 2 vote, reaffirmed its previous denial of competitive service. The majority conceded that the San Diego-Denver market \u201cmaintained a healthy growth rate in calendar year 1968,\u201d but argued that 1969 traffic data demonstrated that \u201cthe market is by no means an exception to the nationwide slowdown.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Using more recent traffic figures and a 1971 forecast year, the majority calculated that \u201cContinental\u2019s certification would produce an operating loss of about $84,000 for Western in 1971. . . \u201d The Board concluded that harm to Western \u201cat a difficult period for the industry as a whole and Western in particular\u201d outweighed the \u201csignificant factors\u201d favoring certification such as substantial beyond segment benefits and profitable operation for Continental.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The dissenters claimed that \u201c[tjhere can be no serious question that this market is large enough to support competition,\u201d emphasizing that the majority\u2019s projection for 1971 yielded a larger traffic volume than the ALJ had found sufficient to support competition using a 1970 target year.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> They found that the possibility of a temporary loss by Western in 1971 was overshadowed by public benefits from improved service which Continental\u2019s competitive flights would provide in the San Diego-Denver market and in other related markets.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>Shortly after issuance of its supplemental opinion, the Board discovered that its financial calculations had erroneously rested on fiscal rather than calendar 1971 traffic estimates and consequently had underforecast 1971 traffic volume. Corrected estimates revealed that, in competition with Continental, Western\u2019s 1971 profits would range from slightly below to somewhat above the break-even level. The CAB stated: \u201cThese revised figures render extremely close the balance of decisional criteria\u2014 harm to Western under existing economic conditions weighed against public benefit factors favoring competition and improved beyond service \u2014 in determining whether such competition should be authorized.\u201d Under these circumstances, the Board, by order of April 16, 1971, remanded the competition question to the ALJ for an analysis of \u201cthe most recent traffic and cost data and Western\u2019s actual experience with nonstop service in the market.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">The remand proceeding culminated in a 92-page Supplemental Initial Decision issued on March 20, 1972. The decision found a second nonstop carrier warranted by the size of the market in the 1972 and 1973 forecast years, the serious deficiencies and omissions in Western\u2019s service, and Western\u2019s ability \u201cto achieve a substantial operating profit\u201d in each of the forecast years in competition with another nonstop carrier.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The ALJ accepted as reasonable the Bureau of Operating Right\u2019s traffic estimate of 118,-520 passengers in 1972 and 127,409 in 1973 and its related projection of an operating profit for Western of $417,000 in 1972 and $325,000 in 1973.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The supplemental decision faulted Western\u2019s San Diego-Denver service for scheduling inadequacies and high load factors.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The ALJ selected Continental to compete with Western for substantially the same reasons contained in his initial decision.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">The Board, 3 \u2014 2, again reversed the ALJ and declined to authorize competitive nonstop service. The majority members expressed concern that, \u201cduring a period of lagging traffic growth and retrenchment within the industry, and during the subsequent period of recovery before an adequate upward trend has been assured,\u201d the agency \u201cmust be more than usually careful to avoid impeding the industry\u2019s opportunities for full recovery.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It concluded that certification of competition would be imprudent since Western\u2019s service had been \u201creasonably responsive to the needs of the market\u201d and since competitive service was \u201clikely to produce, at best, only marginal financial results.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Board found the ALJ\u2019s and the Bureau\u2019s traffic forecast \u201ctoo optimistic\u201d and set forth a number of adjustments in their growth and stimulation percentages which reduced the 1973 traffic estimates by 29,000 passengers.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Although the Board made no profit or loss calculations of its own, it concluded that \u201cthe prospect for profitable two-carrier operation is tenuous at this time.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">Continental\u2019s detailed petition for reconsideration took issue <em>inter alia </em>with the Board\u2019s adjustments to the ALJ\u2019s traffic forecast. In particular, it questioned the majority members\u2019 reliance on experience during recession years to support its forecast of a 3 percent growth rate for 1972 and 1973, in view of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>Board\u2019s earlier finding that the recession was a \u201ctemporary phenomenon.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> As proof of the Board\u2019s error, Continental noted that, as a result of substantial growth, Western\u2019s traffic figures revealed that the market was significantly larger at the end of 1972 than the Board had predicted it would be a year later.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">On May 3, 1974, fifteen months after the opinion following the remand, the Board issued an Opinion and Order on Reconsideration reaffirming, by a 2-1 vote, its denial of a competitive nonstop certification. This final opinion in these extended proceedings reiterates the Board\u2019s \u201cpolicy of caution\u201d and expresses its \u201cresolve to avoid making unnecessary awards of competitive authority on routes which are adequately served.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Noting recent traffic growth data, the Board conceded \u201cthat the prospects for profitable competitive operations are far stronger than earlier believed\u201d and that \u201ccompetitive service would be more profitable than originally anticipated \u2014 although not as profitable as Continental claims.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> However, without further explication, it stated that \u201cthe Board\u2019s original decision did not turn on profitability alone. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Despite the improved financial outlook for competition and the benefits it offered, the Board determined that, given the general state of the industry and the recent onset of the fuel shortage, \u201ca competitive authorization is unnecessary and undesirable at this time.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-16\">The dissenting member emphasized that traffic data indicated that the ALJ\u2019s 1973 forecasts \u201cwere on sound ground, indeed if anything conservative\u201d and that there would likely be \u201cwell over 150,000 annual passengers\u201d for fiscal 1975, the earliest possible first year of competitive operations.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> He commented: \u201cOverall, it is hard to avoid the impression that the majority is not really interested in whether competitive service would be profitable, and has effectively eliminated this as a decisional factor.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Nor did he find any warrant for a denial of competitive service in the fuel situation. In view of Western\u2019s scheduled four and a half nonstop roundtrips, the dissent noted that \u201ccompetitive service in this market is possible today without materially increasing overall jet fuel consumption or reducing service in other, perhaps more essential markets.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-17\">On June 25, 1974, Continental filed a petition for review of the Board\u2019s 1972 order and its 1974 order on reconsideration.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-18\">II. <em>Competition and the Public Interest Standard of the Federal Aviation Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-19\">Continental urges that the challenged orders must be set aside in part because the Board failed to give adequate weight to the governing statute\u2019s mandate favoring competition.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s contention rests both on an assessment of the general importance of competition in the statutory scheme and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>an- analysis of the Board\u2019s treatment of the record in view of that scheme. As shall be seen, these two aspects of petitioner\u2019s argument implicate distinct questions of statutory interpretation and substantial evidence. We turn first to an examination of the role of competition, in order to develop a framework for evaluating the record to determine whether the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and evinces a \u201cfidelity to the functions assigned to the regulatory agency by the Congress.\u201d <footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">\u201cCompetition to the extent necessary\u201d is one of the six public interest factors set forth in \u00a7 102 of the Federal Aviation Act to guide the CAB \u201c[i]n the exercise and performance of its powers and duties.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The parties present divergent interpretations of \u00a7 102 and its competition subsection, \u00a7 102(d). Continental contends that the Act creates \u201ca \u2018strong presumption\u2019 in favor of competition.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The CAB\u2019s brief argues that the statute \u201ccontemplates that competition may or may not be \u2018necessary\u2019 \u201d and that competition is not <em>per se </em>favored \u201cwhere it endangers other policy goals in the public interest, such as the achievement of efficient, economical service or the fostering of sound economy of operations.\u201d <footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Intervenor Western opines that in view of the origin of the Act \u201cit is apparent Congress contemplated that as to Section 102(d) the emphasis would be, not on the word \u2018competition,\u2019 but on the remainder of the phrase: to the extent necessary to assure the sound development of an air transportation system properly adapted to the needs of the foreign and domestic commerce of the United States, of the Postal Service, and of the national defense.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> An examination of the origins of the statute and of its \u201ccontemporaneous construction\u201d by persons \u201ccharged with the responsibility of setting its machinery in motion\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> clarifies the intended meaning of \u00a7 102(d) and the relationship between competition and the other public interest factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-10\">Congress first established a comprehensive system for regulation of air transportation through the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The legislative history of that act makes clear that the statute was designed to correct the abuses of unrestrained competition among carriers. The Senate Report on the proposed legislation warned that \u201c[cjompetition among air carriers is being carried to an extreme, which tends to jeopardize and render unsafe\u201d air transportation and urged the \u201cimmediate enactment\u201d of the bill to \u201cpromote an orderly development of our Nation\u2019s civil aeronautics\u201d and to \u201cprevent the spread of bad practices and of destructive and wasteful tactics resulting from the intense competition now existing within the air-carrier industry.\u201d <footnotemark>50</footnotemark> In floor debates, Congressman Randolph cited \u201crate war, cutthroat devices, and destructive and wasteful practices\u201d as evidence that \u201c[t]he industry has reached the point where unbridled and unregulated competition is a public menace.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>However, Congress made it clear that while it was moving to safeguard against the excesses of destructive and unrestrained competition, it was in favor of the competitive principle and opposed to a policy of monopoly. In the debates, Senator McCarran stressed that the Act established a \u201cnonpolitical agency\u201d that would focus on the public interest of avoiding destructive competition where <em>e. g., </em>United Air Lines already serves Chicago to Salt Lake City, and the agency rejects another applicant who wants to serve the route, \u201cbecause if you do both lines will fail. . . . \u201d He added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-6\">[This] is not to say that any line may be \u201cfrozen\u201d nor that any line may be \u25a0perpetuated, nor that any monopoly over any terrain may be established to the exclusion of the necessity which the public may present.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">Other speakers likewise evinced a clear intent to protect against the evils of monopoly. Senator Borah, for example, stated: \u201cI have no doubt of the intent of the framers of this proposed legislation to inhibit or prohibit monopoly. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> And Senator Copeland, Chairman of the pertinent committee, pointed to the \u201ccompetition to the extent necessary\u201d language in the declaration of policy section \u2014 \u00a7 2 of the 1938 Act which was reenacted in 1958 as \u00a7 102 of the Federal Aviation Act \u2014 as one of \u201cfive places in the pending bill where the question of monopoly is dealt with in one way or another with the view to its control and prevention.\u201d <footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">The central point is that this was one of an emerging group of statutes that did not regulate the so-called \u201cnatural monopolies\u201d that identified conventional public utility regulation, but instead called for \u201cregulated competition,\u201d achieving the benefits of competition without the evils of unrestrained entry or under-cost rate wars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-15\">It is significant that Congress, addressing itself to the air transport industry, deliberately fashioned this 1938 law so as to identify competition in express language as a key element of the public interest. During the Senate debate it was emphasized that both of the 1938 bills \u2014 the McCarran bill and the Administration substitute \u2014 altered the general declaration of policy contained in earlier bills to take \u201cexplicit recognition of the importance of competition to the extent necessary to assure the sound development of air transport.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-16\">Numerous early CAB opinions provide insight into the intended role of competition in the new regulatory scheme. In one of its first decisions the Board stated: \u201cReference to both the legislative history and to the text of the act demonstrates the congressional intent to safeguard an industry of vital importance to the commercial and defense interests of the Nation against the evils of unrestrained competition on the one hand, and the consequences of monopolistic control on the other.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The CAB read the inclusion of an express reference to competition in \u00a7 2 to render inapplicable doctrine developed under other transportation regulatory schemes that competition should not be authorized where an existing carrier was furnishing adequate service and stood ready to meet any additional service needs of the public.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The Board stated explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>that when \u201ccompetition will be neither destructive nor uneconomical. the Board is directed to implement competition\u201d because it generally promotes the other public interest factors set forth in \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Thus the CAB concluded in the <em>Additional North-South California Services Case:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-4\">While no convenient formula of general applicability may be available as a substitute for the Board\u2019s discretionary judgment it would seem to be a sound principle that, since competition in itself presents an incentive to improved service and technological development, there would be a strong, although not conclusive, presumption in favor of competition on any route which offered sufficient traffic to support competing services without unreasonable increase of total operating cost.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">And it further explained in the <em>Hawaiian Case:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-6\">The greatest gain from competition . is the stimulus to devise and experiment with new operating techniques and new equipment, to develop new means of acquiring and promoting business, including the rendering of better service to the customer and to the Nation . . . . Competition invites comparison as to equipment, costs, personnel, methods of operation, solicitation of traffic, all of which tend to assure the development of an air transportation system as contemplated by the Act.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-11\">The legislative history and the early CAB decisions indicate that there is no presumption in favor of competition <em>per se </em>because competition may prove uneconomical and destructive of the healthy development of the industry if the relevant market is too small to support competing carriers. But when sufficient traffic exists to support competition, certification of competing carriers is mandated by the Act as providing the best means of effectuating the other public interest goals contained in \u00a7 102.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-12\">We place substantial reliance on this view of the role of competition both because of the particular respect due a \u201ccontemporaneous construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>a statute by men charged with the responsibility of setting its machinery in motion\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> and because the Board \u201chas from the outset consistently taken\u201d that position.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Although Continental and the Department of Justice, as <em>amicus curiae, </em>charge that this case is indicative of the Board\u2019s recent unannounced abandonment of this view and adoption of a route freeze policy,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> we need not address that claim in view of the Board\u2019s failure to articulate its actions as a fundamental change in policy. \u201cIn our reviewing role, it is peculiarly appropriate for us to take the Board at its own word as to what it was doing, and to scrutinize the result in terms of that process.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> We thus proceed to an examination of the Board\u2019s treatment of the record to determine whether there is substantial evidence indicating either that the San Diego-Denver market lacks sufficient traffic potential for healthy competition or that another public interest consideration outweighs the significant benefits afforded by competition.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">III. <em>Lack of Substantial Evidence to Support Rejection of Competition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">The post-remand orders under review in this case ^set forth two justifications for rejecting the ALJ\u2019s reeommen-dation that competitive nonstop service be certificated for the San Diego-Denver market \u2014 maintenance of the economic health of the industry and the fuel shortage. Although a comprehensive analysis would pinpoint a number of shortcomings in the CAB\u2019s opinions, we find that a focused examination of the evidence supporting these two core rationales is entirely sufficient to demonstrate the lack of substantial evidence to underpin the Board\u2019s rejection of competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">A. <em>Promotion of Sound Economic Conditions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">In its initial orders culminating in a remand for further proceedings on the issue of competitive nonstop service, the Board concentrated on the economic threat to Western posed by authorization of a competing carrier. Although the ALJ had found that the market would be large enough to support competition in 1970, the initial forecast year, the Board concluded that the projection was too optimistic \u201c[i]n view of the recent lag in nationwide traffic growth\u201d and credited Western\u2019s \u201cgloomy forecast\u201d of \u201ca sizeable operating loss if competitive nonstop service is instituted.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> When Continental petitioned for reconsideration on the basis that the record showed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>substantial growth in the San Diego-Denver market contrary to the national trend, the Board responded that \u201cmore recent O &amp; D data demonstrates [sic] that the market is by no means an exception to the nationwide slowdown.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The CAB went on to project an $84,000 operating loss for Western in 1971 under competition with Continental and to conclude that \u201cContinental\u2019s advantages\u201d were outweighed \u201cby the harm the carrier would cause to Western\u2019s operations at a difficult period for the industry as a whole and for Western in particular.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> When discovery of an error erased the $84,000 loss projection, the Board altered its analysis of the competition issue. It remanded the question for further proceedings, stating that \u201c[t]hese revised figures render extremely close the balance of decisional criteria \u2014 harm to Western under existing economic conditions weighed against public benefit factors favoring competition and improved beyond service. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Significantly, by the time of the last CAB order in May, 1974, the Board had abandoned its reliance on the threat of competition to the profitability of Western\u2019s San Diego-Denver service. The AU and the CAB\u2019s Bureau of Operating Rights again found that there would be substantial growth in the market in both the 1972 and 1973 forecast years and projected that both Western and Continental would achieve sizeable profits in each of those years.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The Board again deemed the ALJ and Bureau of Operating Rights\u2019 traffic forecast \u201ctoo optimistic\u201d, making numerous downward revisions in the ALJ\u2019s forecasting assumptions and concluding that the competitive service was \u201clikely to produce, at best, only marginal financial results.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> In contrast to its pre-remand orders, the Board did not make the key bottom line profit and loss calculation in its 1972 order or include any reference to the financial status of Western and Continental. Implicit in the Board\u2019s decision was its belief that any doubts as to the profitability of competition should be resolved against certification of a second carrier \u201cto avoid impeding the industry\u2019s opportunities for full recovery.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-11\">The CAB argues that its analysis of traffic projections and balancing of public interest factors involve a \u201cspecialized task\u201d that is \u201cwithin the Board\u2019s special province\u201d and that the court should defer to the agency\u2019s expertise in these technical matters.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> In response, Continental identifies a number of danger signals that serve to alert the court to the Board\u2019s failure to engage in a reasoned application of its expertise \u2014 a predicate to restrained and deferential judicial review of an agency\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> It points to the ever-shifting basis of the Board\u2019s decisions, the inexplicable delay in prepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>ration of agency orders, and the persistent conservative downgrading of the ALJ\u2019s and staff\u2019s traffic forecasts in the teeth of data revealing significant growth as danger signals indicating that the Board\u2019s adjustments and conclusions are a product of \u201cresult-oriented\u201d rationalization.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">We are not required to rule on this contention, to evaluate the strength of these danger signals or to consider whether they undercut the deference normally accorded to agency analyses of technical traffic matters. These matters have been obviated by the Board\u2019s May, 1974 Opinion and Order on Reconsideration, which concedes the need for adjustment of its forecast and states that competition would be profitable.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Subsequent additions to the traffic data that were before the Board prior to its 1972 order convincingly demonstrated that the majority members severely underestimated the size of the market.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Faced with these figures, the Board acknowledged what could not fairly be denied\u2014 \u201cthe prospects for profitable competitive operations are far stronger than earlier believed\u201d and \u201ccompetitive service would be more profitable than originally anticipated.\u201d <footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">But then the Board brushed these developments aside, stating that its \u201coriginal decision did not turn on profitability alone. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Since the profitability of Western was the crucial reason for the original remand, we do not see how this fairly could be discarded without explication of why the change in this factor did not alter the conclusion<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> The only factor identified in the Board\u2019s April, 1971 order authorizing the remand of the competition question was profitability \u2014 \u201charm to Western under existing economic conditions. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> The March, 1971 Supplemental Opinion and Order on Reconsideration had pointed to the related factor of \u201ca difficult period . . . for Western in particular,\u201d but by May, 1974, Western\u2019s financial situation had brightened with earnings in excess of the 12% level found \u201creasonable\u201d by the Board in its Domestic Passenger-Fare Investigation.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-16\">The only remaining factor mentioned in the CAB\u2019s prior decision in this matter was the financial condition of the industry as a whole. But that consideration had been relied upon solely in terms of justifying a \u201cmore than usually careful\u201d approach to evaluating the competition question in the San Diego-Denver market. That approach may have validity, if not carried to extremes, for it still leads up to an ultimate' decision focused on the subject market. But we are unable to discern on what basis the Board can glean any support from this factor of general conditions once it has recognized, as it now apparently has, that the particular market will sustain competition and still be profitable. If an air transport market is substantial and thriving, we do not see how the fact that other markets are over-served, can justify leaving this market under-served, of depriving it of the public-interest benefits of competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-17\">Is the Board obliquely saying that monopoly profits are needed in this market to sustain overall industry earnings when shaky?</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>This would not only raise serious questions of Congressional intent, and adequacy of articulation of reasoning, but present the question whether there is evidence to show that competition in this market will not maintain overall profits,<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> by enhancing efficiency, quality of service, and the size of this and connecting-beyond markets.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> In the end we are left with the conviction that the Board\u2019s reference to general industry conditions is \u201clocal color\u201d to gain an atmosphere of acceptability for the result, rather than a novel, independent ground of decision resting on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">We have not ignored the passage, in the Board\u2019s opinion denying reconsideration, which says that the industry\u2019s faltering in its effort to achieve recovery \u201cfortifies our resolve to avoid making unnecessary awards of competitive authority on routes that are adequately served.\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> The structure of this sentence suggests that the general faltering of industry factor (which we have already discussed and found wanting) was taken in conjunction with, and as fortifying, a separate regulatory notion that competition is \u201cunnecessary\u201d when existing (monopoly) service is \u201cadequate.\u201d Such a concept would not only constitute a fundamental change in doctrine that requires a more direct address and reasoned analysis than this elliptical reference<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> but more important would conflict with the intent of Congress as we discern it.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">B. <em>The Fuel Shortage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">We come, finally, to the fuel shortage issue to which the Board referred in ultimately denying reconsideration. The onset of the oil embargo in late 1973 diminished the fuel supplies available for air transportation. The Board\u2019s May, 1974 opinion grasped the fuel problem as an independent reason for rejecting competitive service.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> As the Justice Department brief remarks, since fuel shortages are a permanent fixture of American life, this is tantamount to writing \u00a7 102(d) out of the act.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Moreover, the Justice Department aptly comments that there is no support for the Board\u2019s alleged fear that certificating competitive service would increase fuel consumption at the expense of more \u201cessential service elsewhere\u201d to the \u201coverall detriment of the public interest.\u201d <footnotemark>91</footnotemark> The crisis of late 1973 may have justified temporary orders to preserve the status quo pending analysis, but not an indefinite abdication by CAB.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> We have recently noted in another context that the existence of an energy crisis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>does not excuse a regulatory agency\u2019s \u201cfailure to seek answers\u201d pertinent to the exercise of its duties or its \u201cabdication of its duty to \u2018indicate fully and carefully the methods by which, and the purposes for which, it has chosen to act.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">The CAB contends that its reference to the Remanded Atlanta/Detroit/Cleveland/Cincinnati Investigation was sufficient since \u201cthere was no reason for the Board to repeat in this case what it had already said in a companion case issued on the same day.\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> However, in the companion case the Board found that the proposed competitive flights \u201cwould consume well over 10 million gallons of fuel annually.\u201d In addition, it noted that the markets under consideration there were experiencing load factors \u201conly moderately if at all above the Board\u2019s rate-making standard of 55 percent.\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> Here, by contrast, additional fuel was not required to institute competition. At the time of the final order, Western was planning to run four and a half nonstop trips in the San Diego-Denver market. This exceeded the two round trip flights each which the carriers had proposed to institute in the remand proceedings.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> Moreover, the monthly on board coach load factors on Western\u2019s San Diego-Denver flights were repeatedly well in excess of the 55% level during the 14 months ending with July, 1973.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> In this context, the Board\u2019s bare reference to the fuel shortage rationale set forth in the Atlanta-Detroit case is not sufficient to constitute reasoned decisionmaking for the disparate conditions of the San Diego-Denver market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">Section 102 sets forth six public interest factors to guide the CAB in the exercise of its statutory duties. We are cognizant that in reviewing agency orders \u201c[t]he court\u2019s responsibility is not to supplant the [Board\u2019s] balance of these interests with one more nearly to its liking,\u201d <footnotemark>98</footnotemark> but the state of the record establishes that the Board recited the public benefits to be derived from competition, and did not itself accord them any real weight in the balance, dismissing them, in effect, as overborne by considerations, of the health of the industry and the fuel situation, which lacked any support in substantial evidence. Accordingly, the challenged orders are set aside and the record is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-14\">IV. <em>Remand Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-15\">The agency proceedings eventuating in Continental\u2019s petition for review were commenced over 8V2 years ago. Two complete evidentiary hearings have been conducted and the ALJ has issued two thorough initial decisions detailing the characteristics of the market, analyzing traffic forecasts, and comparing the strengths of carriers seeking certification. The record before us contains ample evidence of the need for competing nonstop service. We agree with Interve-nor Western Air Lines that \u201c[p]ublic policy dictates that the case be brought to an end.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> We thus contemplate that the CAB will proceed expeditiously on remand with selection of a competing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>nonstop carrier. To avoid any unnecessary delay, we note that if the Board should invoke the procedure of petitioning this court to modify its mandate to permit taking of additional evidence on the pendency of this appeal, it should set forth with particularity the matters involved and their relationship to the desirability and feasibility of implementing competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Turning finally to the question of carrier selection, we note that this issue has also been fully fleshed out in the previous hearings. The ALJ has twice selected Continental over the other carriers seeking nonstop authorization to compete with Western. The Board has repeatedly noted the substantial beyond market benefits offered by Continental and has spoken in terms of the advantages provided by Continental in addressing the related competition question. Nonetheless, as Intervenor United Air Lines, points out, the Board has not squarely examined the ALJ\u2019s findings on the carrier selection issue. On remand the CAB should review the record and render a supplemental order either adopting the ALJ\u2019s determination or setting forth its separate reasons for accepting or rejecting the ALJ\u2019s selection. In view of the comprehensive record before the agency and the public interest in a prompt determination, we trust that the Board will proceed with expedition in completing carrier selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">The case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-13\">.
