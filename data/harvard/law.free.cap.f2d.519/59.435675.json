Strickland, </em>1975, 420 U.S. 308, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214, whether the District Judge\u2019s failure to instruct with regard to the effect of O\u2019Connor\u2019s claimed reliance on state law rendered inadequate the instructions as to O\u2019Connor\u2019s liability for compensatory and punitive damages\u201d. In the light of <em>Wood v. Strickland, </em>we hold that the district court erred in denying an instruction concerning O'Connor's claimed reliance on state law as authorization for Donaldson\u2019s continued confinement. We now hold, as to both Doctors O\u2019Connor and Gumanis, that the district court\u2019s instructions were insufficient in defining the scope of the qualified immunity possessed by state officials under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Moreover, since the case was tried before the Supreme Court decided <em>Wood v. Strickland, </em>the interests of justice require that the plaintiff and both defendants, Dr. J. B. O\u2019Connor and Dr. John Gumanis, have an opportunity to present evidence and to articulate their arguments on the issue of official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed insofar as the defendants were held liable for monetary damages and the case is remanded for further proceedings, if any, consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Wood v. Strickland, </em>1975, 420 U.S. 308, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 and <em>O\u2019Connor v. Donaldson, </em>422 U.S. 563, 95 S.Ct. 2486, 45 L.Ed.2d 396 [decided June 26, 1975].</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">It is further ordered that the defendants recover from Kenneth Donaldson their costs herein expended.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
