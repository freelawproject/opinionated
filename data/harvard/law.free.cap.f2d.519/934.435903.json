They take primary issue with our ruling that those portions of the Commission's chronological minutes which it described to the District Court as containing \u201cpolicy determinations\u201d must be disclosed to the appellant. We deny appellees\u2019 petition. To our mind, a \u201cpolicy determination\u201d denotes a final agency decision which is utilized as a touchstone for future administrative action. Such decisions must be made available to the public, as this court held in <em>Sterling Drug, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, </em>\u201cto prevent the development of secret law within the Commission.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">We take this opportunity to emphasize, however, that our opinion leaves open the possibility on remand that the District Court may find, with the benefit of a more adequate record, that the Commission\u2019s own characterization of the chronological minutes as containing \u201cpolicy <em>determinations </em>\u201d was inaccurate. Nothing in our opinion requires that the policy <em>discussions </em>or recommendations of FTC Commissioners be revealed to the public.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the agency, in spite of its own description of portions of the chronological minutes as \u201cpolicy determinations,\u201d can satisfy the District Court\u2014 through the procedure outlined in our opinion \u2014 that no final agency opinions or binding decisions are found therein, the disclosure rationale of <em>Sterling Drug </em>will not be applicable to this case. For, as the Supreme Court so recently held i<em>n NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Exemption 5 can never apply to \u201cfinal opinions,\u201d whereas memoranda (and records of oral discussions) leading up to a final opinion or binding decision are protected from disclosure by Exemption 5.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ae9p\">. 146 U.S.App.D.C. 237, 247, 450 F.2d 698, 708 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"apq-dedup-0\">.
