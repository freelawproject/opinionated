She sued for a refund of these taxes, claiming that they were erroneously paid because the amounts paid to her by Graybar were gifts, excluded from gross income under \u00a7 102(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a). The district court gave judgment in her favor, and the government appealed. We reverse:</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-23\">With this opinion we become the fourth United States Court of Appeals to consider the tax consequences of certain \u201cspecial death benefits\u201d paid by Graybar to the estates or beneficiaries of its shareholders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since the facts and relevant tax considerations of the Graybar \u201cspecial death benefits\u201d plan have been carefully detailed in three published opinions, only a summary statement of our views is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-24\">All Graybar stock is owned by company employees. Graybar possesses a right to repurchase the employee\u2019s shares on his death at par value; and, as it has in every case since 1928, Graybar exercised this option upon the death of its retired employee and former director, John H. Pearson, Jr. The \u201cspecial death benefits\u201d are equal to the amount of divi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>dends that would have been paid to the shareholder\u2019s estate or beneficiaries had Graybar not redeemed the stock. In theory, Graybar does not bind itself to pay these benefits, but it virtually always makes the payments. In the present case the benefits were paid directly to the taxpayer, Mr. Pearson\u2019s widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-5\">The Second Circuit ruled in 1959 that Graybar was not entitled to deduct the \u201cspecial death benefits\u201d as post-mortem compensation for previous services. <em>Graybar Electric Company v. Commissioner, </em>267 F.2d 403 (2 Cir. 1959). This ruling is not disputed by the parties before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-6\">The Ninth Circuit held that the payments were nontaxable gifts to the recipients. <em>Harper v. United States, </em>454 F.2d 222 (9 Cir. 1971). The district court in the instant case and the Fifth Circuit in <em>Jensen v. United States, </em>511 F.2d 265 (5 Cir. 1975), both rejected the reasoning employed by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Harper.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The district court, however, concluded that primarily because Graybar did not owe Mrs. Pearson \u201cany legal or moral duty to make the payments,\u201d the payments were not additional consideration for the redemption of Mr. Pearson\u2019s stock. Therefore it held the payments were gifts and it required the government to refund the long-term capital gain taxes paid by Mrs. Pearson after her receipt of the payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-7\">The Fifth Circuit, on the other hand, found in the Graybar payment plan \u201cnothing to indicate affection, admiration, respect, charity, or like impulses as the dominant reasons for these payments.\u201d <em>Jensen, supra, </em>511 F.2d at 272. Finding, instead, \u201csubstantial benefits [of the plan] to the corporation and its shareholders,\u201d the <em>Jensen </em>court reversed a district court judgment that a taxpayer was entitled to a refund of the long-term capital gains tax he paid on the \u201cspecial death benefits\" received from Graybar. 511 F.2d at 272-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-10\">For the reasons stated by the district court in the instant case and the Fifth Circuit in <em>Jensen, </em>we decline to follow the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Harper. </em>But, for the reasons stated in <em>Jensen, </em>we hold that the \u201cspecial death benefits\u201d received by Mrs. Pearson were not gifts, and therefore she is not entitled to a refund.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-11\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1343-16\">. <em>Graybar Electric Company v. Commissioner, </em>267 F.2d 403 (2 Cir. 1959); <em>Harper v. United States, </em>454 F.2d 222 (9 Cir. 1971); <em>Jensen v. United States, </em>511 F.2d 265 (5 Cir. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1344-8\">. The <em>Harper </em>court applied five factors for distinguishing gifts from payments of income which were listed in <em>Poyner v. Commissioner, </em>301 F.2d 287 (4 Cir. 1962). But, as the district court and the <em>Jensen </em>court both noted, these factors are not the complete test for settling gift-or-income problems; they are only means of analyzing the \u201cmost critical consideration\u201d \u2014the intent of the transferor. <em>Commissioner v. Duberstein, </em>363 U.S. 278, 285-86, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1344-23\">. We also agree with the Fifth Circuit that \u201c[i]n this refund suit, we need not reach the question\u201d whether these payments should be treated as long-term capital gains or \u201cwhether, for example, they constitute distribution of corporate profits taxable under Section 301 of the Code, or simply \u2018other income\u2019.\u201d 511 F.2d at 273.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
