Southern Pacific Co., </em>293 F.Supp. 1219 (C.D.Cal.1968), but reserved judgment with respect to costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. We affirmed on the merits. <em>Rosenfeld v. Southern Pacific Co., </em>444 F.2d 1219 (9th Cir. 1971). The district court then entered judgment awarding appellee $30,000 as attorneys\u2019 fees as part of her costs. This is an appeal from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-20\">Section 706(k) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k), provides that in actions under the Act \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs . . . .\u201d Appellant nonetheless challenges the authority of the court to award attorneys\u2019 fees in this case on a number of grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Appellant\u2019s principal argument rests upon the provision of section 713(b) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-12(b), that no person who acted in good faith reliance on a written interpretation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shall be subject to \u201cliability or punishment,\u201d and such a defense \u201cshall be a bar to the action or proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Appellant asserts it relied in good faith upon EEOC guidelines to the effect that state laws prohibiting employment of women in jobs involving lifting of weights greater than stipulated in the statute would not be deemed in conflict with Title VII. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.-1(b) and (c), 30 Fed.Reg. 14,927 (December 2, 1965). Appellant points out that this court held appellant\u2019s good faith defense could not be rejected without an evidentiary hearing (444 F.2d at 1227), and that appellant\u2019s requests for such a hearing have been rejected. Appellant argues that appellee cannot recover attorneys\u2019 fees under section 706(k) unless and until appellant\u2019s \u201cgood faith\u201d defense under section 713(b) is rejected after a proper hearing, for two reasons. If appellant succeeds in establishing a good faith defense, appellant contends, the defense will be \u201ca bar to the action or proceeding\u201d under section 713(b), and therefore appellee will not be the \u201cprevailing party\u201d under section 706(k). In any event, appellant argues, if the good faith defense is established, section 713(b) bars imposition upon appellant of \u201cany liability or punishment,\u201d which appellant contends include costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The premise of the first argument was rejected in our holding on the prior appeal that, under section 713(b), good faith reliance is relevant only to liability for back pay or other damages, and does not bar declaratory or injunctive relief. 444 F.2d at 1227. Even though appellee\u2019s prayer for damages was denied, she prevailed on the merits and obtained declaratory and injunctive relief. She was therefore a \u201cprevailing party\u201d to whom attorneys\u2019 fees may be awarded. <em>Lea v. Cone Mills Corp., </em>438 F.2d 86, 88 (4th Cir. 1971); <em>Clark v. American Marine Corp., </em>320 F.Supp. 709, 710 (E.D.La.1970), <em>aff\u2019d </em>437 F.2d 959 (5th Cir. 1971); <em>see also Parham v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>433 F.2d 421, 429-30 (8th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Appellant\u2019s second argument is more substantial. We conclude, however, that an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under section 706(k) does not constitute the imposition of \u201cliability or punishment\u201d which is barred by section 713(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">The language of the statute does not require a contrary result. Section 706(k) provides that attorneys\u2019 fees may be allowed \u201cas part of the costs,\u201d and appellant concedes that under its interpretation of the statute all costs would be barred. Awarding \u201ccosts\u201d to the prevailing party is the general practice in our court system and is not aptly described as \u201cliability or punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">The meaning of the phrase \u201cliability or punishment\u201d was not specifically discussed in the legislative proceedings. However, it would be contrary to the clear purpose of Congress in authorizing the award of attorneys\u2019 fees in section 706(k) to interpret these words in section 713(b) in such a way as to preclude an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under section 706(k) whenever the discriminator could establish a good faith defense. \u201cCongress . . . enacted the provision for counsel fees \u2014 not simply to penalize litigants who deliberately advance arguments they know to be untenable but, more broadly, to encourage individuals injured by racial discrimination to seek judicial relief under Title II.\u201d <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, </em>390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968). This is equally true of Title VII. As we said in a Title VII case, \u201cThe allowance of reasonable fees in civil rights cases is an important feature of the enforcement provisions of that Act.\u201d <em>Schaeffer v. San Diego Yellow Cabs, Inc., </em>462 F.2d 1002, 1008 (9th Cir. 1972). <em>See also Lea v. Cone Mills Corp., supra, </em>438 F.2d at 88. Reading section 713(b) to bar allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>whenever good faith reliance could be shown would deter private suits challenging suspect EEOC interpretations of Title VII. At best, such suits are unattractive to private litigants. The issues are often complex; the deference accorded the agency\u2019s interpretation of its governing statute makes success unlikely. Yet it is particularly important that private litigants submit such issues to the courts for determination, for the agency itself will not do so. The agency declined to proceed in this case, for example, but this private litigation resulted in a highly significant contribution to the effective enforcement of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Appellant argues that even if attorneys\u2019 fees were not barred by section 713(b), the award was an abuse of the discretion vested in the district court by section 706(k) since appellant simply obeyed a state statute that was valid when appellant acted. We reject this argument for the reasons already stated. The purpose of the award is not simply to punish the defendants but to encourage individuals injured by discrimination to seek judicial relief, and thus secure enforcement of the Act. <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, supra, </em>390 U.S. at 402, 88 S.Ct. at 696. Trial courts have uniformly rejected the suggestion that they should decline to award attorneys\u2019 fees because the defendant relied upon state law. <em>See LeBlanc v. Southern Beil Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>333 F.Supp. 602, 611 (E.D.La.1971), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>460 F.2d 1228 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>Kober v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>325 F.Supp. 467, 473-74 (W.D.Pa.1971), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>480 F.2d 240 (3d Cir. 1973); <em>Local 246, Utility Workers Union v. Southern California Edison Co., </em>320 F.Supp. 1262, 1267 (C.D.Cal. 1970); <em>Richards v. Griffith Rubber Mills, </em>300 F.Supp. 338, 341 (D.Ore.1969). Our footnote reference in <em>Krause v. Sacramento Inn, </em>479 F.2d 988, 990 n. 2 (9th Cir. 1973), is not to the contrary. We do not understand it to mean that the presence of a defense based upon reliance on state law would affect the propriety of awarding to the plaintiff proper attorneys\u2019 fees, but only that the fact that such a defense was presented and litigated might affect the proper amount of the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Finally, appellant argues that the award was excessive in amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The expert testimony as to a proper fee ranged from $12,500 to $50,000. The trial court fixed the fee at $30,000 based upon these factors: (1) plaintiff\u2019s attorneys are \u201chighly respected, experienced and competent\u201d; (2) the case \u201cwas one of precedential significance in a new and fast developing field of law, and involved many complex and difficult legal issues\u201d; (3) the attorneys\u2019 \u201cmanner of handling the issues . . . [was] designed to fix, and [was] successful in fixing, the Court\u2019s attention quickly and precisely on the principal legal issue and in obtaining a favorable resolution thereof\u201d; (4) plaintiff\u2019s attorneys devoted 407 hours to the case over a period of almost four years; and (5) \u201c[b]ased upon the fees customarily charged by other law firms in the legal community of Los An-geles of a reputation and standing similar to those of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u201d a fee in excess of $30,000 would have been charged. These were appropriate considerations. <em>See </em>cases cited in <em>Brandenbur-ger v. Thompson, </em>494 F.2d 885, 890 n. 7 (9th Cir. 1974); <em>Evans v. Sheraton Park Hotel, </em>503 F.2d 177, 187-88 (D.C.Cir. 1974); <em>Waters v. Wisconsin Steel Works, </em>502 F.2d 1309, 1322 (7th Cir. 1974). They fully support the trial court\u2019s evaluation of the worth of counsels\u2019 services.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">We reject appellant\u2019s argument that it was error to include compensation for services rendered solely to obtain the allowance of the attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Miller v. Amusement Enterprises, Inc., </em>426 F.2d 534, 539 (5th Cir. 1970). Our decision in <em>Schaeffer v. San Diego Yellow Cabs, Inc., supra, </em>462 F.2d at 1008 n. 5, is not to the contrary. Attorneys\u2019 fees were not allowed as costs on appeal in <em>Schaef-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>far, both because in that case, as in this case, appellee had not requested them, and because in the particular circumstances of that case the court in the exercise of its discretion declined to award such fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
