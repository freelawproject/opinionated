CARTER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1026-20\">Defendants Lake Oswego School District Board (\u201cthe school board\u201d) and its individual members appeal from the judgment of the district court, enjoining the school board from refusing to grant sick leave benefits for absence due to childbirth, and awarding plaintiff Hut-chison lost wages, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees against the school board and its individual members. Hutchison, on the other hand, appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Lake Oswego School District No. 7 (\u201cthe school district\u201d) on Eleventh Amendment grounds. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-21\">Hutchison was employed for two school years by the school district as a part-time junior high school teacher. On January 27, 1973, she gave birth to a-child, necessitating her absence from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>work for 15 working days. She suffered no complications as a result of either her pregnancy or childbirth. Upon her return to work, she requested that she be allowed sick leave benefits for her absence \u2014 she had accrued 15 days sick leave at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">The school board refused her request on the basis of \u00a7 415.1 of the school district\u2019s Policies and Procedures and Ore.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 342.595, both providing for a minimum amount of sick leave for \u201cillness or injury.\u201d Pregnancy was not deemed to be an \u201cillness or injury\u201d but rather a temporary disability permitting leave without pay. This interpretation was rendered by the superintendent of the Lake Oswego Schools and concurred in by the Director of Legal and Executive Services for the Oregon State Department of Education. The sum of $339.59 was deducted from Hutchison\u2019s wages because of her absence from her job and the necessity of hiring a replacement during her absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">After exhausting all possible administrative remedies, she brought the present suit seeking a declaration that the school district\u2019s maternity leave policy constituted sex discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 2(a). She also sought damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g), and attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">The case was submitted without trial on the briefs and certain stipulated facts. The district court dismissed the school district on the basis of sovereign immunity, but found that the school, board and its individual members had engaged in unlawful sex discrimination in violation of both the Equal Protection Clause and Title VII. The case is reported below in 374 F.Supp. 1056 (D.C. Or.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">The defendants contend on appeal that: the refusal to grant sick leave benefits for normal pregnancy violates neither the Equal Protection Clause nor Title VII; the recovery of back pay and attorney\u2019s fees from the individual school board members is barred by the doctrine of qualified immunity for acts done in good faith and within the scope of their official duties; and such recovery against the school board is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Hutchison contends that the doctrine of sovereign immunity was improperly applied to the school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">EQUAL PROTECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-11\">The decision of the district court was rendered prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Geduldig v. Aiello, </em>417 U.S. 484, 94 S.Ct. 2485, 41 L.Ed.2d 256 (1974), which held that the State of California was not required by the Equal Protection Clause to provide for absences due to normal pregnancy and childbirth under its state disability benefits plan. The. Court stated that the State has a legitimate interest in \u201cdistributing the available resources in such a way as to keep benefit payments at an adequate level for disabilities that are covered, rather than to cover all disabilities inadequately.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496, 94 S.Ct. at 2491. And with respect to the contention that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy constitutes \u201cinvidious discrimination\u201d for purposes of equal protection, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-12\">\u201cThe California insurance program does not exclude anyone from benefit eligibility because of gender but merely removes one physical condition\u2014 pregnancy \u2014 from the list of compensa-ble disabilities. While it is true that only women can become pregnant, it does not follow that every legislative classification concerning pregnancy is a sex-based classification Absent a showing that distinctions involving pregnancy are mere pretexts designed to effect an invidious discrimination against the members of one sex or the other, lawmakers are constitutionally free to include or exclude pregnancy from the coverage of legislation such as this on any reasonable basis, just as with respect to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>other physical condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496-497 n. 20, 94 S.Ct. at 2492.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">The operation of Oregon\u2019s sick leave benefits plan differs somewhat from California\u2019s disability benefits plan, and, unlike the <em>Geduldig </em>defendant, the defendants in the present case did not make a strong showing below that the exclusion of normal pregnancy from the sick leave policy was necessitated by the increased administrative burden and cost of including such pregnancy. However, we hold that <em>Geduldig </em>dictates a similar result in the present ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">Hutchison has not suggested that the policy is a mere pretext designed to effect an invidious discrimination. And inclusion of normal pregnancy in the school district\u2019s sick leave plan would unquestionably \u201cbe substantially more costly than the present program and would inevitably require state subsidy, a higher rate of employee contribution, a lower scale of benefits . . . , or some combination of these measures.\u201d <em>Geduldig, supra, </em>at 495-496, 94 S.Ct. at 2491. We hold that Hutchison cannot validly base her claim on the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">TITLE VII</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">The defendants concede that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>is applicable to the employment practices of the school board, and that the policy in issue is an \u201cemployment practice\u201d within the meaning of Title VII. However, they rely upon Footnote 20 of <em>Geduldig, supra, </em>to support their contention that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is not sex discrimination. But the defendants have greatly overstated the reach of <em>Geduldig </em>in general and Footnote 20 in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-13\">First, the school district cites Footnote 20 as if it states that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is <em>never </em>sex-based. That is not what the Footnote provides. Rather, it states that not <em>every </em>legislative classification concerning pregnancy is sex-based.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-14\">Second, in <em>Geduldig </em>the Court was considering whether such classification violated the Equal Protection Clause. Title VII was not at issue. The school district contends that since the threshold question under Title VII is whether or not there has been discrimination on the basis of sex, and since the Supreme Court in <em>Geduldig </em>has stated that exclusion of pregnancy benefits under a state disability plan is not sex-based, the Court decided the Title VII issue <em>sub silentio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-15\">Title VII, however, unlike the Equal Protection Clause, proscribes classifications which <em>\u201cin any way </em>would deprive <em>or tend to deprive </em>any individual of employment opportunities <em>or otherwise adversely affect </em>[her] status . .\u201d (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This language certainly is conducive to an interpretation different from that premised upon the language of and cases interpreting the Equal Protection Clause. \u201cIn this posture our case is one of statutory interpretation rather than one of constitutional analysis. On this distinction alone we believe appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>[Geduldig] </em>is misplaced.\u201d <em>Wetzel v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>511 F.2d 199, 203 (3 Cir. 1975), <em>cert. granted, </em>421 U.S. 987, 95 S.Ct. 1989, 44 L.Ed.2d 476 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-17\">To effectuate the goals of Title VII, Congress entrusted the promulgation of regulations or guidelines thereunder to the Equal Employment Opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>nity Commission (EEOC). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-4. The guidelines so promulgated are the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute and indicate what are or are not proscribed discriminatory practices. <em>Wetzel, supra, </em>511 F.2d at 204. ' These EEOC guidelines are entitled to \u201cgreat deference\u201d with respect to the proper interpretation of Title VII. <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">The EEOC guideline applicable to the school board\u2019s sick leave policy in the present ease unequivocally provides that the exclusion of pregnancy or childbirth related disabilities from sick leave coverage is a violation of Title VII.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Unless \u201capplication of the guideline would be inconsistent with an obvious congressional intent not to reach the employment practice in question\u201d, the school board\u2019s sick leave policy must be deemed to be violative of Title VII. <em>Espinoza v. Far-ah Mfg. Co., </em>414 U.S. 86, 94, 94 S.Ct. 334, 339, 38 L.Ed.2d 287 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">In enacting Title VII, Congress intended to eliminate all discriminatory employment practices, H.Rep. No. 914, 1964 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 2401, including discriminatory treatment of men and women. <em>See Sprogis v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>444 F.2d 1194, 1198 (7 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 991, 92 S.Ct. 536, 30 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Clearly, a sick leave policy which excludes from coverage absences related to pregnancy or childbirth adversely and disparately affects women with respect to employment benefits. This interpretation is in no way inconsistent with the language of Title VII or congressional intent to eliminate all employment practices which discriminate on the basis of sex. In fact, \u201cover the past decade, Congress has itself manifested an increasing sensitivity to sex-based classifications.\u201d <em>Frontiero v. Richardson, </em>411 U.S. 677, 687, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 1770, 36 L.Ed.2d 583 (1973). <em>See also </em>1972 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 2137 (House Report concerning sex discrimination and the 1972 amendments to Title VII).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">In <em>Sprogis, supra, </em>it was stated with respect to Title VII: \u201cThe effect of the statute is not to be diluted because discrimination adversely affects only a portion of the protected class. Discrimination is not to be tolerated under the guise of physical properties possessed by one sex ... or through the unequal application of a seemingly neutral company policy.\u201d 444 F.2d at 1198. We decline to ratify such discrimination under the facts of this case and in light of a reasonable EEOC guideline specifically proscribing the exclusion of pregnancy from sick leave coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">In the proceedings below, the defendants placed all of their \u201ceggs\u201d in the Footnote 20 \u201cbasket\u201d. On appeal they contend that the exclusion of childbirth from their sick leave policy is justified because pregnancy is voluntary and is , not an \u201cillness or injury\u201d, and because of the administrative burden and cost engendered by adding pregnancy and childbirth related disabilities to the sick leave coverage. In support of this latter de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>fense, they cite statistics in the Brief of Amicus Curiae American Telephone and Telegraph Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">We do not consider factual and legal defenses raised for the first time on appeal. We do n\u00f3te, however, that administrative costs which might justify an employment practice for purposes of equal protection would not necessarily constitute an adequate defense under Title VII. Further, we must assume that the EEOC was aware of the increased costs that would be required in order to comply with its guidelines. And finally, those circuit courts and the majority of district courts which have considered the defenses raised by the school district have held them to be without merit. <em>See, e. g., Wetzel, supra, </em>511 F.2d at 206: \u201cUnder Liberty Mutual\u2019s plan nearly all disabilities are covered. We believe that an income protection plan that covers so many temporary disabilities but excludes pregnancy because it is not a sickness discriminates against women and cannot stand.\u201d <em>See also Gilbert v. General Electric Co., </em>519 F.2d 661 (4 Cir. June 27, 1975); <em>Farkas v. South Western City School Dist., </em>506 F.2d 1400 (6 Cir. 1974), <em>aff\u2019g </em>8 FEP Cases 288 (S.D.Ohio 1974); <em>Vineyard v. Hollister School Dist., </em>64 F.R.D. 580; 585 (N.D.Cal.1974); <em>Sale v. Waverly-Shell Rock Bd. of Educ., </em>390 F.Supp. 784, 788 (N.D.Iowa 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">ELEVENTH AMENDMENT-SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">In <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), the Supreme Court held that retroactive welfare payments awarded against the Illinois Department of Public Aid were barred by the Eleventh Amendment, proscribing monetary awards against a State. In the present case, the district court awarded Hutchison sick leave benefits, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k) against, the school board and its individual members, but dismissed the school district. The defendants contend that <em>Edelman, supra, </em>bars an award of back pay or attorney\u2019s fees against either the school district or school board. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-11\">The most important factor in determining whether a particular agency is the \u201calter ego\u201d of the State for Eleventh Amendment purposes is \u201cwhether .payment of a judgment will have to be made out of the state treasury, i. e., whether the fund in question has both the independent power and resources to pay the judgment without further action by the state legislature or other governmental officer.\u201d <em>Bowen v. Hackett, </em>387 F.Supp. 1212, 1221 (D.R.I.1975). Also important to our decision are the following factors: performance by the entity of an essential government function, ability to sue or be sued, power to take property in its own name or in the name of the State, and corporate status of the entity. <em>George R. Whitten, Jr., Inc. v. State University Construction Fund, </em>493 F.2d 177 (1 Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-12\">The autonomous nature of school districts (and their administrative arms, the district school boards) in Oregon with respect to the factors noted above is evident from a reading of the relevant Oregon statutory provisions. Of primary importance is the fact that most of a school district\u2019s financing comes from local and not state-wide sources. Although the State does aid the various school districts, the amount is based upon the number of resident students and may not be used as an offset to the school district\u2019s own tax levy. Ore.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 327.090.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, the Lake Oswego School District has the <em>power </em>to obtain funds to satisfy a monetary judgment, and is precluded from applying <em>State </em>funds to offset such a levy. A set amount of State aid is awarded each year on the basis of the number of students, an amount which would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>altered by the back pay award in the present c\u00e1se.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">With respect to the other relevant factors, school districts are \u201cbodies corporate\u201d, \u00a7 332.072,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the district school boards may sue and be sued, \u00a7 332.072, may condemn property for school purposes, \u00a7 332.182,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and may contract indebtedness, \u00a7 328.565.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We hold that the analysis of the court in the recent case of <em>Gordenstein v. The University of Delaware, </em>381 F.Supp. 718, 722-723 (D.Del. 1974), is equally applicable to the school district and school board in the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-6\">\u201cSince the state treasury is insulated from a judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, since the University has both the funds and the legal power to satisfy such a judgment, and since under Delaware law the University is an independent corporation exercising virtually complete fiscal and educational autonomy, this Court concludes that the University is not an arm or alter ego of the State of Delaware under the Eleventh Amendment and therefore is not immune from suit. The fact that the University may be assisting the State of Delaware in the performance of a governmental function is not determinative.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">Our holding that neither the school district nor the school board as a body is immune from suit obviates the necessity of deciding two additional contentions raised by Hutchison: (a) that even if this is deemed to be a suit against the State, attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded in conjunction with the granting of prospective injunctive relief; <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (b) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>the states in ratifying the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments <em>consented </em>to Congress\u2019 authority under the enabling clauses of those Amendments to make state and local governments amenable to suit in federal court by individual employees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">QUALIFIED IMMUNITY OF INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">Finally, the individual members of the school board contend that they are protected by a qualified \u201cgood-faith\u201d immunity from liability for damages. We agree. In <em>Scheuer </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 247-248, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1692, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974), the Supreme Court stated: \u201cIt is the existence of reasonable grounds for the belief formed at the time and in light of all the circumstances, coupled with good-faith belief, that affords a basis for qualified immunity of executive officers for acts performed in the course of official conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">Recently, this qualified immunity was extended to school board members acting in good faith. <em>Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975). The Court stated: \u201cThe official must himself be acting sincerely and with a belief that he is doing right, but an act of violating a student\u2019s constitutional rights can be no more justified by ignorance or disregard of settled, indisputable law . . . than by the presence of actual malice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 95 S.Ct. at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">Although the Court was dealing with student discipline in <em>Wood, </em>the principles enunciated are equally applicable in the present circumstances. The school board members did not disregard \u201csettled, indisputable law\u201d since the courts themselves have been split as to whether or not pregnancy may permissibly be excluded from sick leave coverage. The school board specifically asked the State Director of Legal and Executive Services for a ruling on the issue and acted in reliance thereon. Although we conclude that the school board\u2019s exclusion of pregnancy and childbirth related disabilities from sick leave coverage violated Title VII, the board members clearly acted in good faith and within their official capacities and are therefore entitled to qualified immunity from the payment of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-13\">We affirm that portion of the district court\u2019s judgment and opinion finding that the Lake Oswego School District Board\u2019s sick leave policy violates Title VII, enjoining exclusion of pregnancy .and childbirth related disabilities from the plan and awarding back pay, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees against said Oswego School District Board. We reverse the judgment and opinion so far as it dismisses the Lake Oswego School District No. 7 and holds liable the individual school board members for back pay, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees, and we direct that judgment be entered for Hutchison and against Lake Oswego School District No. 7, jointly and severally with Lake Oswego School District Board, for back pay, costs and attorney\u2019s fees; finally, we reverse that portion of the judgment and opinion finding the sick leave policy to be in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-14\">The cause is remanded for entry of judgment accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">.

(1) All taxable property in a school district at the time any indebtedness is incurred by such district and all taxable property subsequently located in the area comprising such district shall be liable to taxation for the payment of such indebtedness until paid.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1031-17\">. This contention finds support in the recent cases of <em>Souza v. Travisono, </em>512 F.2d 1137 (1 Cir. 1975), and <em>Downs v. Department of Public Welfare, </em>65 F.R.D. 557 (E.D.Pa.1974). In <em>Downs </em>the court held that \u201can award of counsel fees is both clearly remedial and an integral part of a decree providing for prospective relief from violations of federal statutory and/or constitutional rights.\u201d Since such fees are incidental to prospective injunctive relief, are necessary to the future compliance with federal law (private attorney general theory), and have a minimal impact on the State treasury, \u201cthe Eleventh Amendment does not bar an order directing individual defendants to satisfy an award of attorneys fees from state funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2271. <em>See also Jordan v.

But I do not believe it violates Title VII either.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-17\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Geduldig v. Aiello, </em>417 U.S. 484, 496-497, incl. fn. 20, 94 S.Ct. 2485, 2492, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-18\">\u201cThe California insurance program does not exclude anyone from benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>eligibility because of gender but merely removes one physical condition\u2014 pregnancy \u2014 from the list of compensa-ble disabilities. . . . Normal pregnancy is an objectively identifiable physical condition with unique characteristics. . . . The program divides potential recipients into two groups \u2014 pregnant women and nonpregnant persons. While the first group is exclusively female, the second includes members of both sexes . There is no risk from which men are protected and women are not. Likewise, there is no risk from which women are protected and men are not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">The Court was clearly saying that any discrimination in California\u2019s program was not because of sex and that any adverse effect the program\u2019s classifications had on plaintiffs there was not in any way due to their sex. A program with such characteristics would not involve illegal sex bias under Title VII [see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 2(a)], and the school district\u2019s sick leave plan is such a program. Plaintiff here has not suggested that the district\u2019s \u201cdistinctions involving pregnancy are mere pretexts designed to effect an invidious discrimination against the members of one sex or the other\u201d [see <em>Geduldig v. Aiello, supra </em>at fn. 20]. On the contrary, the district simply made a reasonable, good faith decision to cover only \u201cillness or injury\u201d in their program and, on good authority, determined that pregnancy is not an illness or injury. (The California program also covered only illnesses and injuries.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">Thus, there are compelling indications that the EEOC guidelines are wrong in treating the district\u2019s pregnancy exclusion as a Title VII violation, so that courts need not defer to them on this point <em>[Espinoza v. Farah Mfg. Co., </em>414 U.S. 86, 94-95, 94 S.Ct. 334, 38 L.Ed.2d 287 (1973)].</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">Since I do not think plaintiff here has any claim on which a federal court may grant her relief, I express no opinion as to whether the Eleventh Amendment bars non-injunctive relief against defendants school district and school board or whether defendant school board members are individually liable for damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
