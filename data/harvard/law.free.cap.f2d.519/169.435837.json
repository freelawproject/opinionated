No. 30. The issues presented all involve sufficiency of the evidence questions, and in each area of concern the Board approved and adopted the findings of the administrative law judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-26\">Specifically, we are required to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the Board\u2019s findings that the Company interfered with, restrained and coerced its employees in violation of Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act; that the Company refused to bargain in good faith with the Union in violation of Section 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act; and that the Company violated Section 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>refusing to reinstate and by discharging unfair labor practice strikers because of their union activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">As is not infrequently the case, we are confronted with a situation in which the administrative law judge chose to discredit the testimony of the witnesses for the petitioner and to credit those of the Union, but we conclude that it cannot be said that there is not sufficient testimony in the record to support the findings of fact adopted by the Board. <em>Universal Camera Corp. </em>v. <em>N.L.R.B., </em>340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Enforcement of the order is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
