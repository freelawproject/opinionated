Appellants argue that the assessment was arbitrary and factually unsupported, and they mount two other attacks on the Judgment, which requires them to pay $479,996.31, plus interest, in wagering taxes for the period from April 1963 to April 1965. The District Court\u2019s Judgment of October 21, 1974 further authorizes the Government to foreclose a lien on Appellants\u2019 real estate in satisfaction of their debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">A procedural problem confronts us at the outset \u2014 compliance with Rule 58, Fed.R.Civ.P. On October 8, 1974, the District Court issued an \u201cOrder,\u201d which contained findings and conclusions and stated that the Court \u201centers summary judgment\u201d for the Government on the issue of Appellants\u2019 liability for the assessed taxes. The \u201cOrder\u201d further stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-10\">[T]he Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its claim that it is entitled to an order foreclosing its liens ... is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">Because a third-party defendant\u2019s cross-claim required a hearing and because the Court found itself unable to enter an order of sale and distribution until this additional matter was decided, it set down the cross-claim for hearing. No \u201cseparate document\u201d was prepared based on this \u201cOrder\u201d which would have made its provisions a \u201cfinal order\u201d under Rule 58. On October 10, 1974, Appellants nonetheless filed a notice of appeal \u201cfrom the Order entered in this proceeding\u201d on October 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-14\">On October 21, 1974, the District Court entered a second \u201cOrder,\u201d which declared that the cross-claim was to be dismissed, the cross-claimant and Appellants having settled their differences. This second \u201cOrder\u201d indicates the District Court\u2019s belief that Appellants desired to appeal its prior \u201cOrder\u201d but had not yet done so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-15\">The defendants have indicated that they intend to appeal this Court\u2019s order of October 7, 1974, [(which was filed on October 8)] in which summary judgment was entered in favor of the Government. Should such an appeal be taken, execution of the decree ordering sale and distribution of the property will be stayed pending appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-16\">On October 21, 1974, a document styled \u201cSeparate Judgment\u201d was entered granting judgment on the Government\u2019s claims against Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-17\">The October 8 \u201cOrder\u201d from which Appellants noticed their appeal was not a final decision appealable to this Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1970). Decisions of the Supreme Court and this Court have made clear the necessity for a \u201cseparate document\u201d under Rule 58 to give this Court jurisdiction of an appeal. <em>United States v. Indrelunas, </em>411 U.S. 216, 93 S.Ct. 1562, 36 L.Ed.2d 202 (1973); <em>Cloyd v. Richardson, </em>510 F.2d 485 (6th Cir. 1975); <em>Columbus Coated Fabrics v. Industrial Commission of Ohio, </em>498 F.2d 408 (6th Cir. 1974); <em>Richland Trust Co. v. Federal Ins. Co., </em>480 F.2d 1212 (6th Cir. 1973). If the October 8 \u201cOrder\u201d were the only docket entry by the District Court, we would be required to remand the case to the District Court for entry of a judgment from which an appeal could be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-18\">Here, however, the District Court did enter a separate document embodying the provisions of the October 8 \u201cOrder.\u201d The uncertainties which the \u201cseparate document\u201d rule were intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>resolve, <em>Indrelunas, </em>411 U.S. at 220 \u2014 21, 93 S.Ct. 1562, pose no problem here, since October 21, when the separate document was entered, is the reference point to resolve disputes concerning the time of the judgment\u2019s efficacy. Although Appellants should have filed a notice of appeal from the October 21 Judgment, they have manifested their intention to appeal therefrom. A final decision exists over which we may exercise jurisdiction, and we construe Appellants\u2019 notice of' appeal as applicable to the October 21 Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Turning to the merits of the appeal, we find Appellants\u2019 objections to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">They contend, first, that the jeopardy assessment was arbitrary and factually unsupported. In opposition to the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment and in the face of the Government\u2019s detailed affidavit showing the manner in which the assessment was calculated, however, Appellants filed no response. When a taxpayer challenges an assessment, he has the burden of coming forward with evidence to show that the assessment is erroneous. <em>United States v. Rexach, </em>482 F.2d 10, 15-17 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1039, 94 S.Ct. 540, 38 L.Ed.2d 330 (1973). <em>Cf. Weir v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>283 F.2d 675 (6th Cir. 1960). Appellants\u2019 total failure to raise objection to the Government\u2019s showing of the basis for its assessment properly resulted in the grant of summary judgment for the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Second, Appellants argue that the search and seizure of materials on which the assessment was based were illegal and that the assessment should therefore be declared improper as well. In a related case, we specifically held that the search and seizure herein were legal. <em>United States v. One 1965 Buick, </em>392 F.2d 672, 678 (6th Cir. 1968), <em>rehearing denied, </em>397 F.2d 782, 784 (6th Cir. 1968). Although in <em>Dean v. United States, </em>402 U.S. 937, 91 S.Ct. 1602, 29 L.Ed.2d 105 (1971), our holding on the applicability of the Fifth Amendment to the forfeiture proceeding in <em>One 1965 Buick </em>was remanded by the Supreme Court for reconsideration in light of <em>United States v. United States Coin and Currency, </em>401 U.S. 715, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 28 L.Ed.2d 434 (1971), we reiterate our holding that the search and seizure were valid and that evidence obtained therefrom properly entered into the assessment of wagering taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">Finally, Appellants argue that they should not be required to pay interest on the amount assessed to the extent that the Government failed to credit them for interest during the period when seized funds were held in violation of their Fifth Amendment rights, as determined in <em>United States v. United States Coin and Currency, </em>401 U.S. 715, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 28 L.Ed.2d 434 (1971).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants requested in 1965 that the Government invest the seized funds in interest-bearing securities, but the request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">Whether funds seized in a forfeiture action must be invested by the Government during the pendency of proceedings is a question not before us. Our only concern is whether the jeopardy assessment and the interest added thereon are proper. Appellants have shown nothing to call into question the validity of the amount of interest assessed. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6601(a) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">The Judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\">. The related proceedings began when the Government sought to have funds forfeited which had been seized during an April 5, 1965 search of Appellants\u2019 premises. This action was eventually dismissed in light of <em>United States Coin and Currency.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
