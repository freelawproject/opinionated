Plaintiff claimed that the bank and the manager had violated \u00a7 10(b) of The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 of The Securities and Exchange Commission, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5, by permitting the brokers to believe that their mutual customer, Pierce, was a man of means and probity. The trial court exonerated the bank and its manager of 10b-5 liability, and the brokers appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-21\">The plaintiffs\u2019 theory was that the bank and its manager \u201caided and abetted\u201d the alleged swindler in his scheme by unwittingly permitting Pierce to use his bank accounts and associations with bank officers to create a false aura of financial and moral responsibility which was essential to the fraudulent scheme and instrumental in causing plaintiffs\u2019 loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-22\">The district court correctly found that the bank\u2019s dealings with Pierce and with the brokers did not render it liable under 10b-5. <em>See White v. Abrams, </em>495 F.2d 724, 735-736 (9th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
