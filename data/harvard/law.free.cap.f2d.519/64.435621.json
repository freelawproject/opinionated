Citizens Casualty Company of New York et al., </em>5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b129-27\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b129-28\">Defendant was tried and convicted of aiding and abetting in the commission of a bank robbery of a federally insured bank in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d) (1970).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>conterids on appeal to this Court that the trial court improperly admitted hearsay evidence and evidence which was obtained in violation of his Miranda rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, he asserts that the evidence presented was insufficient. We find these contentions to, be without merit and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The defendant initially challenges the trial court\u2019s admission of statements made by defendant\u2019s two partners as they accosted a bank guard while defendant waited in the getaway car nearby. The guard testified that one of the bandits told him that he was going to blow his head off at the time when he was initially assaulted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reject out of hand the defendant\u2019s contention that this statement was inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">First, it was said by one of his cohorts in the criminal enterprise then under way. So it is chargeable to him on accepted notions of agency. <em>See, Park v. Huff, </em>5 Cir., 1975, 506 F.2d 849, 859 (en banc); <em>United States v. Gattie, </em>5 Cir., 1975, 511 F.2d 608, 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">It is well established in this Circuit, see, <em>Park v. Huff, supra, </em>at 859 and others, see e. g., <em>Carbo v. United States, </em>9 Cir., 1963, 314 F.2d 718, cert. <em>denied, </em>377 U.S. 953, 84 S.Ct. 1625, 12 L.Ed.2d 498; <em>United States v. Carminati, </em>2 Cir., 1957, 247 F.2d 640, <em>cert. denied, </em>355 U.S. 883, 78 S.Ct. 150, 2 L.Ed.2d 113, that a statement of one conspirator in a crime is admissible against another participant when (i) the declaration is made in furtherance of the conspiracy, (ii) during the pendency of the conspiracy and (iii) when there is independent proof of a nexus between the declarant and the defendant. <em>Carbo v. United States, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">Here all of these elements are unquestionably met, for it would be fatuous for us to conclude that the statement was not made in furtherance of the conspiracy and during the conspiracy. Similarly, there is ample evidence in the record connecting the defendant and the declarant as participants in a common criminal enterprise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-14\">While it is true that at the time this statement was admitted the prosecution had not yet presented any evidence connecting the defendant to the bank robbery attempt, this Court has repeatedly held that the trial court has broad discretion to admit statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy without first establishing the conspiracy and the defendant\u2019s connection therewith.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Nelson v. United States, </em>5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Cir., 1969, 415 F.2d 483, 487; <em>Strauss v. United States, 5 </em>Cir., 1963, 311 F.2d 926; <em>Landers v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1962, 304 F.2d 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Next, the statement was not presented to prove the truth of the matters asserted therein so that its reliability was dependent upon the credibility of the declarant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although not then technically<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> applicable the Federal Rules of Evidence reflect these same views. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">We must also reject the defendant\u2019s argument that his Miranda rights were not fully related to him before custodial interrogation began.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s claims in this regard must be rejected as a matter of fact, for after interrogating the FBI agent as to the specifics of the Miranda warnings which were administered prior to interrogation the Court concluded that all of the Miranda warnings had been read to the defendant, that there existed no coercion and that the statements made by the defendant were made freely and voluntarily.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Finally, on the basis of our many cases,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we reject defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict. The record contains ample evidence upon which a jury could reasonably conclude that defendant aided and abetted in the attempted bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-14\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(a) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-15\">\n<em>\u00a7 2113.

Arizona, </em>1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\">. R. at p. 30, <em>USA v. Grant </em>(No. 74-641-CR-JE). Defense counsel failed to object to either the question or the answer upon which he bases his appeal. The initiative is placed upon the litigants in the trial court to object or make motion to strike and failure to make timely objections to the admission of objectionable evidence is characterized as a waiver of appeal based upon erroneous admission of such evidence. <em>See, McCormick on Evidence, </em>52 at p. 113 (2d ed.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The appellant has also assailed in this appeal a statement made by Mr. Loughery, the bank guard, as to why he believed the defendants were in the bank. <em>See, </em>R. at p. 36. However, the appellant\u2019s objection to this testimony was sustained by the trial court and we fail to see upon what basis the appellant challenges a ruling which was favorable to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b130-10\">. The prosecution presented evidence designed to establish a nexus between the defendant and the bank robbers. For example, the prosecution read into the record a stipulation of the parties prior to trial that the two bank robbers\u2019 fingerprints were found in defendant\u2019s car. <em>See </em>R. at 152-54. There was also testimony that the defendant was seen driving two individuals matching the description of the bank robbers by the bank prior to the holdup and that he was observed parking his car nearby. <em>See </em>R. at 62-76. Also the evidence indicated that the defendant was observed ducking in his car when persons passed by his car and otherwise acting in a suspicious manner as he waited in the parking lot outside the bank, see R. at 121, and that he attempted to flee the scene when the police arrived and foiled the robbery attempt. See R. at 124.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b130-16\">. In other Circuits as well, the trial court has been accorded substantial leeway in admitting statements of co-conspirators against the defendant before establishing the common enterprise. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Acuff, </em>10 Cir., 1969, 410 F.2d 463, <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 830, 90 S.Ct. 82, 24 L.Ed.2d 81; <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>v. Harris, </em>6 Cir., 1968, 391 F.2d 348; <em>Parente v. United States, </em>9 Cir., 1957, 249 F.2d 752.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b131-10\">. Since the Government is not attempting to prove that the statement made by the co-conspirator is true, there is no issue of credibility to be raised. <em>See, Anderson v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 211, 94 S.Ct. 2253, 2260, 41 L.Ed.2d 21 (1974); <em>Braswell v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1952, 200 F.2d 597, <em>cert. denied, </em>350 U.S. 845, 76 S.Ct. 86, 100 L.Ed. 752 (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b131-11\">. The Federal Rules of Evidence are not directly applicable to this case because the proceedings occurred prior to the date upon which the rules became effective.
