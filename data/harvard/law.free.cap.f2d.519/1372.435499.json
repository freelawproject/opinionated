INS, </em>420 U.S. 619, 95 S.Ct. 1164, 43 L.Ed.2d 501 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>(1975). We grant the petition for rehearing, withdraw our previous memorandum, and affirm the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-4\">In the case at bar, the INS charged petitioners with being deportable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(1), on the ground that they were \u201cexcludable ... at the time of entry.\u201d It relied upon 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(20), which deals with and makes excludable immigrants \u201cwho at the time of application for admission [are] not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document required by this chapter . . . .\u201d Petitioners entered this country by falsely claiming to be United States citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-7\"><em>Reid, supra, </em>is similar to the case at bar, but differs in one important respect. There, the stated ground for deportation was 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2), that petitioners \u201centered the United States without inspection.\u201d So far as we can tell, no underlying statute was relied on in <em>Reid. </em>In the case at bar, as in <em>Reid, </em>petitioners rely on the \u201cfraud\u201d exception provided for in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(f). Under our decision in <em>Lee Fook Chuey v. INS, </em>9 Cir., 1970, 439 F.2d 244, petitioners, if they could prove the fraudulent representation as to citizenship, would have been entitled to relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(f). In <em>Reid, </em>however, the Court disagreed with <em>Lee Fook Chuey </em>and held that, under similar circumstances, the aliens did not come within \u00a7 1251(f). The essence of the <em>Reid </em>decision is that \u00a7 1251(f) \u201ctracks the provisions of ... 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(19), dealing with aliens who are <em>exiudable, . </em>.\u201d (420 U.S. at 622, 95 S.Ct. at 1167), and is applicable only when the ground of excludability is \u00a7 1182(a)(19).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-11\">It can be argued that because <em>Reid </em>also rests on the fact that deportability was charged under \u00a7 1251(a)(2), which does not specify excludability, while in the case at bar deportability is charged under \u00a7 1251(a)(1), which does deal with excludability, just as \u00a7 1251(f) does, <em>Reid </em>is not in point. Footnote 2 in the <em>Reid </em>opinion points out that entry without inspection \u201cis ground for deportation under [\u00a7 1251(a)(2)], even though the alien was not excludable at the time of entry under [\u00a7 1251(a)(1)].\u201d And at 623,. 95 S.Ct. 1164, the Court emphasizes the difference between excludability under \u00a7 1251(a)(1) and entry without inspection under \u00a7 1251(a)(2). Thus it can be claimed that <em>Reid </em>does not govern this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-14\">While the answer to this argument is far from clear, at least to us, our study of <em>Reid </em>leads us to the conclusion that <em>Reid </em>does govern this case. We note particularly, in addition to the language about tracking the provisions of \u00a7 1182(a)(19), quoted above, the statement at p. 630, 95. S.Ct. at p. 1171: \u201c[W]\u00e9 do not believe <em>Errico\u2019s [INS v. Errico, </em>1966, 385 U.S. 214, 87 S.Ct. 473, 17 L.Ed.2d 318] holding may properly be read to extend the waiver provisions of [\u00a7 1251(f)] to any of the grounds of ex-cludability specified in [\u00a7 1182(a)] other than subsection 19.\u201d In the case at bar, it is subsection 20, not subsection 19, which is the basis for deportability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
