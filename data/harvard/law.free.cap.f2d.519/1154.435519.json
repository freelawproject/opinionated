The Tax Court\u2019s opinion sets out the facts, which are stipulated for the most part, and applicable law. The Tax Court determined that the benefits sought by the grantors were indirect and intangible and that the value of the land conveyed to taxpayer was a capital contribution within the meaning of \u00a7 118(a), and as such properly excluded from taxpayer\u2019s gross income. The Tax Court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence and not induced by any erroneous view of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">We affirm on the basis of the Tax Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
