In one of those coincidences that makes the law so fascinating, the procedures utilized here are almost the precise reverse of those in <em>Reinertsen v. George W. Rogers Constr. Corp., </em>519 F.2d 531 (2d Cir. 1975), in which this court recently discussed the general problem at length. Robert Fross Staplin appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Richard H. Levet, J., which reduced a jury verdict of $3,500 to $2,335 and directed entry of judgment in the lower amount. For reasons indicated below, we reverse the order of the district court and order judgment in the full amount awarded by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-21\">Plaintiff Staplin injured his right foot while employed in March 1973 as a merchant seaman on the S/S Overseas Ulla, a vessel owned by defendant Maritime Overseas Corp. The circumstances of the accident need not concern us because in a bifurcated jury trial before Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>Levet, defendant was apparently found liable for plaintiff\u2019s damages and does not now complain of that verdict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The second part of the trial covered damages. On this issue, there was evidence before the jury that plaintiff was a chief pump-man aboard the vessel; that he was a \u201cpermanent employee\u201d and would not have had to leave the vessel had he not been injured; that he did leave the vessel on March 22, 1973 with a Master\u2019s Certificate to be treated at the United States Public Health Service Marine Hospital, which pronounced him not fit for duty at that time; and that he was not found fit for duty until May 30, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">The trial was held in March 1974, and plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages was limited to pain and suffering and lost earnings for the period he was not fit for duty. On the issue of lost earnings, plaintiff introduced into evidence exhibit P-2, showing that he had earned $2,125.78 for two months and four days of work on the voyage of the S/S Ulla during which he was injured. There was also a stipulation as to the wages earned by plaintiff in the four year period of 1969-72. These averaged about $6,200 per year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">The judge originally told the jury that it should award plaintiff as compensation for lost earnings what the jury believed \u201cplaintiff would have earned,\u201d that it \u201cmay consider the average\u201d of the four years\u2019 earnings and that it \u201cmay also consider, for whatever aid it may be,\u201d exhibit P-2. The judge furnished the jury a form upon which it was to record its special verdict in response to questions, which are quoted hereafter. After starting deliberations, the jury sent a note which asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-7\">Was plaintiff paid wages while unfit for duty?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">The judge responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-10\">The answer, of course, is no. That\u2019s what the claim is all about as far as past wages are concerned. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-11\">I will explain to you that the proper way to calculate it would be to take an average \u2014 an annual amount for the previous four years and allot four months and six days,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>1 guess it is, and if you believe that\u2019s correct, and it has been proved that he was unable to work because of the accident, then you put that amount, whatever amount you come to, in the special verdict. I think I have answered it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-12\">Is there any question now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-13\">Do you understand, Mr. Foreman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-14\">The Foreman: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-15\">The Court: Is there anybody that doesn\u2019t understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-16\">Have I correctly stated it, Mr. Dooley?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-17\">Mr. Dooley [Plaintiff\u2019s counsel]: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-18\">The jury eventually returned a verdict, in which it answered the questions put to it as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-19\">1. (a) Has plaintiff proved by a fair preponderance of the credible evidence that as a result of the accident of March 1, 1973 he sustained damages consisting of past loss of wages ?</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-20\">/ Yes</p>\n<p id=\"A4a\">No</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-22\">(b) If so, to what award is plaintiff entitled for past loss of wages? $2400.00</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-23\">Proceed to question 2</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-24\">2. (a) Has plaintiff proved by a fair preponderance of the credible evidence that as a result of the accident of March 1, 1973 he sustained damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>consisting of past pain, suffering and disability ? /</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">Yes No</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">(b) If so, to what award is plaintiff entitled for past pain, suffering and disability? $1200.00</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">Proceed to question 3</p>\n<p id=\"A6S\">3. What is the sum of plaintiff\u2019s damages consisting of past loss of wages and past pain, suffering and disability? (Give the sum of 1(b) and 2(b)) $3600.00</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">The jury was then excused. Apparently believing that the jury had not followed his instructions, the judge asked defendant\u2019s counsel to compute Staplin\u2019s average annual earnings for four years and, based upon that, to arrive at a figure for the period plaintiff was unfit for duty. The judge also suggested to counsel that he move to reduce the verdict, which counsel was happy to do. The judge then reduced the figure of $2,400, given by the jury in answer to question 1(b), to $1,135 to make the total verdict $2,335. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected strenuously to the entire procedure, arguing, among other things, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-8\">Mr. Dooley: The objection is that we have had a jury finding which cannot be disturbed. It is a finding of fact and the fact has been transmitted into figures. Any instructions to the jury on the mathematical calculations are at best guidelines and also submitted to them with the fact what were the man\u2019s past earnings records for the previous two months. In fact, it was almost the same period now. So they could very well use that .is a guide in calculating the wages that were lost by the man had he stayed aboard the vessel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">Defendant responded by arguing that plaintiff\u2019s articles terminated when he got off the vessel and there was no proof that he would have stayed on the vessel. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel rejoined that there was such evidence but the court adhered to its earlier ruling, apparently on the ground that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any proof that it [plaintiff\u2019s employment on the vessel] would go on.\u201d Judgment was entered upon the reduced verdict in the sum of $2,335, together with costs. From that judgment plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">Plaintiff argues that the district judge had no right to reduce the jury\u2019s award for damages and enter judgment in the lower amount. According to plaintiff, this infringed his seventh amendment right to trial by jury because there was substantial evidence to support the jury verdict for lost wages. Defendant responds that plaintiff cannot \u201cappeal from a jury instruction to which he specifically agreed\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-13\">There is no doubt that plaintiff has the right to appeal from the judgment in the lower amount. The judge did not use the procedure of ordering <em>a </em>new trial unless plaintiff agreed to remit a specified sum. Had the judge done that and had plaintiff filed a remittitur \u201cunder protest\u201d and then appealed, we would have been faced with the question of appealability discussed at some length, but not decided, in <em>Reinertsen v. George W. Rogers Constr. Corp., supra. </em>Here, the judge simply substituted his judgment for that of the jury and, without any indication of assent by plaintiff, entered judgment in the lower amount. This was clearly a judgment from which plaintiff could appeal. Cf. <em>Kennon v. Gilmer, </em>131 U.S. 22, 30, 9 S.Ct. 696, 33 L.Ed. 110 (1889).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-14\">We assume from the rest of defendant\u2019s argument that what it means is that plaintiff cannot properly complain about the judge\u2019s supplemental charge on the method the jury should use in calculating lost wages because plaintiff agreed to it. Plaintiff responds that he is not attacking the charge. He agreed, he now says, not that the jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>bound to calculate damages based upon an average of his earnings over four years but only that the court\u2019s supplemental charge was a correct statement of defendant\u2019s position. The colloquy is ambiguous. The judge\u2019s statement of \u201cthe proper way\u201d to calculate lost wages \u201cif you believe that\u2019s correct\u201d was not a clear direction to the jury that it was required to use the averaging method.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Obviously, plaintiff\u2019s counsel did not consider it as such. He had just urged the jury to use another method and would hardly have immediately agreed without complaint that his argument had been incorrect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, in a colloquy in the robing room after the main portion of the charge had been given, this very question was discussed, and plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated he would object if the judge told the jury \u201cthe average is what really controls.\u201d The judge never gave such an instruction. Moreover, the judge\u2019s comment went far beyond the brief response called for by the jury\u2019s note.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under all the circumstances, therefore, we hold that plaintiff is not barred from arguing on appeal that the verdict was improperly reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">What we have already said disposes of the substance of the appeal as well. Defendant correctly concedes that a general verdict could not on these facts simply have been reduced by the judge. <em>Kennon v. Gilmer, supra, </em>131 U.S. at 29, 9 S.Ct. 696; <em>Brewer v. Uniroyal, Inc., </em>498 F.2d 973, 976 (6th Cir. 1974); <em>Stewart v. Atlantic Pipe Line Co., </em>470 F.2d 738 (5th Cir. 1972), modified, 479 F.2d 311 (1973), see also 474 F.2d 695 (1973); 6A J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 59.05[3], at 59-61 &amp; n. 36 (2d ed. rev. 1974). Defendant argues, however, that the judge could follow that course here because the verdict was special and did not conform to his charge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We need not examine the validity of the proposition because, as already explained, the jury did not clearly disregard the judge\u2019s charge. We recognize that a trial judge does have the power to alter a jury verdict without consent if he \u201cis satisfied that the issue of liability has been properly determined by the jury and there is no genuine factual issue as to the amount of recoverable damages. .\u201d 6A J. Moore, <em>supra, </em>at 59-61 &amp; n. 37. The judge here may have believed he was doing this. However, as plaintiff\u2019s counsel tried to point out, there was sufficient evidence to create a jury question on the amount of appellant\u2019s lost wages. Exhibit P-2 showed plaintiff\u2019s wages on the same ship he arguably would have worked on had he not been injured. Plaintiff had testified that he could continue to work on the Ulla as long as he wished, and that he left the ship only because of the injury and was given a Master\u2019s Certificate for treatment. Perhaps the judge thought the only evidence that could be considered on lost earnings was the four-year average. But, as indicated above, he did not clearly state this and did not remove exhibit P-2 from the jury\u2019s consideration. Moreover, on this record, such a ruling would have been erroneous.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>The only question remaining is whether we should direct that judgment be entered for the full verdict or should remand for the judge to consider granting a new trial either with or without a remittitur in the disputed amount. On this record, we see no persuasive reason for subjecting the parties to the possibility of a new trial when the stakes are so minimal, or for prolonging a case that should have been terminated long ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">Judgment reversed with directions to enter judgment for the full jury verdict, with interest and costs to plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1035-26\">. We use the word \u201capparently\u201d because the parties have so informed us. There was no complete transcript of either phase of the trial\" transmitted to us as part of the record on appeal,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"aip-dedup-0\">. Plaintiffs stipulated earnings were as follows: 1969 \u2014 $8,732; 1970 \u2014 $8,147; 1971\u2014 $1,671; 1972 \u2014 $6,107.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"ArT\">. The judge later made clear to the jury that he misspoke and meant to say \u201ctwo months and six days.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1036-15\">. Brief for Defendant-Appellee, at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">. Moreover, at the time the judge made this statement, he did not order exhibit P-2 stricken from evidence, which he presumably would have done if it were no longer relevant to the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">. We note also that defense counsel made use of exhibit P-2 in his summation to attack plaintiffs credibility as a witness by arguing that it showed plaintiff had exaggerated his damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">. The supplemental charge relied upon by defendant is additionally ambiguous because it is not clear what the judge\u2019s statement \u201cif you believe that\u2019s correct\u201d refers to. It might refer to \u201cthe proper way\u201d to calculate lost wages, as suggested above, or it could refer to a finding by the jury merely of the number of days plaintiff was not fit for duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1037-15\">. Defendant cites <em>Feinsinger v. Bard, </em>195 F.2d 45 (7th Cir. 1952), but that case only holds that where there is a special verdict, the court will ascertain whether there was evidence to support each part of the jury award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1037-16\">.
