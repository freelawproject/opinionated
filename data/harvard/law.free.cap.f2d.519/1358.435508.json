We upheld the dismissal as to the first eight counts brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, but reversed as to counts IX and X which purported to state claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3). <em>Harrison v. Brooks, </em>446 F.2d 404 (1st Cir. 1971). Trial began in September 1974, and the court granted defendants\u2019 motions for a directed verdict at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case and denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. Plaintiffs now appeal from the judgment of dismissal entered on the directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-12\">In 1964 Textron, Inc. built a factory adjacent to the Harrisons\u2019 home and laid driveways across the residentially zoned area on both sides of the house. The Harrisons brought a mandamus proceeding in state court against defendant Ma-loney to compel him to enforce a zoning by-law which in their view prohibited this use of residentially zoned property. The lower court refused to issue the writ, but the Supreme Judicial Court upheld the Harrisons\u2019 interpretation of the ordinance, staying its writ \u201cto give an opportunity for orderly municipal action in respect to providing legal access to land in the industrial zone.\u201d <em>Harrison v. Building Inspector, </em>350 Mass. 559, 563, 215 N.E.2d 773, 776 (1966). The town then adopted a new by-law purporting to validate all existing ways across residential land to other zoning districts and allowing future access ways by special permit from the zoning board of appeals. The Supreme Judicial Court upheld the by-law as it affected future ways but invalidated it insofar as it sought to legitimate all existing ways without an individual determination of reasonableness. <em>Harrison v. Braintree, </em>355 Mass. 651, 247 N.E.2d 356 (1969). The driveways adjacent to the Harrisons\u2019 property were subsequently abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-17\">Counts IX and X, citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3), allege that after the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s first decision the defendants, acting under color of state law, conspired to deprive plaintiffs of their right to equal protection of the law by \u201curging\u201d and \u201cpersuading\u201d the Braintree planning board to recommend and the town meeting to adopt an unconstitutional and invalid by-law to permit the continued use of the driveways.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971), teaches that if \u00a7 1985(3) reaches conspiracies not motivated by racial animus, it does so only when there is \u201ca class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators\u2019 action.\u201d 403 U.S. at 102, 91 S.Ct. at 1798 [footnote omitted]. The requirement that the discrimination be \u201cclass-based\u201d is not satisfied by an alle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>gation that there was a conspiracy which affected the interests of a class of persons similarly situated with the plaintiffs. Rather, the complaint must allege facts showing that the defendants conspired against the plaintiffs because of their membership in a class and that the criteria defining the class were invidious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">The class asserted by appellants, that of \u201cresidential property owners who own adjacent residential land illegally crossed by industrial access driveways\u201d is descriptive of one group affected by appellants\u2019 dispute with appellees, but has little to do with appellees\u2019 reasons for advocating positions opposed to appellants. <em>See Bricker </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>468 F.2d 1228, 1233 (1st Cir. 1972). The evidence that the adoption of the by-law was motivated by invidious animus against this class rather than the defendants\u2019 perceptions of the town\u2019s best interests is slim indeed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Evidence of animus towards the Harrisons personally <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is not probative. <em>See Turner v. Baxley, </em>354 F.Supp. 963, 973 (D.Vt.1972). As we find no substantial evidence on the record of malice toward residential property owners or subjective realization that the by-law amendment was invalid, we think the court properly directed a verdict. <em>Magnat Corp. v. B &amp; B Electroplating Co., </em>358 F.2d 794, 797 (1st Cir. 1966). Since the newly discovered evidence dealing with the Magaldi guarantee could not have changed the result, the motion for a new trial was also properly denied. <em>See </em>11 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2808, at 59-60 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1423-13\">. During the relevant period defendant Brooks was chairman of the town Industrial Commission; defendant Hunt, town counsel; defendant Magaldi, chairman of the Planning Board; and defendant Maloney, building inspector.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1423-14\">. At trial plaintiffs sought unsuccessfully to amend the complaint to extend the conspiracy backwards in time to encompass the entire period from the construction of the Textron plant forward. Although evidence of events during this period was admitted, the court limited its significance to providing \u201cbackground\u201d for the conspiracy alleged in the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1424-5\">. Defendants testified they opposed the closing of the access roads because the relocation of the industrial plants which might result from this step would cause the town great economic harm. They also testified that they believed the driveways were permissible under the town\u2019s zoning ordinances, an interpretation to which they persuaded the lower court in the mandamus action. In light of this testimony, their refusal to take action to close the roads during this period could not support an inference of malice toward residential owners; nor would Maloney\u2019s deviation from his usual practice of having complainants meet with alleged zoning law violators in order to work out an accommodation or Maloney\u2019s submission of pleadings identical to Textron\u2019s in the mandamus action. Nor does the record show that in responding to the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s invitation to take \u201corderly municipal action\u201d after the driveways were held to violate the zoning by-laws defendants adopted an ordinance they knew to be unconstitutional or were motivated by malice. Magaldi\u2019s acceptance of guarantees from industrial developers on a bank loan he took out bespeaks injudicious self-interest rather than animus toward residential property owners. <em>Cf. Kennedy Park Homes Ass\u2019n v. City of Lackawanna, </em>436 F.2d 108, 112-14 (2d Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 1010, 91 S.Ct. 1256, 28 L.Ed.2d 546 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1424-20\">. <em>E. g., </em>Brooks\u2019 remark to a Textron official during trial of the Harrisons\u2019 state court nuisance action against Textron \u201cI hope you beat [Harrison] and beat him good.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
