Following the disposition of certain procedural motions relating to venue<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the propriety of class representation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the District Court proceeded to the merits of the controversy and, in granting relief, held the denial of pregnancy-related disability benefits vio-lative of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant has appealed, asserting that the exclusion of such disabilities under its employee disability plan is not violative of Title VII and that, in any event, the District Court improperly permitted the action to be maintained as a class action. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-16\">The legislative purpose behind Title VII was to protect employees from any form of disparate treatment because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin or, as one commentator has stated it, \u201cto make employment decisions sex-blind, as well as colorblind.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And that remedial purpose is plainly spelt out in the Act, the sweep of which \u201cextends beyond discrimination in rates of wages,\u201d and which proscribes broadly any adverse discrimination by an employer with respect to \u201ccompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment\u201d on the basis of sex.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c[Tjerms [or] conditions, * * * of employment,\u201d as used in the Act, include \u201cfringe benefits\u201d such as pension rights and retirement and disability benefits, all of which are now well recognized as \u201cintegrally related to the entire wage structure.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has so declared in its guidelines <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> issued under the Act. Nor is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>the defendant in any position to contend that \u201cfringe benefits\u201d are not included in \u201cconditions of employment,\u201d for it has stated in its 1966 Annual Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\">\u201cCompensation at General Electric is interpreted broadly to include not only monetary returns but also the value of benefit programs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">It would seem necessarily to follow, therefore, that any limitations or restrictions on disability benefits imposed by the defendant under its program of employee benefits which may be found to be sex-based would represent a discrimination in the \u201ccompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment\u201d within the proscription of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Pregnancy-related disabilities are, however, excluded from the disability benefits available under the defendant\u2019s employee benefit program. It is specifically this restriction upon the benefits available under the program which has prompted this controversy and which the plaintiffs seek by their action to invalidate. Pregnancy is a condition unique to women and a basic characteristic of their sex. A disability program which, while granting disability benefits generally, denies such benefits expressly for disability arising out of pregnancy, a disability possible only among women, is manifestly one which can result in a less comprehensive program of employee compensation and benefits for women employees than for men employees; and would do so on the basis of sex. \u201c[W]omen, to be treated without discrimination [under the Act], must be permitted to be women,\u201d and this means a right to be \u201cwomen\u201d without being burdened by any discrimination in employment benefits, whether in wages or in fringe benefits, on account of characteristics peculiar to their sex.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is of no moment that an employer may not have deliberately intended sex-related discrimination; the statute looks to \u201cconsequences,\u201d not intent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Any discrimination, such as that here, which is \u201cinextricably sex-linked\u201d in consequences and result, is violative of the Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In so concluding, we are following the opinion reached by most of the Courts which have considered the issue<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and are giving effect to the construction of the Act as adopted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in its guidelines, to which the courts are directed to give \u201cgreat deference\u201d in applying the Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>The defendant insists, however, that this pregnancy related disability exclusion provision in its plan cannot be deemed discriminatory since its plan only offers benefits <em>during sickness </em>and pregnancy confinement cannot be regarded as a sickness. Its basis for arguing that pregnancy confinement is not a sickness is that such disability is \u201cvoluntary.\u201d The plan, by its provisions, covers disabilities resulting from non-occupational sickness and accident. It incorporates no definition of either \u201cdisability\u201d or \u201csickness,\u201d though it does state that \u201cnon-occupational\u201d means \u201cany sickness or injury not arising out of or in the course of employment and not entitling you or a covered dependent to benefits under any Workmen\u2019s Compensation or Occupational Disease Act.\u201d While a number of decisions, relying on this idea of voluntarism, has, particularly in the construction of insurance contracts, refused to characterize childbirth as a sickness,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the rule generally followed in labor arbitration cases is to equate pregnancy disability and sickness and to find an employee entitled to the same disability benefits in pregnancy confinement as in the case of any other disability under an employee sickness benefit program. <em>See Middleton Board of Education, </em>56 LA 830 (1971); <em>National Lead Co., </em>18 LA 528 (1952); <em>Republic Steel Corp., </em>37 LA 367 (1961).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under the circumstances, it would seem that whether pregnancy disability was within the coverage offered by the plan would be an issue that would turn largely on the construction of the plan as followed by the defendant itself. The record appears clear that, other than for childbirth disability, the defendant had never construed its plan as eliminating <em>all </em>so-called \u201cvoluntary\u201d disabilities. It has, as the District Court stated, applied its plan to <em>\u201call </em>disability, including cosmetic surgery, disabilities arising from attempted suicides, etc.\u201d except those occurring during childbirth.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In short, the defendant raises this defense of \u201cvoluntarism\u201d only against a disability that is unique to women and disregards it in connection with any claim for disability submitted by male employees. Whatever facile plausibility there might be to the argument that its plan does not cover \u201cvoluntary\u201d disabilities accordingly disappears in the face of the manner in which the defendant itself has construed and applied its plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The main thrust of the defendant\u2019s argument in this Court, however, is that the recent decision in <em>Geduldig v. Aiello </em>(1974) 417 U.S. 484, 94 S.Ct. 2485, 41 L.Ed.2d 256, authoritatively determined that, contrary to the conclusion of the District Court below and the guidelines of the Commission, disparity in treatment between pregnancy-related and other disabilities cannot be classified as sex discrimination prohibited under either the Equal Protection Clause or Title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>VII. We do not read <em>Aiello </em>as so holding as applied to an action under Title VII. Nor has it been so read in the two recent Circuit decisions, which have faced directly this problem.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Aiello </em>dealt with a constitutional attack under the Equal Protection Clause on a <em>legislatively </em>created social welfare program for private employees in which a differentiation between pregnancy-related and other disabilities was made. In that context the Court applied the customary standards in testing legislation under the Equal Protection Clause and held that, \u201c[AJbsent a showing that distinctions involving pregnancy are mere pretexts designed to effect <em>an invidious discrimination </em>against the members of one sex or the other, <em>lawmakers are constitutionally free </em>[under the Fourteenth Amendment] to include or exclude pregnancy from the coverage of legislation such as this on any reasonable basis * * <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Italics added) In line with this, it added in note 20<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> of the opinion, that not \u201cevery legislative classification concerning pregnancy is a sex-based classification like those considered in <em>Reed, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Frontiero, supra.\" </em><footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In essence, its holding was simply that a legislative classification incorporating a pregnancy-childbirth classification was \u201crationally supportable\u201d in a social welfare program under the Fourteenth Amendment and that it did not amount to an \u201cinvidious discrimination\u201d under the Equal Protection Clause. And this was all that was required to sustain the legislation against an Equal Protection assault. It should be noted, perhaps parenthetically, that the' opinion in <em>Aiello </em>did not declare that the distinction in disability benefit rights in that case between males and females, a distinction which excluded pregnancy-related disabilities, was not discriminatory. In fact, the language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the Court indicates rather clearly that the Court considered the differentiation discriminatory. What it concluded was, as we have said, that such discrimination was not \u201cinvidious\u201d and was not without a rational relationship to the objective of the legislature in establishing the social welfare program under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">In this case, on the contrary, the issue is not whether the exclusion of pregnancy benefits under a social welfare program is \u201crationally supportable\u201d or \u201cinvidious\u201d but whether Title VII, the Congressional statute, in language and intent, prohibits such exclusion. Accordingly, as the Court in <em>Wetzel v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., supra, </em>aptly observed, \u201cour case is one of statutory interpretation rather than one of constitutional analysis.\u201d There is a well-recognized difference of approach in applying <em>constitutional </em>standards under the Equal Protection Clause as in <em>Aiello </em>and in the statutory construction of the \u201csex-blind\u201d mandate of Title VII. To satisfy constitutional Equal Protection standards, a discrimination need only be \u201crationally supportable\u201d and that was the situation in <em>Aiello, </em>as well as in <em>Reed </em>and <em>Frontiero. </em>The test in those cases was legislative reasonableness. Title VII, however, authorizes no such \u201crationality\u201d test in determining the propriety of its application. It represents a flat and absolute prohibition against all sex discrimination in conditions of employment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It is not concerned with whether the discrimination is \u201cinvidious\u201d or not. It outlaws <em>all </em>sex discrimination in the conditions of employment. It authorizes but a single exception to this statutory command of non-discrimination and that is a narrow one<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> which, to be upheld, requires a finding that it is \u201cnecessary to the safe and efficient operation of the business.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Lorillard Corporation </em>(4th Cir. 1971) 444 F.2d 791, 798, <em>cert. dis. </em>404 U.S. 1006, 92 S.Ct. 573, 30 L.Ed.2d 655. The defendant makes no claim for relief under this exception.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Its denial of pregnancy-related disability from the application of its employee disability benefit program, in our opinion, falls clearly within the prohibitions of Title VII and <em>Aiello </em>confers no immunity for such denial. The District Court properly so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">We find equally without merit the contention of the defendant that this class action falls within subsection (b)(3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>of Rule 23, compelling compliance with the requirement of personal notice as held in Sisen.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This is not a (b)(3) action; it is an action in equity for injunc-tive relief and falls within the mold of subsection (b)(2), as the District Court properly ruled. The notice requirements imposed by the District Court were adequate for an action under subsection (b)(2). <em>Robinson v.

Martin Marietta Corp. </em>(1971) 400 U.S. 542, 545, 90 S.Ct. 496, 27 L.Ed.2d 613; <em>Griggs v.

The defendant urges that this waffling by the Commission renders the present guidelines poor guides to a construction of the Act and that we should look to the earlier opinions of the Commission for guidance \u2014 or, at least, should give minimal weight to the Commission\u2019s guidelines. This argument was pressed on the Court in <em>Wetzel v.

All of this, however, is beside the point as we see it. We are of the opinion, as was the District Court, that the guidelines, as presently promulgated, are merely expressive of what is the obvious meaning and purpose of the Act. We entertain no doubt that it was the legislative purpose in enacting Title VII to prohibit any disparity of treatment in compensation and conditions of employment between men and women and this included any disparity that might be sex-related in fringe benefits. <em>And this would be our opinion, whatever might be the language of the Commission\u2019s guidelines.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b729-8\">. <em>Mutual Benefit Health &amp; Acc.

The guidelines specifically reject the following as justifiable discrimination under the \u201cbona fide occupational qualification\u201d rubric: refusal to hire a woman based on assumptions about the \u201ccomparative employment characteristics of women in general\u201d (for example, the assumption that women\u2019s turnover rates are higher than those of) men); refusal to hire an individual based on sexual stereotypes; refusal to hire because of client or co-worker preferences. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1604.-2(a)(l)(i)-(iii).

While the defendant disclaimed consistently any intention of asserting a business necessity defense under Section 703(e) of the Act, it did offer considerable evidence on the \u201cbusiness considerations\u201d which prompted its exclusion of childbirth disability in its employee benefit plan. It regarded this evidence as \u201cmaterial,\u201d to quote its own brief, \u201cnot because of a Section 703(e) reason, but rather because it shows the absence of pretextual motivation under the <em>Geduldig, supra, </em>rationale.\u201d [p. 12, Reply Brief] Since we do not consider <em>Geduldig </em>in point here, it is unnecessary to consider this evidence. It might be noted, though, that these same \u201cbusiness considerations\u201d were marshalled in opposition to the enactment of the Equal Rights Law one year before the enactment of Title VII and were discarded by the Congress. <em>See </em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 1963, pp. 687 and 689. Since the two Acts <em>(i.e., </em>the Equal Pay Law and Title VII as directed at sex discrimination) had a similar purpose, Congress no more regarded \u201cbusiness considerations,\u201d that is, claimed greater absenteeism by women employees, etc., as a basis for escape from the prohibitions of Title VII than it did for the Equal Pay Law. <em>See, </em>Note, 84 <em>Harv.L.Rev., supra, </em>at p. 1174.

Liberty Mutual Insurance </em>Co., <em>supra, see 421 </em>U.S. 1011, 95 S.Ct. 2415, 44 L.Ed.2d 679 (1975), the District Court should perhaps defer further proceedings herein until after <em>Wetzel </em>is decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b732-6\">WIDENER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AQ9\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"ARV\">I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion that the exclusion of pregnancy related disability from the application of an employee disability benefits program is prohibited by Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">I think such a holding is precluded by the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Geduldig v. Aiello, </em>417 U.S. 484, 94 S.Ct. 2485, 41 L.Ed.2d 256 (1974). Although that case involved an action brought under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and not Title VII, the decision should control here.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2 provides in part that it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against an individual because of the individual\u2019s sex. The inquiry in this case must therefore focus initially on whether the exclusion of pregnancy related disability from the disability benefits plan is sex discrimination. If it is not sex discrimination, then, regardless of what test is applied, there is no Title VII violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">The court, in <em>Geduldig, </em>held that the exclusion of pregnancy from a state disability insurance plan for employees of private employers was not a classification that would support a finding of sex discrimination, since it was not shown that distinctions involving pregnancy were mere pretexts designed to effect an invidious discrimination against one sex. 417 U.S. at 496-97, n. 20, 94 S.Ct. 2485. Such a showing was not made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">The Court said of the California insurance plan, \u201cThere is no evidence in the record that the selection of the risks insured by the program worked to discriminate against any definable group or class in terms of the aggregate risk protection derived by that group or class from the program. There is no risk from which men are protected and women are not. Likewise, there is no risk from which women are protected and men are not.\u201d <em>Geduldig, </em>417 U.S. at 496-97, 94 S.Ct. at 2492. In a footnote, 417 U.S. at 496, n. 20, 94 S.Ct. at 2492 in reply to the dissenting opinion, the Court explained that the pregnancy exclusion is a \u201cfar cry from cases like <em>Reed . </em>and <em>Frontiero . </em>. . involving discrimination based upon gender as such,\u201d and most importantly continued: \u201cThe California insurance program does not exclude anyone from benefit eligibility because of gender but merely removes one physical condition \u2014 pregnancy \u2014 from the list of compensable disabilities.\u201d 417 U.S., n. 20, p. 496, 94 S.Ct. p. 2492. And later in the same footnote appears the flat statement which should control our case: \u201cThe lack of identity between the excluded disability and gender as such under this insurance program becomes clear upon the most cursory analysis.\u201d 417 U.S., n. 20, p. 497, 94 S.Ct. p. 2492.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-15\">Absent a showing of sex discrimination, Title VII, even if its reach were broader than the equal protection clause, would not render unlawful a pregnancy exclusion such as that involved here. Since the Supreme Court has held, for precisely the same exclusion, there is a \u201clack of identity between the excluded disability and gender as such,\u201d the exclusion should no more support a finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>discrimination under Title VII than under the equal protection clause. And since, as the Court says, the exclusion is \u201cmerely\u201d the removal of \u201cone physical condition \u2014 pregnancy \u2014 from the list of compensable disabilities,\u201d no reason appears why a collective bargaining agreement may not lawfully do by contract what a state may do by legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">But, in this circuit, the reach of Title VII is not broader than that of the Fourteenth Amendment. We have held that \u201cthe test of validity under Title VII is not different from the test of validity under the fourteenth amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Chesterfield County School Dist., S. </em>C., 484 F.2d 70, 73 (4th Cir. 1973).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Unless this court intends to alter its position as just above stated, it is required to reverse the decision below because of the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Geduldig. </em>If the test is \u201cnot different,\u201d there can be no justification for the finding of discrimination here.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Additional reasons for my disagreement are the illogical results bound to follow. For example: a state\u2019s disability benefit plan for its own employees covered by Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b), would, under our holding, not be allowed to exclude pregnancy from its coverage. However, such an exclusion could be made freely in a state plan for employees of private employers such as that in <em>Geduldig. </em>I fail to see the justification for the inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">I grant the majority opinion is most persuasively written. Nevertheless, after many readings, I am left with the impression that, read as a whole, it very nearly follows the rationale of the dissenting justices in <em>Geduldig </em>which has been rejected by a majority of the court as emphasized in footnote 20 above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">In sum, I am of opinion <em>Geduldig </em>was written with an eye to Title VII cases certain to come, not in a vacuum and not with self imposed blinders, and came to the only result logically possible when we consider that the Court must be the even handed arbiter in all cases, not only those involving equal protection. I even assume that the result in <em>Geduldig </em>may not be as socially desirable as the minority there argues for, and the majority here obtains. But social desirability is not the aim. The aim is to construe the statute in view of applicable precedent and legislative purpose. And Title VII seeks to equalize opportunity, not create an advantage for either men or women. If Congress wishes to legislate in favor of pregnant women, I see no constitutional impediment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> legislatures have made less rational classifications for centuries. But, I submit, Congress did not so undertake in Title VII.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\">. Indeed, the very opinion of the district court affirmed here indiscriminately cites equal protection and Title VII cases in support of its position. That the rule in this circuit as recited from the <em>Chester\u00f1eld County </em>case is a widespread practice is pointed out in a comment in 75 Col.Law Review, 441, 464, 467 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"akp-dedup-0\">.
