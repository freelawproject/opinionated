Most of appellees\u2019 proof consisted of general unsupported claims of sales in unspecified amounts. Specifically identified sales totaled about $100 over an eight-year period. This was not enough to establish, as a matter of law, that the marketability test of <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>390 U.S. 599, 88 S.Ct. 1327, 20 L.Ed.2d 170 (1968), was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">The record also supports the Secretary\u2019s finding that the red, gold, and pink decomposed granite found on appellees\u2019 claims was a \u201ccommon variety\u201d of stone and, by the terms of 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 611, therefore could not be the basis for a valid mining claim. The record shows that a large quantity of colored decorative decomposed granite similar to appellees\u2019 was available from other deposits in the same general marketing area. The Secretary therefore properly compared the price of appellees\u2019 decomposed granite only with the price of this similar decorative granite, and not with the price of all decomposed granite, in determining that appellees\u2019 granite did not have a \u201cdistinct and special value.\u201d <em>Brubaker v. Morton, </em>500 F.2d 200 (9th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">Reversed and remanded for entry of summary judgment for appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
