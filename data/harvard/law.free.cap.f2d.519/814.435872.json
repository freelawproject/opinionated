As a result, the dispute raises a question of the interpretation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement which the parties agreed by Article XIII to resolve by arbitration. We note that the union recognizes that if it had no right to strike, an Article XIII arbitrator could assess damages against it. We therefore affirm the order of the district court staying the employer\u2019s suit for money damages and accompanying equitable relief until such time as arbitration under Article XIII of the Collective Bargaining Agreement has been carried to completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-24\">Because we view the company\u2019s suit as one principally and substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>for money damages, we think that the district court\u2019s order staying the law suit pending arbitration was an appealable one. Chapman v. International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union, 401 F.2d 626 (4 Cir. 1968). We deny the union\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">\n<em>Affirmed; motion to dismiss denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
