The bankruptcy judge to whom this argument was made below rejected the Government\u2019s objection to his jurisdiction over this matter. On review, the district court was of the opinion that the Government\u2019s position was an incorrect one, but concomitantly concluded that its appeal was premature. 377 F.Supp. 798. We agree with the latter conclusion and so find no occasion to decide the extent of the bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction in cases involving the potential federal tax liability of bankrupts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>\u2022 Lloyd James Durensky filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy on February 25, 1972, naming the United States as a creditor by virtue of approximately $90,-000 in income taxes alleged to be due and owing for the years 1964 and 1965. The Government was duly notified of the First Meeting of Creditors and was further informed that the bankruptcy court had set May 22, 1972, as the last day for filing objections to Durensky\u2019s discharge and for filing applications pursuant to section 17c(2) of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(c)(2),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to determine the dis-chargeability of debts claimed to be non-dischargeable under the Act. The Government, however, neither filed a proof of claim nor participated in any way in the bankruptcy proceedings. On May 25, 1972, the bankruptcy court entered an order granting Durensky a discharge of his debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">While Durensky was being absolved of his debts and given a fresh fiscal start, the Internal Revenue Service was completing its slow but inexorable investigation of the bankrupt\u2019s potential tax liability. On August 8, 1972, the IRS finally concluded that Durensky did in fact owe the Government $90,000 in income taxes for 1964 and 1965, and so presented him with a Final Notice Before Seizure, demanding payment. Durensky responded to this sudden demonstration of interest by returning to the bankruptcy court and filing an application to determine the dischargeability of his tax debts, pursuant to section 17c(l) of the Act. The bankruptcy judge issued a temporary restraining order on August 14, restraining the Government from seizing any of Durensky\u2019s property pending a hearing on the merits of the dispute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Government immediately objected to the bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction over this tax controversy, on the ground that the Government had not filed a proof of claim in the prior proceedings. After a lengthy delay, the bankruptcy judge held a hearing on the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Duren-sky\u2019s application, and on December 21, 1973, the judge entered an order denying the Government\u2019s motion and setting a date for a hearing on the merits of the dischargeability issue. The Government chose to appeal this order to the district court, in accordance with section 2a(10) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 ll(a)(10).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On May 28, 1974, after an extensive and thoughtful discussion of the jurisdiction of bankruptcy courts in tax controversies, the district court concluded that regardless of the strength of the Government\u2019s jurisdictional contentions, its appeal of the interlocutory order denying its motion to dismiss was \u201cpremature and piecemeal.\u201d 377 P.Supp. at 805 \u2014 06. Accordingly, the court remanded the case to the bankruptcy judge for a hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">Although the district court is a \u201cbankruptcy court,\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1(10), endowed with a broad power to review and modify the actions of bankruptcy judges, <em>see </em>n. 5, <em>supra; </em>this Court can exercise only a general appellate review in bankruptcy matters. <em>Willyerd v. Buildex Co., </em>6 Cir. 1972, 463 F.2d 996, 1001 n. 1; 2 Collier, Bankruptcy \u00b6 24.05[1] (14th ed. rev. 1975). Our power of review is conferred by section 24a of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 47(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-6\">The United States courts of appeals are invested with appellate jurisdiction from the several courts of bankruptcy , in their respective jurisdictions in proceedings in bankruptcy, either interlocutory or final, and in controversies arising in proceedings in bankruptcy, to review, affirm, revise, or reverse, both in matters of law and in matters of fact: <em>Provided, however, </em>That the jurisdiction upon appeal from a judgment on a verdict rendered by a jury shall extend to matters of law only: <em>And provided further, </em>That when any order, decree, or judgment involves less than $500, an appeal therefrom may be taken only upon allowance of the appellate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1091-11\">Section 24a thus distinguishes between \u201cproceedings in bankruptcy\u201d and \u201ccontroversies arising in proceedings in bankruptcy;\u201d appeals may be taken as of right from either interlocutory or final orders in the former type of matter, but only from final orders in the latter variety. <em>Diamond Door Co. v. Lane-Stanton Lumber Co., </em>9 Cir. 1974, 505 F.2d 1199, 1203; <em>In re Charmar Investment Co., </em>6 Cir. 1973, 475 F.2d 560, 563, <em>cert. denied sub nom. Charmar Investment Co. v. City National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>414 U.S. 823, 94 S.Ct. 123, 38 L.Ed.2d 56. Unfortunately, the distinction between \u201cproceedings\u201d and \u201ccontroversies\u201d has long eluded concise and easily ascertainable definition, so that the courts have adopted what is tantamount to a case-by-case approach for the classification of particular disputes. <em>See Texas &amp; N.O.R. Co., </em>5 Cir. 1954, 211 F.2d 419, 421-22, <em>cert. denied, </em>1955, 348 U.S. 913, 75 S.Ct. 293, 99 L.Ed. 716; <em>United Kingdom Mutual S.S. Assur. Assoc. v. Liman, 2 </em>Cir. 1969, 418 F.2d 9, 10. As a general rule, \u201cproceedings\u201d are those matters of an administrative character, including questions between the bankrupt and his creditors which are presented in the ordinary course of the administration of the bankrupt\u2019s estate. \u201cControversies,\u201d on the other hand, are usually described as matters which arise in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings and which are not mere steps in the ordinary administration of the bankrupt, but which present distinct and separable issues between the trustee and adverse claimants concerning the right and title to the bankrupt\u2019s estate. <em>See Taylor v. Voss, </em>1926, 271 U.S. 176, 180-81, 46 S.Ct. 461, 463, 70 L.Ed. 889, 892; <em>In re Merle\u2019s, Inc., </em>9 Cir. 1973, 481 F.2d 1016, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>1018; <em>United Kingdom Mutual S.S. Assur. Assoc. v. Liman, supra, </em>418 F.2d at 10; 2 Collier, <em>supra, </em>lit 24.12-24.36. Another approach to the elusive distinction was taken in <em>United Kingdom Mutual, </em>where the Second Circuit attempted to differentiate the two types of matters by reasoning that a proceeding contains a \u201ccontroversy\u201d if the matter involves a claimant \u201c[who] raises a dispute with regard to the propriety of including property in the estate for distribution, rather than a question with regard to the administration of the estate once it is amassed.\u201d 418 F.2d at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">Although we have been unable to discover any instance in which a section 17c(l) application such as that filed by Durensky here has been denominated either \u201cproceeding\u201d or \u201ccontroversy,\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we believe that it is a clear as anything can be in this terminological morass that the instant case constitutes a \u201cproceeding.\u201d If we scrutinize the application for a determination of the dischargeability of a debt for evidence of the common characteristics of a \u201cproceeding,\u201d we find that the section 17c(l) motion begins as a proceeding, that is, by an application by the bankrupt as to which the bankruptcy court applies its summary procedures. It is also true that such a motion occurs in the ordinary course of the bankruptcy proceedings, in that it is an integral \u2014 although not inevitable \u2014 part of bankruptcy adjudications. Finally, if we apply either the traditional definition of \u201ccontroversy\u201d or that proposed in <em>United Kingdom Mutual, </em>we think it apparent that the Government has not challenged the right and title to any part of the bankrupt\u2019s estate as it existed before discharge, nor has the Government questioned the propriety of the inclusion of any particular property in the estate; rather, the Government contends that Durensky\u2019s discharge has had no effect upon his tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">The denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is an interlocutory order which is not ordinarily appeala-ble under the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d rule of 28 U.S.C.' \u00a7 1291. <em>See Catlin v. United States, </em>1945, 324 U.S. 229, 236, 65 S.Ct. 631, 635, 89 L.Ed. 911, 917-18; <em>Wallace v. Norman Industries, Inc., </em>5 Cir. 1972, 467 F.2d 824, 825; <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Dulien Steel Products, Inc., </em>5 Cir. 1957, 240 F.2d 414, 415, <em>cert. denied, </em>356 U.S. 968, 78 S.Ct. 1008, 2 L.Ed.2d 1074. We have seen, however, that section 24a of the Bankruptcy Act departs from the general rule and affords appeals as of right from both interlocutory and final orders in proceedings in bankruptcy. It might appear, therefore, that the district court\u2019s order of remand in the instant case \u2014 with its concomitant refusal to reverse the bankruptcy judge\u2019s denial of the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss\u2014 would surely be an appealable order in view of our determination that this case is a proceeding in bankruptcy. Such a sweeping conclusion would be ill-advised however, for the courts of appeals have interpreted section 24a so as to allow appeals from interlocutory orders in proceedings only when the orders dispose of some right or duty asserted by one of the parties. <em>See, e. g., City of Fort Lauderdale v. Freeman, </em>5 Cir. 1952, 197 F.2d 122, 124; <em>Sherr v. Sierra Trading Corp., </em>10 Cir. 1974, 492 F.2d 971, 975; <em>In re Charmar Investment Co., supra, </em>475 F.2d at 563; <em>Cope v. Aetna Finance Co., </em>1 Cir. 1969, 412 F.2d 635, 639; <em>Dubnoff v. Goldstein, </em>2 Cir. 1967, 385 F.2d 717, 722; <em>Carolina Mills v. Corry, 4 </em>Cir. 1953, 206 F.2d 76, 77; <em>In re Chicago Rapid Transit Co., </em>7 Cir. 1953, 200 F.2d 341, 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-7\">The obvious explanation for this judicial gloss on the statutory language is that if every word issuing from the bankruptcy judge\u2019s mouth or pen were to be a proper subject for immediate review by the district court and the court of appeals, bankruptcy proceedings would cease to offer a reasonably swift resolution of pressing economic difficulties. <em>See Georgia Jewelers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bulo-va Watch Co., </em>5 Cir. 1962, 302 F.2d 362, 364; 9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice T 110.-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>19[5]; <em>see also Digital Data Systems, Inc. v. Carpenter, </em>5 Cir. 1967, 387 F.2d 529, 533. This Court has consistently ruled that in order for an interlocutory order in a bankruptcy proceeding to be appealable as of right, it must possess a \u201cdefinitive operative finality.\u201d <em>In re Wingreen Co., </em>5 Cir. 1969, 412 F.2d 1048, 1050; <em>Georgia Jewelers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bulova Watch Co., supra, </em>302 F.2d at 364; <em>cf. In re Transystems, Inc., </em>5 Cir. 1974, 499 F.2d 416.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\"> We do not believe that the order under consideration here has any such \u201cdefinitive operative finality.\u201d We are presented with a district court\u2019s order of remand to the bankruptcy judge after a refusal to reverse that judge\u2019s refusal to dismiss Durensky\u2019s application for lack of jurisdiction; upon remand, the bankruptcy judge would presumably hold the hearing on the merits of Durensky\u2019s claim of discharge that has been delayed for over two years since the filing of the bankrupt\u2019s section 17c(l) application. The very description of the order and the chronological results of the Government\u2019s attempts to appeal therefrom indicate that this order ought not to be reviewable at this time.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> An order denying a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is perhaps unique in its incapacity permanently to affect the rights of the moving party, for jurisdictional defects may be recognized by a court at any time, on the motion of the parties or on its own motion. <em>See American Fire &amp; Cas Co. v. Finn, </em>1951, 341 U.S. 6, 17-18, 71 S.Ct. 534, 541-42, 95 L.Ed. 702, 710 \u2014 11; <em>Mansfield, Coldwater &amp; Lake Michigan Ry. v. Swan, </em>1884, 111 U.S. 379, 382-83, 4 S.Ct. 510, 511-12, 28 L.Ed. 462, 464. It is therefore possible \u2014 although not likely \u2014 that on remand the bankruptcy judge will think better of his assertion of jurisdiction and dismiss Durensky\u2019s application, or that upon a review of the bankruptcy judge\u2019s decision on the merits, the district court will reconsider its position on the matter. It was this inherent tentativity in the bankruptcy judge\u2019s order that caused the district court to conclude that a review of that order should await a decision on the merits of the controversy. 377 F.Supp. at 805 \u2014 806. We have discovered no circumstances which would compel a different disposition of the appeal in this court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>In conclusion, we hold that the interlocutory order under consideration here, although entered in a proceeding in bankruptcy, lacks that \u201cdefinitive operative finality\u201d necessary to render it ap-pealable as of right under section 24a of the Bankruptcy Act. Although the Government\u2019s challenge to the bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction is certainly not a frivolous one and would constitute a question of first impression in this Circuit, the long procedural history of this case demonstrates why review by this Court at this time would be at war with the policy against piecemeal appeals which underlies federal jurisprudence and the policy of expedited adjudication which undergirds federal bankruptcy law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1089-13\">. Section 2a provides that courts of bankruptcy are invested with jurisdiction to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1089-14\">(2A) Hear and determine, or cause to be heard and determined, any question arising as to the amount or legality of any unpaid tax, whether or not previously assessed, which has not prior to bankruptcy been contested before and adjudicated by a judicial or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction . . . .

We note that the Eighth and Ninth Circuits, both relying heavily on the district court\u2019s opinion in the instant case, have recently decided that bankruptcy courts possess jurisdiction under section 2a(2A) to entertain applications such as that of Durensky here. <em>In re Bostwick, </em>8 Cir. 1975, 521 F.2d 741; <em>In re Gwilliam, </em>9 Cir. 1975, 519 F.2d 407. <em>See In re Murphy, </em>N.D.Ala.1974, 381 F.Supp. 813, 816; <em>In re Savage, </em>C.D.Cal. 1971, 329 F.Supp. 968, 969; <em>see also </em>Plumb, The Tax Recommendations of the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws \u2014 Tax Procedures, 88 Harv.L.Rev. 1360/ 1389-99 (1975); Plumb, The Tax Recommendations of the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws \u2014 Priority and Dischargeability of Tax Claims, 59 Cornell L.Rev. 991, 1050-54 (1974); 9 Mertens, Law of Income Taxation, \u00a7 54.03; <em>but see In re Zook, </em>C.D.Cal.1974, 74-1 U.S. Tax Cas. \u00b6 9399; <em>In re O\u2019Ffill, </em>D.Kan.1973, 368 F.Supp. 345, 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>We note also that the orders reviewed in <em>Bostwick </em>and <em>Gwilliam </em>arose in different procedural contexts than the instant order, so that the Eighth and Ninth Circuits did not encounter the difficulty that we must resolve here. In <em>Gwilliam, </em>the bankruptcy judge concluded not only that he had jurisdiction to determine the dischargeability of the bankrupt\u2019s tax liabilities, but also that those liabilities were in fact discharged; the district court reversed the order of the bankruptcy judge on the ground of want of jurisdiction, and it was that order which the Ninth Circuit reviewed. In <em>Bost-wick, </em>as in this case, the bankruptcy judge concluded only that he had jurisdiction over the matter and enjoined the Government from proceeding against the bankrupt pending a hearing on the question of dischargeability. Upon review, however, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy judge\u2019s order instead of concluding, as did the district court here, that the Government\u2019s petition for review was premature. The Eighth Circuit did not discuss the appealability issue, although it obviously had read Judge Mahon\u2019s discussion of the problem in his opinion below in this case. We cannot say whether the Eighth Circuit implicitly drew some significant procedural distinction between their case and this one, or whether that Court decided <em>sub silentio </em>to adopt a rule regarding the appealability of interlocutory orders in proceedings in bankruptcy which differs from that followed by this Court. <em>See </em>n. 7, <em>infra. </em>In either case, we do not believe that the <em>Bostwick </em>Court\u2019s decision to address the merits of the Government\u2019s jurisdictional claims can bind this Court on an issue which apparently was not raised there, and which certainly was not discussed there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">.

It might be argued that our concern with the swift resolution of bankruptcy matters should persuade us to determine the merits of the Government\u2019s jurisdictional contentions at this time, rather than to postpone such a resolution until after a hearing on the issue of the dis-chargeability of Durensky\u2019s tax liabilities. Although there might be a considerable practical advantage in such a decision, the fact of the matter is that \u201cthe judicial power of the United States must not be exerted in a case to which it does not extend, even if both parties wish to have it exerted.\u201d <em>Mansfield, Coldwa-ter &amp; Lake Michigan Ry. v.

A cursory reading of <em>TMT Trailer Ferry </em>reveals, however, that in that case the district court, sitting as a reorganization court, pursuant to Chapter X order of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 501, et seq., refused, among other things, to issue a protective order against the taking of depositions from certain parties, who then appealed; we concluded that the district court\u2019s order was appealable as of right and that certain of the appellants\u2019 actions did not estop them from pursuing their right of appeal in this Court. <em>See generally </em>Farrar, the Appealability as of Right of Interlocutory Discovery Orders in Bankruptcy Proceedings, 23 U.Miami L.Rev. 366 (1969).
