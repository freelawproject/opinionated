Lewis, </em>492 F.2d 126 (5th Cir. 1974) vacated and the case remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Serfass v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 377, 95 S.Ct. 1055, 43 L.Ed.2d 265 (1975). Having followed the directive of the Court, we reinstate the Government\u2019s appeal, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3731 (1970), and after examination of the issue presented, affirm the order of the district court dismissing the indictment of Murphy Albert Lewis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-16\">The operative facts are not in dispute. The history of this litigation is as follows: In July 1970 Lewis was ordered to report for . induction into the Armed Forces of the United States on August 6, 1970. He sought to claim conscientious objector status and his order to report for induction was postponed by the local board pursuant to 32 C.F.R. Section 1632.2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The board notified Lewis on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>May 12, 1971 that in light of the decision in <em>Ehlert v. United States, </em>402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (1971) his claim to conscientious objector status could no longer be considered by it, and that he would, therefore, retain his 1A classification. The State Director of Selective Service notified the local board on May 19, 1971 that Lewis\u2019 postponement of induction was terminated and that he should be ordered to report in June 1971. The local board\u2019s June call had previously been filled, however, and no immediate call was forthcoming. In July 1971, the Selective Service Act of 1967 expired. In September 1971, the Draft Extension Act became law. Pursuant to his original July, 1970, induction order, Lewis was ordered to report in November, 1971. This order to report was issued approximately five months after the termination of Lewis\u2019 postponement of induction by the State Selective Service Director.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lewis did not report and was indicted for violating 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a). He moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the five month delay between termination of postponement and notification to report violated the provisions of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1632.2 and voided his original July 1970 order to report. The district court agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">Accordingly, since the induction order of July 13, 1970 was cancelled by the delay in ordering defendant to report for induction, it is the order of the court that the motion to dismiss the indictment, be, and the same is hereby, granted. App. p. 78.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">The Government filed an appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 3731, as amended by the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1970, 84 Stat. \u00a7 1890, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">In a criminal case an appeal by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision, judgment, or order of a district court dismissing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>indictment or information as to anyone or more counts, except that no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution prohibits further prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">The provisions of this section shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The 1970 amendments (effective in January 1971) to section 3731 were intended to facilitate governmental appeals by shifting judicial focus from the question whether \u201cthe decision setting aside or dismissing an indictment or information was \u2018based upon a defect in the indictment or information, or in the institution of the prosecution\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to the inquiry whether the appeal is precluded by the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The courts of appeal need no longer precisely define the nature of the action taken by the district courts in order to ascertain whether the government may appeal; rather any dismissal of an indictment or information by the district court is ap-pealable so long as it is not precluded by the double jeopardy clause. The 1970 amendments to section 3731 served, then, to obviate the need to discuss the \u201ckind of error section 3731 was intended to cover.\u201d <em>United States v. Findley, </em>439 F.2d 970, 973 (1st Cir. 1971). See also, <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>485 F.2d 1143, 1147 (5th Cir. 1973). In <em>Serfass v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court discusses the remaining constraint upon governmental appeals: the double jeopardy clause.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Serfass, like Lewis, was indicted for failing to report for induction in violation of 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a). The district court granted Serfass\u2019 pre-trial motion to dismiss the indictment because he established a prima facie claim for conscientious objector status which was not given full consideration by his local board. <em>Serfass v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 377, 95 S.Ct. 1055, 43 L.Ed.2d 265, 269 (1975). The United States appealed and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that because Serfass had not waived his right to trial by jury and because no jury had been empaneled, jeopardy had not attached. The Supreme Court affirmed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">As an aid to the decision of cases in which the prohibition of the Double Jeopardy Clause has been invoked, the courts have found it useful to define a point in criminal proceedings at which the constitutional purposes and policies are implicated by resort to the concept of \u201cattachment of jeopardy.\u201d In the case of a jury trial, jeopardy attaches when a jury is empaneled and, sworn. In a nonjury trial, jeopardy attaches when the court begins to hear evidence. The Court has consistently adhered to the view that jeopardy does not attach, and the constitutional prohibition can have no application, until a defendant is \u201cput to trial before the trier of facts, whether the trier be a jury or a judge.\u201d (citations omitted) <em>Serfass v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 377, 388, 95 S.Ct. 1055, 1062, 43 L.Ed.2d 265, 274 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Serfass conceded that technical jeopardy had not attached when the district court granted his motion to dismiss. He argued, however, that because the court\u2019s ruling was based on \u201cevidentiary facts outside of the indictment, which facts would constitute a defense on the merits at trial,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the ruling amounted to an acquittal on the merits and constituted the constructive attachment of jeopardy. <em>Id. </em>at 393, 95 S.Ct. at 1063, 43 L.Ed.2d at 275 (citation omitted). The Supreme Court held the characterization of an order to dismiss as an acquittal on the merits of no significance \u2014 absent the attachment of technical jeopardy and the risk of conviction. <em>Id. </em>392, 95 S.Ct. 1055, 43 L.Ed.2d 276. See also, <em>United States v. Kehoe, </em>516 F.2d 78 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Mann, </em>517 F.2d 259 (5th Cir. 1975) pp. 6991, 6998. In so doing, the Court noted that the opinions from which Serfass developed his argument were ones construing the Criminal Appeals Act prior to its 1970 amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The approach in those cases was not in terms of double jeopardy but rather in terms of the kind of error addressed by section 3731. <em>Serfass v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 377, 393, 95 S.Ct. 1055, 43 L.Ed.2d 265, 277 n. 15. Accordingly, the language of those decisions is not determinative in the context of <em>Ser-fass, </em>a case in which the issue is whether double jeopardy considerations preclude an appeal. See, <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>485 F.2d 1143, 1147 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Mann, </em>517 F.2d 259 (5th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">We are unable to distinguish <em>Lewis </em>from <em>Serfass. </em>Since Lewis has not waived his right to trial by jury, he has never been subject to the risk of conviction. The pre-trial hearing on Lewis\u2019 motion to dismiss could not have resulted in a guilty verdict. No jury was ever empaneled or sworn. If upon consideration of the merits of this appeal, we reversed the ruling of the district court, Lewis would be subjected to trial for the first time. The \u201cconstitutional protection against Government appeals attaches only where there is a danger of subjecting the defendant to a second trial for the same offense . ..\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 336, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 1018, 43 L.Ed.2d 232, 237 (1975). We, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>reinstate the Government\u2019s appeal and turn to the merits of its argument.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Lewis was indicted for refusing to report for induction in violation of 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a). He contended in his motion to dismiss the indictment that the induction order was invalid as a matter of law because the specified reporting date was greater than 120 days after the State Selective Service Director instructed the local board to issue a letter ordering him to report on its June 1971 call. See 32 C.F.R. 1632.2(a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In other words, Lewis contends his original July 1970 induction order was voided by the delay in excess of 120 days which transpired between the May 1971 termination of postponement for consideration of his claim to conscientious objector status and the October 1971 issuance of a letter ordering him to report. The Government, on the other hand, contends that Lewis was originally granted an indefinite postponement pursuant to 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1632.2(b) \u2014 a valid delay chargeable to Lewis which continued unabated until October 1971 when the <em>local </em>board actually ordered him to report. The Government does not agree that the actions of the State Director, reinstating Lewis\u2019 1A classification and authorizing the local board to include him in the June call, had the effect of terminating the original delay and activating the 120 day limit of section 1632.2(a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We agree with the district court that the communications of the State Director to the local board concluded the period of delay attributable to Lewis\u2019 claim to conscientious objector status and set in motion the 120 day limit applicable to the local board as prescribed by 32 C.F.R. 1632.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">The only authority by which a local board may postpone the time for reporting pursuant to an outstanding order to report is 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1632.2. <em>United States ex rel Iverson v. Rhodes, </em>465 F.2d 402, 403 (7th Cir. 1972). The postponement may not exceed 120 days, <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>469 F.2d 1310, 1313 (9th Cir. 1972), unless it is occasioned by the design of the registrant and accrues to his benefit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Scialabra, </em>465 F.2d 1395, 1396 (9th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>Abrams, </em>476 F.2d 1067, 1071 (7th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1001, 94 S.Ct. 355, 38 L.Ed.2d 237; <em>United States v. Shea, </em>508 F.2d 82, 86-7 (5th Cir. 1975). The deleterious effects that a reporting delay, may have upon the personal, business, or scholastic plans of a registrant have led courts to construe strictly the provisions of 32 C.F.R. 1632.2. <em>United States ex rel Iverson v. Rhodes, </em>465 F.2d 402, 404 (7th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Munsen, </em>443 F.2d 1229, 1231 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Admittedly the postponement of Lewis\u2019 induction was predicated initially upon his claim to conscientious objector status. Such a claim is lawful and may not be seized upon to justify additional delay attributable to administrative inertia. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Munsen, </em>443 F.2d 1229, 1231 (9th Cir. 1971). Pre-induction deliberations regarding Lewis\u2019 status were concluded by the draft authorities in May 1971. At that time he was notified that he had been reclassified as 1A. The delay between May and October 1971 was in no way precipitated by Lewis. It was not his fault that the local board\u2019s June call had been filled before his availability was known or that the Selective Service Act expired in July 1971. The effect of the delay was to keep Lewis \u201cguessing as to his ultimate fate beyond the time specified in the regulations.\u201d <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>438 F.2d 628, 629 (9th Cir. 1971); <em>United States v. Munsen, </em>443 F.2d 1229, 1231 (9th Cir. 1971). We conclude that in the circumstances disclosed by the undisputed facts of this case the delay violated the regulation limiting such delay to 120 days and that Lewis was not the cause of the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The dismissal order and judgment of the district court are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-9\">. 421 U.S. 943, 95 S.Ct. 1671, 44 L.Ed.2d 97 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b163-10\">. In <em>United States v.

As indicated earlier, in <em>Serf ass </em>the district court dismissed the indictment because it felt that the defendant had established a prima fa-cie case for conscientious objector status and that the draft board failed to state sufficient reasons for the denial of his claim to such status. The <em>Serfass </em>decision deals chiefly with double jeopardy principles. In the case <em>sub judice </em>the issue on remand relates to the merits of the district court\u2019s ruling with respect to delay by the draft board in ordering the defendant to report for induction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\">. The Government argues that the original postponement to consider Lewis\u2019 conscientious objector claim was granted pursuant to 32 C.F.R. section 1632.2(b) and terminated pursuant to 32 C.F.R. section 1632.2(e). It contends that the 120 day delay limit specified in 1632.2(a) is not applicable to terminations effected under section 1632.2(e). Section 1632.-2(a) is applicable, argues the Government, only to postponements granted for extreme family emergencies, or other emergencies beyond the registrant\u2019s control. Our disagreement with the Government \u201cis consistent with several cases in which courts have enforced the requirements of section 1632.2 even though the local board did not purport to act under that regulation or the delay was not occasioned by the kind of \u2018extreme emergency\u2019 mentioned in the regulation.\u201d <em>United States ex rel Iverson v. Rhodes, </em>465 F.2d 402, 404 (7th Cir. 1972) (citations omitted). We believe that such an approach is required by section 1632.2 particularly \u201c[a]t a time when the President, Congress and the Director of Selective Service are all attempting to infuse the present draft law with as much certainty as possible . . ..\u201d <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>438 F.2d 628, 629 (9th Cir. 1971). Presumably, even the Government would agree that excessive reporting delays resulting in unfairness are possible under section 1632.2(e). To prevent abuse and provide certainty we look to the limits explicitly prescribed by section 1632.2(a), for guidance in construing the entire regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b167-14\">.
