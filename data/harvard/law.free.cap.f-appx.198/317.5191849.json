The district court sentenced Barnhart to 222 months\u2019 imprisonment, consisting of a 102-month sentence on the \u00a7 924(c) offense, and a consecutive 120-month term on the \u00a7 922(g) offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">Barnhart\u2019s attorney filed an Anders<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brief, arguing that Barnhart is entitled to specific performance by the Government of its agreement to make a motion for downward departure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Barnhart signed a plea agreement containing the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-12\">23. When and if the defendant assists the government as described above:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-15\">a. The United States, in its sole discretion, will determine whether said assistance has been substantial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-16\">b. Upon a determination that the defendant has rendered substantial assistance, the government may make a motion pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for imposition of a sentence below the applicable Sentencing Guidelines. The United States may also, within its sole discretion, move the Court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) to impose a sentence below any applicable statutory mandatory minimum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-17\">24. The defendant understands that if he ... violates any federal, state, or local law, or any order of any court, including any condition of pre-trial or pre-sentence, or post-sentence release, the United States will be relieved of its obligation under this Plea Agreement, but the defendant will not be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-18\">First, we note that the plea agreement unambiguously provides that the decision whether to file a departure motion was within the Government\u2019s discretion, and Barnhart does not allege that the refusal to so move was based on an improper motive, such as racial or religious animus. <em>See United States v. Butler, </em>272 F.3d 683, 686-88 (4th Cir.2001). Moreover, after he signed the plea agreement, Barnhart tested positive for illegal drugs, freeing the Government from any obligation it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>under the plea agreement. Thus, the issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Barnhart asserts that his guilty plea was not voluntary because during the plea hearing, he was led to believe his sentences for the \u00a7 922(g) offense and the \u00a7 924(c) offense would run concurrently. As Barnhart suggests, the magistrate judge<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appeared to accede to counsel\u2019s suggestion that the sentences would be concurrent, when, by statute, the sentence on the \u00a7 924(c) count was required to run consecutively to any other sentence imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Because Barnhart did not object or seek to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis of this error, this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 527 (4th Cir.2002). Under plain error review, this court may notice an error that was not preserved by timely objection only if the defendant can demonstrate that: (1) there was error; (2) it was plain; and (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Even when these three conditions are satisfied, this court may exercise its discretion to notice the error only if the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">We conclude that the error here did not rise to the level of reversible \u201cplain error\u201d because it did not impact Barnhart\u2019s substantial rights. An error is substantial if it was so prejudicial as to affect the outcome of the proceedings. <em>Id.; Martinez, </em>277 F.3d at 532. In the guilty plea context, to prove that an error is substantial, the defendant must show that, but for the error, he would not have pled guilty. <em>Martinez, </em>277 F.3d at 532. Barnhart signed a plea agreement that stated with regard to each count that the sentence would be consecutive to any other sentence. Both the magistrate judge and the plea agreement also stated that the maximum penalty for Count Two was life imprisonment, which is far below the sentence Barnhart ultimately received. Any confusion that may have resulted from the misstatement in the Rule 11 hearing did not prejudice Barn-hart.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">Barnhart next claims his counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate his mental health before advising him to plead guilty, and he states that he was taking several prescription drugs at the time of the offense and guilty plea hearing. Generally, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal. To allow for adequate development of a record, a defendant must bring his claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir. 1999); <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Because the present record does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Barn-hart\u2019s claim is not cognizable on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">Barnhart also claims that he should not have been convicted of the \u00a7 924(c) offense when he did not plead guilty to the underlying drug offense. However, \u201ca defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 924(c) \u2018does not depend on his being convicted \u2014 either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>previously or contemporaneously \u2014 of the predicate offense, as long as all of the elements of that offense are proved and found beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hopkins, </em>310 F.3d 145, 152 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Crump, </em>120 F.3d 462, 466 (4th Cir.1997)). Barnhart\u2019s guilty plea to the \u00a7 924(c) offense constituted an admission of all material elements of the crime. <em>See McCarthy v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466-67, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969); <em>United States v. Willis, </em>992 F.2d 489, 490 (4th Cir.1993) (\u201cA knowing, voluntary, and intelligent guilty plea to an offense conclusively establishes the elements of the offense and the material facts necessary to support the conviction.\u201d). Thus, Barnhart has failed to establish plain error in the taking of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Similarly, Barnhart challenges the factual basis for his guilty plea to Count Two. Specifically, he argues that he did not actively use a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking under <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995). Again, because Barnhart voluntarily entered a guilty plea, his claims are waived. <em>Willis, </em>992 F.2d at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decision process.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-13\">. <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-14\">. Barnhart\u2019s attorney also argues that the waiver in the plea agreement does not preclude his appeal that the Government breached its agreement to file a substantial assistance motion. Because the Government has not relied on the waiver provision to assert that appellate review is precluded, the argument raised by Barnhart\u2019s counsel need not be addressed. <em>See United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Brock, </em>211 F.3d 88, 90 n. 1 (4th Cir.2000)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\">. The plea hearing was conducted by the magistrate judge with Barnhart\u2019s consent. <em>See United States v. Osborne, </em>345 F.3d 281, 288 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b345-15\">. We note that in all other respects, the magistrate judge properly advised Barnhart and informed him of the charges against him, the rights he was foregoing by pleading guilty, and the penalties for the offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
