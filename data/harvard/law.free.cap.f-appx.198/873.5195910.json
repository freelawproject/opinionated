Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we previously vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Hubbard (\u201cHubbard I\u201d</em>), 148 Fed.Appx. 810 (11th Cir.2005) (unpublished). After a re-sentencing hearing, at which the district court heard argument on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court imposed the same sentence, which was at the lowest end of the Guidelines range Hubbard faced. In this appeal, Hubbard again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>challenges his 92-month sentence for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). On appeal, Hubbard argues that his sentence was unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions in <em>Booker, </em>we review a district court\u2019s sentence, imposed after consulting the Guidelines and considering the factors set forth at \u00a7 3553(a), for reasonableness. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 264-65, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cUnder Booker, we review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness.\u201d). The reasonableness review is \u201cdeferential\u201d and focuses on whether the sentence imposed fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Based on an adjusted offense level of 23 and a criminal history category VI (based on 14 criminal points), Hubbard faced a Guidelines range of 92 to 115 months\u2019 imprisonment. The statutory maximum term of imprisonment was ten years, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2). At the resentencing hearing, the district court heard evidence and legal argument in support of mitigation. Hubbard\u2019s wife testified that Hubbard had changed and was a good person, and also stated that a fellow church member had offered to give Hubbard a job. She also described her own health problems and the family\u2019s need for Hubbard to work. Hubbard\u2019s mother-in-law also testified to his good character. In addition, the court heard Hubbard\u2019s statement of remorse, as well as defense counsel\u2019s argument in support of mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Prior to imposing sentence, the district court throughly addressed its sentencing options, taking into account the evidence and argument presented at the original sentencing hearing and the resentencing hearing, the PSI, and the statutory maximum. The court also noted its discretion to impose a below-Guidelines sentence based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including \u201cthe characteristics of the Defendant,\u201d but determined that it was not appropriate in Hubbard\u2019s case, given his lengthy criminal history. From our own review of the record, we readily conclude that Hubbard\u2019s low-end sentence, which was below the 120-month statutory maximum he faced, was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
