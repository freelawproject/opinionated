Jackson argues that the district court lacked authority to sua sponte dismiss his complaint for failure to pay the initial partial filing fee and that his in forma pauperis complaint could be dismissed only if it was frivolous, malicious, or failed to state a claim. Jackson\u2019s arguments are without merit. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b); <em>McCullough v. Lynaugh, </em>835 F.2d 1126, 1127 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">With the benefit of liberal construction, Jackson also argues that he believed the district court would collect the filing fee, that the district court\u2019s dismissal was arbitrary, malicious, and fraudulent, and that his complaint raised meritorious issues relating to the denial of parole, denial of good-time credit, and the Ex Post Facto Clause. The record shows that Jackson was instructed that he was responsible for paying the filing fee and timely executing all necessary documents for withdrawals from his inmate trust account, but Jackson did not comply with the district court\u2019s order. The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the complaint without prejudice. <em>See McCullough, </em>835 F.2d at 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
