On appeal, Cineas argues that substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, which provided the primary basis for denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT. Cineas also contends that substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>that he could relocate within Haiti and avoid the alleged persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">When the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion, such as here, the IJ\u2019s decision becomes the final removal order subject to review. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). To the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, and we must affirm the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Cineas first argues that he is entitled to asylum. To establish asylum eligibility, the Cineas must, with specific and. credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a)-(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">If the alien establishes past persecution, it is presumed that his life or freedom would be threatened upon his return to that country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b), 208.16(b). An alien who has not shown past persecution may still be entitled to asylum or withholding of removal if he can demonstrate a future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground in his country. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b)(2), 208.16(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">When evaluating an applicant\u2019s claim, the IJ must make \u201cclean determinations of credibility,\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted), and must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). If the IJ does not state clearly whether he believed the petitioner, we will assume that credibility was not determinative. <em>Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201. A credibility determination, like any fact finding, \u201cmay not be overturned unless the record compels it.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">In finding Cineas\u2019s testimony to lack credibility, the IJ made a \u201cclean\u201d adverse credibility determination. Substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s denial of Cineas\u2019s three claims based on an adverse credibility finding. See <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (\u201c[A]n adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d). The IJ noted several inconsistencies in Cineas\u2019s testimony, and a review of the record supports these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">Cineas also argues that he qualifies for withholding of removal under the INA and protection under CAT. For the same reasons that we deny Cineas\u2019s application for asylum, we find that he is also unable to qualify for withholding of removal or protection under CAT. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">Upon careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we hold that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum, withholding of removal under the INA, and claim under the CAT. Accordingly, we deny Cineas\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-9\">. Because we affirm the IJ\u2019s credibility finding, we need not review Cineas\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
