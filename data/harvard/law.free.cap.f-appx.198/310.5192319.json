The district court sentenced Brown to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment, five years of supervised release, and ordered payment of a $100 statutory assessment. Brown has appealed, challenging the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for new counsel. We find no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See United States v. Gallop, </em>838 F.2d 105, 108 (4th Cir.1988). The district court conducted an adequate inquiry into Brown\u2019s complaint and properly determined that: (1) counsel was diligent in his efforts to represent Brown; (2) Brown\u2019s motion for substitute counsel was not timely filed; (3) there was not a total lack of communication between Brown and his attorney; (4) Brown\u2019s own behavior created the conflict that was present; and (5) Brown put forth no valid reason why new counsel should be appointed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-20\">Accordingly, we affirm Brown\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
