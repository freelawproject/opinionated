Steven also argues that the district court erred by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b842-25\">On March 2, 2005, Steven filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint against Richard McKillop and Larry Medlock, employees of the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d), in their individual capacities, alleging a violation of her Fifth Amendment rights. In her com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>plaint, Steven alleged that she began employment with the USPS in October 1999 under the supervision of McKillop and Medlock, and that she was terminated on January 28, 2000, \u201cfor confrontation with another employee.\u201d Steven received notice of her termination on January 28, 2000, via a letter that was given to her by one of the defendants. Steven\u2019s complaint sought damages in the amount of $3,600,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), alleging that the complaint was filed after the applicable four-year statute-of-limitations period had expired. In response, Steven argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the limitations period did not begin to run until she was aware that she had been injured, and that she did not have knowledge of her injury until she had conducted legal research. Steven also requested that the district court hold an evidentiary hearing on her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Without holding an evidentiary hearing, the district court found that Steven\u2019s complaint was time-barred and granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The district court found that Steven was aware of her termination on January 28, 2000, the date she received the termination letter, and that she had, at most, four years in which to file her complaint, or until January 28, 2004. However, Steven did not file her complaint until March 2, 2005. The district court also noted that Steven\u2019s ignorance of the law did not constitute good cause for excusing the delay. Accordingly, the district court dismissed Steven\u2019s complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">On appeal, Steven argues that her complaint is not time-barred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties do not dispute that Steven\u2019s complaint, which we construe as filed pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), is governed by Florida\u2019s residual limitations period of four years. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(3)(p).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, the parties dispute when Steven\u2019s cause of action accrued, and likewise, when the statute of limitations expired. A cause of action does not accrue until the plaintiff knows or has reason to know that she has been injured and is aware of who inflicted the injury. <em>Mullinax v. McElhenney, </em>817 F.2d 711, 716 (11th Cir.1987) (addressing cause of action under \u00a7 1983). Here, it is clear from the face of Steven\u2019s complaint that her injury occurred on January 28, 2000, the date of her termination, and that she was aware of who inflicted the injury at that time. Thus, Steven\u2019s cause of action against the defendants in this case accrued on January 28, 2000, and she had four years from that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>date in which to file her complaint. The fact that Steven may not have been aware of any possible legal recourse at that time does not change this fact or toll the limitations period. <em>See Quina v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 575 </em>F.2d 1115, 1118 (5th Cir.1978) (noting that ignorance of legal rights does not toll the statute of limitations). Because Steven\u2019s complaint was not filed until March 2, 2005, more than five years later, the district court correctly found that Steven\u2019s complaint was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing. Because it was clear from the face of the complaint and other pleadings that Steven\u2019s complaint was time-barred, an evidentiary hearing was not necessary in this case. <em>See Cano v. Baker, </em>435 F.3d 1337, 1342-43 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying request for an evidentiary hearing where holding such a hearing would not aid the court\u2019s analysis on a question of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Based on the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Steven\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-7\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's interpretation and application of a statute of limitations. <em>Harrison v. Digital Health Plan, </em>183 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b843-8\">. A <em>Bivens </em>action is subject to the same statute of limitations that would apply to a complaint brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Kelly v. Serna, </em>87 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir. 1996). In turn, the Supreme Court has directed that the state limitations period applicable to personal injury actions should be applied to all actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983. <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 276, 280, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 1947, 1949, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985), <em>superceded by statute as recognized in Jones v. R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., </em>541 U.S. 369, 379-80, 124 S.Ct. 1836, 158 L.Ed.2d 645 (2004). \u201c[Wjhere state law provides multiple statutes of limitations for personal injury actions, courts considering \u00a7 1983 claims should borrow the general or residual statute for personal injury actions.\u201d <em>Owens v. Okure, </em>488 U.S. 235, 249-50, 109 S.Ct. 573, 582, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989). Florida is one such state with multiple statutes of limitations for personal injury actions, and Florida law provides a residual limitations period of four years. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(3)(p).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
