Counsel have filed a joint brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the sentences but stating that, in their view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Michael and Aubrey were informed of their right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but neither has done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">Counsel suggest that the district court violated Michael\u2019s and Aubrey\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights by applying a two-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) (2003), based upon the number of firearms involved in the offense. We find no error in the application of this enhancement to either Defendant because each of them admitted the factual basis for this enhancement during the plea colloquy and at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Revels, </em>455 F.3d 448, 450-51 (4th Cir.2006) (discussing what constitutes an admission under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-19\">Aubrey also suggests that, because of his poor health, the district court should have granted his motion for downward departure under USSG \u00a7 5H1.4 or \u00a7 5K2.0. A district court\u2019s decision not to depart from the sentencing guidelines is not subject to appellate review unless the refusal to depart is based on the mistaken belief that the court lacked jurisdiction to depart. <em>United States v. Quinn, </em>359 F.3d 666, 682 (4th Cir.2004) (citing <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 30-31 (4th Cir.1990)); <em>see United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 333 (3d Cir.2006) (collecting cases adopting rule <em>post-Booker). </em>Here, the district court recognized its authority to depart but found, under the circumstances of Aubrey\u2019s case, that departure was not warranted. Thus, this claim is not subject to appellate review. <em>Quinn, </em>359 F.3d at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-21\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Michael\u2019s and Aubrey\u2019s convictions and sentences. This court requires that counsel inform their clients, in writing, of their right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>ther review. If either client requests that a petition be filed, but his counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
