The IJ found Gaubault removable after Gaubault, initially electing to proceed <em>pro se, </em>admitted that he remained in the United States for a time longer than permitted following his entry on June 10, 1997. He also filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal, which the IJ set for a subsequent hearing. Before the hearing on his application, Gaubault retained counsel. Gaubault then moved to continue the hearing and for leave to file for cancellation of removal, alleging that he qualified for cancellation based on his continuous presence in the United States since his first arrival in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-17\">The IJ denied the motion to continue on the ground that Gaubault failed to establish <em>prima facie </em>entitlement to seek cancellation of removal. The BIA dismissed Gaubault\u2019s appeal, finding no reason to disturb the IJ\u2019s finding that Gaubault was not entitled to a continuance. On appeal, Gaubault argues that the IJ erroneously denied his motion because he established good cause for a continuance and that, by barring him from applying for relief, the IJ violated his due process rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth more fully below, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>We review the denial of a motion to continue for abuse of discretion. <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1361-62 (11th Cir.2006). We review constitutional challenges <em>de novo. Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">An IJ may grant a motion to continue \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. A non-permanent resident alien in removal proceedings can apply for cancellation of removal if the alien (1) has been continuously present in the United States for at least ten years; (2) has been of good moral character during that period; (3) has not been convicted of certain offenses; and (4) establishes that removal would result in extreme hardship to a citizen or permanent resident spouse, parent, or child. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b), Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 240A(b). \u201cThe Attorney General ... has discretion to cancel the removal of a non-permanent resident if that alien\u201d meets these statutory criteria. <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). A continuous presence is not maintained if the alien departs from the United States for any period over 90 days or for any aggregated periods over 180 days. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(2), INA \u00a7 240A(d)(2). Moreover, the period ends when the alien is served with a notice to appear. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1), INA \u00a7 240A(d)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">In his asylum application, Gaubault listed June 10,1997, as the date he left Jamaica and the only date on which he entered the United States. The only documentary evidence Gaubault presented that, standing alone, indicated that he had been in the United States prior to 1997 was evidence that he obtained a Florida driver\u2019s license on December 1, 1995. Gaubault\u2019s notice to appear was served on June 17, 2004, less than ten years after the driver\u2019s license was issued and, therefore, the license provides insufficient evidence to demonstrate ten years\u2019 continuous presence as required for cancellation of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l), INA \u00a7 240A(d)(l). The remaining evidence in support of Gaubault\u2019s prior entry into the United States consists of his allegation that he came to the United States in 1987 and a bank transaction receipt from 1993. However, the receipt did not contain any information as to the identity of the account holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">In light of Gaubault\u2019s asylum application, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in declining to find that Gaubault\u2019s assertion and his documentary evidence set forth a <em>prima facie </em>case of eligibility for cancellation of removal. Although Gaubault claims that the dates of his previous entries into the United States were inadvertently omitted from the application, the application contains other inconsistencies with his claim. The only residential address Gaubault listed prior to 1997 is in Jamaica. According to the application, Gaubault was a waiter at one Jamaican business from May 1981 to October 1990 and a waiter at a second Jamaican business from December 1990 to July 1997. The statement Gaubault provided with his application makes no mention of coming to the United States at any time other than 1997. In addition, in support of his motion for a continuance, Gaubault, through counsel, stated that he had gone back to Jamaica since 1987 and admitted entering the United States in 1990 and 1997. Viewed as a whole, these facts are inconsistent with a finding that Gaubault satisfied the continuous presence requirement of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A), INA \u00a7 240A(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">On appeal before the BIA, Gaubault submitted no further documentation in support of his claim of continuous presence and, aside from stating that he resided in the United States since 1987 except for \u201csome casual visits\u201d to Jamaica, he offered no details of when he departed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>United States and how long he remained in Jamaica before returning. Because the IJ did not abuse his discretion and Gaubault did not make a showing before the BIA to counter the problems created by his asylum application with establishing a continuous presence, the BIA likewise did not abuse its discretion in finding no reason to set aside the IJ\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">We also deny Gaubault\u2019s due process claim. Cancellation of removal is a form of discretionary relief. <em>See Gonzalez-Oropeza, </em>321 F.3d at 1332. Gaubault has no constitutionally protected right to discretionary relief. <em>Zafar, </em>461 F.3d at 1367. Accordingly, his claim that the inability to apply for cancellation of removal resulting from the denial of a continuance violated his due process rights fails. <em>Id. </em>at 1367 (holding that the denial of a motion to continue to allow aliens to meet the requirements for the discretionary relief of adjustment of status did not violate due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">In light of the foregoing, Gaubault\u2019s petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-13\">. Gaubault argues that we should review the IJ\u2019s opinion because the BIA\u2019s decision was tantamount to an affirmance without opinion. We disagree. Because the BIA neither expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision nor entered an affirmance without opinion as contemplated under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), we review the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001); <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 221 </em>F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-18\">Gaubault also argues that the IJ failed to make adequate findings because the IJ did not adequately develop the record and that the IJ mischaracterized the nature of his motion. As Gaubault did not exhaust these issues before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider them. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Sundar v. I.N.S., </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
