We review a dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo and we review a dismissal as frivolous for abuse of discretion. <em>Morin v. Moore, </em>309 F.3d 316, 319 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 718 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">Fennell\u2019s claims concern the defendants\u2019 alleged actions in obtaining an assault conviction against him. He argues that District Attorney Kirk Sistrunk improperly put him on trial before Judge Roy Quintanilla on an assault charge brought by his ex-girlfriend that had previously been dismissed by Judge Schweitzer.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-17\">Fennel does not address the district court\u2019s determination that Sistrunk is entitled to absolute immunity. <em>See Beck v. Texas State Bd. of Dental Examiners, </em>204 F.3d 629, 637 (5th Cir.2000). He has therefore waived the issue. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993). Because Judge Quintanilla and Judge Schweitzer are also entitled to absolute immunity from claims for damages arising out of acts performed in the exercise of their judicial functions, Fennell has not shown that the district court erred in dismissing his claims against these defendants. <em>See Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 284 (5th Cir.1994). Additionally, because Fennell\u2019s claims necessarily imply the invalidity of his assault conviction, which has not been set aside, they are not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and are frivolous. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); <em>Hamilton v. Lyons, </em>74 F.3d 99, 102-03 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-18\">Fennell\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Fennell\u2019s \u00a7 1983 lawsuit and this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir. 1996). Fennell is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
