The court sentenced appellant to a prison term of 235 months on Count One, and concurrent prison terms of 120 months on each of the remaining counts, for a total term of imprisonment of 235 months. Appellant appeals his conviction, raising one issue: whether the district court, in determining appellant\u2019s base offense level, committed plain error in attributing to appellant at least 10 pounds of cocaine and 5,570 pounds of marijuana as relevant conduct. We find no error much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-17\">The district court based its findings on the testimony presented at trial \u2014 in particular, the testimony of several people who supplied appellant with drugs. In short, the court had more than sufficient evidence on which to make the challenged findings. Appellant\u2019s sentences are, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b904-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
