To this great rule in the exposition of wills, all others must bend. Lines v. Darden, 5 Fla. 51; Russ v. Russ, 9 Fla. 105; Floyd v. Smith, 59 Fla. 485, 51 So. 357, 138 Am. St. Rep. 133, 37 L. R. A.

State v. Beardsley, 77 Fla. 803, 82 So. 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u201cNo rule of construction of mere words control the intention. Lines v. Darden, 5 Fla. 51; Floyd v. Smith, 59 Fla. 485, 51 So. 537, 138 Am. St. Rep. 133, 37 L. R. A. (N. S.) 651, 21 Ann. Cas. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u201cAnd it should prevail against any perversion of words from their usual meaning. Lowrimore v. First Sav., etc., Co., 102 Fla. 740, 140 So. 887.\u201d 13 Enc.

Kansas Masonic Home, filed at this term.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In a will the words, \u201cwill and bequeath,\u201d may be sufficient to pass the title to real estate and to personalty, the context and the objectives of the will being duly considered in determining the intent of the testator in the use of the quoted or other words in the will.

But such an intent to enlarge the life estate already limited may not be inferred from a right or power given to the life tenant to' dispose of the \u201cproperty bequeathed to her and to use the proceeds thereof as she may see fit,\u201d coupled with a statement that the testator\u2019s intent being to bequeath to her \u201cher half interest of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>said residue * * * without restrictions,\u201d when the <em>estate </em>is not enlarged expressly or by <em>necessary </em>implication, but the life estate is previously expressly and specifically limited and the intent to bequeath only a life estate is consistent with the will considered as an entirety, and the power or right to dispose of the property bequeathed is consistent with the testator\u2019s intent that such life tenant may continue to use the property bequeathed to her for life in a business enterprise, with its hazards and incidental changes in the uses and values of property, and the testator\u2019s expressed and otherwise manifest intent is that if the life tenant is at her death possessed of any of the property bequeathed to her, or of the proceeds from a disposition 6f her life estate or interest in the property, it shall be equally divided among the testator\u2019s nieces and nephews, the remaindermen after the death of the life tenant.

Items 2 and 3 and the first sentence of Item 4 make separate specific bequests to the testator\u2019s two brothers and to Mrs. Mary Selina Mosgrove.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u201cItem 5. I hereby appoint my brother, Otto Mach, of Orange County, Florida, and the said Mary Selina Mos-grove, executors of this my Last Will and Testament with full authority without any order of any court to sell, mortgage or dispose of any of my real or personal property at public or private sale or to do any and all other acts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>they may deem necessary and proper to carry out this my Will, and I hereby expressly relieve them and each of them of the necessity of making bonds or returns as such executors to any Court. However, it is my wish that they jointly carry on my business, the Mach Lumber &amp; Crate Mill, as long as they shall deem it practical, they sharing the income thereof, in accordance with Item 4 of this my Will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">While the will cannot curtail the powers of the courts to require right and justice to be done to creditors and legatees and devisees including remaindermen, Item 5 of the will purports to confer full powers upon the named executors to deal' with the property of the estate as \u201cthey may deem necessary and proper <em>to carry out this my will\u201d </em>without bond or returns or court orders; and also expresses the testator\u2019s wish that the executors \u201cjointly carry on my business, the Mach Lumber &amp; Crate Mill, as long as they shall deem practical, they sharing the income thereof, in accordance with Item 4 of this my will.\u201d Of course, if the executor, Otto Mach, survives the executrix, the <em>joint </em>operation of the \u201cbusiness\u201d could not continue longer than the life of the executrix, Mrs. Mosgrove, the life tenant of one-half interest in the residue of the testator\u2019s property which includes \u201cthe Mach Lumber &amp; Crate Mill,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In Item 4 of the will, the words \u201cwill and bequeath\u201d are intended to and do give title to both real and personal property embraced in the residuary devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">After making specific bequests in Items 2, 3 and in the first sentence of Item 4, the testator in Item 4 of his will directs that \u201call the rest and residue of my property of whatever description and wherever located,\u201d which, as shown by the will, includes both real and personal property, shall be divided into two equal parts by his executors. One part of which he bequeathed to his brother, Otto Mach, in fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>simple. The other part of said residue he bequeathed to Mrs. Mary Selina Mosgrove \u201cfor and during her -natural life, with remainder over to my five (5) nieces and nephews * * * share and share alike.\u201d This gave to Otto Mach a fee simple interest in one-half of the \u201cresidue\u201d of the testator\u2019s property; and in contrast gave to Mrs. Mary Selina Mosgrove \u201cthe other part of said residue\u201d \u201cfor.and during her natural life with remainder over.\u201d Continuing, Item 4 provides: \u201cHowever, the said Mary Selina Mosgrove shall have the right to sell, mortgage, pledge or dispose of any of the <em>real or personal property bequeathed to her under this item of this my will </em>in any manner in which she shall see fit, and use the proceeds thereof in any manner she shall see fit, it being my intention to bequeath this <em>her half interest </em>of said residue of my estate <em>without restrictions, </em>save and except that if she should possess <em>any of the same </em>at the time of her death, it is my will that it shall be equally divided among my said nieces and nephews.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In Item 4 of his will the testator bequeaths a half interest in the \u201cresidue\u201d of his property \u201cto Mrs. Mary Selina Mos-grove for and during her natural life with remainder over to\u201d the testator\u2019s \u201cfive nieces and nephews.\u201d The testator then gave to Mrs. Mosgrove \u201cthe right to sell, mortgage, pledge or dispose of any -of the real or personal property bequeathed to her under this item of this will in any manner in which she shall see fit, and use the proceeds thereof in any manner she shall see fit, it being my intention to bequeath her this her half interest of said residue of my estate without restrictions, save and except that if she should possess any of the same at the time of her death, it is my will that it shall be equally divided among my said nieces and nephews.\u201d These provisions of the will appear after the provision <em>expressly limiting </em>the estate already bequeathed to Mrs. Mosgrove in the \u201cresidue,\u201d to a half interest therein, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>\u201cfor and during her natural life with remainder over\u201d to the testator\u2019s five nieces and nephews. Such subsequent provisions confer a power; and do not expressly or impliedly enlarge the estate previously and specifically limited to a life estate \u201cwith remainder over\u201d and such subsequent provisions do not clearly express or imply an intent of the testator that Mrs. Mosgrove shall have \u201cthe right to sell, mortgage, pledge or dispose of\u201d more than the life estate in any of the real or personal property <em>bequeathed to her under this item of this my will. </em>The provision, \u201cit being my intention to bequeath her this her <em>half interest </em>of said residue of my estate without restrictions, save and except that if she should possess <em>any of the same </em>at the time of her death, it is my will that it shall be equally divided among my said nieces and nephews,\u201d has reference to Mrs. Mosgrqve\u2019s <em>\u201chalf interest </em>of said residue,\u201d and does not expressly or impliedly enlarge that interest beyond a life estate in such \u201chalf interest\u201d; and the power just previously conferred is a right to dispose of any of the property \u201cbequeathed to her under this item of this my will.\u201d The bequest to her was a \u201chalf interest\u201d in the \u201cresidue,\u201d \u201cfor and during her natural life with remainder over to \u201cthe testator\u2019s \u201cfive nieces and nephews.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The \u201cinterest\u201d or estate in one-half of the residue of the tetator\u2019s property that is bequeathed to Mrs. Mosgrove in Item 4 is expressly limited to an estate therein, \u201cfor and during her natural life with remainder over\u201d; and the subsequent provisions in Item 4 do not expressly or impliedly enlarge the life estate previously expressly limited to Mrs. Mosgrove, but confer upon her a power or \u201cright to sell, mortgage, pledge or dispose of any of the real or personal property bequeathed to her under this item of\u201d the will. The will also expresses an intention of the testator \u201cto bequeath her this her half interest of said residue of my es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>tate without restrictions, save and except that if she should possess any of the same at the time of her death, it is my will that it shall be equally divided among my said nieces and nephews.\u201d Such provision considered with the whole of Item 4 and the entire will, likewise does not expressly or impliedly .enlarge the life estate previously expressly and specifically limited to Mrs. Mosgrove. The words \u201cto bequeath\u201d and \u201cher half interest\u201d and \u201cwithout restrictions\u201d in the connection used do not severally or in conjunction express or imply an intent to enlarge the <em>\u201cinterest\u201d </em>or the estate in one-half of the \u201cresidue\u201d that had already been expressly and specifically limited to Mrs. Mosgrove \u201cfor and during her natural life with remainder over to my five (5) nieces and nephews, the children of the said Otto Mach and Ernest Mach, share and share alike.\u201d The words, \u201cwithout restrictions,\u201d as used and when considered in connection with the words and purpose of the first part of the same sentence, refer to the power or right to dispose of the property \u201cbequeathed to her\u201d and do not operate to enlarge the life estate expressly limited to her in the previous sentence of the will, or to affect the remainder over.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The right or power conferred upon Mrs. Mosgrove to sell, mortgage, pledge or dispose of any of the property \u201cbequeathed to her under this item of this my will\u201d is necessarily limited to that which is appropriate and legal to effectuate the provisions of the will according to the testator\u2019s intention as it may be duly interpreted by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Because of the business enterprise in which most of the residue of the estate was used and the testator\u2019s contemplation that such business, with its hazards and varied uses of property, might be continued by his executors, one of whom was the life tenant of a half of the residue of the estate, thereby needing changes in the property bequeathed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>the power or right to dispose of any of the property bequeathed to the life tenant not in excess of her life estate or interest therein was expressly though inaptly provided for by the testator who desired a continuance of the business enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The provisions of the will considered as an entirety clearly negative any intent of the testator to authorize the life tenant to dispose of the fee simple title, to the half interest in the property bequeathed to her and specifically limited to an estate \u201cfor and during her natural life with remainder over,\u201d so as to destroy or unduly impair the vested remainder expressly bequeathed to the testator\u2019s five nieces and nephews.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Any portion of the half interest of the personal property or the value thereof bequeathed to the life tenant and not lost or consumed in the proper use of it by the life tenant, and any portion of or interest in the real estate or the value thereof that becomes \u201cher half interest of said residue\u201d as a life estate therein, which she should possess at her death was intended by the testator to go to his five nieces and nephews as designated remaindermen. The remainder was vested to come into possession of the life tenant; and the remainders may be in values if so legally determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">If it is desirable to dispose of a fee simple estate in any of the property in which Mrs. Mosgrove has a life estate, a court of equity may control the dispositipn of, and the conservation of, the values of the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The testator\u2019s will expresses no intent that the residue of the estate shall be arbitrarily considered as, or converted into, personalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">It is assumed that Item 1 of the will has been complied with by the payment of the <em>testator\u2019s </em>debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The bequest to Otto Mach of a fee simple estate in one-half of the \u201cresidue,\u201d and the bequest to Mrs. Mosgrove of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the other half \u201cfor and during her natural life with remainder over\u201d to designated nieces and nephews of the testator, were present bequests to the first takers, the portions to be ascertained as stated in the will, with vested remainder over after the expiration of the life estate bequeathed to Mrs. Mosgrove in one-half of the \u201cresidue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b499-6\">Terrell, Brown, Buford and Chapman, J.
