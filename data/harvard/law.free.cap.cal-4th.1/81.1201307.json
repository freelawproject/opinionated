We find no express or implied state-law restriction on the traditional rule that a local government may specifically enforce its valid land use regulations by demanding the elimination of offending conditions. Indeed, the County\u2019s order defers to all conceivable state regulatory concerns. The operator\u2019s attack upon the order, accepted by the courts below, would permit the company to reap the benefits of the illegal encroachments. We will therefore reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">IT Corporation (IT) operates a 106-acre \u201cClass I\u201d hazardous waste disposal facility (the Panoche facility) in the rolling hills of the County. The City of Benicia (City) adjoins the Panoche facility downslope to the southwest. The Panoche facility and surrounding land are zoned for agricultural use.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">In 1968, the County issued conditional use permit R-418 allowing the parcel then owned by IT\u2019s predecessor, Howard Jenkins, to be employed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>the disposal of liquid and solid hazardous wastes. Permit R-418 included a condition that all treatment and storage of hazardous waste must be set back at least 200 feet of the outer perimeter of the permitted property.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Jenkins created a number of surface impoundments\u2014ponds containing liquid waste\u2014on the property. By 1972, several of these impoundments (ponds 12, 13, 13A, 17, and 18), as well as surface solid wastepile 17P, had encroached within 200 feet of Jenkins\u2019s property line. Pond 17 came to the attention of the County\u2019s planning commission (Commission) as early as 1971 because the pond had intruded beyond Jenkins\u2019s property onto neighbors\u2019 land. Apparently Jenkins was allowed to cure the pond 17 violation by purchasing additional land to bring this impoundment within a reconfigured 200-foot setback.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In 1973, the County issued a new permit for the site, No. R-708. Permit R-708 related to a specific site map provided by Jenkins and included a 200-foot setback condition (Condition 3.F.) that was substantially identical to the 1968 restriction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">IT acquired the Panoche facility in 1975 and continued to deposit wastes in ponds 12, 13, 13A, 17, and 18, and in surface wastepile 17P. IT also inherited two landfills which encroached beyond the setback line referred to in permit R-708. IT added hazardous waste to these landfills as well. IT itself established the so-called north drum burial site, which intruded into the setback zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Since 1975, IT has purchased additional contiguous land west, north, and east of the facility. The effect of these acquisitions is that only pond 13 A, the encroaching unit nearest the City, remains less than 200 feet from the outer boundary of property now owned by IT.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">In 1981, the Department of Health Services (DHS), acting under state and federal laws, issued an \u201cInterim Status Document\u201d authorizing operation of the facility. In September 1985, the County\u2019s director of public works issued a stop order against grading work at the site on grounds that a grading permit was required and had not been obtained. IT appealed the stop order to the County\u2019s board of supervisors (Board). In January 1986, as partial settlement of the grading dispute, IT stipulated to formal hearings before the Commission to determine IT\u2019s compliance with permit R-708.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">During 1986 and 1987, the Commission held numerous hearings and took voluminous evidence. As IT concedes, evidence of noncompliance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Condition 3.F. was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d The record also touched upon the troubled regulatory history of the facility, which included citations by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Testimony and documentary evidence catalogued leakage and migration of hazardous wastes from encroaching storage areas into surrounding soil of the setback zone and, with respect to pond 13A, beyond the borders of IT\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">On June 25, 1987, the Commission found that IT was out of compliance with several conditions of the permit. Among other things, the Commission determined that \u201cIT is in violation of Condition 3.F. due to the encroachment of portions of Ponds 12,13,13A, 17 and 18, as well as portions of waste pile 17P, the old landfill and the north drum burial area on the 200 foot buffer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The Commission proposed a two-pronged remedy for the violation of Condition 3.F. First, IT must \u201cimmediately cease using and close\u201d all encroachments. Second, IT must within 90 days submit to pertinent state and federal regulators its \u201cplans for clean closure, i.e., removal of all wastes [except drum burials] and contaminated soils\u201d from the setback zone; must modify its closure plans as required by the agencies; and must begin closure immediately upon obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">IT was ordered to consult further with the agencies on the safest plan for closure of the drum burial encroachment, and to submit a closure plan on that basis. If \u201cclean closure\u201d approval was not obtained for any encroachment subject to that requirement, the Commission promised to \u201creopen the hearings to review appropriate remedies at that time.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">IT appealed the \u201cclean closure\u201d order to the Board. The company urged, inter alia, that the proposed remedy of complete restoration was preempted, arbitrary, unreasonable, and estopped by the County\u2019s long delay in enforcing Condition 3.F. IT estimated that \u201cclean closure\u201d of the encroachments entailed removal of some 174,000 cubic yards of hazardous material and might cost as much as $40.5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The Board ordered the Commission staff to study alternate remedies. For the most part, these included variations on IT\u2019s proposal that the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>close and cleanse <em>only </em>the encroachment adjacent to City (i.e., pond 13A) and simply \u201cdedicate\u201d a <em>new </em>200-foot setback conforming to the current boundaries of IT\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">In March 1988, after considering the staff report and conducting hearings de novo, the Board adopted the Commission\u2019s remedial order. IT sought mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The superior court granted relief. The court ruled that a violation of Condition 3.F. was established by the administrative record. Applying the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test of review, it also found \u201cunsupported by the record\u201d IT\u2019s separate defenses of laches, estoppel, and the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the court concluded that because \u201cstate law has pre-empted the storage, treatment, and disposal of [hazardous waste,] . . . [t]he Board is without authority to dictate the remedy\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201cclean closure\u201d\u2014for IT\u2019s permit violation. On the other hand, the court held, the Board could order IT to submit for appropriate state regulatory approval \u201cone or more plans by which <em>[IT] proposes </em>to remedy the non-compliance.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Both parties appealed. The Court of Appeal affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Addressing IT\u2019s appeal, the court reasoned as follows: No limitations period had run, because IT\u2019s violations were \u201ccontinuing.\u201d With respect to IT\u2019s equitable defenses, the trial court properly reviewed the Board\u2019s findings under the deferential \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, rather than the more stringent \u201cindependent judgment\u201d standard urged by IT.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201cambiguous\u201d administrative record did not make clear when the County actually knew or should have known of the bulk of the encroachments. Hence, the trial court correctly declined to uphold IT\u2019s claims of laches and estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Addressing the County\u2019s appeal, the court reasoned as follows: The setback condition was a valid local land use regulation, and the Board was entitled to enforce it by ordering IT to \u201ccease using\u201d and \u201cclose\u201d the encroachments. However, by dictating the <em>method </em>of closure of a hazardous waste disposal site, a matter of statewide concern, the Board invaded the state\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive\u201d regulation of that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>The County alone sought review, urging that the courts below had erroneously resolved the issue of preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">1. <em>Implied preemption.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeal discussed IT\u2019s claims of <em>express </em>preemption because both courts accepted IT\u2019s more general contention that the Board\u2019s \u201cclean closure\u201d order was <em>impliedly </em>preempted by the comprehensive state statutes and regulations governing the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. The County and its amici curiae<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> urge first that this conclusion was erroneous. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\u201cA county may make and enforce within its limits \u2018all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 7.) . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Deukmejian </em>v. <em>County of Mendocino </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 476, 483-484 [204 Cal.Rptr. 897, 683 P.2d 1150] <em>(Mendocino).) </em> The power of cities and counties to zone land use in accordance with local conditions is well entrenched. (See, e.g., 3 Manaster &amp; Selmi, Cal. Environmental Law and Land Use Practice (1991 rev.) \u00a7\u00a7 60.10, 60.11, pp. 60-14, 60-15; 1 Longtin\u2019s Cal. Land Use (2d ed. 1987) \u00a7 3.02, pp. 234-235; Cal. Zoning Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1969) \u00a7\u00a7 1.3-1.6, pp. 4-7.) The Legislature has specified certain minimum standards for local zoning regulations (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65850 et seq.) but has carefully expressed its intent to retain the maximum degree of local control (see, e.g., <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 65800, 65802).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">A zoning ordinance may allow conditional uses, pursuant to permit, for particular parcels within a zone. The reasonable conditions included in such a permit become part of the zoning regulation applicable to the affected parcel. (1 Longtin\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3.71[1], at pp. 360-362; 3 Manaster &amp; Selmi, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 60.71 [1], at pp. 60-97, 60-98; see Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 65901, 65909.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">When use of a parcel violates applicable zoning rules, the responsible agency may obtain abatement\u2014i.e., removal of the violation and restoration of legal use\u2014even when substantial expense is involved. (See, e.g., <em>County of San Diego </em>v. <em>McClurken </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 683 [234 P.2d 972] [remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>fixed 48,000-gallon storage tanks]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 590 [116 Cal.Rptr. 172] [remove auto wrecking business]; <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Padilla </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 388 [100 Cal.Rptr. 223] [remove 2 dwelling units]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watkins </em>(1959) 175 Cal.App.2d 182 [345 P.2d 960] [remove portion of structure beyond setback line]; <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(1948) 88 Cal.App.2d 386 [199 P.2d 51] [remove 20 dwelling units; reconvert main structure to single-family residence].) Abatement does not depend on a finding that the zoning violation constitutes a \u201cnuisance per se.\u201d <em>(City of Santa Clara </em>v. <em>Paris </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 338, 341-342 [142 Cal.Rptr. 818]; <em>City etc. of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Burton </em>(1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 749, 756-757 [20 Cal.Rptr. 378].)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Permit R-708 expressly authorizes the Commission to hold periodic compliance reviews and to determine \u201c[a]ny action deemed appropriate\u201d to correct noncompliance therein found to exist. Indeed, IT stipulated to such a review as partial settlement of its grading-permit dispute with the County. Thus, it is clear that neither the setback condition in IT\u2019s permit, nor the Board\u2019s issuance of a remedial order for noncompliance, exceeds the County\u2019s general land use control powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">IT argues instead that this particular order is invalid because it invades the sensitive field of hazardous waste management in ways which are closely and exclusively regulated by the state. In particular, IT invokes the state\u2019s complex scheme for overseeing the \u201cclosure\u201d of hazardous waste disposal sites\u2014a scheme designed to minimize health, safety, and environmental risks when use of a site is discontinued. This scheme, IT argues, places all \u201cclosure\u201d procedures and decisions in the hands of an expert state agency, DHS, and thus precludes a local government from dictating the method of \u201cclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The trial court and the Court of Appeal agreed with this contention. We conclude it lacks merit. Nothing in state hazardous waste disposal law implies that a city or county is precluded from abating a clear and potentially dangerous violation of its valid land use regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u201cLocal [regulation] in conflict with general law is void. Conflicts exist if the [regulation] duplicates [citations], contradicts [citation], or enters an area fully occupied by general law . . . [citations] . . . .\u201d <em>(Mendocino, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 476, 484-485, quoting <em>Lancaster </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 805, 806-808 [100 Cal.Rptr. 609, 494 P.2d 681].)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">. . In determining whether the Legislature has preempted by implication to the exclusion of local regulation we must look to the whole purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>and scope of the legislative scheme. There are three tests: \u2018(1) the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern; (2) the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action; or (3) the subject matter has been partially covered by general law, and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of . . . local [regulation] on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the [local government].\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Mendocino, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 485, quoting <em>In re Hubbard </em>(1964) 62 Cal.2d 119, 128 [41 Cal.Rptr. 393, 396 P.2d 809]; accord: <em>Western Oil &amp; Gas Assn. </em>v. <em>Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control Dist. </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 408, 423 [261 Cal.Rptr. 384, <em>777 </em>P.2d 157] (WOGA).)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Here, of course, there is no issue of the challenged order\u2019s undue effect on \u201ctransient citizens.\u201d The question is whether state law has so occupied the subject of hazardous waste management as to preclude a local government from enforcing its long-standing restrictions on the locations within a facility at which hazardous waste may be treated or stored.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The Hazardous Waste Control Act (HWCA), adopted in 1972 (Stats. 1972, ch. 1236, \u00a7 1, p. 2388 et seq.), is codified as chapter 6.5 of the Health and Safety Code (\u00a7 25100 et seq.). The HWCA directs DHS to adopt standards and regulations governing the \u201cmanagement of hazardous wastes\u201d in order to \u201cprotect against hazards to the public health, to domestic livestock, to wildlife, or to the environment.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25150, subd. (a).) Among other things, DHS must issue permits authorizing operation of hazardous waste disposal facilities and must apply applicable regulations and standards through the permit system. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 25150, subd. (b), 25200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">DHS may grant \u201cinterim status\u201d operating authority to a pre-1980 facility such as Panoche, pending final determination of the operator\u2019s permit application. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25200.5, subd. (a).) For HWCA purposes, the Panoche facility apparently has always operated under \u201cinterim status\u201d authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The HWCA further requires DHS to adopt \u201cclosure\u201d regulations and standards for hazardous waste disposal facilities. These regulations must specify financial assurances by facility operators to cover postclosure damage claims, as well as the cost of closure and postclosure maintenance. The regulations must also ensure that every such facility \u201ccan be closed and maintained [thereafter] for at least 30 years\u201d without health or environmental damage, and that the escape of contamination from a closed site into the soil, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>water, and atmosphere will be \u201c[minimized] or [eliminated].\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25245, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The HWCA provides that when they apply for permits, \u201cor when otherwise requested by [DHS],\u201d facility operators must submit \u201cclosure and postclosure plans\u201d for approval by DHS and RWQCB. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25246, subds. (a), (b).) DHS must approve a plan that complies with all pertinent regulations, <em>(Id.., </em>\u00a7 25247, subds. (a), (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">DHS has implemented the required permit system and has developed extensive regulations governing the design, construction, operation, maintenance, monitoring, closure, and postclosure maintenance of hazardous waste facilities. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 26 (hereafter Regulations), \u00a7\u00a7 22-66260.1 et seq., 22-66264.110 et seq.; former \u00a7\u00a7 22-66316 et seq., 22-67102 et seq.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Among these are detailed standards for the \u201cclosure\u201d or \u201cpartial closure\u201d of hazardous waste disposal sites, and for the contents of closure plans to be submitted by facility operators. (Regs., \u00a7\u00a7 22-66260.10, 22-66264.110, 22-66264.111, 22-66264.112; former \u00a7\u00a7 22-66027, 22-66152, 22-67210 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">IT contends that the HWCA places the initiative for closure plan design on the <em>facility operator alone, </em>subject only to state regulatory standards which do not necessarily require complete restoration of a site to its original condition. IT asserts, and no party disputes, that IT has designed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>submitted for DHS approval its own HWCA plan to \u201cclose in place\u201d the entire Panoche facility, including the encroaching deposits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Hence, IT contends, the Board\u2019s order conflicts with the HWCA by <em>requiring </em>IT to submit an <em>additional </em>plan that <em>specifies </em>\u201cclean\u201d closure of the encroachments.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">We cannot accept the premise. With specific exceptions discussed below, nothing in the HWCA or its implementing regulations indicates any intent or need to immunize a state-authorized facility from the enforcement of applicable local land use regulations. Indeed, the HWCA expressly suggests otherwise. Health and Safety Code section 25105 provides that \u201c[n]o provision of this chapter [i.e., ch. 6.5,] shall limit the authority of any state <em>or local </em>agency in the enforcement or administration of <em>any provision of law </em>which it is specifically permitted or required to enforce and administer.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">As we noted in <em>Mendocino, </em>use of the word \u201claw\u201d is significant in this context, for \u201claw\u201d includes local ordinances. (See <em>Mendocino, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 489.) Moreover, the legislative decision to reserve local powers despite adoption of the HWCA was conscious and specific. The words \u201cor local\u201d were added to Health and Safety Code section 25105 (originally \u00a7 25172) during the Legislature\u2019s consideration of the HWCA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Given the historic role of cities and counties in local land use regulation, we must assume the Legislature meant to allow the \u201cenforcement\u201d of \u201clocal\u201d zoning \u201claw[s],\u201d as applied through use permit conditions. (See <em>Mendocino, supra.)</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Moreover, the HWCA expressly provides for joint state and local authority over the siting and operation of hazardous waste facilities. Among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>things, the HWCA limits local power to reject a new facility in derogation of statewide interests (see Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25199 et seq.) but also allows delayed effectiveness of a new <em>state </em>permit \u201cuntil the applicant is granted a local land use permit.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 25199.3, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">As we said in <em>Mendocino, </em>\u201c[preemption by implication of legislative intent may not be found when the Legislature has expressed its intent to permit local regulations. Similarly, it should not be found when the statutory scheme recognizes local regulations.\u201d <em>(Mendocino, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 485; <em>Casmalia Resources, Ltd. </em>v. <em>County of Santa Barbara </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 827, 837 [240 Cal.Rptr. 903, 67 A.L.R.4th 809] [finding HWCA did not impliedly preempt local monitoring regulations].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The Legislature has further undermined IT\u2019s claim of \u201cimplied\u201d preemption by making clear those narrow areas in which it considers local regulation incompatible with the state scheme. In 1981, the Legislature became concerned that hostile local restrictions on existing hazardous waste disposal facilities might accelerate a developing reduction in statewide disposal capacity. By adding article 4.5 to the HWCA (Stats. 1981, ch. 244, \u00a7 3, p. 1295), the Legislature expressly barred unilateral efforts by local governments to \u201cprohibit or unreasonably regulate\u201d the treatment or disposal of hazardous wastes at \u201cexisting\u201d \u201cClass I\u201d disposal facilities such as Panoche (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25149, subd. (a)).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">However, the Legislature has specified the limited nature of this statutory intrusion on local land use regulation. Health and Safety Code section 25147 declares that \u201c[e]xcept as expressly provided in Section 25149, it is not the intent of this article to preempt local land use regulation of existing hazardous waste facilities.\u201d  Health and Safety Code section 25149, subdivision (a), itself states that \u201cnothing in this section authorizes an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>operator of [an \u2018existing\u2019] facility to violate any term or condition of a local land use permit or any other provision of law not in conflict with this section.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Another example of the Legislature\u2019s ability to distinguish expressly between preempted and nonpreempted regulation occurs in article 6.5 of the HWCA, adopted in 1979. (See Stats. 1979, ch. 1097, \u00a7 3, p. 3964.) Article 6.5 (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25167.1-25169.3) sets standards and establishes state registration for transporters and haulers of hazardous waste. Health and Safety Code section 25167.3 declares an intent that article 6.5 preempt \u201call local regulations and all conflicting state regulations concerning the transportation of hazardous waste\u201d and provides that no local agency, including a charter city or county, \u201cshall adopt or enforce any ordinance or regulation . . . inconsistent with [state] regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The Legislature has thus demonstrated its readiness to preempt local regulation unequivocally when persuaded of the need to do so. Its preemptive action in specific and expressly limited areas weighs against an inference that preemption by implication was intended elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Examination of \u201cthe whole purpose and scope of the legislative scheme\u201d <em>(Mendocino, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 485) leads us to the same conclusion. The Legislature has declared that the HWCA\u2019s purpose is to ensure safe handling, treatment, recycling, disposal, and destruction of hazardous waste (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25101, subd. (a)), and to develop a state hazardous waste program \u201cin lieu\u201d of the federal RCRA program. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 25101, subd. (d), 25159; see fn. 6, <em>ante, </em>at p. 92.)  Though extensive and detailed, the HWCA purports only to be a \u201cminimum standards\u201d program and implies no general purpose to strip local entities of their traditional power to impose and specifically enforce land use regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">IT points to the California Attorney General\u2019s 1974 conclusion that in view of the need for \u201cuniform\u201d statewide standards, the HWCA \u201c[preempts] the field of regulating the handling, processing, and disposal of hazardous . . . waste materials.\u201d (57 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 159, 164.) For reasons already stated, the opinion fails to persuade us that the HWCA generally precludes enforcement of a local land use condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">In particular, the Attorney General\u2019s opinion construes too narrowly the HWCA\u2019s express disclaimer of intent to preempt \u201cenforcement ... of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>any provision of law\u201d by responsible \u201clocal agencies].\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25105, formerly <em>id., </em>\u00a7 25172.) Contrary to our later <em>Mendocino </em>analysis, the opinion assumes that the statutory reference includes only <em>state </em>laws administered by local officials. (57 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 159, <em>supra, </em>at p. 163.) Moreover, the express but limited preemption clauses later adopted by the Legislature belie the opinion\u2019s assumption of broader preemptive intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">IT next suggests that the Board\u2019s order disrupts the state\u2019s regulatory process for closure of hazardous waste facilities, bypasses the expertise of state agencies, and may affect statewide policies on hazardous waste transportation and storage capacity. Again, we disagree. As the County has emphasized, the order does not demand that IT remove all hazardous waste deposits in the setback zone regardless of state regulatory and programmatic concerns. Instead, it simply requires IT to submit the option of \u201cclean\u201d closure\u2014i.e., complete removal of contaminants\u2014for approval by all pertinent regulatory agencies, including DHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">State regulations require a facility operator to submit a \u201cclosure plan\u201d which includes, if applicable, a description how the operator would perform both \u201cfinal closure\u201d of a facility at the end of its active life <em>and </em>\u201cpartial or final closure\u201d of the facility <em>during </em>its active life. (Regs., \u00a7 22-66264.112, subd. (b); former \u00a7 22-67212, subd. (b)(1); see also former \u00a7 22-67212, subd. (a).) Amendments to the plan must be made, submitted, and approved \u201cwhenever changes in operating plans . . . affect the closure plan, or there is a change in the expected year of closure. . . .\u201d (Regs., \u00a7 22-66264.112, subd. (c)(2)(A), (B); former \u00a7 22-67212, subd. (c).) Current regulations require a facility operator to seek approval of an amended closure plan within 60 days after the plan has been affected by an \u201cunexpected event.\u201d (Regs., \u00a7 22-66264.112, subd. (c)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The Regulations set minimum standards for closure plan methodology, but they do not prohibit the operator from submitting a more stringent closure plan. Nor do they exclude local regulation as the cause of operational changes or other \u201cunexpected event[s]\u201d requiring amendment of the plan. A fortiori, they do not eliminate the possibility that enforcement of a local land use regulation might force the operator to submit, for state regulatory approval, a \u201cpartial closure\u201d plan which exceeds minimum state standards.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">In essence, IT contends that the long-continuing deposit of hazardous wastes in and upon land <em>never permitted for that use </em>is exempt from effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>local remedy simply because a state scheme exists for regulation and \u201cclosure\u201d of hazardous waste disposal facilities. However, the HWCA suggests no such wholesale intent to intrude upon the enforcement of local zoning and land use regulations. We conclude that the HWCA does not impliedly preempt the Board\u2019s cleanup order.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">2. <em>Express preemption.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">IT and Pacific claim the judgments of the trial court and the Court of Appeal are nonetheless correct on the alternative theory that Health and Safety Code section 25149 <em>expressly </em>preempts the Board\u2019s order. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Health and Safety Code section 25149, subdivision (a), provides in pertinent part that \u201c[njotwithstanding any other provision of law,\u201d and with limited exceptions not applicable here, \u201cno city or county ... or district may enact, issue, enforce, suspend, revoke, or modify any ordinance, regulation, law, license, or permit relating to an existing hazardous waste facility so as to <em>prohibit or unreasonably regulate </em>the disposal, treatment, or recovery of resources from hazardous waste ... at that facility. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There is no dispute that the Panoche facility, in operation since the late 1960\u2019s, is an \u201cexisting hazardous waste facility\u201d as described in the statute. (See <em>id., </em>\u00a7 25148, subd. (a); Regs., \u00a7 22-66260.10; former \u00a7 22-66056.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">IT urges that the Board\u2019s order for complete cleanup of the buffer zone thus violates Health and Safety Code section 25149 because it constitutes \u201cenforcement\u201d of a \u201cpermit\u201d so as to \u201cunreasonably regulate\u201d hazardous waste disposal at the Panoche \u201cfacility.\u201d Pacific goes farther, suggesting that by banning local efforts to \u201cprohibit\u201d disposal at an existing \u201cfacility,\u201d section 25149 prevents <em>any and all </em>attempts by the County to limit IT\u2019s disposal of hazardous waste within the buffer zone. Neither position has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>These arguments turn on the meaning of the statutory phrase \u201cprohibit or unreasonably regulate . . . disposal ... at [a] facility.\u201d  To determine legislative intent, we first consult the statutory words themselves, applying their \u201cusual, ordinary import\u201d in harmony with the overall legislative scheme. <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 30, 43 [127 Cal.Rptr. 122, 544 P.2d 1322]; see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Kelly Broadcasting Co. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 724 [257 Cal.Rptr. 708, 771 P.2d 406].) If the statutory language is ambiguous, we examine the legislative history and other extrinsic indicia of the Legislature\u2019s purpose. (See <em>In re Marriage of Bouquet </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 583, 587-588 [128 Cal.Rptr. 427, 546 P.2d 1371]; <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 231-232 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The literal words of Health &amp; Safety Code section 25149 do not solve the precise issue before us\u2014i.e., whether the County may require IT to restore the boundaries within which hazardous waste disposal is a permitted use. The phrase \u201cprohibit ... the disposal [of] hazardous waste ... at [a] facility\u201d reasonably suggests more than one meaning, and the phrase \u201cunreasonably regulate\u201d is inherently open to interpretation. We therefore turn to a broader examination of legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Health and Safety Code section 25149 falls within article 4.5 of the HWCA. The purpose of article 4.5 is apparent from its legislative findings and declarations. The Legislature determined that statewide disposal capacity, both developed and potential, was decreasing despite increasing demand (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25146, 25146.5, subd. (b)), and that retention of \u201cthe number of existing hazardous waste facilities ... to the extent feasible\u201d was thus \u201ca matter of urgent public necessity and statewide concern\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 25146.5, subd. (a)).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">However, article 4.5 of the HWCA makes clear that it preempts local land use restrictions on existing facilities to the minimum extent consistent with these concerns. As previously noted, the article specifies that it does not preclude \u201clocal land use regulation\u201d of existing facilities \u201c[e]xcept as expressly provided in Section 25149\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25147) and does not authorize violation of \u201cany term or condition of a local land use permit . . . not in conflict with [section 25149]\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 25149, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The express reservations of local authority set forth in Health and Safety Code sections 25147 and 25149 represent a reversal of the original intent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>the bill. As first proposed, these sections would have preempted \u201call\u201d local regulation of the operation of \u201cexisting hazardous waste facilities\u201d; invested state agencies \u201cexclusively\u201d with regulatory authority over such facilities; and, with limited exceptions, prohibited local governments from imposing or enforcing \u201cany\u201d regulation on the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste therein. (See Sen. Bill No. 501 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) (hereafter S.B. 501) \u00a7 2.) The current language was later substituted by the Senate. (Sen. Amend, to S.B. 501, Apr. 30, 1981.) The obvious purpose of this successful amendment was to repudiate the notion of complete preemption, and to restrict the traditional land use prerogatives of local agencies only as necessary to serve specific statewide concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Hazardous waste disposal facilities are unpopular neighbors, and the Legislature obviously sought to prevent local political pressure from crippling the functions of a state-authorized facility already operating or under construction. No such concerns are implicated here. Since the inception of the Panoche facility, which long antedates article 4.5 of the HWCA, hazardous waste disposal has been a forbidden use of the 200-foot setback zone. That zone cannot be considered part of the state\u2019s \u201cexisting\u201d hazardous waste disposal capacity which the Legislature sought to \u201cretain\u201d by enacting article 4.5. By the same token, the Board\u2019s cleanup order has no effect on IT\u2019s authority to operate within the traditional geographical boundaries of its use permit. Nor does the order eliminate the Panoche facility from the \u201cnumber of existing hazardous waste . . . facilities.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25146.5, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Pacific argues that the statutory ban on local regulations which \u201cprohibit . . . disposal\u201d at an existing \u201cfacility\u201d protects such a \u201cfacility\u201d from <em>both complete and partial </em>local \u201cprohibitions].\u201d Thus, Pacific concludes, to the extent permit R-708 bans disposal at <em>any location </em>within the Panoche facility, Health and Safety Code section 25149 renders such condition void and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">However, pertinent statutory and regulatory references suggest that a \u201cfacility\u201d is an entire treatment or disposal operation, considered as a whole. (See, e.g., Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25146, 25146.5, 25148; see also Regs., \u00a7 22-66260.10; former \u00a7 22-66096 [\u201cHazardous waste facility\u201d means \u201call\u201d contiguous land and improvements used for management of hazardous waste; \u201cfacility\u201d may consist of \u201cone or more . . . units or combinations of . . . units\u201d].) Moreover, the declared objectives of article 4.5 of the HWCA, and the equally explicit limits on its preemptive intent, undermine Pacific\u2019s expansive interpretation of the statute.  We agree with the County that while Health and Safety Code section 25149 may forbid a local government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>from barring an \u201cexisting . . . facility\u2019s\u201d <em>acceptance </em>of hazardous waste pursuant to its HWCA authority, the statute does not prevent the enforcement of original geographical restrictions on <em>placement </em>of the waste received.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">IT suggests that the Board\u2019s order is not \u201cland use regulation,\u201d as to which Health and Safety Code sections 25147 and 25149 state an expressly limited preemptive intent. Instead, IT claims, the order is \u201chazardous waste closure regulation,\u201d a field occupied exclusively by the HWCA. However, by providing that local \u201cland use regulation\u201d and \u201cland use permit [conditions]\u201d are preempted only as expressly provided (see Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25147, 25149, subd. (a)), article 4.5 of the HWCA assumes that hazardous waste operations may be affected by local land use permits and regulations. Moreover, as we have already concluded, the HWCA \u201cclosure\u201d provisions imply no preemption of the order at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">IT offers numerous reasons why the Board\u2019s order is \u201cunreasonable\u201d regulation expressly preempted by Health and Safety Code section 25149. Because \u201cclean closure\u201d of the setback encroachments conflicts with IT\u2019s own submitted plan for \u201cclosure in place\u201d of the entire Panoche facility, IT suggests, the order improperly thwarts paramount state regulatory concerns without identifying any \u201carticulated standard\u201d or \u201ccompetent evidence\u201d in support of its decision. (Citing <em>Ogden Environmental Services </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(S.D.Cal. 1988) 687 F.Supp. 1436, 1447 <em>(Ogden).) </em>IT also implies the Board ignored prohibitive cost estimates for complete restoration of the encroached areas. These contentions are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">IT concedes it has violated the explicit setback condition of its land use permit and wisely makes no claim that the condition itself is \u201cunreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Yet IT suggests that given state regulatory interests under the HWCA, Health and Safety Code section 25149 requires the Board to justify its chosen method of enforcement as against less complete alternatives advanced by IT itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>The notion that remedies stricter than those proposed by the violator are presumptively \u201cunreasonable\u201d is novel. Such a rule would reward the violation and is compelled neither by Health and Safety Code section 25149 nor by the HWCA in general.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">In any event, the basis of the Board\u2019s decision is both manifest and reasonable.  Unless the encroaching deposits are removed, IT\u2019s mere violation of the setback condition will have defeated the specific and legitimate purpose of the condition\u2014maintenance of a waste-free \u201cbuffer\u201d around the original permitted disposal site.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The Board considered IT\u2019s proposed alternatives, which involved dedication of a <em>new </em>setback line, consistent with the <em>current </em>boundaries of IT\u2019s property, so as to enclose all but one of the current encroachments. But these proposals really constituted no enforcement or remedy at all. Rather, they rewarded and ratified IT\u2019s violations by simply expanding the permit boundaries to accommodate them. The Board\u2019s insistence upon the original terms of the permit was hardly \u201cunreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">IT notes that the staff report studied by the Board identified considerable technical problems and environmental risks of moving and redepositing the encroaching wastes. In light of these difficulties, IT suggests, the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u201creasonable\u201d decision was to leave the competing interests for resolution between IT and DHS under the \u201cclosure\u201d provisions of the HWCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">In effect, however, this is what the Board has done. Under its order, pertinent regulatory agencies are free to conclude that the risks and burdens of \u201cclean closure\u201d are unacceptable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> IT\u2019s claim that paramount state law leaves IT free to choose its preferred remedy has already been rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">We conclude that the Board\u2019s order does not constitute \u201cunreasonable\u201d or \u201cprohibitory\u201d regulation of an \u201cexisting hazardous waste facility.\u201d Hence, the order is not expressly preempted by article 4.5 of the HWCA.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed insofar as it holds that the Board\u2019s order for \u201cclean closure\u201d of the setback encroachments is preempted by state laws governing hazardous waste disposal facilities. In all other respects, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Lucas, C.

No. 94-580, 90 Stat. 2795 (1976), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6901 et seq.), which covers many of the same topics. The RCRA defers to state hazardous waste programs approved by the EPA administrator as meeting RCRA standards, and similarly allowed \u201cinterim authorization\u201d of preexisting state programs the EPA administrator deemed \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to the RCRA program. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6926(b), (c).) California\u2019s Legislature has authorized and instructed the director of DHS to take all steps necessary to establish an approved program \u201cin lieu\u201d of federal RCRA enforcement. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25101, subd. (d), 25159.) However, California\u2019s program has never won final EPA approval, and the state\u2019s partial \u201cinterim authorization\u201d expired in 1986, causing reversion of the federal program to federal control. Hence, both state and federal regulations currently apply in this state. (3 Manas ter &amp; Selmi, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 50.50[2], atpp. 50-41, 50-42.) Under a 1988 agreement, EPA has delegated the bulk of federal enforcement to DHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Effective July 1, 1991, DHS repealed its previous regulatory scheme and substituted a new scheme designed to meet RCRA standards for EPA approval of an \u201cin lieu\u201d state program. Portions of the prior state scheme which exceeded RCRA standards were retained and recodified. (See Regs., \u00a7 22-66260.1 et seq.; Barclay\u2019s Cal.

A Senate amendment of November 28, 1972, added the words \u201cor local\u201d between \u201cstate\u201d and \u201cagency.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b123-9\">In <em>Mendocino, </em>this court concluded that nothing in divisions 6 and 7 of the Food and Agricultural Code, which regulate and license the use of \u201ceconomic poisons,\u201d impliedly preempted a county ordinance prohibiting the aerial application of phenoxy herbicides. Among other things, we observed that under the state regulatory scheme (Food &amp; Agr. Code, \u00a7 14007), state-issued agricultural pesticide permits were expressly conditioned upon \u201ccompliance with the law,\u201d which \u201claw\u201d must be construed to include local health ordinances adopted under the police power. <em>(Mendocino, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 486.) The Legislature promptly thereafter added section 11501.1 to division 6 of the Food and Agricultural Code and also amended Food and Agricultural Code section 14007. The new section provides that divisions 6 and 7 \u201care of statewide concern and occupy the whole field of regulation regarding . . . economic poisons to the' exclusion of all local regulation\u201d; accordingly, \u201cno ordinance or regulation of local government . . . may prohibit or in any way attempt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>regulate any matter relating to the . . . use of economic poisons, and any of these ordinances, <em>laws, </em>or regulations are void and of no force or effect.\u201d (Italics added.) The amendment to Food and Agricultural Code section 14007 removed the phrase \u201ccompliance with the law\u201d and substituted the phrase \u201ccompliance with this code [, related] regulations!,] and . . . such other specified conditions as may be required to accomplish the purposes of this chapter.\u201d Though the Legislature stated an intent to \u201coverturn the holding\u201d of <em>Mendocino </em>and to \u201creassert\u201d the exclusive state regulation of economic poisons (Stats. 1984, ch. 1386, \u00a7 3, pp. 4879-4880), nothing in its declaration of <em>express </em>preemption undermines our conclusion that preemption should not be <em>implied </em>when state regulation acknowledges local \u201claw.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"Ag\">Pacific suggests that <em>Mendocino </em>announced this principle, without authority, as a \u201ctrump card\u201d over the more general tests of legislative intent and occupation of the field. \u201cIn sum, amicus [curiae] submits that the unique language in <em>Mendocino </em>should be explicitly disapproved or just forgotten. . . .\u201d We are not persuaded. An expressed intent to allow local regulation, or an express recognition of local regulation, is convincing evidence that the state legislative scheme was not intended to occupy the field.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\">An \u201cexisting hazardous waste facility,\u201d for purposes of article 4.5 of the HWCA, is defined to include one \u201coperating as of May 1, 1981, pursuant to a grant of interim status by [DHS] pursuant to Section 25200.5.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25148, subd. (a)(2).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\">With respect to facilities not yet in existence, article 4.5 of the HWCA prohibits local authorities, once having issued conditional use permits for particular facilities, from amending them later to impose \u201cadditional restrictions\u201d on the types of hazardous waste the facilities may accept. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25149.1, subd. (a).) Article 4.5 thus implicitly acknowledges the general right of local authorities to impose such restrictions in local use permits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Moreover, the Regulations themselves appear to embrace \u201cclean closure\u201d as the preferred methodology for surface impoundments (i.e., ponds for liquid and semiliquid wastes) and surface wastepiles, such as those primarily at issue here. Methods short of \u201cclean closure\u201d are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>acceptable only where the operator shows alternative means will meet applicable health and environmental standards under the particular circumstances, or that \u201cclean closure\u201d is impracticable. (See Regs., \u00a7\u00a7 22-66264.228, 22-66264.258; former \u00a7\u00a7 22-67316, 22-67351.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Under section 25149, subdivision (a), a local government may \u201cprohibit or unreasonably regulate\u201d hazardous waste disposal at an \u201cexisting . . . facility\u201d only if, \u201cafter public notice and hearing, the director [of DHS] determines that the operation of the facility may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health and the environment. . . .\u201d The County applied for such a finding in this case, but one had not been made at the time of trial. Article 4.5 also specifically preserves \u201cthe right of any person to maintain a civil action to enjoin or abate a nuisance . . . .\u201d (See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25149.7; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 731.) It allows general law cities and counties to impose, for revenue purposes, a maximum 10 percent gross receipts tax on existing facilities. (See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25149, subd. (a), 25149.5.) Finally, it authorizes a city or district attorney\u2019s office, when requested by DHS, to seek injunctive relief against threatened violations of the HWCA within that office\u2019s territorial jurisdiction. (See <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 25149, subd. (a), 25181.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Among the Legislature\u2019s detailed findings were that under current law and circumstances, \u201cimbalance between supply and demand is likely to further increase in the foreseeable future\u201d; that the problem is common to urban, suburban, and rural areas throughout the state; and that decreases in capacity increase the distance hazardous waste must be transported for proper disposal, which in turn encourages illegal disposal.

Because of the obvious health, safety, and environmental dangers, state legislation now presumptively requires a 2,000-foot buffer zone around facilities which began operation after August 6, 1980. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25202.5, subds. (c)-(e).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\"><em>Ogden, supra, </em>687 F.Supp. 1436, on which IT heavily relies, is inapposite. There, after extensive study, state and federal agencies issued permits for operation of an experimental treatment facility in a municipal area already zoned for that use. The city responded by hastily adopting a use permit ordinance, then delayed and ultimately denied a permit on vague grounds. <em>Ogden </em>concluded that such local obstructionism was preempted as \u201ca significant obstacle to the fulfillment of a clear congressional objective\u201d set forth in the RCRA. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1450; see <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Davidowitz </em>(1941) 312 U.S. 52, 67 [85 L.Ed. 581, 586-587, 61 S.Ct. 399].) The court suggested that the RCRA\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d for \u201cmore stringent\u201d local regulation (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6929) applies only when the local government proceeds upon \u201cadequate information and study\u201d and by \u201carticulating specific health or safety concerns or setting forth particular environmental requirements which the facility must meet . . . .\u201d <em>(Ogden, supra, </em>687 F.Supp. at pp. 1448, 1450.) Here, however, the County's \u201cclean closure\u201d order is no standardless subversion of state policy; it merely remedies the violation of a condition under which IT has always been required to operate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Thus we may reject IT\u2019s argument, not raised in the trial court, that the Board\u2019s order is void as a matter of administrative law because it lacks \u201cfindings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and [the] ultimate decision . . . .\u201d <em>(Topanga Assn, for a Scenic Community </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515 [113 Cal.Rptr. 836, 522 P.2d 12].) There is no such \u201canalytic gap.\u201d The order flows implicitly from the Board\u2019s undisputed \u201cfinding,\u201d on undisputed \u201cevidence,\u201d that the requirement of a 200-foot waste-free buffer around the permitted disposal site had been violated in specific respects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The current basic zoning of the area is for agriculture, a use incompatible with hazardous waste contamination. Moreover, the Panoche facility abuts the City of Benicia, and logic suggests that the land acquired by IT since issuance of the permit has potential for residential or commercial development. The Board was not obliged to eliminate or restrict these possible uses simply to accommodate IT\u2019s violation of its permit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\">IT notes that closure of a hazardous waste facility is a \u201cdiscretionary project\u201d under the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.) and thus requires consideration of an environmental impact report (EIR) before final closure decisions are made. Nothing in the Board\u2019s order precludes DHS from including evaluation of an EIR in its decision whether to approve \u201cclean closure\u201d of the setback encroachments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b132-10\">The Regulations effective July 1, 1991 (see fn. 6, <em>ante), </em>include new section 22-66260.4, which provides that \u201c[n]o local agency shall enforce any requirement, other than those in this division, which would impede interstate or intrastate transportation or disposal of hazardous waste or which would impede use of facilities for regional multi-county management of hazardous waste.\u201d The meaning of the phrase \u201cimpede . . . disposal of hazardous waste\u201d is not clear on its face, but a county\u2019s efforts to obtain removal of stored waste from land where such storage was never permitted cannot reasonably be deemed an \u201cimpedfiment]\u201d to disposal within the regulatory meaning. In any event, section 22-66260.4 of the Regulations does not derive from any specific provision of the HWCA, and application of this Regulation against the County\u2019s enforcement of its long-standing land use limitation would appear to contravene Health and Safety Code sections 25105, 25147, and 25149.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
