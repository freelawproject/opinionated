Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">We confront in this case the interplay of two otherwise unrelated constitutional concerns: the prohibition against being twice put in jeopardy and the right of a criminal defendant to be mentally as well as physically present at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>trial. In deciding whether real party in interest John Marks<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> may invoke the protections of the double jeopardy clause, we first consider whether a trial court suffers a fundamental loss of jurisdiction when it subjects a defendant to trial without first determining that he has the requisite capacity to understand, consult, and assist in the defense of his life or liberty. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1368.) We resolve this threshold question in the negative and conclude the court retains jurisdiction over the subsequent, albeit defective, proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">This determination does not end our inquiry, however. Because the failure to evaluate a defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial mandates reversal, principles of double jeopardy may limit the scope of reprosecution. To assess the proper application of this constitutional guaranty in the present factual context, we also address whether a conviction of a lesser degree crime by operation of law (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1157)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> should be accorded the same effect on retrial as an express finding of the lesser degree crime by the previous trier of fact. This question we answer in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">II. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">We are not unacquainted with the underlying factual and procedural history herein, portions of which we reviewed on automatic appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marks </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1335, 1338-1339 [248 Cal.Rptr. 874, 756 P.2d 260] <em>(Marks </em>I).) The record established reversible error because the trial court failed to hold a competency hearing in compliance with section 1368, subdivision (b), after expressing a doubt as to defendant\u2019s ability to proceed with the guilt phase. (45 Cal.3d at pp. 1340-1344; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hale </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 531, 541 [244 Cal.Rptr. 114, 749 P.2d 769].) \u201c[T]o provide brief guidance to the trial court for the possibility of a retrial,\u201d we noted that \u201c[t]he jury\u2019s verdict did not specify the degree of murder of which defendant was convicted [contrary to the mandate of section 1157].\u201d (45 Cal.3d at p. 1344.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The matter returned to the trial court, where defendant was found competent. The prosecution reinstated all charges, including first degree murder, both special circumstance allegations, and all enhancement allegations, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>indicated its intention again to seek the death penalty. Defendant entered pleas of former acquittal and once in jeopardy (\u00a7 1016), essentially contending that by operation of section 1157 the prosecution could not retry him on any offense greater than second degree murder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The People responded that the trial court\u2019s section 1368 error rendered it without jurisdiction except to hold a competency hearing and that all other proceedings were a nullity. Since jeopardy never attached, the proffered pleas were unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">After a hearing on the matter, the trial court agreed with defendant and limited the prosecution to retrial for second degree murder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The People petitioned for extraordinary relief; in a divided opinion, the Court of Appeal issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the trial court to set aside its order precluding prosecution for first degree murder and to strike defendant\u2019s pleas of former acquittal and once in jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">In reversing the trial court, the Court of Appeal majority accepted the People\u2019s jurisdictional argument, obviating the need to consider defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claims. In a lengthy explication, the dissent vigorously disagreed, positing that the trial court did not proceed without jurisdiction but only in excess of jurisdiction because its failure to hold a competency hearing denied defendant his due process right to a fair trial. Since the trial proceedings were thus not void, double jeopardy might preclude retrial for first degree murder. The dissent declined, however, to reach this issue in light of countervailing policy considerations, concluding instead that due process required the same result to avoid penalizing defendant for exercising his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">We granted defendant\u2019s petition for review and stayed further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">A. <em>Trial Court Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">The parties have framed the nature and scope of our threshold inquiry thusly: The People contend double jeopardy is not implicated because the trial court\u2019s failure to observe the mandate of section 1368 divested it of fundamental, i.e., subject matter, jurisdiction. \u201cBoth the history of the Double Jeopardy Clause and its terms demonstrate that it does not come into play until a proceeding begins before a trier \u2018having jurisdiction to try the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>question of guilt or innocence of the accused.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Serfass </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1975) 420 U.S. 377, 391 [43 L.Ed.2d 265, 276, 95 S.Ct. 1055]; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1824) 22 U.S. 579 [6 L.Ed. 165].) From this perspective, since section 1368 error requires reversal irrespective of prejudice (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hale, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 541), defendant was never subjected to the possibility of a valid conviction. \u201cWithout risk of a determination of guilt, jeopardy does not attach, and neither an appeal nor further prosecution constitutes double jeopardy.\u201d <em>(Serfass </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>420 U.S. at pp. 391-392 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 276].) Put succinctly, \u201can accused must suffer jeopardy before he can suffer double jeopardy.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 393 [43 L.Ed.2d at pp. 277].)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Defendant counters that principles of double jeopardy obtain because \u201c[t]he jurisdictional concept involved ... is not lack of jurisdiction of the cause but excess of jurisdiction. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Griffin </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 343, 347 [62 Cal.Rptr. 1, 431 P.2d 625]; see also, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Prudencio) </em>(1927) 202 Cal. 165, 174 [259 P. 943], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Howard) </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 491, 501 [72 Cal.Rptr. 330, 446 P.2d 138].) Accordingly, even when, for example, a case proceeds under a \u201cfatally defective\u201d indictment, \u201cif the court had jurisdiction of the cause and the party, its judgment is not void, but only voidable\u201d; and the defendant may invoke double jeopardy. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Ball </em>(1896) 163 U.S. 662, 669-670 [41 L.Ed. 300, 302-303, 16 S.Ct. 1192]; <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 784, 797 [23 L.Ed.2d 707, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2056]; see <em>In re Hess </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 171, 175-176 [288 P.2d 5]; <em>In re Dellasala </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 453, 456-457 [136 Cal.Rptr. 99].) In defendant\u2019s view, the trial court retained subject matter jurisdiction even if it lacked discretion to act other than in compliance with section 1368.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In arguing an absence of fundamental jurisdiction, the People rely substantially on our statement in <em>Marks I </em>that \u201conce a trial court has ordered a competency hearing pursuant to section 1368, the court lacks jurisdiction to conduct further proceedings on the criminal charge or charges against the defendant until the court has determined whether he is competent.\u201d <em>(Marks I, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 1337, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Hale, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 531.)  We also reiterated our earlier conclusion in Hale: \u201c \u2018The sub silentio disposition of the section 1368 proceedings without a full competency hearing rendered the subsequent trial proceedings void because the court had been divested of jurisdiction to proceed pending <em>express </em>determination of the competency issue.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Marks I, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 1344.)  The People also note that since <em>People </em>v. <em>Pennington </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 508 [58 Cal.Rptr. 374, 426 P.2d 942] <em>(Pennington), </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>this court and the Courts of Appeal have consistently spoken in jurisdictional terms when referring to this species of error. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 521 [trial court \u201cpronounced judgment . . . without jurisdiction to do so.\u201d]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hale, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 541 [trial court \u201chas no jurisdiction to proceed\u201d]; <em>In re Davis </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 798, 808 [106 Cal.Rptr. 178, 505 P.2d 1018] [\u201cthe matter is jurisdictional\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Day </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 112, 119 [247 Cal.Rptr. 68] [\u201cthe court has no power to proceed\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Conrad </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 361, 367 [182 Cal.Rptr. 912] [trial court \u201clacks jurisdiction to try, judge, or sentence a defendant\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tomas </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 75, 87-88 [141 Cal.Rptr. 453] [\u201cSince the matter is jurisdictional [citation], the court lacks the power to try, judge, or sentence . . . .\u201d]; cf. \u00a7 1367 [defendant \u201ccannot be tried or adjudged to punishment while . . . mentally incompetent\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Despite their imperative tenor, however, none of the cited authorities squarely addressed a question of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to proceed notwithstanding an erroneous failure to hold a competency hearing. The principal consideration was invariably limited to the effect of section 1368 error on the underlying judgment of conviction; subsequent to <em>Pennington, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 508, the cases simply adopted its \u201cwithout jurisdiction\u201d language as a shorthand for reversible error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While the opinions occasionally embellished the terminology, they never confronted the factual predicate to, and hence never engaged in, any substantial discussion or analysis of it.  \u201cLanguage used in any opinion is of course to be understood in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>light of the facts and the issue then before the court, and an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ginns </em>v. <em>Savage </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 520, 524, fn. 2 [39 Cal.Rptr. 377, 393 P.2d 689]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Kelly Broadcasting Co. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 734-735 [257 Cal.Rptr. 708, 771 P.2d 406].)  The issue before us then is one of first impression. Consequently, we must view with caution seemingly categorical directives not essential to earlier decisions and be guided by this dictum only to the extent it remains analytically persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">As explained below, we conclude that the failure to comply with the mandate of section 1368 does not effect a fundamental loss of jurisdiction, i.e., \u201can entire absence of power to hear or determine the case, an absence of authority over the subject matter or the parties. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 288 [109 P.2d 942, 132 A.L.R. 715].) Rather, the trial court suffers an inability \u201cto act except in a particular manner, or to give certain kinds of relief, or to act without the occurrence of certain procedural prerequisites.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see, e.g., <em>Rodman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1939) 13 Cal.2d 262, 269 [89 P.2d 109].) Thus, while the court retains jurisdiction over the cause,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it acts in excess of that authority in failing to hold a competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Our analysis begins with the statutory language, from which we educe no legislative directive or intent to oust the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction pending an evaluation of the defendant\u2019s competence. In pertinent part, section 1368, subdivision (c), provides that when the court has expressed a doubt as to the defendant\u2019s capacity to stand trial and has ordered a hearing thereon, \u201call proceedings in the criminal prosecution shall be suspended until the question of the present mental competence of the defendant has been determined.\u201d Among other definitions, \u201cto suspend\u201d means \u201cto cause (as an action, process, practice, use) to cease for a time ...[;] stay [as a hearing] . . . .\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internal. Dict. (3d ed. 1981) p. 2303.) The code provision itself is thus not cast in jurisdictional terms. Nor does the statutory scheme invite or accommodate judicial imposition of such a limitation. For example, in contrast to subdivision (c), subdivision (b) of section 1368 explicitly vests exclusive authority in the superior court to conduct the competency hearing; a municipal court may not do so even when the defendant is charged with a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(In re Shaw </em>(1953) 115 Cal.App.2d 753, 756 [252 P.2d 970]; see <em>Bean </em>v. <em>County of Los </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>Angeles </em>(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 754, 760 [60 Cal.Rptr. 804], disapproved on other grounds in <em>In re Underwood </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 345, 348 [107 Cal.Rptr. 401, 508 P.2d 721]; cf. \u00a7\u00a7 691, subd. (b) [definition of \u201ccompetent court\u201d], 777 [delineation of state and federal court jurisdiction]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanchez </em>(1942) 21 Cal.2d 466, 471-472 [132 P.2d 810] [differentiation between juvenile and superior court jurisdiction].)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Subsequent legislation buttresses this conclusion. Added in 1974, section 1368.1 now permits the trial court to consider several types of preliminary legal matters, including demurrers, suppression motions, and motions to dismiss for lack of reasonable cause, \u201ccapable of fair determination without the personal participation of the defendant\u201d and notwithstanding the pendency of a competency hearing. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Hulbert) </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 407, 413 [141 Cal.Rptr. 497]; see also <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Indiana </em>(1972) 406 U.S. 715, 740-741 [32 L.Ed.2d 435, 452, 92 S.Ct. 1845].) These procedural changes necessarily assume the court retains subject matter jurisdiction despite restrictions on the scope of its authority. (See also <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 221, 227-228 [124 Cal.Rptr. 57, 539 P.2d 817]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Stankewitz </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 72, 87-89 [270 Cal.Rptr. 817, 793 P.2d 23] [court may first hold <em>Marsden </em>hearing <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44]) to ensure effective assistance of counsel at competency hearing].)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Nor is there any constitutional imperative for imposing a jurisdictional limitation in this circumstance. In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Indiana, supra, </em>406 U.S. 715, the United States Supreme Court noted that, as California now does to a certain extent, \u201c[s]ome States have statutory provisions permitting pretrial motions to be made or even allowing the incompetent defendant a trial at which to establish his innocence, without permitting a conviction.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 741 [32 L.Ed.2d at p. 452], fn. omitted; see also <em>id., </em>at p. 741, fn. 30 [32 L.Ed.2d at p. 452].) In this regard, the high court expressly declined \u201cto preclude the States from allowing, at a minimum, an incompetent defendant to raise certain defenses such as insufficiency of the indictment, or make certain pretrial motions through counsel.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 741 [32 L.Ed.2d at p. 452].) Moreover, while in <em>Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 375, 387 [15 L.Ed.2d 815, 823, 86 S.Ct. 836], the court emphasized \u201cthe difficulty of retrospectively determining an accused\u2019s competence to stand trial . . . ,\u201d in <em>Drope </em>v. <em>Missouri </em>(1975) 420 U.S. 162, 182-183 [43 L.Ed.2d 103, 119, 95 S.Ct. 896], it accepted the possibility of a constitutionally adequate posttrial or even postappeal evaluation of the defendant\u2019s pretrial competence. (See also <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1956) 350 U.S. 961 [100 L.Ed.2d 835, 76 S.Ct. 440] <em>(per curiam) </em>[judgment vacated and case remanded \u201cfor a hearing on the sanity of [the defendant] at the time of his trial\u201d].) In no case did the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Supreme Court suggest that substantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s incompetence impaired or even implicated the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Having identified no statutory or constitutional imperative, we turn to the seemingly entrenched judicial gloss on which the People premise their jurisdictional argument. The precise passage spawning all subsequent references appears in <em>Pennington, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d at page 521: \u201cIn trying defendant without first determining at a hearing his competence to stand trial, the court both denied to defendant a substantial right [citations] and pronounced judgment on him without jurisdiction to do so.\u201d A review of prior decisions reveals no similar \u201cjurisdictional\u201d characterization of the trial court\u2019s failing, save for a single oblique reference in <em>People </em>v. <em>Vester </em>(1933) 135 Cal.App. 223, 228 [26 P.2d 685] [\u201can omission by the trial court to exercise what may be termed a jurisdictional duty resulted\u201d]. Rather, earlier opinions denominated the error a \u201cdenial of substantial rights\u201d (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Westbrook </em>(1964) 62 Cal.2d 197, 204 [41 Cal.Rptr. 809, 397 P.2d 545]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1951) 105 Cal.App.2d 811, 816 [234 P.2d 261]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Vester, supra, </em>135 Cal.App. at p. 237; <em>People </em>v. <em>Grace </em>(1926) 77 Cal.App. 752, 762 [247 P. 585]) and a \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d (See <em>In re Dennis </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 666, 671 [335 P.2d 657]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Merkouris </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 540, 553 [297 P.2d 999]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Aparicio </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 565, 568 [241 P.2d 221]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Renteria </em>(1960) 183 Cal.App.2d 548, 551 [6 Cal.Rptr. 640].) Some cases also drew upon the statutory language in describing the trial as \u201cinterrupted\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rothrock </em>(1936) 8 Cal.2d 21, 24 [63 P.2d 807]) or \u201carrested\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>West </em>(1914) 25 Cal.App. 369, 371 [143 P. 793]) pending outcome of the section 1368 hearing. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Ah Ying </em>(1871) 42 Cal. 18, 21; <em>People </em>v. <em>Grace, supra, </em>77 Cal.App. at p. 763.) Thus, prior to <em>Pennington, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 508, a substantial body of extant authority contained virtually no suggestion that section 1368 error raised a jurisdictional bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Closer analysis of <em>Pennington </em>discloses no support for a departure from this settled law. In that case, we reexamined our statutory scheme in light of the then recent decision of <em>Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra, </em>383 U.S. 375, in which the federal high court held that when a defendant presents sufficient evidence, he is \u201cconstitutionally entitled to a hearing on the issue of his competence to stand trial.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 377 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 818].) Failure to make meaningful inquiry at such a hearing deprives him of a fair trial. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 385 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 822].)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Thus informed of its constitutional mandate, this court held, \u201cThe decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>demonstrates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the type of \u2018hearing\u2019 which due process requires when the accused has come forward with substantial evidence of present insanity has not been accorded the accused when the judge merely takes evidence to guide him in determining if he should declare the existence of a \u2018doubt\u2019 [as to this question].\u201d <em>(Pennington, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d at pp. 520-521.) Rather, the court must observe the express terms of section 1368, suspend further criminal proceedings, and take evidence \u2018to the end of determining an issue of fact and [making] a decision on the basis of that evidence. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 521.)

We agree that the legal effect of the statute coincides in significant respects with an implied acquittal: It is a final verdict of the lesser degree crime after a determination on the merits. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co. </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 564, 571 [51 L.Ed.2d 642, 651, 97 S.Ct. 1349]; cf. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 516 [\u201cdischarge of the jury without a verdict is tantamount to an acquittal\u201d once jeopardy attaches].)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">For purposes of delimiting the scope of retrial after a successful appeal, however, such a finding is generally contingent upon an implied or express determination that the evidence failed to sustain the prosecution\u2019s case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> By contrast, section 1157 renders a conviction of the lesser degree by operation of law and does not establish or necessarily imply an insufficiency of the evidence to convict of the greater degree.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, on occasion \u201cform triumphs over substance, and the law is traduced\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johns </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 281, 295 [193 Cal.Rptr. 182]) when the record contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u201cclear and reliable evidence that the jury must have actually found the defendant guilty of the higher degree offense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bonillas, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at pp. 802-803 (conc. opn. of Arguelles, J.); see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>McDonald, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at pp. 379-383; <em>People </em>v. <em>Beamon </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 625, 629, fn. 2 [105 Cal.Rptr. 681 [504 P.2d 905].)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In any event, we need not decide the former acquittal issue. The overriding fact remains that in fixing a defendant\u2019s conviction at the lesser degree, section 1157 conclusively resolves the question of his guilt for the greater degree crime in his favor after trial for that offense. In this circumstance, controlling United States Supreme Court precedents compel we accommodate a plea of \u201conce in jeopardy.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1016.)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In the seminal case of <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>355 U.S. 184, the defendant was charged with both first and second degree murder; the jury found him guilty of second degree murder but failed to return a verdict on first degree. Green secured a reversal of his conviction. The prosecution again charged him with first degree murder, and the trial court rejected his plea of double jeopardy. On retrial, the jury convicted of the greater offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The Supreme Court reversed, relying on both a finding of an implied acquittal and the broader principle of once in jeopardy. <em>(Price </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>398 U.S. at p. 329 [26 L.Ed.2d at p. 305].) With respect to the latter, the high court observed that \u201cthe jury was dismissed without returning any express verdict on [first degree murder] and without Green\u2019s consent. Yet it was given a full opportunity to return a verdict and no extraordinary circumstances appeared which prevented it from doing so. Therefore it seems clear, under established principles of former jeopardy, that Green\u2019s jeopardy for first degree murder came to an end when the jury was discharged so that he could not be retried for that offense. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Green </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>355 U.S. at p. 191 [2 L.Ed.2d at p. 206]; accord, <em>Price </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>398 U.S. at p. 329 [26 L.Ed.2d at p. 305].)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">We discern no constitutionally sustainable logic or rationale by which to distinguish the present case. To suggest defendant was not \u201cin direct peril of being convicted and punished for first degree murder at his first trial\u201d or that he was not \u201cforced to run the gantlet once on that charge\u201d <em>(Green </em>v. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>States, supra, </em>355 U.S. at p. 190 [2 L.Ed.2d at p. 206]) would indefensibly trivialize \u201cthe heavy personal strain\u201d imposed by a criminal trial, particularly one for a capital offense. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Jorn </em>(1971) 400 U.S. 470, 479 [27 L.Ed.2d 543, 553, 91 S.Ct. 547] (plur. opn.).) Correspondingly, \u201c[t]o be charged and to be subjected to a second trial for first-degree murder is an ordeal not to be viewed lightly.\u201d <em>(Price </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>398 U.S. at p. 331 [26 L.Ed.2d at p. 306], fn. omitted.) The prosecution had a full and fair opportunity to convince the trier of fact of defendant\u2019s guilt for first degree murder. Although the jury did return a verdict, it nevertheless did not convict him of that charge; and by operation of law its verdict became fixed at second degree murder. In this circumstance, the application of double jeopardy is manifest: \u201cthe first verdict, limited as it was to the lesser included offense, required that the retrial be limited to that lesser offense.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 327 [26 L.Ed.2d at p. 304]; accord, <em>Bunnell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 592, 608 [119 Cal.Rptr. 302, 531 P.2d 1086].) We must perforce conclude defendant\u2019s jeopardy for first degree murder terminated when the jury was discharged from the guilt phase and a second degree verdict was rendered pursuant to section 1157. (See also <em>In re Hess, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d at p. 176; cf. <em>Kellett </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 63 Cal.2d 822, 827-828 [48 Cal.Rptr. 366, 409 P.2d 206] [\u00a7 654 precludes prosecution for more serious offense after defendant has been acquitted or convicted of lesser charge].)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The fact the trial court committed reversible error at the outset of the proceedings and defendant successfully appealed his conviction on that ground assumes no analytical significance in this context. When a defendant has once endured the rigors of trial and the jury fails to convict despite a full opportunity to do so, he may not be required to face that ordeal again regardless of any collateral defects in the original proceeding. <em>(Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, supra, </em>395 U.S. at pp. 796-797 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 717]; see, <em>ante, </em>fn. 14; cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, supra, </em>400 U.S. at p. 483 [27 L.Ed.2d at p. 555] (plur. opn.) [reprosecution after unnecessary mistrial subjects defendant to \u201csame personal strain and insecurity\u201d even if trial court is well intentioned].) Moreover, as the court in <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>explained in rejecting the government\u2019s waiver argument, \u201cGreen was not convicted of first degree murder and that offense was not involved in his appeal.\u201d (355 U.S. at p. 193 [2 L.Ed.2d at p. 207].)

Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">As its ancient lineage attests, the double jeopardy clause is no mere \u201ctechnicality\u201d; it is an integral part of \u201cthe framework of procedural protections which the Constitution establishes for the conduct of a criminal trial.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number><em>(United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, supra, </em>400 U.S. at p. 479 [27 L.Ed.2d at p. 553] (plur. opn.).)

[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Serfass </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>420 U.S. at p. 390 [43 L.Ed.2d at p. 275].) In animating our own independent \u201cvital safeguard,\u201d we have expressly refused to perpetuate \u201cspurious distinction[s]\u201d at the risk of \u201cgiving our constitutional prohibition against twice in jeopardy a \u2018narrow, grudging application\u2019 unsupported by either logic or reason.\u201d <em>(Gomez </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>50 Cal.2d at p. 649; accord, <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>355 U.S. at p. 198 [2 L.Ed.2d at p. 210].)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Consistent with this tradition, we continue to eschew a parsing attitude unworthy of this \u201cfundamental ideal in our constitutional heritage . . . .\u201d <em>(Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, supra, </em>395 U.S. at p. 794 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 716].) In amending section 1157, our citizenry has demonstrated its willingness on occasion to forgo exaction of the law\u2019s full measure of punishment in exchange for finality of judgments and fair play. We must be no less generous in applying clearly implicated constitutional principles; indeed, our function is to enforce those principles, \u201c \u2018whatever be the words in which the [legislative] provision is expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Webb, supra, </em>38 Cal. at p. 479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The double jeopardy clause suffers no compromise; therein lies its strength and vitality.  The extent of our inquiry ends with its proper application: \u201cWhether guilty or innocent of the offense with which he [is charged, the defendant is] entitled to have his case fairly tried according to the established rules of law. As was said by a learned judge, \u2018Though unfair means may happen to result in doing justice to the prisoner in the particular case, yet justice so attained is unjust and dangerous to the whole community.\u2019 (H<em>urd </em>v. <em>State, </em>25 Mich. 405.) The doctrine that respect for the law cannot be inspired by withholding the protection of the law from those accused of crime is one which recognizes no exceptions. To be watchful for the constitutional and individual rights of the citizen against any encroachment thereon is one of the primary duties and obligations of the courts, and it is by unrelenting watchfulness and zeal in this regard that the conviction of the innocent will be averted.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mendoza </em>(1942) 55 Cal.App.2d 625, 633 [131 P.2d 622]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Harris) </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1332 [266 Cal.Rptr. 563] [defendant may not be retried for death penalty after sentence of life without possibility of parole reversed].)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">V.
