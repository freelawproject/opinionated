We hold that, under the narrow circumstances presented, such a voting scheme is reasonably related to the objectives of the statute and thus survives constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b689-13\">The Southern California Rapid Transit District (hereafter SCRTD or transit district) is the lead agency for the construction, financing, and operation of \u201ca comprehensive mass rapid transit system in the southern California area, and particularly in Los Angeles County.\u201d (Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 30001, subd. (a).) The initial segment of the transit system, an 18.6-mile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>subway line connecting the central business district of downtown Los Angeles with North Hollywood and known as \u201cMetro Rail,\u201d was approved by SCRTD in 1983. The first operating element of Metro Rail, a 4.4-mile rapid transit line extending from Union Station to Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street, will cost an estimated $1.25 billion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Financing for the project comes from a combination of sources\u2014federal, state, and local\u2014and, as a condition of federal funds, from the private sector. To help defray part of the enormous cost of the project, the Legislature has authorized SCRTD to establish \u201cspecial benefit assessment districts\u201d surrounding planned Metro Rail subway stations along the rapid transit corridor. (Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 33000-33020.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Although the transit district is statutorily authorized to establish assessment districts without voter approval, a referendum must be held if requested by the \u201cowners of at least 25 percent of the assessed value of real property\u201d within a proposed assessment district. (Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 33002.1, 33002.2.) The statute limits voting at such a referendum, however, to those owners of real property who will be subject to assessment in the event an assessment district is approved. (Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 33002.3.) Because in the present case residential property has been exempted from assessment, participation in any referendum is denied to non-property-owning residents and residential property owners alike within the proposed districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In addition to the foregoing franchise restrictions, the statute directs that votes in any referendum be alloted on the basis of the assessed value of the real property for ad valorem tax purposes. Qualified owners are alloted one vote for each $1,000 of assessed value of their real property. (Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 33002.3, subd. (b).) Although votes are alloted according to assessed value, the statute requires that any assessments actually levied by the transit district be calculated on the basis of the parcel or floor area, depending on the condition of the real property. (Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 33002, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">We have described special or local assessments of the sort authorized by the Legislature here as a \u201ccompulsory charge placed by the state upon real property within a pre-determined district, made under express legislative authority for defraying in whole or in part the expense of a permanent public improvement therein . . . .\u201d <em>(San Marcos Water Dist. </em>v. <em>San Marcos Unified </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number><em>School Dist. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 154, 161 [228 Cal.Rptr. 47, 720 P.2d 935] (quoting <em>Spring Street Co. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1915) 170 Cal. 24, 29 [148 P. 217], internal quotation marks omitted); their use as a means of financing the cost of municipal improvements has a lengthy pedigree in the law of public finance. (See, generally, 14 McQuillin, The Law of Municipal Corporations (3d ed. 1987 rev.) \u00a7\u00a7 38.01-38.338.) Analogous to but differing in important respects from the power of taxation, the essential feature of the special assessment is that the public improvement financed through it confers a special benefit on the property assessed beyond that conferred generally. (See, e.g., <em>Norwood </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1898) 172 U.S. 269 [43 L.Ed. 443, 19 S.Ct. 187]; <em>Spring Street Co. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>170 Cal. 24, 30-31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">The uses of the special assessment as a financing device for public improvements are as manifold as the forms of such improvements themselves. It has been employed to finance such variegated public improvements as the construction of drains and sewers <em>(Dawson </em>v. <em>Town of Los Altos Hills </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 676 [129 Cal.Rptr. 97, 547 P.2d 1377] <em>(Dawson)), </em>residential subdivisions <em>(Burrey </em>v. <em>Embarcadero Mun. Improvement Dist. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 671 [97 Cal.Rptr. 203, 488 P.2d 395] <em>(Burrey)), </em>gas distribution works <em>(County of Riverside </em>v. <em>Whitlock </em>(1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 863 [99 Cal.Rptr. 710] <em>(Whitlock)), </em>flood control projects <em>(City of Larkspur </em>v. <em>Marin County Flood Control etc. Dist. </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 947 [214 Cal.Rptr. 689]), the redevelopment of blighted areas <em>(In re Redevelopment Plan for Bunker Hill </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 21 [37 Cal.Rptr. 74, 389 P.2d 538]), and the construction of a transit tunnel <em>(Larsen </em>v. <em>San Francisco </em>(1920) 182 Cal. 1 [186 P.2d 757]).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In recent years, the special assessment has found a new field of application in the context of the construction of massive urban rapid transit systems, the extraordinary capital costs of which have heightened pressure for the exploration of novel forms of financing. Grounded in the fact that the installation of a transit station and related facilities at a point along a rapid transit corridor enhances the value of real property in the immediate vicinity by generating intensified commercial activity, the special assessment has been promoted as a means by which transit authorities can recoup some of the value added to the surrounding real property and the resulting \u201cwindfall\u201d enrichment of property owners. (See Note, <em>Rapid Transit Financing: Use of the Special Assessment </em>(1977) 29 Stan.L.Rev. 795.)</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">As applied to rapid transit financing, the mechanics of the assessment process do not differ materially from its use in conjunction with other public improvements. Briefly, the authorized public entity adopts a resolution of its intention to impose an assessment, determines the boundaries of the planned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>assessment district, and computes the proposed levy. It is then generally required to submit the issue to voter approval through some form of referendum or protest procedure. On approval, bonds are issued to finance construction of the public improvement, the principal and interest being paid and the bonds retired from income obtained through annual assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">In 1984, as part of its implementation of the assessment district revenue device, the SCRTD board appointed a benefit assessment policy task force, composed of representatives of a cross-section of property owners along the planned Metro Rail transit corridor, and charged it with the task of conducting a study and making recommendations for structuring the benefit assessment districts. Following a series of public hearings, the task force submitted its recommendations to the SCRTD board in 1985. In substance, it found that the property within the proposed assessment districts would benefit from the installation of Metro Rail transit stations through enhanced land values, higher lease rates and occupancy levels, increased retail sales, easier visitor access, reduced parking costs, and the intensification of land development. Following public notice and additional hearings, the SCRTD board adopted the resolutions necessary to proceed with the establishment of the benefit districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">After submission of the resolutions to the Los Angeles City Council as required by statute and modification by that body to exempt residential property owners within the proposed districts from assessment, the transit district took final action on the matter in July of 1985 by establishing two benefit districts, one covering real property within the one-half mile radii of the four Metro Rail transit stations planned for the downtown central business district, and a second covering the real property within a one-third mile radius of the Wilshire-Alvarado transit station.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The SCRTD board\u2019s final resolutions established an initial assessment rate of $.30 per square foot of assessable property, with a maximum rate of $.42 per square foot\u2014a rate calculated to raise a total of $130.3 million in capital funding over a multiyear assessment period, or roughly 11 percent of the total cost of the 4.4-mile segment. The board also acceded to the exemption of residential property within the two benefit districts, required as a condition for Los Angeles City Council approval, and directed that the assessments otherwise be levied uniformly throughout the two districts and that they expire in the year 2008 or earlier. Although assessment notices for the 1986-1987 year were mailed to commercial property owners within the two districts, at the request of affected property owners the board subsequently deferred collection of any assessments until 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Soon after the foregoing administrative action was taken, this suit was filed. Brought by SCRTD against its secretary, Helen M. Bolen, the complaint sought a writ of mandate directing her to certify additional resolutions of the SCRTD board authorizing the sale of $200 million in municipal bonds secured by revenues from the benefit assessments, the object of the suit being to judicially validate the actions of the board in establishing the two benefit districts before the bonds were issued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>Whitlock, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.3d 863, 868 &amp; fn. 6; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 860 et seq.; Sts. &amp; Hy. Code, \u00a7 10601 et seq.) Several commercial property owners within the two proposed assessment districts and one tenant under a commercial lease were granted leave by the superior court to intervene in the action on the side of defendant Bolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">After reviewing the administrative record supporting the task force\u2019s recommendations and taking additional evidence, the superior court upheld the property-based voting scheme at issue against claims that it violated the equal protection guarantees of the state and federal Constitutions. The trial court likewise validated the assessment districts in all other respects against the nonconstitutional objections of interveners and Bolen, entered judgment for the transit district on its claims, issued its writ directing defendant Bolen to certify the board resolutions authorizing issuance of the revenue bonds, and denied interveners any relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The Court of Appeal reversed. In its view, the property-based voting scheme was constitutionally flawed in two respects. First, it violated equal protection by invidiously discriminating against nonproperty owners. According to the Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning, public transportation affects all citizens, not merely property owners, and the financing, operation, and maintenance of Metro Rail will impact all segments of the population of greater Los Angeles. Since the benefits and the burdens of the assessments fall indiscriminately on property owners and nonproperty owners alike, the principle of \u201cone person, one vote\u201d is triggered, requiring a compelling state interest to justify the exclusion of nonproperty owners from the franchise. Finding none, the Court of Appeal pronounced that part of the statutory voting scheme void.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In addition, the Court of Appeal concluded that the differing methods adopted by the Legislature in alloting votes and imposing assessments under the statute\u2014the former linked to the ad valorem tax value of the property, the latter tied to parcel size\u2014were fundamentally unfair because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>absence of proportionality between the allotment of votes and the burden of paying assessments. In the Court of Appeal\u2019s view, even if the principle of one person, one vote were inapplicable, in order to pass equal protection scrutiny the voting scheme was required to allot the most votes to those paying the largest assessments. After finding that these constitutionally defective referendum provisions could not be severed from the remainder of the statutory scheme, and ruling that the transit district lacked the power to exempt residential property owners from the assessment, the Court of Appeal invalidated the entire benefit assessment legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">It is important to underline at the outset what is not before us in this case. The question at issue is not whether Metro Rail should be built and, if so, how its costs should be distributed. Neither are we asked to consider directly the desirability or usefulness of special assessment districts as a financing device to recapture some of the economic value added to a commercial area as a result of locating a rapid transit station within it. Questions concerning metropolitan transportation policy in greater Los Angeles, and the economic, environmental and aesthetic aspects of Metro Rail and of benefit assessment districts, important as they undoubtedly are as public issues, are not presented by this case, having been debated, sometimes litigated (see, e.g., <em>Rapid Transit Advocates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 996 [230 Cal.Rptr. 225]), and resolved in other forums over the past decade.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">What is at issue is the substantially narrower question whether the principle of \u201cone person, one vote,\u201d laid down by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(1964) 377 U.S. 533 [12 L.Ed.2d 506, 84 S.Ct. 1362] <em>(Reynolds), </em>applies to the property-based assessment district voting scheme described above, or whether the circumstances qualify as those in which the Constitution does not stand as a \u201croadblock[] in the path of innovation, experiment, and development among units of local government.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Midland County </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 474, 485 [20 L.Ed.2d 45, 53-54, 88 S.Ct. 1114] <em>(Avery).) </em>As with much of the jurisprudence of equal protection, the answer to that question is significantly affected by the threshold selection of the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>If the principle of one person, one vote applies to voting in the assessment district referenda, the state is placed under a substantial burden of demonstrating a compelling justification for an exclusion from the voting franchise resting on the ownership of real property. If, however, this case qualifies as an exception to the principle of <em>Reynolds, </em>the constitutional test is the less demanding one of whether the voting scheme is either \u201cwholly irrelevant\u201d or \u201creasonably related\u201d to the statutory objectives. As we shall explain, the crucial task in the case of property-based voting schemes is to identify the constitutionally relevant factual basis for selecting one level of scrutiny over the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The solution to the equal protection problem posed by the statutory classification in this case lies in a trio of <em>post-Reynolds </em>decisions of the high court which recognize an exception to the principle of one person, one vote.  In substance, these cases hold that the right protected by Reynolds\u2014 equality at the ballot box\u2014is not fundamental under limited circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the court formulated the exception in <em>Avery, supra, </em>390 U.S. 474,483-484 [20 L.Ed.2d 45, 53], these circumstances consist of \u201ca special-purpose unit of government assigned the performance of functions affecting definable groups of constituents more than other[s] . . . .\u201d Where these two conditions jointly occur, the strict demands of <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>377 U.S. 533, do not apply and voting power \u201cmay be apportioned in ways which give greater influence to the citizens most affected by the organization\u2019s functions\u201d <em>(Avery, supra, </em>at p. 484 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 53]) without violating the guarantee of equal protection provided that the resulting classification is reasonably related to the statutory objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The first condition focuses on the extent to which the public entity involved is vested with governmental powers. In <em>Avery, supra, </em>390 U.S. 474, the court held that <em>Reynolds </em>applied to the election of a countywide \u201ccommissioners court,\u201d a local body exercising \u201cgeneral governmental powers over the entire geographic area served by [that] body.\u201d (390 U.S. at p. 485 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>[20 L.Ed.2d at p. 53].) In so ruling, the court said that if the governmental entity involved makes \u201ca large number of decisions having a broad range of impacts on all the citizens\u201d within its jurisdiction, the principle of one person, one vote applies presumptively. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 483-485 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 52-54].) In <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Junior College District </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 50, 54 [25 L.Ed.2d 45, 49, 90 S.Ct. 791], the high court elaborated on this requirement, applying the presumption whenever \u201cimportant governmental functions,\u201d including, as in <em>Hadley, </em>those as \u201cvital\u201d as education are involved. Thus, \u201cas a general rule, whenever a state or local government decides to select persons by popular election to perform governmental functions, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that each qualified voter must be given an equal opportunity to participate in that election . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 56 [25 L.Ed.2d at pp. 50-51].)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The second branch of the equal protection analysis looks to the impact of the election outcome on voters and nonvoters. It focuses on the extent to which a contested statutory voting classification is supported by \u201cgenuine difference [s] in the relevant interests\u201d of those enfranchised and those excluded by a given voting scheme. (See <em>Lockport </em>v. <em>Citizens for Community Action </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 259, 268 [51 L.Ed.2d 313, 322-323, 97 S.Ct. 1047] <em>(Lockport) </em>[upholding concurrent majority voting requirements for city and non city residents in county wide referendum].) If the class enfranchised by the scheme at issue is \u201cprimarily affected\u201d or \u201cprimarily interested\u201d in the election and \u201cthose excluded are in fact substantially less interested or affected than those the statute includes\u201d <em>(Kramer, supra, </em>395 U.S. at p. 632 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 592]), the voting scheme does not deny equal protection so long as the statutory classification is not \u201cwholly irrelevant\u201d to the achievement of the statute\u2019s objectives. <em>(Kotch </em>v. <em>Pilot Comm\u2019rs </em>(1947) 330 U.S. 552, 556 [91 L.Ed. 1093, 1096-1097, 67 S.Ct. 910]; <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1961) 366 U.S. 420, 425-426 [6 L.Ed.2d 393, 398-399, 81 S.Ct. 1101].)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In <em>Salyer Land Co. </em>v. <em>Tulare Water District </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 719 [35 L.Ed.2d 659, 93 S.Ct. 1224] <em>(Salyer), </em>the conditions required to support an exception to the principle of <em>Reynolds </em>materialized in the form of a contested election of the board of directors of a California water storage district. In ruling that a property-based voting scheme was <em>not </em>subject to the principle of one person, one vote, the court invoked both the \u201cspecial-purpose unit of government\u201d and the \u201cprimarily affected or interested\u201d criteria to anchor its result.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Comprising 193,000 acres of intensively cultivated farmland, the water storage district was populated by only 60 adults, most of whom were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>employed by one of the 4 corporations that farmed 85 percent of the land within it. The statutory voting scheme at issue in <em>Salyer </em>limited voting in the general election for the district board of directors to owners of land within the water storage district, apportioning votes according to the assessed value of district land. <em>(Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, 724-725 [35 L.Ed.2d at pp. 664-665].) In upholding the statutory limitation on voting against claims by resident nonproperty owners that it violated equal protection by failing to comply with the principle of one person, one vote, the court first pointed out that although the district exercised some typical governmental powers, these were incidental to its limited authority and primary purpose of \u201cprovid[ing] for the acquisition, storage, and distribution of water for farming in the Tulare Lake Basin.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 728 [35 L.Ed.2d at p. 666].) Moreover, the district\u2019s activities affected landowners disproportionately since \u201c[a]ll of the costs of district projects are assessed against land ... in proportion to the benefits received [and] . . . charges for services rendered are collectible from persons receiving their benefit in proportion to the services.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 729 [35 L.Ed.2d at p. 667].)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Because there was \u201cno way that the economic burdens of district operations [could] fall on residents <em>qua </em>residents, and the operation of the district^ primarily affect[s] land within [its] boundaries,\u201d the court concluded that \u201cthe popular election requirements enunciated in <em>Reynolds . . . </em>and succeeding cases are inapplicable to elections such as the general election of [the] Water District.\u201d <em>(Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. at pp. 729-730 [35 L.Ed.2d at p. 667].) The equal protection question, the court said, was simply \u201cwhether the State\u2019s decision to deny the franchise to residents of the district while granting it to landowners was \u2018wholly irrelevant to achievement of the [statute\u2019s] objectives,\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 730 [35 L.Ed.2d at pp. 667-668].)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\"><em>Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, is analytically linked to the court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Ball </em>v. <em>James </em>(1981) 451 U.S. 355 [68 L.Ed.2d 150, 101 S.Ct. 1811] <em>(Ball). </em>On facts strikingly different from those of <em>Salyer, </em>the court reached an identical result, ruling that the principle of <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>377 U.S. 533, did not apply to an election for the directors of the Salt River District, a water reclamation district encompassing 236,000 acres in central Arizona whose governing board was elected by those owning land within the district, voting power being apportioned according to the number of acres owned. <em>(Ball, supra, </em>451 U.S. at pp. 370-372 [68 L.Ed.2d at pp. 162-164].)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Like the water storage district in <em>Salyer, </em>the primary purpose of the Salt River District was the conservation and distribution of water owned by its landowning membership. But unlike the district in <em>Salyer, </em>the Salt River <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>District had constructed dams and other public works to generate hydroelectric power. By 1980, the district was one of the largest public utilities in the state. It provided power to almost half of the population of Arizona, including much of metropolitan Phoenix, met most of its capital and operating costs through electric power revenues, and had over $3 billion in long-term debt; 40 percent of the water stored by the district was delivered to urban areas for nonagriculatural uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Despite recognition that these activities were \u201cmore diverse and affected far more people\u201d than those in <em>Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, the court held that \u201cthese distinctions do not amount to a constitutional difference.\u201d <em>(Ball, supra, </em>451 U.S. at pp. 365-366 [68 L.Ed.2d at pp. 159-160].) This was so, the majority reasoned, because despite its manifold activities, the Salt River District did \u201cnot exercise the sort of governmental powers that invoke the strict demands of Reynolds.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 366 [68 L.Ed.2d at p. 160].) Its powers did not run the gamut of those typical of a general government, and those that it did exercise were incidental to and in the service of its relatively narrow mission of storing, conserving, and distributing water to its landowner members. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 368-369 [68 L.Ed.2d at pp. 161-162].) \u201cThe constitutionally relevant fact is that all water delivered by the Salt River District ... is distributed according to land ownership, and the District does not and cannot control the use to which the landowners who are entitled to the water choose to put it.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 367-368 [68 L.Ed.2d at p. 161], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Coordinate with its limited purpose and functions, the reclamation district\u2019s activities fell disproportionately on the specific class which the statutory voting scheme enfranchised\u2014its landowner membership. Only they were subject to the acreage-based taxing power of the district, only they had committed capital to the district through assessments, and only their land was subject to liens to secure district bonds. <em>(Ball, supra, </em>451 U.S. at p. 370 [68 L.Ed.2d at pp. 162-163].) Since the district\u2019s operations had a disproportionate effect on those enfranchised, \u201cthe voting scheme . . . [was] constitutional because it bears a reasonable relationship to its statutory objectives.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 371 [68 L.Ed.2d at p. 163].)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">No one reviewing this area of the high court\u2019s equal protection jurisprudence can fail to be impressed with the result in Ball\u2014not because the opinion represents an analytical advance over the principles developed in <em>Salyer, </em>but because it illustrates the majority\u2019s steadfast willingness to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>adhere to the <em>Salyer </em>analysis in the face of a record presenting such compelling, if \u201cconstitutionally irrelevant,\u201d facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Clearly, in light of <em>Ball, </em>as far as the governmental function analysis is concerned, the constitutionally decisive fact is that the voting scheme at issue reflects the \u201cnarrow primary purpose for which the [public entity] is created.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Ball, supra, </em>451 U.S. at p. 369 [68 L.Ed.2d at p. 162].)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Viewing the record in this case through the lens of that insight, one conclusion seems evident. Manifestly, the benefit districts at issue here are not invested with and do not exercise powers remotely similar to the \u201cgeneral governmental powers\u201d to which the principle of <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>377 U.S. 533, presumptively applies. And unlike the substantial but narrowly directed complement of powers exercised by the water districts in <em>Salyer </em>and <em>Ball, </em>the benefit assessment districts lack virtually any of the incidents of government. In fact, they are little more than formalistic, geographically defined perimeters whose <em>raison d\u2019\u00e9tre </em>is to serve as the conceptual medium for the recognition of economic benefits conferred and the imposition of a corresponding fiscal burden. (Compare <em>Whitlock, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.3d 863, 874 [assessment district \u201csimply denotes the land area benefited by the proposed improvements and to be assessed for the costs thereof\u201d], and <em>Dawson, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 676, 683 [special assessment district \u201cis not a legal entity with officers and corporate rights and duties\u201d], with <em>Burrey, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d 671, 677 <em>[Reynolds </em>applied to municipal improvement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>district \u201cbecause it is the sole local governmental unit . . . carrying out the basic municipal functions which directly affect and benefit each of the district\u2019s residents\u201d], and <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 942, 959 &amp; fn. 20 [104 Cal.Rptr. 297, 501 P.2d 537] [statutory limitations on voting for municipal incorporation unconstitutional where city would exercise \u201cgeneral governmental powers\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The transit district itself, of course, <em>is </em>invested with and exercises substantial governmental powers; indeed, it has been described as having \u201cvirtual autonomy in self-governance\u201d and \u201ca regional governmental body with statewide concerns.\u201d <em>(Rapid Transit Advocates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist., supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d 996, 1000.) But SCRTD is not the governmental body implicated by the voting scheme at issue and the range of governmental powers exercised by it are irrelevant to our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The political entities constitutionally relevant to the challenged voting scheme are the limited-purpose benefit districts, the organizing principle of which is the recoupment of some of the added economic value conferred on commercial property resulting from its proximity to the transit stations. The narrow purpose for which the districts are established is reflected in a voting scheme that limits the franchise to those who will directly and primarily enjoy the benefits of transit station siting and shoulder the reciprocal burden of assessments\u2014owners of commercial property within the two proposed districts. In light of that congruence, we are satisfied that the governmental units at issue lack the indicia of \u201cgeneral governmental powers\u201d and, on this leg of the equal protection inquiry, qualify as the sort of \u201cspecial-purpose units of government\u201d that are not subject to the strict requirements of <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>377 U.S. 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">We turn now to the cognate question whether the challenged voting classification is supported by a \u201cgenuine difference in the relevant interests\u201d of those enfranchised and those excluded. <em>(Lockport, supra, </em>430 U.S. 259, 268 [51 L.Ed.2d 313, 322-323].) The analysis is advanced by a recognition of the \u201csingle-shot\u201d nature of referenda. \u201cIn a referendum, the expression of voter will is direct, and there is no need to assure that the voters\u2019 views will be adequately represented through their representatives .... The policy impact of a referendum is also different in kind from the impact of choosing representatives .... [T]he referendum puts one discrete issue to the voters. That issue is capable ... of being analyzed to determine whether its adoption or rejection will have a disproportionate impact on an identifiable group of voters.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 266 [51 L.Ed.2d at p. 321].) At the outset, then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>we must recognize that the issue-specific nature of referenda in general and of the assessment district elections in particular reduces somewhat the prominence equal protection values would assume if representational interests were at stake in the challenged election.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Resolution of this part of the equal protection inquiry also requires us to make careful distinctions in identifying constitutionally relevant facts. While certain broad criteria are clear, the analysis ineluctably implicates a measure of constitutional line drawing.  The touchstone of the high court\u2019s \u201cprimarily affected or interested\u201d doctrine is the extent of the impact of the election on those within and those outside the challenged voting classification. As noted, two complementary estimates must be made: whether the class of eligible voters enfranchised is disproportionately affected by the election issue, and whether those excluded are in fact substantially less interested in its outcome. Importantly, the court has stressed that, in weighing the statutory classification against the factual record, absolute distinctions between affected classes are not constitutionally compelled. The inquiry is the relative one of identifying differences sufficiently substantial to sustain the classification; the fact that some of those excluded from voting in the election may be \u201caffected\u201d by its outcome is not in itself fatal: \u201c[c]onstitutional adjudication cannot rest on any such \u2018house that Jack built\u2019 foundation . . . .\u201d <em>(Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, 731 [35 L.Ed.2d at p. 668].)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">From the undeniably correct premise that public transportation is an issue affecting all citizens, the Court of Appeal reasoned that, the development of an urban mass transit system being crucial to the orderly growth of a metropolitan area, its financing, construction and operation necessarily affected all segments of the population. Specifically noting the interests of commercial lessees within the assessment districts who are excluded from voting in referenda, but championing as well what it termed the \u201csame\u201d interests of \u201cother residents, both within and without the [benefit districts] who will be impacted\u201d by Metro Rail, the Court of Appeal concluded that, along an axial line, this case was factually closer to two municipal bond referendum cases decided by the high court, <em>Cipriano </em>v. <em>City of Houma </em>(1969) 395 U.S 701 [23 L.Ed.2d 647, 89 S.Ct. 1897] <em>(Cipriano), </em>and <em>Phoenix </em>v. <em>Kolodziejski </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 204 [26 L.Ed.2d 523, 90 S.Ct. 1990] <em>(Phoenix), </em>than it was to <em>Salyer </em>or <em>Ball. </em>It was thus one in which the principle of one person, one vote applied, the court concluded. Our analysis of these cases and the facts surrounding the benefit districts impels us to disagree with the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In the two cases relied upon by the Court of Appeal to support its result, the high court concluded that the differences \u201cbetween the interests of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>property owners and the interests of nonproperty owners [were] not sufficiently substantial to justify excluding the latter from the franchise.\u201d <em>(Phoe</em>nix, <em>supra, </em>399 U.S. 204, 209 [26 L.Ed.2d 523, 527].) In <em>Cipriano, </em>a municipally owned utility called an election to approve the issuance of $10 million in revenue bonds to finance improvements to the utility. Under state law, only \u201cproperty taxpayers\u201d were qualified to vote in such a referendum. The court invalidated the voting limitation as underinclusive, concluding that those excluded from voting were not \u201c \u2018in fact substantially less interested or affected [by the outcome] than those the statute includes.\u2019 \u201d (395 U.S. at p. 704 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 651], quoting <em>Kramer, supra, </em>395 U.S. 621, 632 [23 L.Ed.2d 583, 592].) Since the operations of the public utility affected virtually every resident of the governmental unit (the city)\u2014the rates of all users would be directly affected by the utility\u2019s debt service requirements, and the bonds were paid out of utility revenues rather than property taxes\u2014 the impact of the revenue bond issue on those permitted to vote had little to do with their status as property owners. The challenged scheme thus excluded qualified voters who were \u201cas substantially affected and directly interested in the matter voted upon as . . . those . . . permitted to vote.\u201d <em>(Cipriano, supra, </em>395 U.S. at p. 706 [23 L.Ed.2d at pp. 651-652].)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Similarly, in <em>Phoenix, supra, </em>399 U.S. 204, the court invalidated a statutory voting scheme restricting the franchise to real property taxpayers in a referendum called by the city to approve general obligation bonds, the proceeds of which were to be used to finance multiple municipal improvements\u2014\u201cthe city sewer system, parks and playgrounds, police and public safety buildings, and libraries.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 206 [26 L.Ed.2d at p. 526].) In holding that the <em>Reynolds (supra, </em>377 U.S. 533) principle of one person, one vote applied to the bond referendum, the court identified three reasons why the challenged voting classification was not supported by sufficiently substantial differences between those permitted to vote and those excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">First, it was plain that all the residents of the municipality had a substantial and indistinguishable interest in the public facilities and services to be financed by the bond issue and thus would be substantially affected by the election outcome. <em>(Phoenix, supra, </em>399 U.S. at p. 209 [26 L.Ed.2d at pp. 527-528].) Second, although under state law the city theoretically had recourse to a real property tax levy to support its bond issue, historically it had financed more than half of its debt requirements by revenues from nonproperty taxes, taxes paid by property and nonproperty owners alike. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 209-210 [26 L.Ed.2d at pp. 527-528].) Finally, the court recognized that a significant portion of those property taxes paid by owners to finance the bonds would ultimately be passed on to lessees in the form of higher rents, and to the general public as increases in the cost of goods and services, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>thereby dispersing the financial burden beyond the limited class enfranchised. (I<em>d. </em>at p. 210 [26 L.Ed.2d at p. 528].)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Applying the teaching of these two cases to the circumstances presented by the record here, we reach a conclusion contrary to that of the Court of Appeal. First and foremost, unlike <em>Cipriano, supra, </em>395 U.S. 701, and <em>Phoenix, supra, </em>399 U.S. 204, in which it could be said that virtually all of the residents of the governmental unit had a beneficial interest in the outcome of the bond referendum\u2014the prospect of improved utility service for resident consumers in the one case and an array of civic improvements and services in the other\u2014nonvoting residents of the assessment districts have no specific beneficial interest in the proceeds of the assessments distinguishable from that of every other resident of the multicounty area comprising the transit district.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Although nonproperty owning residents of the assessment districts are \u201caffected\u201d by the outcome of the referendum, they are no more affected than any other resident of the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area served by Metro Rail. It is not contended by any party that the state or federal Constitution requires that assessment district referenda be open to all qualified electors in the entire geographical area served by Metro Rail. Since the beneficial impact of the assessment districts on nonvoting residents is indistinguishable from the impact on residents of the Metro Rail service area outside of the benefit districts, that impact is insufficient to require extension of the franchise to the excluded class.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Moreover, again unlike the circumstances in <em>Cipriano, supra, </em>395 U.S. 701, and <em>Phoenix, supra, </em>399 U.S. 204, the economic burden of the assessments does not fall indiscriminately on property- and non-property-owning residents of the benefit districts alike. If the benefit districts are approved, the levy will fall directly on precisely that limited class enfranchised by the statutory scheme\u2014owners of commercial property within the district; nonvoting residents of the districts will bear no discemably direct financial burden as a result of the assessments, nor will those residing outside the benefit districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">And while one possible result of the failure to gain voter approval of the benefit districts may be to force SCRTD to look elsewhere to make up for lost funding, the possibility of a future search for alternative revenues that could conceivably result in some financial impact on the taxpayers of much of Southern California in the form of additional levies does not mean that all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>qualified voters residing within the benefit districts must be permitted to vote. Again, the economic effect is remote and diluted rather than direct and substantial, and for that reason does not implicate interests sufficient to trigger the principle of <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>377 U.S. 533. As in <em>Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, 729 [35 L.Ed.2d 659, 667], \u201cthere is no way that the economic burdens\u201d of the assessment districts \u201ccan fall on residents <em>qua </em>residents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Third, unlike both <em>Cipriano, supra, </em>395 U.S. 701, and <em>Phoenix, supra, </em>399 U.S. 204, this is not a case in which those residents of the governmental unit denied the franchise will in fact contribute to the burden of financing Metro Rail as directly as those enfranchised. The constitutionally decisive fact is that, under the assessment scheme, only commercial real property within the two districts will be assessed\u2014an immediate and tangible economic burden that is confined to commercial property and does not implicate directly any economic interest of either non-property-owning residents or residential property owners within the assessment districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">As in <em>Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, and <em>Ball, supra, </em>451 U.S. 355, the \u201cactivities\u201d of the assessment districts\u2014the raising of revenue to defray in part the cost of Metro Rail\u2014will affect disproportionately owners of commercial property within them; it is they who will most directly feel both the beneficial economic effects of the transit station locations and bear the financial burden of the annual assessments. Likewise, all district \u201ccosts\u201d (the assessments themselves) \u201care assessed against land\u201d; district \u201coperations\u201d (again, the raising of revenue to finance public improvements directly benefiting the enfranchised class) \u201cprimarily affect the land within [district] boundaries.\u201d (410 U.S. at p. 729 [35 L.Ed.2d at p. 667].)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">This is not to deny that some within the benefit districts who are not permitted to vote will be more \u201caffected\u201d by the proposed assessments than those outside. Notably, we may assume, as did the court in <em>Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, that a subclass of those within the two benefit districts whose economic interests are analogous to those of commercial property owners\u2014 commercial lessees in this case\u2014will be affected secondarily by the assessments because of \u201cpass through\u201d clauses in their lease agreements. But so, too, are consumers of goods and services retailed by this subclass \u201caffected,\u201d as the financial consequences of the assessments are presumably distributed throughout the region. In the specific factual context of this case, however, we do not find this prospect sufficiently substantial to invoke the demands of <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>377 U.S. 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">As in <em>Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, we think that recognition of the indirect and secondary affect on this limited class smacks too much of \u201chouse that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Jack built\u201d casuistry to support constitutional determinations. As mentioned, the equal protection inquiry is one of constitutional line drawing; the cases do not teach that the limited class enfranchised \u201cmust be the only parties at all affected ... or that their entire economic well-being must depend on that [special-purpose unit of government].\u201d <em>(Ball, supra, </em>451 U.S. 355, 371 [68 L.Ed.2d 150, 163].) Voting power may constitutionally be apportioned \u201cto give greater influence to the constituent groups found to be <em>most </em>affected by the governmental unit\u2019s functions.\u201d <em>(Lockport, supra, </em>430 U.S. 259, 266 [51 L.Ed.2d 313, 321], italics added.) In short, we are satisfied that those excluded from voting under the statutory scheme at issue in this case are not \u201cas substantially affected and directly interested in the matter voted upon as are those who are permitted to vote.\u201d <em>(Cipriano, supra, </em>395 U.S. 701, 706 [23 L.Ed.2d 647, 651-652].)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Finally, we cannot fail to note the apparent inconsistency of interveners on this issue. Although urging that the principle of <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>377 U.S. 533, applies, they nevertheless acknowledge the superior fairness of a voting scheme that would offend the principle of one person, one vote, by contending that the proper voting classification would include commercial property owners and tenants as well as residents of the benefit districts. Were the <em>Reynolds </em>principle to prevail here, however, it is district residents, precisely that class least affected by the assessment scheme, who would be enfranchised, to the exclusion of nonresident corporate property owners and probably most commercial tenants of the two districts. As in <em>Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, 730 [35 L.Ed.2d 659, 667], to sustain interveners\u2019 contention \u201cwould not result merely in the striking down of an exclusion from what was otherwise a delineated class, but would instead engraft onto the statutory scheme a wholly new class of voters in addition to those enfranchised by the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">We conclude, therefore, that neither the \u201cspecial-purpose unit of government\u201d nor the \u201cprimarily affected or interested\u201d analysis yields a requirement that the principle of one person, one vote must be applied to benefit assessment district referenda.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Of course, respondents are entitled to have their claims adjudicated under the equal protection requirement applicable in this case, namely, that the statutory voting scheme not be \u201c \u2018wholly irrelevant\u2019 \u201d to the \u201c \u2018achievement of the [statutory] objectives,\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, 730 [35 L.Ed.2d 659, 668].) The question whether the voting classification meets that constitutional standard is one that we examine in the abstract; it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>not whether we would authorize the same exclusions were we the Legislature, but whether \u201cany state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify\u201d a voting scheme limiting the franchise to owners of record of commercial real property located within the benefit districts. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 732 [35 L.Ed.2d at pp. 668-669], citing <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Maryland, supra, </em>366 U.S. 420, 426 [6 L.Ed.2d 393, 399].)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The challenged scheme denies the vote to two identifiable subgroups within the benefit districts\u2014residents, whether lessees or owners, of noncommercial real property, and lessees of commercial property. The Legislature reasonably could have permitted the exclusion of the former on the obvious ground that limiting voting to those who will directly bear the cost of the assessments is demonstrably fairer or more equitable than including those whose affirmative vote carries no personal financial consequences or risk. As did the court in <em>Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, 731 [35 L.Ed.2d 659, 668], we conclude that nothing in the equal protection clause precludes the total exclusion of \u201cthose who merely reside within the district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The case with respect to commercial lessees is only slightly less evident. As noted, interveners\u2019 claim with respect to this class is that, by virtue of \u201cpass through\u201d clauses in commercial lease agreements, they (or some of them) will bear a financial impact as a result of the assessments that is so closely analogous to that affecting the class enfranchised as to be indistinguishable for equal protection purposes. Here again, however, it was for the Legislature to draw the line. And again, as in <em>Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, 732 [35 L.Ed.2d 659, 668-669], we think that it reasonably could have drawn the line that it did in light of the significant administrative difficulties that foreseeably would have arisen had the vote been extended to the \u201cpass through\u201d class of commercial tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">As the transit district points out, including this class within those enfranchised would require those administering the referenda to determine a multitude of discrete voter qualification issues\u2014identifying those commercial leases with \u201cpass through\u201d provisions and those without, the percentage of the assessment passed to particular tenants, whether partial \u201cpass throughs\u201d are permitted, the duration of commercial leases, and other electoral minutiae which have not occurred to us. Although imperfect, the \u201crough accommodation\u201d to practicality and administrative convenience chosen passes constitutional muster. <em>(Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, 732 [35 L.Ed.2d 659, 668-669]; <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 471, 485-487 [25 L.Ed.2d 491, 501-503, 90 S.Ct. 1153]; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 288, 295, fn. 2 [93 Cal.Rptr. 455, 481 P.2d 823]; <em>United States Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 603, 613-614 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>[175 Cal.Rptr. 169, 629 P.2d 1381].) We cannot conclude that the Legislature was unreasonable in drawing the line so as to deny the franchise to this class.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The conclusion that the distribution of the elective franchise in benefit district referenda is not subject to the strict demands of <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>377 U.S. 533, also yields the answer to interveners\u2019 ancillary claim that the manner in which the Legislature chose to apportion votes and levy assessments among those enfranchised is constitutionally defective.  The specific contention is that principles of equal protection <em>require </em>that those who pay the most in assessments be alloted the most votes in the referenda. Absent this substantial \u201cproportionality\u201d between voting power and financial burden, interveners argue, the statutory voting scheme lacks a rational basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">As authority for this argument, interveners rely entirely on a sentence in <em>Ball, supra, </em>451 U.S. 355, and language in the opinion of the Court of Appeal in <em>Whitlock, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.3d 863. Interveners seize on the statement in <em>Ball </em>that an acreage-based vote allotment scheme is rational because it \u201creasonably reflects the relative risks . . . incurred [by] landowners and the distribution of the benefits and burdens of the District\u2019s water operations.\u201d (451 U.S. at p. 371 [68 L.Ed.2d at p. 163], fn. omitted.) They also invoke language in <em>Whitlock </em>sustaining as rational a statutory provision for the termination of assessment proceedings on the protest of owners of more than one-half of the land affected.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">We cannot regard these brief remarks as definitive on the issue, however, impliedly condemning alternative vote allotment schemes. In <em>Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, 734 [35 L.Ed.2d 659, 669-670], the court upheld a statutory scheme that alloted votes according to the tax assessed value of real property and imposed assessments on a project-specific basis according to the benefit conferred, a divided arrangement not unlike the statutory scheme challenged in this case. The high court declined to declare such a scheme not rationally based, given the rough proportionality between voting strength and assessment burden. <em>(Ibid.) </em>As in <em>Salyer, </em>we think that the Legislature was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>to assume that within these relatively small benefit assessment districts, assessed valuation bears a rough relationship to lot or building size and that the vote allotment and assessment formulas are thus not unreasonably disproportionate for equal protection purposes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Alternatively, the conclusion that the circumstances surrounding the benefit district referenda satisfy the constitutional criteria for an exception to the principle of one person, one vote, necessarily means that the proponent of the challenged statutory voting scheme must demonstrate only that it is not \u201cwholly irrelevant\u201d to the objectives of the statute. <em>(Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, 730 [35 L.Ed.2d 659, 668].) The equal protection issue raised by interveners\u2019 proportionality claim, therefore, is simply whether the divided arrangement chosen by the Legislature bears some reasonable relation to the statutory scheme. That is, we perceive no constitutional basis independent of <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>377 U.S. 533, for what is, in substance, simply an argument for a scheme of weighted voting different from that chosen by the Legislature, one that gives greater voting power to some property owners rather than others.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">That said, it is not difficult to imagine legitimate concerns that might have motivated the Legislature to adopt differing formulas for the allotment of votes and the calculation of assessments. It might, for example, have adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>the working assumption that building or lot size bears a rough but reasonably direct relationship to the enhanced economic benefits resulting from the location of Metro Rail facilities, a supposition that would rationally justify basing assessment calculations on square footage or parcel size. It may be true, as interveners point out, that such an assumption is faulty when applied to warehouse space, for example, but at this level of equal protection analysis we must deal in imperfect generalities. Given the interests at stake here, the Legislature has wide latitude within which to draw lines before a reviewing court can say it has crossed over into the zone of complete irrelevancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Likewise, the Legislature\u2019s direction that current ad valorem tax assessment rolls be used to identify qualified voters and allot votes has the merit of accuracy, simplicity and administrative convenience. At least where the countervailing interests are not fundamental in the constitutional sense or otherwise entitled to special solicitude, these are virtues that are not lightly abandoned. <em>(Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, 732-733 [35 L.Ed.2d at pp. 668-669].) It was hardly unreasonable for the Legislature to direct that votes be alloted by means of existing tax assessment rolls\u2014an accurate, convenient, and verifiable basis for notice and one that permits benefit districts to be approved at referenda <em>before </em>undertaking the administratively detailed, prolonged, and costly task of calculating and verifying the square footage of each parcel subject to assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"> Whatever the case, although both alloting votes and calculating assessments according to square footage might be more \u201cequitable\u201d in that it would tend to equalize the burden of assessments and voting power, we discern no constitutional basis for compelling the Legislature to adopt such an arrangement, on pain of having its voting scheme invalidated as lacking a rational basis.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">A final matter requires our attention.  As noted, in addition to holding that the referendum voting scheme violated principles of equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>protection, the Court of Appeal also held that SCRTD lacked legal authority to exempt from assessment residential property within the two benefit districts. It reached this conclusion on nonconstitutional grounds, concluding that only the Legislature possessed the power to grant exemptions from special assessments and that it had neither done so here nor delegated that authority to SCRTD. We disagree. The Legislature expressly authorized the relevant local government to amend the transit district board\u2019s resolution creating the assessment district in various ways, including exempting residential property from assessment, and empowered SCRTD to adopt the resolution as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Specifically, Public Utilities Code section 33001.5 requires that, before being established, any benefit district proposed by SCRTD be submitted to the relevant \u201cgoverning body,\u201d defined by section 33001.5, subdivision (d), as \u201cthe city council of a city in which the proposed benefit district is located\u201d or county board of supervisors if not within a city. The statute goes on to empower the governing body, after a public hearing, to \u201capprove, or amend and approve, as amended, or disapprove the geographic boundaries of the benefit district and the method of assessment,\u201d following which the SCRTD board may by a two-thirds vote either establish the benefit district on the terms approved by the governing body or forgo its establishment. (Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 33001.5, subds. (b) &amp; (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Relying on the rule that exemptions from special assessments \u201cshould ... be based on express statutory authority\u201d <em>(Hollywood Cemetery Assn. </em>v. <em>Powell </em>(1930) 210 Cal. 121, 135 [291 P. 397, 71 A.L.R. 310]), and that a presumption, founded on distributive equity, extends assessment to all those who are beneficially affected by the improvement absent affirmative indications supporting an exemption <em>(Cedars of Lebanon Hosp. </em>v. <em>County of L. A. </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 729, 747-748 [221 P.2d 31, 15 A.L.R.2d 1045]), interveners claim that the text of the statute fails to demonstrate the requisite clarity of legislative intent. The Court of Appeal agreed that the statute did not grant SCRTD any exemption power. We disagree and, for the reasons that follow, conclude that the exemption of residential property from the assessment districts at issue here is \u201cbased on express statutory authority.\u201d <em>(Hollywood Cemetery Assn. </em>v. <em>Powell, supra, </em>210 Cal. 121, 135.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Public Utilities Code section 33001.5, subdivision (b), expressly authorizes the City Council of Los Angeles to \u201camend and approve, as amended ... the geographic boundaries of the benefit district and the method of assessment.\u201d Although the term \u201cmethod of assessment\u201d is not defined, the Legislature previously has used this phrase to encompass the determination of the type of property upon which an assessment will be levied. (Stats. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>1977, ch. 1218, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, pp. 4101-4103, Deering\u2019s Wat. Uncod. Acts (1991 pocket supp.) Act 7150, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 13.5, pp. 9-10.) Accordingly, we conclude that by using this phrase in section 33001.5, the Legislature authorized Los Angeles to amend the method of assessment by excluding residential properties from the assessment district. Our conclusion is butressed by the fact that, in addition to receiving authorization to amend the method of assessment, the city was statutorily authorized to amend the geographic boundaries of the benefit district. It is clear, therefore, that the Legislature intended the city to have a significant voice in determining which properties would be subject to the special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Finally, subdivision (c) of section 33001.5 of the Public Utilities Code provides that once the city has acted, SCRTD must decide \u201cwhether to create the benefit district as approved by the [city].\u201d The Legislature thus granted SCRTD authority to create the assessment district as amended by the city, including the exemption of residential properties from assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Early in our history, the high court observed that \u201cthe science of government is ... the science of experiment.\u201d <em>(Anderson </em>v. <em>Dunn </em>(1821) 19 U.S. [6 Wheat.] 204, 226 [5 L.Ed. 242, 247].) Not long ago, in upholding an innovation in the government of a county school system, the court reminded us that \u201c[v]iable local governments may need many innovations, numerous combinations of old and new devices, great flexibility in municipal arrangements to meet changing urban conditions.\u201d <em>(Sailors </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 105, 110-111 [18 L.Ed.2d 650, 654-655, 87 S.Ct. 1549].) In the circumstances of this case, combining an old device with a new setting, we see \u201cnothing in the Constitution to prevent experimentation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 111 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 655].)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Lucas, C.

Despite sweeping language in early post-<em>Reynolds </em>decisions of the high court suggesting that enfranchising any class of qualified voters is itself sufficient to invoke the principle of one person, one vote, and thus to require the state to demonstrate a compelling need for the classification (see, e.g., <em>Kramer </em>v. <em>Union School District </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 621, 627 [23 L.Ed.2d 583, 589-590, 89 S.Ct. 1886] <em>(Kramer)), </em>later cases have undermined that proposition to such an extent that it fairly can be doubted to be the rule.

In part, our decision in <em>Choudhry </em>was grounded in equal protection concerns arising from the statute\u2019s interference with ballot access and the \u201creal and appreciable impact\u201d test on the electoral process formulated in <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Carter </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 134, 144 [31 L.Ed.2d 92, 100, 92 S.Ct. 849].

The Court of Appeal rejected this argument in the following language: \u201cSince only those landowners who are directly benefited are charged with the cost of the improvements in proportion to the benefit conferred and since land area bears some reasonable relationship to the amount of the assessment, there is a rational basis for making the governmental decision subject to landowners\u2019 protest and in measuring the sufficiency of the protest by the land area protested.\u201d (22 Cal.App.3d at p. 876.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b708-6\">It is true that <em>Salyer </em>was decided prior to the passage of Proposition 13, an event that, as interveners vigorously remind us, transformed the California real property tax landscape. By making the assessed value of real property for tax purposes essentially dependent on sale price, Proposition 13 has a \u201cwild card\u201d effect on property-based bifurcated vote allotment/ assessment schemes such as the one at issue here. Since property held longer will be assessed for tax purposes at a lower rate than property recently transferred and reassessed (assuming continuing inflationary trends in real property values), a referendum scheme that allots votes according to tax assessment value may result in substantial disparities in the voting power and assessment burdens of real property of comparable market value and square footage. As interveners point out, under the statutory scheme, the voting power of comparably sized parcels within the same benefit district may vary by as much as (in one case) a factor of 20, depending on the date of acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">We have upheld substantial inequalities in the assessed value of comparable properties for ad valorem tax purposes against equal protection challenge and validated as reasonable the acquisition-value approach to property assessment embodied in Proposition 13. <em>(Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch.

The fact that such a constitutionally valid tax assessment system may have the marginal result of diluting voting power in an assessment referendum is an inequality that the Legislature can remedy by amending the voting scheme; it does not constitutionally invalidate the voting classification per se.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Interveners make much of the fact that following passage of the benefit assessment legislation, the Legislature passed an amendatory measure which would have mandated both voting allotment and assessments on a square footage or parcel basis; the measure, however, was vetoed by the Governor.

Because the construction of rapid transit stations is a matter of concern to all residents of the area surrounding the sites of the proposed stations, and because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>burden of the assessments will be passed on to other members of the community in the form of higher rents and higher prices for goods and services, the right to vote on a financing mechanism for the stations may not be restricted to owners of commercial property. The contrary conclusion reached by the majority is based on a faulty analysis derived from a misreading of the applicable decisions of the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The Legislature established the Southern California Rapid Transit District (hereafter the SCRTD) to construct, operate, and maintain \u201ca comprehensive mass rapid transit system in the southern California area, and particularly in Los Angeles County.\u201d (Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 30001, subd. (a).) The governing body of the SCRTD is its board of directors (hereafter the Board). <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 30200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Recognizing that \u201crail rapid transit facilities and services provide special benefits to parcels of land, and improvements thereon, in the vicinity of rail rapid transit stations\u201d (Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 33000, subd. (b)), the Legislature authorized the SCRTD to identify the area around each transit station that would be specially benefited by the station, to designate this area a benefit assessment district (or a zone within a benefit assessment district), and to levy special benefit assessments on property so designated <em>(id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 33000, subd. (a), 33001). Imposition of the special benefit assessments is \u201cfor the purpose of financing, in whole or in part, the acquisition, construction, development, joint development, operation, maintenance, or repair of one or more rail transit stations and rail transit related facilities located within the benefit districts.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 33001, subd. (a).) Revenue derived from a special benefit assessment, or from bonds secured by such assessment, may be used only for financing the facility for which it was levied. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 33002, subd.

If a petition with the required signatures is presented, the SCRTD holds an election at which only owners of assessed property may vote and each such property owner \u201cmay cast one vote for each one thousand dollars ($1,000), or fraction thereof, worth of land or improvements owned by the voter in the benefit district as is shown on the most recent equalized assessment roll.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 33002.3, subd.

Although the Legislature had not expressly authorized the exemption of residential property from assessment, such property was exempted and the Board levied the assessment only on commercial property. The lawsuit now before this court challenges the electoral features of the existing scheme, under which only owners of commercial property can petition for and vote in an election on the benefit assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Under the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution, no state may \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d In the context of state and local voting systems, this guarantee means that the government may not impose a voting restriction other than residence, age, or citizenship, <em>in elections of general interest, </em>unless it can demonstrate that the restriction is necessary to promote a compelling state interest. <em>(Hill </em>v. <em>Stone </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 289, 297 [44 L.Ed.2d 172, 178-179, 95 S.Ct. 1637].) The SCRTD does not contend that the voting restriction at issue here, which limits the franchise to owners of commercial property, can withstand this strict scrutiny. The primary question to be answered, therefore, is whether an election on the imposition of special benefit assessments to finance rail rapid transit stations is an election of general or special interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">To support its conclusion that the restrictions at issue here are constitutionally permissible, the majority relies heavily on <em>Salyer Land Co. </em>v. <em>Tulare Water District </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 719 [35 L.Ed.2d 659, 93 S.Ct. 1224] (hereafter <em>Salyer), </em>and <em>Ball </em>v. <em>James </em>(1981) 451 U.S. 355 [68 L.Ed.2d 150, 101 S.Ct. 1811] (hereafter <em>Ball). </em>As I will explain, these cases are of limited relevance because they concern elections to select representatives rather than, as here, elections to decide discrete issues. To the extent these cases are relevant, they support the conclusion that voting restrictions in elections conducted by the SCRTD are not exempt from strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">In <em>Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, and <em>Ball, supra, </em>451 U.S. 355, the issue before the United States Supreme Court was the validity, under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s equal protection guarantee, of a law limiting to property owners the right to vote in elections of the governing body of a water district. In upholding the property ownership restrictions, the high court explained that a water district, in the discharge of its primary function, does not exercise traditional governmental powers. Noting that a water district exists to acquire, store, and distribute water, the court commented that the district at issue in <em>Salyer </em>provided \u201cno other general public services such as schools, housing, <em>transportation, </em>utilities, roads, or anything else of the type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>ordinarily financed by a municipal body. . . . and it does not have a fire department, police, buses, or trains.\u201d <em>(Salyer, supra, </em>at pp. 728-729 [35 L.Ed.2d at pp. 666-667], italics added.) Although the district at issue in <em>Ball </em>did provide a \u201cgeneral public service\u201d by producing and distributing electrical power, this activity was merely incidental to its primary purpose and thus, the court concluded, the provision of this utility service could not change the district\u2019s character. <em>(Ball, supra, </em>at pp. 368-369 [68 L.Ed.2d at pp. 161-162].)</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The United States Supreme Court also emphasized that the actions of water districts disproportionately affect landowners because district costs are assessed against landowners in proportion to the benefits received, with delinquencies becoming a lien on the land. <em>(Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719,729 [35 L.Ed.2d at p. 667].) Although the district at issue in <em>Ball </em>provided much of its water for nonagricultural uses, the court explained that the \u201cconstitutionally relevant fact\u201d was that all of its water was distributed according to land ownership. <em>(Ball, supra, </em>451 U.S. 355, 367 [68 L.Ed.2d at pp. 160-161].) The court concluded that the districts \u201cremain essentially business enterprises, created by and chiefly benefiting a specific group of landowners.\u201d (I<em>d. </em>at p. 368 [68 L.Ed.2d at p. 161].)</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The SCRTD\u2019s primary purpose and manner of operation contrast sharply with those of the water districts discussed in <em>Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, and <em>Ball, supra, </em>451 U.S. 355. The SCRTD\u2019s primary purpose is to establish and operate an urban rail mass transit system. Providing urban mass transportation is a task traditionally performed by local government, as the United States Supreme Court recognized when it included transportation among the \u201cgeneral public services\u201d that local governments have historically provided to their citizens. <em>(Salyer, supra, </em>at pp. 728-729 [35 L.Ed.2d at pp. 666-667]; see also, <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle </em>(W.D.Wash. 1990) 751 F.Supp. 885, 890 [applying one-person, one-vote principle to special district providing mass transit and water pollution abatement].)</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">If a public entity\u2019s primary purpose is to provide even a single traditional governmental service, the federal Constitution may require strict scrutiny of voting restrictions in elections of its governing body. (See, e.g\u201e <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Junior College District </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 50 [25 L.Ed.2d 45, 90 S.Ct. 791] [applying one-person, one-vote principle to election for school board members]; <em>Fumarolo </em>v. <em>Chicago Bd. of Educ. </em>(1990) 142 Ill.2d 54 [566 N.E.2d 1283, 1295].) The transportation service that the SCRTD provides is not distributed according to land ownership but is available to all who choose to ride its trains. Although the building of a rail mass transit system provides special benefits to some landowners, these benefits are incidental to the rapid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>transit district\u2019s primary purpose. The chief beneficiaries of the transit system are those who use it for transportation, a class unrelated to land ownership. Finally, only a small portion of the SCRTD\u2019s revenues will be derived from assessments on land. Its primary sources of funding are grants from the federal and state governments and the fares to be collected from transit patrons. Given these many significant differences between the SCRTD and the water districts considered by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, and <em>Ball, supra, </em>451 U.S. 355, this case is not controlled by the decisions in those two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The majority opinion does not analyze the issue in these terms. Instead of comparing the water districts at issue in <em>Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, and <em>Ball, supra, </em>451 U.S. 355, with the SCRTD, the majority compares them with the benefit assessment districts. This is fundamentally erroneous, and indeed senseless, because the SCRTD itself, not the benefit districts, imposes and collects the special benefit assessments and conducts any election that may be required. (Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 33000 et seq.) Furthermore, although a rapid transit district and a benefit assessment district are both called \u201cdistrict,\u201d only one of them\u2014the rapid transit district\u2014exists as a legal entity. A benefit assessment district is merely a geographical area within the SCRTD\u2019s borders identified by the Board for the purpose of imposing the assessment. Such a \u201cdistrict\u201d has no governing body, no employees, and no powers or responsibilities. It is not a public entity. (See <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Town of Los Altos Hills </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 676, 683 [129 Cal.Rptr. 97, 547 P.2d 1377].) Because it is not a unit of government, a benefit assessment district, unlike the SCRTD itself, cannot be meaningfully compared to the water districts at issue in <em>Salyer </em>and <em>Ball.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The conclusion to be drawn from <em>Salyer, supra, </em>410 U.S. 719, and <em>Ball, supra, </em>451 U.S. 355, is that the SCRTD is a governmental entity of general powers. If the election at issue were for the purpose of selecting the SCRTD\u2019s governing body, it would be an election of general interest and restrictions on the franchise other than residence, age, or citizenship would therefore be subject to strict scrutiny. <em>(Hill </em>v. <em>Stone, supra, </em>421 U.S. 289,297 [44 L.Ed.2d 172, 178-179].) But the scope of the election is narrower. Its purpose is to determine whether special benefit assessments shall be imposed. To decide whether such an election, conducted by a governmental entity of general powers, is an election of general interest, it is appropriate to consider decisions of the United States Supreme Court concerning similar limited-purpose elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">As the high court has emphasized, the equal protection principles applicable to \u201can election involving the choice of legislative representatives\u201d have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>only \u201climited relevance\u201d in determining the validity of restrictions on the franchise in a \u201c \u2018single-shot\u2019 referendum.\u201d <em>(Lockport </em>v. <em>Citizens for Community Action </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 259, 266 [51 L.Ed.2d 313, 321, 97 S.Ct. 1047].) Unlike an election of legislative representatives, a referendum \u201cputs one discrete issue to the voters,\u201d and the proposal can be analyzed \u201cto determine whether its adoption or rejection will have a disproportionate impact on an identifiable group of voters.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>If adoption or rejection of the proposal that is the subject of the referendum would have such a disproportionate impact, \u201cthe question then is whether a State can recognize that impact either by limiting the franchise to those voters specially affected or by giving their votes a special weight.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Here, it cannot be questioned that the decision to impose a special benefit assessment will have a particular impact on an identifiable group of voters\u2014 owners of the property on which the assessment is imposed. But the existence of this special impact is not in itself sufficient to justify restriction of the franchise to the class specially affected in this manner. The relevant analysis is found in another United States Supreme Court decision, <em>Phoenix </em>v. <em>Kolodziejski </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 204 [26 L.Ed.2d 523, 90 S.Ct. 1990] (hereafter <em>Phoenix).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The high court held in <em>Phoenix, supra, </em>399 U.S. 204, that in an election to approve a municipality\u2019s issuance of general obligation bonds, a state could not restrict the franchise to real property taxpayers, even though the municipality substantially relied on property taxes to service the bonds. The court concluded that \u201c[t]he differences between the interests of property owners and the interests of nonproperty owners are not sufficiently substantial to justify excluding the latter from the franchise.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 209 [26 L.Ed.2d at p. 527].)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The court gave three reasons for this conclusion. First, all municipal residents had a substantial interest in the facilities and services financed by the bonds. \u201cPresumptively, when all citizens are affected in important ways by a governmental decision subject to a referendum, the Constitution does not permit weighted voting or the exclusion of otherwise qualified citizens from the franchise.\u201d <em>(Phoenix, supra, </em>399 U.S. 204, 209 [26 L.Ed.2d at p. 527].) Second, the municipality would not rely entirely on property taxes to service the bond debt, but would also rely in significant part on other local taxes paid by nonproperty owners. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 209-210 [26 L.Ed.2d at pp. 527- 528].) Finally, the landowners could redistribute the property tax burden to others in the community in the form of higher rents and, in the case of commercial property, in the form of higher prices for goods and services produced or sold on the taxed property. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 210-211 [26 L.Ed.2d at pp. 528- 529].)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>This analysis compels a similar conclusion here. As the United States Supreme Court recognized, a vote on a revenue measure cannot be divorced from the facilities and services to be financed by the revenue. Here, the issue addressed by the special benefit assessment election is not just the imposition of the assessment, but also the construction of the mass transit stations that the assessments will finance. The stations will generate an increase in commercial activity in the areas around the stations, as the majority acknowledges. This increase in commercial activity will make the areas more attractive for certain kinds of high volume businesses (e.g., fast-food outlets), and less attractive for other, more neighborhood-oriented businesses (e.g., laundromats). Inevitably, all residents of the benefit assessment area, not just the owners of commercial property, will be affected in important ways by the change in the commercial environment resulting from the location of the transit station.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">The effects will not be confined to commercial activity. In most instances, residential property located near proposed rapid transit stations will increase in value in recognition of the convenience of ready access to the transit system.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This increase in value will translate into higher rents for rented dwellings and higher sales prices for owner-occupied dwellings. These increases in housing costs will significantly affect the residents of the area immediately surrounding the proposed stations.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Because the construction of the transit stations affects all community residents in important ways, the exclusion of residents who own no commercial land is presumptively a violation of equal protection. Although the assessments will be levied initially on the owners of commercial property, they can redistribute the burden to other community residents. Rents charged to commercial tenants will certainly increase. Indeed, it is undisputed that most commercial leases in the benefit assessment areas contain \u201cpass through\u201d provisions under which the tenant assumes liability for any tax or assessment levied on the property. The occupant of the premises who pays the assessment, whether landowner or tenant, can recover the cost from consumers, many of whom will be local residents, by increases in the prices of goods and services produced or sold on the taxed property.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Under the test articulated in <em>Phoenix, supra, </em>399 U.S. 204, which this court is required to employ, the election on the SCRTD\u2019s special benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>assessments is an election of general interest, in which restrictions other than residence, age, and citizenship must be subjected to strict scrutiny. The restriction imposed, which limits the franchise to owners of commercial property, concededly cannot withstand such scrutiny. Accordingly, the existing system for the SCR.TD special benefit assessment elections, by disenfranchising all but owners of commercial property subject to assessment, violates the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Like the other members of this court, I am reluctant to accept a conclusion that might impede the construction of needed public facilities, and the need for a modern and efficient rapid transit system in the greater Los Angeles area cannot be denied. Yet, as the United States Supreme Court has noted, restrictions on the franchise that violate equal protection cannot be justified \u201con exigencies of history or convenience.\u201d <em>(New York City Bd. of Estimate </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(1989) 489 U.S. 688, 703, fn. 10 [103 L.Ed.2d 717, 733, 109 S.Ct. 1433].) Thus, like the Court of Appeal, I conclude that, under controlling federal precedent, the existing electoral system for the SCRTD\u2019s special benefit assessments is invalid on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Because the electoral system is invalid for the reasons I have stated, I find it unnecessary to consider the other bases on which that system has been challenged in this litigation. Having concluded that the existing electoral system violates the federal Constitution, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Mosk, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Interveners\u2019 petition for a rehearing was denied March 26, 1992. Mosk, J., and Kennard, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">There may be situations in which a rapid transit station would depress the value of adjacent residential property. For instance, this could occur in the unlikely event that the station were to be located in a neighborhood of expensive single-family residences. For present purposes, the essential point is that construction of a rapid transit station is virtually certain to have some effect, either positive or negative, on the value of nearby residential property.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
