Wynn, appeals the circuit court's dismissal of his petition for postconviction relief filed pursuant to Rule 32, Ala. R. Crim. P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In August 1999, Wynn was convicted of murdering Denise Bliss during the course of a robbery and a burglary, offenses defined as capital by \u00a7\u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(2) and 13A-5-40(a)(4), Ala. Code 1975. The jury unanimously recommended that Wynn be sentenced to death. The circuit court followed the jury's recommendation and sentenced Wynn to death. On direct appeal, this Court remanded the case to the circuit court for that court to vacate two of Wynn's capital-murder convictions on double-jeopardy grounds and to correct its sentencing order. On return to remand, we affirmed Wynn's convictions and sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wynn v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9411229\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/804/1122/\">\n    804 So.2d 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.Crim.App.2000). This Court issued its certificate of judgment on June 1, 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In March 2003, Wynn filed a timely petition for postconviction relief in the Calhoun Circuit Court. Wynn filed amendments to that petition in August 2003, September 2006, October 2012, and twice in April 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2005, while Wynn's postconviction petition was pending in the Calhoun Circuit Court, the United States Supreme Court released its decision in\n   <em>\n    Roper v. Simmons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    543 U.S. 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928574\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/551/\">\n    161 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). The Supreme Court held that a sentence of death for a juvenile who was under the age of 18 when he or she committed the offense was unconstitutional. Wynn was 17 years of age at the time of the offense; therefore, in accordance with the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   , the circuit court vacated Wynn's death sentence and resentenced Wynn to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In May 2013, the circuit court summarily dismissed some of Wynn's postconviction claims. (CR. 1738-54.) An evidentiary hearing was held on the remaining claims in August 2014. In May 2015, the circuit court dismissed Wynn's postconviction petition in a 24-page order. (CR. 1738-54.) This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At Wynn's trial, the State's evidence showed that in the early morning hours of April 9, 1998, an employee of the Hardee's fast-food restaurant off McClellen Boulevard in Anniston opened the restaurant, discovered a pool of blood on the floor, and immediately telephoned police. Police discovered the body of Denise Bliss in the walk-in refrigerator. The forensic pathologist testified that Bliss had been severely beaten, that she had many defensive wounds, that 40 or more blows had been inflicted to her body, and that she died of multiple blunt-force trauma to her head and neck. Testimony established that Bliss had been beaten with a window washing device, commonly known as a squeegee, and a metal pipe that the restaurant used to compact its trash. Approximately $1,100 in currency, checks, and coins was missing from the restaurant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The State's evidence presented against Wynn was compelling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was testimony that Wynn had previously worked at Hardee's and that he had been fired by Bliss about two weeks before the murder. Two witnesses saw a black male very near Hardee's shortly before 10:00 p.m. on the night of the murder. At trial, one of those witnesses identified this male as Wynn. Randy Smith, a friend of Wynn's, testified that Wynn called him on the evening of April 8, 1998, and asked him for a ride to\n   Hardee's because, he told Smith, he was going to rob the place and get some money. However, Smith said, he could not get his parents' car that evening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Seven people testified that Wynn confessed to them that he robbed and killed a woman at the Hardee's restaurant. Brandy Mancil testified that in April 1998 she was living in a trailer park, that she was at Brandy Yott's trailer on April 8, 1998, and that Wynn was with them. Mancil said that Wynn left the trailer at around 10:00 p.m. that evening on his bicycle but that he came back to the trailer later that night. Wynn wanted to talk to her, she said, and he told her that he had \"robbed Hardee's\" and he showed her money that was in a \"blue like bank bag.\" A little later, she said, he told her and Yott that he had killed a woman. Mancil testified to what Wynn told her:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"He said that he walked into Hardee's and that he was going to rob them but he changed his mind so he walked out. And then he got halfway towards like Fun Fever [an arcade] and he turned around and he said, 'F--- it,' that he was going to go ahead and do it. And he went in and he hid behind the bathroom doors in the women's bathroom because I guess he knew they checked it before it closed. When the lady opened the door she didn't see him so I guess she went ahead and locked up. And he went in the back. And I can't remember, it was some kind of iron pole off of like a garbage disposal or something and he said that he had beat her with it. And then he -- he didn't -- he told her to give him all the money first and he said he wasn't going to kill her until she said, 'Greg, please don't kill me. I won't call the police.' And then after she said that he got scared and panicked I guess and just started beating her with that pole. And then he told me -- he said he didn't know if he had killed her or not. So if he didn't kill her he [dragged] her in the freezer and she would freeze to death before anyone found her the next day.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Trial R. 1107-08.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Yott testified that in the early morning hours of April 9, 1998, Wynn came to the trailer where she was living to see her roommate Brandy Mancil. Yott said that she overheard Wynn tell Mancil that he had robbed somebody and \"wanted to know if we wanted to go get a room.\" (Trial R. 1209.) Yott said that they went to a motel in Oxford, that Wynn paid for the room, and that Wynn gave her money to get beer. As Wynn was talking to them, she said, he told her and Mancil that he had \"killed a woman\" at Hardee's and that he had beaten her with a \"stick or something.\" (Trial R. 1213.) The next morning, she said, they walked over to a mall and Wynn paid for all the purchases that they made that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Anthony Roper testified that he is a general manager for Hardee's. He testified that for each nightly deposit a number is recorded from the highest bill denomination that is deposited. The reason, he said, \"is in case the deposit gets lost or if it's stolen it [is] something the police could use to find it.\" (Trial R. 832.) Reginald Elston testified that the day Wynn was arrested he was at Brandy's trailer with Wynn and Wynn asked him to give him change for a hundred dollar bill. That bill was traced to the daily deposit that had been prepared by Bliss on the night of the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A search was conducted of Wynn's house, which was approximately one mile from Hardee's. On April 11, 1998, police discovered torn checks made out to Hardee's and dated the day of the robbery/murder. Bloody clothing was also discovered at Wynn's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Wynn appeals the circuit court's denial of his petition for postconviction relief attacking his capital-murder conviction. Wynn initiated the proceedings and, according to Rule 32.3, Ala. R. Crim. P., bears the sole burden of pleading and proving that he is entitled to relief. Rule 32.3 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The petitioner shall have the burden of pleading and proving by a preponderance of the evidence the facts necessary to entitle the petitioner to relief. The state shall have the burden of pleading any ground of preclusion, but once a ground of preclusion has been pleaded, the petitioner shall have the burden of disproving its existence by a preponderance of the evidence.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"The standard of review this Court uses in evaluating the rulings made by the trial court is whether the trial court abused its discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Hunt v.

Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963), claim 45 days before the scheduled evidentiary hearing. Specifically, Wynn argues that, according to the Alabama Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Rhone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975131\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/900/455/\">\n    900 So.2d 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.2004), the only grounds that will support the denial of a motion to amend a postconviction petition are \"actual prejudice\" or \"undue delay.\" Wynn's proposed amendment was 56 pages in length and argued that exculpatory evidence, in the form of witness statements, had not been disclosed for several of the state witnesses. (CR. 1989-2045.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Rhone\n   </em>\n   , the appellant filed a pro se postconviction petition alleging that his trial counsel was ineffective. Two weeks later Rhone sought to amend that petition to add 10 additional allegations of ineffective-assistance-of-counsel. The circuit court entered no ruling on Rhone's motion to amend, and subsequently denied Rhone's petition. This Court affirmed the circuit court's actions on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rhone v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975106,8975068\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/900/443/\">\n    900 So.2d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.Crim.App.2004). The Alabama Supreme Court, in reversing this Court's decision, stated the following concerning amendments to postconviction petitions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"This Court's statements concerning the amendment of Rule 32 petitions are supported by the plain language of Rule 32.7, Ala. R. Crim. P. Subsection (b) of that rule unambiguously grants discretion to the trial court, providing that '[a]mendments to pleadings\n   <em>\n    may be permitted\n   </em>\n   at any stage of the proceedings prior to the entry of judgment.' (Emphasis added [in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Rhone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975106,8975068\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/900/443/\">\n    900 So.2d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.2004) ].) Guiding the exercise of that discretion is the mandate of subsection (d) that 'leave to amend\n   <em>\n    shall be freely granted\n   </em>\n   .' (Emphasis added [in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Rhone\n   </em>\n   ].) However, because the trial court has discretion to refuse an amendment to a Rule 32 petition, we must consider the nature of the factors that would provide a proper basis for such a refusal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"In\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Allen\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11402822\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/825/271/\">\n    825 So.2d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.2002),] this Court cited\n   <em>\n    Talley v.

The statements in\n   <em>\n    Talley\n   </em>\n   are consistent with this Court's prior decisions, as well as with Rule 32.7.

The right to amend is limited by the trial court's discretion to refuse to allow an amendment if the trial court finds that the petitioner has unduly delayed filing the amendment or that an amendment unduly prejudices the State. Such an exercise of the trial court's discretion would certainly be appropriate, for example, if, on the eve of an evidentiary hearing, a Rule 32 petitioner filed an amendment that included new claims of which the State had no prior notice and as to which it was not prepared to defend.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"We emphasize that the concepts of 'undue delay' and 'undue prejudice' as discussed in this opinion and in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Rhone\n   </em>\n   apply to the trial court's management of its docket and to the petitioner's attention to his or her case.''\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8311504\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/972/159/\">\n    972 So.2d at 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, the record shows that an evidentiary hearing was originally scheduled for May 5, 2014, but was continued in April 2014 on Wynn's motion. (CR. 1817.) On April 28, 2014, Wynn filed two separate motions to amend two different claims in his postconviction petition -- Claim II(5) and Claim III(G)(1). Both motions were granted. (CR. 1909; 1911.) On April 28, 2014, Wynn also moved the Court to order Hardee's to produce certain documents in connection with the case. (CR. 1867.) The evidentiary hearing that had been rescheduled for June 10, 2014, had been continued to August 25, 2014. (CR. 1959.) On July 11, 2014, Wynn moved to amend his postconviction petition with a new\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim, moved to substitute eyewitness-identification expert Jeffrey Neuschatz for Jennifer Dysart, moved for production of certain materials from the Anniston Police Department, the Weaver Police Department, and the District Attorney's Office, moved for a hearing on pending motions before the August 25, 2016, evidentiary hearing, and moved for the State to comply with its earlier motion to produce Hardee's documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The circuit court granted Wynn's motion for a status hearing and scheduled a hearing on the pending motions for August 8,\n   2014. (CR. 2131.) At this hearing, the State objected to Wynn's late attempt to amend his postconviction petition, arguing that it had to prepare for a substantial evidentiary hearing and it had to respond to all the motions that had been filed by Wynn in July 2014. The circuit court stated that it was concerned with the proximity to the evidentiary hearing and the State's ability or inability to prepare for amended allegations when it already had to prepare for the evidentiary hearing. (R. 144-45.) Wynn had subpoenaed 27 witnesses for the evidentiary hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On appeal, Wynn specifically relies on this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Broadnax v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8177488\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/987/631/\">\n    987 So.2d 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.Crim.App.2007), and argues that he attempted to amend his petition 45 days before the evidentiary hearing and, he says, this length of time was sufficient in\n   <em>\n    Broadnax\n   </em>\n   to result in no undue delay in the proceedings. In\n   <em>\n    Broadnax\n   </em>\n   , we stated: \"\n   <em>\n    Nothing\n   </em>\n   in the record indicate[d] that allowing the amendment would have further delayed the evidentiary hearing.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8177488\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/987/631/\">\n    987 So.2d at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). This Court also emphasized: \"It is important to note that this is not a case where\n   <em>\n    the petitioner had already filed multiple amendments\n   </em>\n   and was attempting to file yet another amendment.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8177488\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/987/631/\">\n    987 So.2d at 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). However, this Court did not hold that every petitioner is entitled to amend his petition when the amendment is filed 45 days before a scheduled evidentiary hearing. Each case must be assessed individually based on its unique facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Here, Wynn's postconviction petition had been pending for more than 11 years when Wynn sought to amend his petition a fifth time. It is clear from reviewing the record that the circuit court would have felt compelled to continue the scheduled evidentiary hearing if it had granted Wynn's fifth motion to amend his petition because of prejudice to the State's ability to defend the new claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Alternatively, the State argues that there was no merit to the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim Wynn sought to raise in his amendment; therefore, the State says, the circuit court did not err in declining to allow the amendment. This Court has held that the denial of a motion to amend a postconviction petition may be harmless depending on the issue or issues raised in the proposed amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8910956\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/911/40/#p46\">\n    911 So.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46 (Ala.Crim.App.2005) (\"Although the trial court erred when it denied the motion to file the third amended petition, that error was harmless. ...

At Wynn's trial, Luckado testified that he was driving past the Hardee's restaurant on the evening of April 8, 1998, at around 9:52 p.m., and saw a black male, whom he identified as Wynn, near the intersection very close to Hardee's. However, his daughter could not identify the man she saw that night. In his proposed amendment, Wynn asserted\n   that the State failed to disclose that the daughter never saw the man \"head on\" and that she saw only the side of his face, that the State failed to disclose that it was raining very hard that night, and that the State failed to disclose that both Luckado and his daughter said that the black male they saw was wearing a hat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, Wynn sought to amend his petition to allege that the State suppressed Ira Finch's statements that, he says, suggested that the identification procedure the police used was suggestive. Finch testified at Wynn's trial that he picked up a black male from the Weaver Trailer Park and drove him to the Howard Johnson's in Oxford early in the morning of April 9, 1998. Finch could not identify the man in the photographic lineup. Nor did Finch identify the man at Wynn's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Third, Wynn sought to amend his petition to assert that the State failed to disclose that Dame Dieye's identification of Wynn was suggestive because, he says, Dieye's pretrial statement shows that he was shown a photograph of Wynn before the photographic lineup was conducted. Dieye testified at Wynn's trial that he owns a men's clothing shop at Quintard Mall in Anniston and that on April 9, 1998, he opened his shop early because, he said, three black males were waiting for the shop to open. He identified one of the males as Wynn because, he said, \"He knew [him] very well ... because he was my customer. He used to come shopping a lot in my store.\" (Trial R. 1158.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Fourth, Wynn sought to amend his petition to allege that the State suppressed various exculpatory witness statements because, he said, numerous statements varied in some respect from the witnesses' trial testimony. This argument encompasses 29 pages of the amendment. For instance, Wynn made the following arguments:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"[Brandy] Mancil also stated during the interview that two rooms were rented at the Howard Johnson's and that 'the money' -- meaning the money taken during the Hardee's robbery -- was kept in the second room. But at trial, she said nothing about a second room.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (CR. 2005-06.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"[Carlos] McCallum told police that Wynn said that he had worn a covering over his head. However, at trial, McCallum testified that Wynn didn't tell him whether he was wearing any kind of disguise.

After carefully examining the proposed amendment, we wholeheartedly agree with the State that none of the alleged suppressed evidence was material to the outcome of Wynn's trial; therefore, the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   could not have been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Based on the unique facts presented in this case, we cannot say that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying Wynn's fifth motion to amend his postconviction petition filed 11 years after the original petition once the circuit court determined that the amendment would cause \"actual prejudice\" and \"undue delay.\" Moreover, based on the claims Wynn sought to raise in his amended petition we believe that if error did occur it was harmless. Wynn is due no relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Wynn next argues that the circuit court erred in summarily dismissing his claim that one of his trial attorneys, Randy Moeller, had an actual conflict of interest that, he says, resulted in the denial of his right to the effective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he argues that Moeller had a conflict of interest because he represented Michael Luckado, a State witness, in an unrelated case. As stated previously, Luckado testified that he saw Wynn near Hardee's on the evening of April 8, 1998, at around 10:00 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   When addressing this claim on direct appeal, we stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \"Shortly, before the trial was scheduled to begin, one of the appellant's attorneys realized that, in a completely unrelated case, he was representing one of the witnesses the State had indicated it intended to call in his case. The attorney consulted the Alabama State Bar and was advised that, pursuant to Rules 1.6 and 1.7 of the Alabama Rules of Professional Conduct, he should withdraw from the appellant's case. After hearing arguments on the attorney's motion to withdraw, the trial court denied the motion. In addition, it ordered the appellant's attorney to consult his notes regarding his representation of the witness and to advise the court if he had obtained information during that representation that he could use to cross-examine the witness when he testified in the appellant's case. The attorney did not subsequently advise the trial court that he had obtained any such information and, in fact, at the hearing on the motion for a new trial, he testified that he had not learned anything in his representation of the witness that he could use to cross-examine him. Furthermore, both the witness and the appellant waived any conflict of interest in this regard, and the appellant's other attorney cross-examined the witness during the trial. (R. 906-08.) Finally, at the hearing on the motion for a new trial, the attorney testified that he could not think of anything the appellant's other attorney should have asked the witness on cross-examination.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Wynn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9411229\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/804/1122/\">\n    804 So.2d at 1130-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In fact, the case involving the witness was a harassment prosecution that was not in any way related to the appellant's case. Also, there is no indication that the appellant's attorney actively represented conflicting interests and that he learned confidential information during his representation of the witness that would have been relevant to a cross-examination of the witness during the appellant's trial. Therefore, under the facts of this case, there was no conflict of interest, and the trial court properly denied defense counsel's\n   motion to withdraw from representation of the appellant.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Wynn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9411229\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/804/1122/\">\n    804 So.2d at 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   When dismissing this claim in Wynn's postconviction petition, the circuit court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \"This matter comes before the Court on the State of Alabama's Motion to Dismiss Claim III(G)(1)(a) pursuant to Rule 32.7(d) of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure.

The same is true in this case. Wynn did not make any offer of proof at the evidentiary hearing concerning this claim. Therefore, this issue was not properly preserved for appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Furthermore, regardless of any ruling on the State's motion in limine, we agree with the State that evidence of\n   Luckado's harassment conviction would not have been admissible to impeach Luckado. At the time of Wynn's trial Luckado had been convicted of one count of harassment in the district court, and that case was pending on appeal de novo to circuit court. The Alabama Supreme Court has stated the following concerning the effect of a de novo appeal on an underlying conviction: \"If ... the accused is entitled to a trial de novo in circuit court on an appeal of a district court conviction, the district court's judgment of conviction is vacated by such an appeal and the district court conviction is not admissible to prove that the accused did the act he was accused of.\"\n   <em>\n    Yancey v.

A vacated conviction is a nullity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Moreover, the alleged victim would not have been permitted to testify to specific instances of conduct by Luckado. As the circuit court stated, Rule 608(b), Ala. R. Evid., provides: \"Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness's character for truthfulness, other than conviction of crime as provided in Rule 609, may not be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness nor proved by extrinsic evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Wynn further argues that the circuit court's order on the motion in limine precluded him from presenting evidence of Luckado's bias in favor of the State. We agree with the State that the circuit court's order on the motion did not prevent Wynn from calling Luckado at the postconviction evidentiary hearing and asking him about any possible bias he might have had in favor of the State. As cited above, the order only precluded the harassment victim, M.L., from testifying at the postconviction hearing. Moreover, Wynn appealed de novo to the circuit court and was acquitted of the harassment charge. It seems obvious that Luckado had no deal with the State concerning the status of his harassment charge at the time of Wynn's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The circuit court's ruling on the State's motion in limine was not erroneous and was consistent with Alabama law.

In Wynn's case, this would have been after the State introduced the testimony of numerous witnesses who heard incriminating admissions made by Wynn during the hours following the murder, an evidence trail connecting Wynn to a large amount of cash -- including the Hardee's $100 bait bill -- immediately following the murder, and, most importantly, evidence that checks stolen from the Hardee's during the murder were found in Wynn's residence. Under such circumstances, the failure to not seek out an expert who would not 'tell [the jury] that a particular witness made an inaccurate\n   identification,' or who would say that under the facts of this case 'it is still possible to make a correct identification' was not unreasonable.
