In particular, Young was convicted of one count of first-degree burglary,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-7-5, Ala. Code 1975, and two counts of first-degree robbery,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-8-41, Ala. Code 1975. As a result, Young was sentenced to concurrent terms of 20 years in prison for each conviction. Davis was convicted of one count of first-degree burglary,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-7-5, Ala. Code 1975, two counts of first-degree robbery,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-8-41, Ala. Code 1975, and one count of attempted murder,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 13A-4-2 and\n   13A-6-2, Ala. Code 1975. Davis was sentenced to serve concurrent terms of 20 years in prison for the burglary and robbery convictions and a consecutive term of 20 years for the attempted-murder conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The relevant facts are as follows. During the trial and after numerous witnesses had testified, Juror S.H. informed the circuit court that she worked with Davis's wife, Joycelyn Davis. The circuit court asked S.H. if working with Mrs. Davis would affect her ability to be fair and impartial. S.H. indicated that it would be uncomfortable but that it would not affect her ability to be fair and impartial. At that point, the circuit court decided to leave S.H. on the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties concluded their cases and the jury was instructed on a Friday. The alternate jurors were released from service with no instructions. The jurors then began deliberating at 1 o'clock p.m. At 4 o'clock p.m., the court recessed for the weekend and instructed the jury to return at 1 o'clock p.m. the following Monday to resume deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When the jury returned that Monday, the jury foreperson sent a note to the circuit court indicating that there was an issue with S.H. The circuit court questioned S.H. about the issue, and S.H. informed the court that, although she had said that she could be fair and impartial, she actually could not because of her working relationship with Joycelyn Davis. She told that court that she \"absolutely cannot do this.\" (R. 378.) The circuit court then released S.H. from further jury duty. After releasing S.H., the circuit court informed the remaining jurors that it would try to contact an alternate juror and instructed the remaining jurors to stop deliberating and to take a recess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the recess, defense counsel moved for a mistrial arguing, among other things, that the alternate jurors had been released for the weekend with no instructions to refrain from talking about or investigating the case. The circuit court denied defense counsel's motion. Later, alternate Juror F.J. was contacted and indicated that she could return to the court the next day, Tuesday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On Tuesday when F.J. returned, the following occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"THE COURT: ... [F.J.,] you left us at the close of the case on Friday; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"[F.J.]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT: Since that time, in the event you have discussed the case with anyone or had anyone discuss it with you, are you able to set aside any information you have gained during that time and deliberate strictly on the evidence presented during the trial?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[F.J.]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"THE COURT: Any questions you want to ask me?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[F.J.]: No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"THE COURT: That's all I need to know.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (R. 389.) The circuit court then instructed the jury that F.J. would be returning and that, once F.J. returned, the jury must begin its deliberations anew. Defense counsel again objected to the substitution and moved for a mistrial arguing that it was improper to substitute an alternate juror who had not been instructed to avoid outside influences. The circuit court again denied counsel's motion. Thereafter, the jury found Young and Davis guilty on all charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, Young and Davis argue that the circuit court improperly substituted F.J. for S.H. According to Young and Davis, when the circuit court released F.J. on Friday, it failed to instruct her to refrain from discussing the case and/or allowing herself to be swayed by any outside\n   influences. They assert that, when the circuit court brought F.J. back to serve the next Tuesday, it failed to inquire as to what, if any, outside influences she may have had during the time in which she had been released. They argue that the circuit court merely made a cursory inquiry regarding whether F.J. believed she could set aside any information she had gained from discussions and decide the case based on the evidence presented at trial. Young and Davis contend that the procedure used to substitute F.J. for S.H. violated this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Peak v.

In\n   <em>\n    Lloyd Noland\n   </em>\n   -a civil, medical-malpractice case-the circuit court charged the jury and designated one of the jurors as an alternate.

The circuit court denied the motion for a mistrial, brought the alternate before the court, and inquired whether the alternate had spoken to anyone about the case. After learning that no discussion had taken place, the circuit court confirmed that the alternate 'could be an impartial juror; that she could weigh the evidence and testimony and be fair to both sides; and that she could render a true and impartial verdict.'\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8949609\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/906/157/\">\n    906 So.2d at 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The circuit court then assembled the reconstituted jury and instructed it to begin its deliberations anew. After deliberating for two hours, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Durham. The hospital subsequently filed a motion for a new trial, arguing for the first time that replacing the absent juror with the alternate after deliberations had begun violated Rule 47(b), Ala. R. Civ. P. The circuit court denied the motion, and the hospital appealed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Finding that the hospital's Rule 47(b) argument was not properly preserved for review on appeal, the Supreme Court considered only whether the circuit court erred in refusing to declare a mistrial in the face of the hospital's assertion that placing the alternate on the jury would disadvantage and unduly prejudice the hospital in light of the 'dynamic of the deliberation process.'\n   <em>\n    Lloyd Noland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8949609\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/906/157/\">\n    906 So.2d at 167-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In considering the issue presented, our Supreme Court stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \" 'We agree with the Hospital that the appellate courts of this State have never addressed the issue whether such a mid-deliberations substitution of an alternate juror is permissible. In\n   <em>\n    Cork v.

App. 1983), a regular juror was discharged immediately before the case was submitted to the jury for deliberations, and an alternate substituted. The appellant in that case had objected to the substitution on the basis that there was no necessity for excusing the original juror. The Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that the trial judge had acted within its sound discretion in excusing the juror. In\n   <em>\n    Toombs v.

App. 1999), a mid-deliberations substitution was made and, although the defendant moved for a mistrial on the ground that the substitution infringed on his right to a fair trial, he did not argue that ground on appeal. Rather, he argued on appeal only that the trial judge had committed reversible error by having an ex parte communication with the jury after it had begun its deliberations. Thus, the Court of Criminal Appeals held that the issue argued on appeal had not been preserved but volunteered that, even if it had, \"the trial judge's communication with the jury did not amount to reversible error.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11578959\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/739/550/\">\n    739 So.2d at 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \" 'Both parties have cited various cases from other jurisdictions on point, but most of those cases are inapposite because they rely on a particular rule of procedure of that jurisdiction and/or a particular state constitutional provision, whereas for the reasons explained, we cannot consider on this appeal the implications of Rule 47, Ala. R. Civ. P., or \u00a7 11 of the Alabama Constitution. A thorough survey of the cases from other jurisdictions is found in David B. Sweet, Annotation,\n   <em>\n    Propriety, Under State Statute or Court Rule, of Substituting State Trial Juror with Alternate After Case has been Submitted to Jury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20A.L.R.%204th%20711\">\n    88 A.L.R.4th 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). Both the Hospital and Durham discuss in their respective briefs a number of those cases, and it may be fairly said that with respect to the two main issues involved-whether a mid-deliberations substitution is error per se and whether such an error can be considered harmless-cases go both ways. All of the cases cited by the Hospital are criminal cases, including some death-penalty cases. In most of those cases, a state procedural rule or a state statute, or both, expressly mandated the discharge of alternate jurors once the regular jurors began their deliberations. For example, in\n   <em>\n    People v. Burnette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11945513\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/775/583/\">\n    775 P.2d 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Colo. 1989), and\n   <em>\n    State v.

R. Crim. P., contains substantially identical language. It may be contrasted with the less specific language of Rule 47(b), Ala. R. Civ. P., but this case does not require us to consider whether that difference in phrasing between the two rules is meaningful. Suffice it to say that in\n   <em>\n    Burnette\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bobo\n   </em>\n   the mandatory language controlled. Also implicated in both of those decisions were the respective state constitutional provisions relating to trial by jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \" '\n   <em>\n    In certain of the cases in which the court was unwilling to entertain a harmless-error analysis of a mid-deliberations substitution, it was important that the alternate juror had been discharged or otherwise allowed to resume his or her normal activities in the community before being recalled and that the alternate was not questioned about those activities or a present ability to serve on the jury when recalled\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Burnette\n   </em>\n   . Once we eliminate from the cases cited by the Hospital those relying, in whole or part, on violations of state criminal statutes; violations of state criminal procedural rules; violations of state constitutional provisions relating to the right to trial by jury; and/or the inadequacy of the questioning of the alternate juror and the instructions given the alternate and the remaining regular jurors, we find no case ordering a reversal of a judgment for a mid-deliberations substitution of an alternate juror solely because the substitution created an abstract disadvantage or prejudice to the objecting party or because of \"the dynamic of the deliberation process.\" As the court noted in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, although F.J. stated that she could set aside any discussions she had had concerning the case, the circuit court's failure to investigate the types of influences to which F.J. may have been subjected or the extent to which F.J. may have been influenced diminishes the weight that may be placed on F.J.'s answer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Potter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7433189\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/661/260/#p262\">\n    661 So.2d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262 (Ala. 1994) (jurors' visit to the scene of the crime to view the width of the street in a criminally-negligent-homicide case might have affected the jury's verdict, despite\n   testimony to the contrary);\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Troha\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7635464\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/462/953/\">\n    462 So.2d 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 1984) (juror's communication with his minister brother requesting scripture references during deliberations in rape defendant's prosecution warranted reversal because the misconduct might have influenced the verdict).

Rule 18.4(g)(2) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \"The court may retain alternate jurors after the jury retires to deliberate. The court must ensure that a retained alternate does not discuss the case with anyone until that alternate replaces a juror or is discarded.

The following Monday, the circuit court decided to release juror S.H. from further jury duty and informed the attorneys that the court would try to contact the released alternate jurors. Defense counsel then moved for a mistrial and asserted, among other grounds, that the circuit court had released the alternate jurors without instructing them not to discuss the case with anyone. (R. 383-84.) In footnote 1 of the main opinion, the Court states that the appellants failed to assert Rule 18.4, Ala. R. Crim. P., as a ground for a mistrial below. Although defense counsel did not specifically mention Rule 18.4(g)(2), the substance of defense counsel's argument was that the circuit court had released the alternate jurors without complying with certain provisions of Rule 18.4(g)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Regardless of whether strict compliance with Rule 18.4(g)(2) is necessary to avoid a mistrial when an alternate replaces a juror after the jury's deliberations have begun, I agree that the procedure used by the circuit court in this case did not meet the minimum requirements discussed in\n   <em>\n    Peak\n   </em>\n   , and that, therefore, the judgments are due to be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Young and Davis also argue that the circuit court's actions violated Rule 18.4, Ala. R. Crim. P. They, however, failed to assert Rule 18.4, Ala. R. Crim. P., as a ground below; therefore, this issue is not properly before this Court.
