Citing dissatisfaction with the quality of the work, the owner stopped making payments to the contractor and eventually filed suit, requesting specific performance and, in the alternative, damages. The contractor and the contractor's insurance company filed a motion for partial summary judgment, seeking dismissal of the owner's claims and dissolution of the contract as to any future performance owed. The trial court granted the motion for partial summary judgment, and the owner now appeals. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 29, 2005, Lynton O. Hester, IV, entered into a \"Turnkey Contract\" with Malcolm L. Burns d/b/a Burns Builders for the construction of a new home at a price of $303,287.00. By addendum, the parties amended the contract on January 11, 2006 to reflect a price of $322,287.00. In March 2006, financing of the home was closed, and construction began shortly thereafter. According to the contract, \"progress payments\" or \"draws\" would be made upon completion of certain tasks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Hester made the first payment in the amount of $18,447.46 on March 16, 2006, and he made a second payment in the amount of $96,686.10 on April 20, 2006. On June 22, 2006, Mr. Hester made a third payment in the amount of $88,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   However, issues subsequently arose between the parties concerning the trim stage of construction. Mr. Burns contended that Burns Builders had completed the trim phase of construction, and on May 10, 2007, Mr. Burns sent a letter to Mr. Hester demanding the payment due under the contract upon completion of the trim stage. In response, Mr. Hester refused to tender payment, citing dissatisfaction with the quality of the workmanship. The parties were unable to reach an agreement, and Mr. Hester ultimately filed a \"Petition for Breach of Contract and Damages.\" In the petition, Mr. Hester asserted \"that the work that has been performed is sub-standard\" and alleged \"defects\" in various\n   rooms of the house. Mr. Hester further alleged in the petition that he had to borrow money to finance the construction of the home; pay monthly interest on said loan; and rent an apartment to live in during the construction. He requested specific performance or, in the alternative, for judgment in an amount to compensate him for the damages incurred as a result of the alleged breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thereafter, Burns Builders and Mr. Burns d/b/a Burns Builders (hereafter collectively referred to as \"Burns Builders\") answered Mr. Hester's petition and filed a reconventional demand. In the reconventional demand, Burns Builders requested all sums owed under the contract, asserting that it had completed the trim work and that Mr. Hester had breached the contract by refusing to pay for the completion of the trim work and by continuing to claim that the work was defective. Burns Builders later filed a third party demand against Gemini Insurance Company (hereafter referred to as \"Gemini\"), Brown's Lumber &amp; Supply, LLC, and A Plus Drywall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 3, 2008, the subject property was foreclosed upon, and the property was subsequently purchased by William Barron at a sheriff's sale. Thereafter, Burns Builders filed a motion for summary judgment, requesting dismissal of the plaintiff's claims; dissolution of the contract as to any future performance owed by Burns Builders; and an award of the contractual sum of $96,686.10 with interest from the date of demand. Mr. Hester filed an opposition to the motion for summary judgment, attaching an affidavit and report from his expert, Philip Beard. The affidavit stated that Mr. Beard is a registered professional engineer, licensed in the State of Louisiana. In the affidavit, Mr. Beard explained that he completed an inspection of the subject property and prepared a formal report based upon that inspection. In pertinent part, Mr. Beard's affidavit states: \"In my opinion, the garage had the potential for future settlement caused by improperly compacted backfill.... Based on my inspection, there were numerous areas of construction and finish of the residence which did not meet the minimum standards or quality of workmanship as required by the contract.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following a hearing, the trial court granted Burns Builders' motion for summary judgment. The \"Partial Final Judgment\" dissolved the contract as to future performance; granted Burns Builders' reconventional demand, ordering Mr. Hester to pay $96,686.10 plus annual interest to Burns Builders; and dismissed, with prejudice, Mr. Hester's claims for specific performance and damages. On appeal, that judgment was reversed as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Burns filed a reconventional demand asserting that payment was owed pursuant to the contract. In order for Burns to succeed on his claim, he would have to prove that payment was owed. Under paragraphs five and ten [of the contract], Hester had the right to withhold payment if he believed the construction was defective. Whether there were defects is a question of fact for the trial court to determine. The scope of damages is another determination for the fact finder. If there were no defects, Burns would be entitled to payment. Hester's assertion that there were damages presents a question of material fact that should have been addressed by the trial court. Accordingly, summary judgment was inappropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Hester v.

In a supporting memorandum, they argued that a contractor's liability for failure to properly perform a building contract is governed by La.Civ.Code art. 2769 and that, in interpreting La.Civ.Code art. 2769, the courts have held that the owner is entitled to a reduction in price by the amount necessary to perfect or complete the work. Burns Builders and Gemini asserted that Mr. Hester had not demonstrated that he incurred costs to correct the alleged defects. Further, they contended that Mr. Hester no longer had to ability to prove his \"damages\" because he could not obtain bids or authorize repairs after he lost ownership of the house when it was foreclosed upon and sold at a sheriff's sale. Mr. Hester did not file an opposition to the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At a hearing on the motion for summary judgment, Mr. Hester moved for a continuance, which the trial court denied. On March 30, 2017, the trial court issued a \"Partial Final Judgment,\" which granted the motion for summary judgment; dismissed Mr. Hester's claims; and reserved Burns Builders' reconventional demand and third party demand. Mr. Hester appeals the judgment, asserting the following assignment of error: \"The trial court erred in granting Summary Judgment in favor of Burns Builders and dismissing the claims of the Appellant with prejudice[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As discussed above, Mr. Hester asserts that the trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment and dismissing his claims with prejudice. In briefing to this court (exhibit citation omitted), he argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [Mr.] Hester alleged several items of damages in his petition in addition to\n   seeking specific performance. Further, he specifically testified in his deposition as to the additional expenses he incurred including paying interest on the construction loan; paying for dirt work; paying attorney's fees for the closing of the construction loan and paying for the lot where the house was being built[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 966 is titled \"Motion for summary judgment; procedure\" and provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [A.] (3) After an opportunity for adequate discovery, a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if the motion, memorandum, and supporting documents show that there is no genuine issue as to material fact and that the mover is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   D. (1) The burden of proof rests with the mover. Nevertheless, if the mover will not bear the burden of proof at trial on the issue that is before the court on the motion for summary judgment, the mover's burden on the motion does not require him to negate all essential elements of the adverse party's claim, action, or defense, but rather to point out to the court the absence of factual support for one or more elements essential to the adverse party's claim, action, or defense. The burden is on the adverse party to produce factual support sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact or that the mover is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   An appellate court reviews a trial court's grant of summary judgment under the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review, using the same criteria that govern the trial court's consideration of whether summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Supreme Servs. &amp; Specialty Co., Inc. v.

This finding is not affected by the fact that the Plaintiff remains in the lawsuit in the capacity of the Defendant-in-Reconvention.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Weeks\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7051704\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/30/1163/\">\n     30 So.3d 1163\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Louisiana Civil Code Article 1986 is titled \"Right of the obligee\" and provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    Upon an obligor's failure to perform an obligation to deliver a thing, or not to do an act, or to execute an instrument, the court shall grant specific performance plus damages for delay if the obligee so demands.
