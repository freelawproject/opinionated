Jimenez does not dispute that he did, in fact, commit a traffic infraction. Instead, Jimenez challenges the legality of the City of Aventura's red light camera enforcement program, which includes the use of a third-party agent to review images from the City's red light cameras before sending them to City police to determine whether a traffic citation should be issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The issue before the Court involves the interpretation of the Mark Wandall Traffic Safety Program, which grants local governments' traffic enforcement officers the power to issue citations for traffic infractions captured by red light cameras.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ch. 2010-80, \u00a7 5, Laws of Fla.; \u00a7 316.0083(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2014). In addition to this grant of authority, section 316.0083(1)(a)\"does not prohibit a\n   <em>\n    review\n   </em>\n   of information\" from red light cameras by a local government's authorized agent before issuance of the traffic citation by a trained traffic enforcement officer. \u00a7 316.0083(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2014) (emphasis added). In this case, this Court is asked to determine the meaning of the word \"review,\" as used in section 316.0083(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Third District Court of Appeal held that the City did not violate the statute because the City provided its authorized agent with written guidelines to aid its review of the red light camera images, and the decision whether to issue a traffic citation based on the images was made by the City's traffic enforcement officer.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

(\"the Vendor\") to service the City's red light camera enforcement program.\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346594\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/158/#p160\">\n    211 So.3d at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The contract states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Vendor shall act as City's agent for the limited purpose of making an initial determination of whether the recorded images should be forwarded to an Authorized Employee to determine whether an infraction has occurred and shall not forward for processing those recorded images that clearly fail to establish the occurrence of an infraction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346594\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/158/#p160\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346594\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/158/#p160\">\n    at 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted). The Third District explained the Vendor's responsibilities under the contract:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Under the contract and its various amendments, the Vendor sorts the information and images generated by the system into two databases: a \"working\" database that the City police review to decide whether to issue a citation and a \"non-working\" database that the City police do not review for that purpose. Each image placed in the non-working database is reported, and the reason for placing the image in the non-working database is explained by the Vendor on a report screen. The report screen is periodically reviewed by the sergeant in charge of the City's review. The non-working database remains available and is occasionally accessed by the police for other investigations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Each month, approximately 5,000 images are sorted into the working database and 3,000 are sorted into the non-working database. The police sergeant who oversees the City's review testified that the City would be overwhelmed if it was required to review all images generated by the system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   To sort images, the Vendor conducts a review that includes (1) confirming workable images exist (and the camera did not simply misfire); (2) examining the images to verify the license plate of the subject vehicle is legible; (3) using the license plate number in an automated process to obtain the identifying information of the registered owner from the Florida Department of Motor Vehicles; (4) confirming the capture of date, time-of-day, speed, and timing-of-light data; (5) checking the \"A\" shot, which is a still photograph showing the vehicle approaching the intersection; (6) checking the \"B\" shot, which shows the vehicle in the intersection; and (7) checking the twelve-second video clip that shows the vehicle approaching and traveling\n   through the intersection. The Vendor can pause the video and view it frame by frame.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A representative of the Vendor testified that the Vendor's task when reviewing images was to filter out images that were \"useless.\" A clear example, she explained, is where a camera simply misfired and failed to record an image. Other examples are where the light displays green or where images fail to capture a vehicle's license plate number. These images were useless, she testified, because \"the police cannot do anything with them.\" But other images are determined to be useless based on the specific and detailed contract language and City guidelines.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346594\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/158/#p160\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346594\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/158/#p160\">\n    at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To aid the Vendor in the sorting process, the City provided the Vendor with a set of guidelines, known as the \"Business Rules Questionnaire.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346594\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/158/#p160\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346594\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/158/#p160\">\n    at 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Third District explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The guidelines govern the Vendor's task of checking the \"A\" and \"B\" shots and the video clip. The guidelines were created by a process in which the Vendor identified scenarios or decision points and suggested alternative solutions to the City. For the most part, the City selected one of the alternative solutions suggested by the Vendor, but in several instances, the City created its own solutions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   For example, guideline 4.1 concerns the line of demarcation, which means the boundary of the intersection. This is the line used to evaluate the \"A\" shot, which is the photograph that shows the vehicle approaching the intersection. In reviewing this guideline, one must keep in mind that if the front tires of a vehicle crossed the boundary and entered the intersection when the light is still displaying green, the vehicle obviously is not running a red light. Conversely, if the front tires had not yet reached this line when the light displays red, the vehicle would appear to be running a red light (assuming the vehicle does not immediately stop within the edge of the intersection and wait for a green light). All of the City intersections containing red light cameras have painted stop lines. The Vendor provided four alternative suggestions for the line of demarcation: (1) the stop line; (2) the prolongation of the curb; (3) the crosswalk; and (4) whichever line the tires will hit first. The City adopted the first suggestion: the line of demarcation is the painted stop line. A similar process was followed for the other guidelines.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346594\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/158/#p160\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346594\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/158/#p160\">\n    at 162-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As to the role of traffic enforcement officers in the City's red light camera program, the Third District explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The police officers assigned to red light camera enforcement access the working database by logging into the server using their own unique user identification and password. The officers decide to issue a citation based on the images in the same manner they decide to issue a roadside citation. If, after reviewing the photographs, video, and other information, the officer decides to issue a citation, the officer clicks the \"accept\" button on the screen. By doing so, the officer authorizes his or her electronic signature and badge number to appear on the notice and citation. The officer's review and determination in this regard is far from a mere rubber stamp. As the trial court expressly found, \"[o]f the images reviewed by the City's police officers, only between sixty-five percent (65%) and seventy percent (70%) are approved as a violation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346594\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/158/#p160\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346594\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/158/#p160\">\n    at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 316.640(1)(b)3., Fla.

The Rephrased Certified Question\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Jimenez argued to the county court and the Third District that the City's red light camera enforcement program amounted to an unlawful delegation of police powers by giving the Vendor \"unfettered discretion that exceeded the City's statutory authority to use an agent to 'review' images\" under section 316.0083(1)(a).\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346594\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/158/#p160\">\n    211 So.3d at 159-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this Court, Jimenez does not pursue his unlawful delegation argument and argues instead that the City's red light camera enforcement program (A) unlawfully exceeds the authority\n   conferred upon the City by the Legislature because \"review\" under section 316.0083(1)(a) is limited to determining whether images from red light cameras are \"complete and usable\"; and (B) is unconstitutional because it violates the uniformity principle set forth in chapter 316.

Whether the City Exceeded its Statutory Authority in Contracting with the Vendor to Review the Red Light Camera Images\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Jimenez argues that the City's red light camera program exceeds the authority granted by the Legislature with respect to the meaning of the word \"review\" as used in section 316.0083(1)(a). Specifically, Jimenez asserts that the word \"review\" as used in section 316.0083(1)(a) is limited to ensuring that the images from the red light camera are complete and usable, as opposed to the review conducted by the Vendor in this case, which, according to Jimenez, involves making a preliminary determination as to whether a traffic infraction has occurred. While Jimenez argues in favor of a narrow construction of the word \"review,\" the City and the State maintain that the delegation of authority authorized by the Legislature in using the term \"review\" is broader and includes an evaluation of not only whether the images are complete and usable, but whether they meet certain guidelines, as provided by the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"In matters of statutory construction, we have repeatedly recognized that legislative intent is the polestar that guides the Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Sch.

Section 316.0083(1)(a), in its entirety, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   For purposes of administering this section, the department, a county, or a municipality may authorize a traffic infraction enforcement officer under s. 316.640 to issue a traffic citation for a violation of s. 316.074(1) or s. 316.075(1)(c)1. A notice of violation and a traffic citation may not be issued for failure to stop at a red light if the driver is making a right-hand turn in a careful and prudent manner at an intersection where right-hand turns are permissible. A notice of violation and a traffic citation may not be issued under this section if the driver of the vehicle came to a complete stop after crossing the stop line and before turning right if permissible at a red light, but failed to stop before crossing over the stop line or other point at which a stop is required. This paragraph does not prohibit a review of information from a traffic infraction detector by an authorized employee or agent of the department, a county, or a municipality before issuance of the traffic citation by the traffic infraction enforcement officer. This paragraph does not prohibit the department, a county, or a municipality from issuing notification as provided in paragraph (b) to the registered owner of the motor vehicle involved in the violation of s. 316.074(1) or s. 316.075(1)(c)1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00a7 316.0083(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2014). Under the statute, the review contemplated is \"of information from a traffic infraction detector,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8189580\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/986/1260/#p1265\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , which, as section 316.003(87) makes clear, consists of \"photographic or electronic images or streaming video.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8189580\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/986/1260/#p1265\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 316.003(87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Reading the provision in its entirety, we conclude that section 316.0083(1)(a) allows a local government's authorized agent to review images from red light cameras for any purpose short of making the probable cause determination to issue a traffic citation. By including two specific examples of what is not a traffic infraction immediately before stating that an authorized agent can review the information captured by red light cameras, which includes photographs and video, it is clear the Legislature contemplated that the agent would conduct an initial review of those photographs or video or both, before a traffic enforcement officer determines whether probable cause exists to issue a traffic citation. There is simply no indication that the Legislature intended the narrow definition of the word \"review\" advanced by Jimenez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Jimenez makes two separate statutory arguments in support of his interpretation of the word \"review,\" both of which we reject. First, Jimenez refers to an earlier version of the bill proposed during the bill drafting process in which a traffic citation could have been issued based on \"a signed statement by a specifically trained technician employed by the agency or its contractor that, based on inspection of photographs or other recorded images,\" the driver of the vehicle committed a traffic infraction. Fla. HB No. 325, \u00a7 3 (filed Nov. 6, 2009) (proposed \u00a7 316.0083(1)(d) ). Even if we were to consider an earlier version of the bill proposed during the bill drafting process, we conclude that it would not help Jimenez because the enacted version retained the use of authorized agents but did not allow those agents to determine whether a citation should be issued. In other words, although the Legislature authorized local governments to delegate initial review responsibilities to an agent, the Legislature clearly intended that the ultimate authority to issue a citation would remain with a trained traffic enforcement officer. Thus, this argument does not support Jimenez's narrow interpretation of the word \"review\" in section 316.0083(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Second, Jimenez notes that a single sentence in a legislative staff analysis of the\n   Wandall Act references the existing statutory scheme for the enforcement of toll violations, which includes the use of cameras.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fla. H.R. Policy Comm. on Roads, Bridges &amp; Ports, HB 325 (2010) Staff Analysis 3 (Jan. 8, 2010) (\"Cameras are permitted by current Florida law to enforce violations of payment of tolls.\") (citing \u00a7 316.1001(2)(d), Fla. Stat. (2009) ). The toll violation statutory scheme authorized \"a toll enforcement officer to issue\" citations for toll violations and allowed toll operators to employ \"independent contractors or designate employees as toll enforcement officers.\" \u00a7 316.1001(2)(a), Fla. Stat. (2009) ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8189580\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/986/1260/#p1265\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 316.640(1)(b)2.b. From that brief reference, Jimenez continues on his journey of statutory construction by pointing to a Florida Administrative Code rule that limited the toll enforcement officers or their designees to \"review[ing] captured photographic images ... to ensure accuracy and data integrity.\" Fla. Admin Code R. 14-100.002(3). Jimenez asserts that this administrative rule's definition of the word \"review,\" which is limited to ensuring accuracy, supports his interpretation of the word \"review\" in section 316.0083(1)(a). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The reference to the toll violation statute in the staff analysis for the Wandall Act was one line in a comprehensive eleven-page analysis, which simply states that cameras are currently used to enforce tollbooth violations; the toll violation statutory scheme was not otherwise mentioned in the staff analysis. Further, the word \"review\" does not appear in the toll enforcement statute. Lastly, the administrative rule Jimenez cites does not even pertain to the statute at issue in this case. We thus conclude that this argument does not support Jimenez's narrow interpretation of the word \"review\" in section 316.0083(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Ultimately, Jimenez cannot escape the fact that the term \"review,\" as used in section 316.0083(1)(a), indicates some evaluative component, and there is no indication that the Legislature intended the most restrictive version of the term in the context of this statute. We therefore hold that section 316.0083(1)(a) authorizes a local government to contract with a private third-party vendor to review and sort information from red light cameras, in accordance with written guidelines provided by the local government, before sending that information to a trained traffic enforcement officer who determines whether probable cause exists and a citation should be issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In this case, the City provided the Vendor with written guidelines to use when reviewing and sorting the images before sending to a trained traffic enforcement officer who determines whether probable cause exists and a citation should be issued. Thus, the City's red light camera enforcement program does not exceed the authority granted in section 316.0083(1)(a). We now turn to address Jimenez's argument regarding uniformity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Uniformity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Jimenez also argues that the City's adoption and use of its own set of standards, or guidelines, for determining whether a traffic infraction has occurred violates the uniformity principle set forth in chapter 316.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 316.002, .007, Fla. Stat. (2014). Essentially, Jimenez complains that the City's red light camera enforcement program may be underinclusive because there is a possibility that\n   other motorists may have committed a red light camera violation but did not receive a citation because, based on the City's guidelines, the images were sorted into the non-working queue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The City explained that it often makes decisions regarding the enforcement of traffic infractions, including where to place red light cameras, as they are not placed at every intersection. Likewise, even without the use of red light cameras, traffic enforcement officers cannot be present at every intersection. As a result, there will inevitably be traffic infractions that go undetected and uncited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Importantly, Jimenez makes no suggestion of discriminatory enforcement. Rather, he seems to assert that it would be fairer if the Vendor sent all usable images to the City for review. We disagree. This is no different than a traffic enforcement officer on the road stopping and citing one individual for exceeding the speed limit, while not citing others doing the same. Indeed, as Judge Wells cogently stated in her special concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   The record in this case establishes that at most the servicing agent has been accorded only the ministerial authority to screen and cull those images which, pursuant to a rigid set of guidelines, clearly show no possible violation of the traffic laws; it is the traffic infraction officer alone who determines from the population of possible violators, those who will be subject to prosecution. This, in my opinion, is neither a violation of the law nor a matter about which those cited for a violation have authority to complain. Put another way, the real issue here is that some individuals who may have violated traffic regulations may be screened out of the process because the images of their vehicles were not sent to a traffic infraction enforcement officer to determine if a violation has occurred. This argument is no different than that made by an individual issued a speeding ticket who complains that other speeders also were not ticketed. In short, the fact that [the Vendor] determines certain images will not be forwarded-i.e., that some drivers will not be ticketed-because images taken of their vehicles show that they have not exceeded set guidelines, does not amount to determining whether those drivers who potentially exceed those guidelines have violated the law. That determination, as the record before us confirms, is left solely to traffic infraction enforcement officers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346594\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/158/#p160\">\n    211 So.3d at 173-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wells J., specially concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Jimenez's arguments that the City's red light camera enforcement program (A) unlawfully exceeds the grant of authority in section 316.0083(1)(a), and (B) violates the uniformity principle set forth in chapter 316, are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Legislature has expressly authorized local governments to allow traffic enforcement officers to issue citations for traffic infractions captured by red light cameras. As part of this express authorization, the Legislature has permitted a local government's agent to review information from red light cameras for any purpose short of making the probable cause determination as to whether a traffic infraction was committed. We thus hold that section 316.0083(1)(a) authorizes a local government to contract with a private third-party vendor to review and sort information from red light cameras, in accordance with written guidelines provided by the local government, before sending that information to a trained traffic enforcement officer, who determines whether probable\n   cause exists and a citation should be issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Accordingly, we answer the rephrased certified question in the affirmative and approve the decision of the Third District in\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   . We also approve the decision of the Second District in\n   <em>\n    Trinh\n   </em>\n   and disapprove the decision of the Fourth District in\n   <em>\n    Arem\n   </em>\n   to the extent it is inconsistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   It is so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   LABARGA, C.J., and QUINCE, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   LEWIS, J., concurs in result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   CANADY, J., concurs specially with an opinion, in which POLSTON and LAWSON, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The question that was certified by the Third District asks:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n    Does the review of red light camera images authorized by section 316.0083(1)(a), Florida Statutes (2014), allow a municipality's vendor, as its agent, to sort images to forward to the law enforcement officer, where the controlling contract and City guidelines limit the Vendor to deciding whether the images contain certain easy-to-identify characteristics and where only the law enforcement officer makes the determinations whether probable cause exists and whether to issue a notice of violation and citation?\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    <em>\n     Jimenez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346594\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/158/#p160\">\n     211 So.3d at 171\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The Third District also ruled upon two other questions, which it certified to be of great public importance:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n    Is it an illegal delegation of police power for the vendor to print and mail the notices and citation, through a totally automated process without human involvement, after the law enforcement officer makes the determinations that probable cause exists and to issue a notice of violation and citation?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n    Does the fact that the citation data is electronically transmitted to the Clerk of the Court from the vendor's server via a totally automated process without human involvement violate section 316.650(3)(c), Florida Statutes (2014), when it is the law enforcement officer who affirmatively authorizes the transmission process?\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346594\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/158/#p160\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346594\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/211/158/#p160\">\n     at 171-72\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Nothing in the text or context suggests that a narrow reading should be imposed on \"review.\" The statute in no way precludes a local government from contracting with a third-party vendor to provide assistance in screening images from red light cameras in any way the local government sees fit other than authorizing the vendor to issue citations. On this point, the critical issue is not the details of the relationship between the local government and the vendor. Rather, the dispositive point is that the local government conforms to the requirement that only law enforcement officers and traffic infraction enforcement officers-rather than employees of a vendor-may issue traffic citations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   POLSTON and LAWSON, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
