After conducting a de novo review we reverse the trial court and hereby render judgment in favor of Trey Coker granting his Exception of No Cause of Action for the alleged antitrust violations raised by Gene Haymon in his Original Answer and First Amended Answer, Reconventional Demand, Third Party Demand, and Cross Claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The basis of Gene Haymon's antitrust claim is that Coker and Clary conspired to defame Gene Haymon in order to restrain the business of his son, David Haymon, as a State Farm Insurance agent. Gene asserts that he \"need only allege the existence of an agreement between Mr. Coker and Mr. Clary that was knowingly entered into\" and he maintains he has gone even further by alleging that \"the conspiracy between Mr. Coker and Mr. Clary injured the competition in the Leesville market by\n   <em>\n    preventing Gene from practicing\n   </em>\n   [as a part-time agent with his son]\" (emphasis added). He also alleges as a basis for his antitrust claim \"that the conspiracy between Mr. Coker and Mr. Clary\n   <em>\n    prevented him from making money as a State Farm sub-agent\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added). Additionally, Gene states at paragraph 120 of his \"First Amended Answer ...\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Coker's conspiracy with the Clary's and their private investigator(s) to defame Gene and David to increase Coker's State Farm business and 'help' Clary's lawsuit violates La. antitrust laws and has had the effect of reducing competition in the Vernon Parish insurance market. The Coker-Clarys anti-trust violations have caused, and continue to cause, great emotional harm to Gene and damage his reputation. Coker and the Clarys are thus solidarily liable for conspiracy to defame Gene in order to unreasonably restrain David's trade in violation of La. R.S. 54:122 (sic).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In his Third-Party Demand Gene Haymon alleges \"State Farm's policy holders have contracts with State Farm, not State Farm's agents.\" Taking this allegation as truthful, as we must for these purposes, this demonstrates that there can be no antitrust injury to consumers that could result from the alleged conspiracy between Coker and Clary because any insurance contracts entered into by consumers will be with State Farm and not with any agent whose trade is allegedly restrained. Additionally, some three years ago when Gene Haymon sought to dismiss the antitrust claims asserted against him by the Clarys he maintained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   There is no way Plaintiffs can plausibly allege customers cannot choose what insurance products they wish to purchase from whichever insurance company, or that consumers are harmed in any way in their choice and ability to purchase insurance policies from State Farm or any other insurer. Consumers could and can get insurance policies from any number of sources.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Gene Haymon also alleges, in paragraph 108 of his First Amended Answer:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   By 2012, State Farm's saturation policy had made it harder for individual agents to generate premiums. State Farm also eliminated many of the financial products agents could sell and reduced the percentage of agents' take on premiums charged on the remaining products. State Farm also greatly increased its premiums to cover for its devastating losses from weather-related events, thereby causing State Farm to price itself out of the market for a large number of budget-minded customers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Additionally, and even more telling, is Gene Haymon's allegation in paragraph 109 which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Additionally, David [Haymon] and Clary both had to overcome competition by State Farm's two other Vernon Parish agents, including third party defendant Trey Coker, as well as agents from surrounding parishes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Phrased another way, this last paragraph, taken as true, states that David Haymon, Clary and Coker all had to compete for consumers' business with each other and two other State Farm agents in Vernon Parish and an unspecified number of agents in surrounding parishes. Moreover, all of these State Farm Agents were competing against all other insurance companies' agents in the area for the local consumers' business. Thus, the alleged conspiracy to defame David and hurt his and/or Gene's bottom line presents no harm to consumers who are shopping for insurance in a very competitive market. This allegation belies any conceivable harm to competition or to consumers and indeed indicates that the alleged conspiracy did not and could not harm consumers. It directly contradicts the conclusory assertion that the alleged conspiracy \"had the effect of reducing competition in the\n   Vernon parish insurance market.\" The antitrust laws\n   <em>\n    were not enacted for the protection of competitors\n   </em>\n   but were instead enacted\n   <em>\n    to protect competition\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plaquemine Marine, Inc. v.

Gene Haymon's allegations clearly state that the insurance consumers in Vernon Parish are not locked in to any specific brand of insurance nor are they in any way locked in to dealing with any particular State Farm agent if they desire to contract insurance with State Farm.

For the reasons stated we reverse the trial court's ruling and hereby grant Trey Coker's exception of no cause of action to Gene Haymon's claims based on antitrust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We also find the trial court erred in considering any of the allegations contained in the proposed \"First Supplemental and Amending Amended Answer, Reconventional Demand, Third Party Demand and Cross Claim\" and we cannot and have not considered it in our de novo review of this matter. On December 29, 2017, Gene Haymon filed a \"Motion for Leave to File First Supplemental and Amending Amended Answer, Reconventional Demand, Third Party Demand and Cross Claim.\" Attached to the motion as an Exhibit was Gene Haymon's proposed \"First Supplemental and Amending\" pleading. The trial court issued a rule to show cause on January 18, 2018, concerning this Motion for Leave to File setting a hearing date on the motion for February 7, 2018. The court held the hearing on February 7, 2018, and because of the time-consuming nature of the matter continued to hear various motions and exceptions on the next day, February 8, 2018. During the course of the hearing on February 8, 2018, the trial court stated from the bench that it would grant Gene Haymon's Motion for Leave to File his proposed \"First Supplemental and Amending Amended\" pleading. As the hearing on Coker's exceptions progressed the trial judge, over multiple objections by opposing counsel, considered both the earlier pleading, which had been filed of record in October 2017, and the later\n   <em>\n    proposed\n   </em>\n   \"Supplemental Amending Amended ...\" pleading which had not been filed in the record. By the date of the hearing the \"First Supplemental and Amending Amended Answer, Reconventional Demand, Third Party Demand and Cross Claim\" had not been officially and properly filed in the record and had not been served on the adverse parties. Gene Haymon filed his First Amended Answer, Reconventional Demand, Third Party Demand, and Cross Claim by presenting it to\n   the clerk's office for filing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   accompanied by the filing fee and costs for service, but by the date of the hearing he had done no such filing of the \"First Supplemental and Amending Amended Answer ...\" nor had he paid any filing fee or costs for service nor directed the clerk to serve the pleading.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   It is settled that a pleading is not \"filed in an action\"\n   <strong>\n    until it has been delivered to the clerk\n    <em>\n     for that purpose\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ; therefore, a party obliged to file a pleading within a time limitation must insure actual delivery, since it is the time when the clerk receives actual delivery of the pleading that is determinative of whether a pleading has been timely filed.\n   <em>\n    Squatrito v.

This Order was signed on October 30, 2017. On October 31, 2017, counsel for Gene Haymon sent a copy of the pleading to the clerk of court accompanied by a cover letter along with a fee of $500.00 to cover the cost of filing and service. That pleading was stamped by the clerk of court dated October 31, 2017, as the date filed in the record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
