State\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12671277\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/246/1032/\">\n    246 So.3d 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.Crim.App.2014). On February 24, 2015, the Alabama Supreme Court granted Kelley's petition for a writ of certiorari to review whether this Court had jurisdiction to affirm his sexual-torture conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 6, 2015, the Alabama Supreme Court issued an opinion in which it determined that this Court did not have jurisdiction to affirm Kelley's conviction for sexual torture.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Ex parte Kelley\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12671290\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/246/1068/\">\n    246 So.3d 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.2015). Specifically, the Alabama Supreme Court determined that the circuit court had not pronounced a sentence for Kelley's sexual-torture conviction; therefore, there had been no judgment of conviction under \u00a7 12-22-130, Ala.Code 1975, from which to appeal. 246 So.3d at 1071. Because there was no judgment of conviction relating to the sexual-torture charge, any appeal from that charge was not ripe. 246 So.3d at 1071. Consequently, this Court lacked jurisdiction to affirm that conviction. 246 So.3d at 1071.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After determining that this Court lacked jurisdiction to affirm Kelley's conviction for sexual torture, the Alabama Supreme Court \"reverse[d] the Court of Criminal Appeals' judgment insofar as it affirm[ed] Kelley's sexual-torture conviction, and ... remand[ed] the case for proceedings consistent with [its] opinion.\" 246 So.3d at 1076. In accordance with the Alabama Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Ex parte Kelley\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12671290\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/246/1068/\">\n    246 So.3d 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.2015), this Court's judgment in\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Kelley v. State\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12671277\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/246/1032/\">\n    246 So.3d 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.Crim.App.2014), is vacated to the extent it addressed and affirmed Kelley's conviction for sexual torture, and Kelley's appeal from that conviction is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   WELCH, KELLUM, BURKE, and JOINER, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
