After the parties entered into a settlement, the claimant sought to reopen his claim by filing an amended claim. The workers' compensation judge concluded that the claimant failed to prove that the settlement should be set aside or modified. Subsequently, the claimant filed a motion to amend judgment and motion for new trial, and the workers' compensation judge denied both motions. The claimant now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 9, 2015, the claimant, Carey Dorsey, filed a \"Disputed Claim for Compensation\" in which he alleged that he injured his neck and back on September 21, 2011, while employed by ProTemp Staffing Solutions, Inc. (\"ProTemp\"). In particular, Mr. Dorsey asserted that the injury occurred when he was attempting to open a panel on a \"chipper,\" which was subsequently engaged and jerked his body. Mr. Dorsey contended that his wage benefits terminated or were reduced on September 7, 2015, and that ProTemp should be assessed penalties, attorney fees, court costs, and legal interest, as well as a penalty for the failure to have workers' compensation insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ProTemp answered and, in pertinent part, denied that Mr. Dorsey sustained an injury and denied that he was either temporarily or permanently disabled. In its answer, ProTemp stated that, at the time of Mr. Dorsey's alleged injury, it was insured by the Louisiana Safety Association of Timbermen. Additionally, ProTemp provided that compensation had been paid to Mr. Dorsey from September 21, 2011, the date of the alleged accident, until September 7, 2015. The record indicates that around September 7, 2015, the Louisiana Safety Association of Timbermen filed for bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Subsequently, Mr. Dorsey filed a \"Motion and Order to File Amended and Supplemental Disputed Claim for Compensation.\" Mr. Dorsey alleged that, at the time of the injury, he had been \"hired by ProTemp and loaned to defendant, Boise Cascade Company (\"Boise Cascade\") to perform work as a temporary employee.\" He further contended that, \"[a]s the borrowing employer and/or the statutory employer, Boise Cascade is liable for workers' compensation indemnity benefits to Carey Dorsey.\" The workers' compensation judge granted Mr. Dorsey's motion. Mr. Dorsey and Boise Cascade ultimately entered into a consent judgment, which stipulated that Boise Cascade was the \"special employer\" or \"borrowing employer\" on the date of the alleged accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A hearing on Mr. Dorsey's claims was scheduled for November 16, 2016. However, prior to the start of the hearing, counsel notified the workers' compensation judge that the parties had reached an agreement to settle, and a compromise settlement was read into the record before the workers' compensation judge. Mr. Dorsey was represented by counsel, Gregory P. Marceaux, at this hearing. The workers' compensation judge asked Mr. Dorsey whether he had heard the terms and conditions of the settlement and whether he agreed with them, and Mr. Dorsey responded affirmatively to both questions. Thereafter, Mr. Dorsey, ProTemp, and Boise Cascade filed a \"Joint Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice,\" which was granted by the workers' compensation judge. The parties then submitted signed compromise settlement documents and a \"Joint Petition for Compromise Settlement of Workers' Compensation Claim\" to the workers' compensation judge. On January 17, 2017, the workers' compensation judge signed the parties' \"Request for Compromise or Lump Sum Settlement,\" as well as an \"Order of Approval of Compromise Settlement\" and an \"Order of Dismissal.\" The \"Order of Approval of Compromise Settlement\" provided, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   EMPLOYER,\n   <strong>\n    PROTEMP STAFFING SOLUTIONS, INC.\n   </strong>\n   , and DEFENDANT,\n   <strong>\n    BOISE CASCADE COMPANY\n   </strong>\n   , shall be fully, finally and forever released and relieved from any and all further liability from any claims for compensation, damages as they relate to this\n   workers' compensation claim, attorney's fees, travel expenses, penalties, medical expenses, and weekly workers' compensation indemnity or monthly supplemental earnings benefits or any other such claims arising heretofore which may hereafter arise out of the Louisiana Worker's Compensation laws in any manner connected with or growing out of any accident or injury occurring prior to the date of this Order, except for the obligation to comply with the terms of this Settlement Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 2, 2017, appearing in proper person, Mr. Dorsey filed an \"Amended Disputed Claim for Compensation,\" which again named ProTemp and Boise Cascade and alleged that Mr. Dorsey had injured his neck and back on September 21, 2011. In the claim, Mr. Dorsey alleged that \"Wage benefits terminated or reduced on 09/07/2015\" and \"Medical benefits terminated 09-07-2015.\" He also contended: \"I have not received any temporary total disability benefits, cash or medical treatment and services since 09-07-2015. Comproise [sic] lump sum. And not seen by physican [sic] Dr. Hodges since 8-2015[.] Status TTD still unable to work. In treatment.\" ProTemp and Boise Cascade both filed exceptions of res judicata, motions to enforce the settlement, and motions for sanctions. On April 12, 2017, the workers' compensation judge held a hearing to address Mr. Dorsey's request. At the hearing, Mr. Dorsey argued that the settlement should be set aside on the basis of fraud or misrepresentation. After taking the matter under advisement, the workers' compensation judge issued a ruling, concluding that Mr. Dorsey had failed to prove that the settlement should be set aside or modified; denying Mr. Dorsey's motion to set aside or vacate the settlement; and held that the exceptions filed by ProTemp and Boise Cascade were rendered moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Subsequently, on April 26, 2017, Mr. Dorsey filed a \"Motion to Amend Judgment and for New Trail [sic].\" In response, ProTemp and Boise Cascade filed exceptions of res judicata, motions for sanctions, and memoranda in opposition to Mr. Dorsey's motions. After a hearing on June 12, 2017, the workers' compensation judge denied Mr. Dorsey's motions, as well as ProTemp's and Boise Cascade's exceptions of res judicata and motions for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Dorsey thereafter appealed, and ProTemp and Boise Cascade moved to dismiss the appeal. A panel of this court issued a limited remand of the appeal in order for the workers' compensation judge to conduct a contradictory hearing and enter a ruling as to whether Mr. Dorsey timely fax-filed his motion for new trial.\n   <em>\n    Dorsey v.

He further asserts that the workers' compensation judge erred in approving the settlement agreement without adequate assurance that Mr. Dorsey was aware that the settlement was a compromise of his claim. Mr. Dorsey alleges that the workers' compensation judge's actions constitute fraud and \"Ill Practice\" and allowed the \"Defendants To Committ [sic] Unlawful Practice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The procedural requirements for approval of workers' compensation settlement agreements are found in La.R.S. 23:1272, which provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A. A lump sum or compromise settlement entered into by the parties under R.S. 23:1271 shall be presented to the workers' compensation judge for approval through a petition signed by all parties and verified by the employee or his dependent, or by recitation of the terms of the settlement and acknowledgment by the parties in open court which is capable of being transcribed from the record of the proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   B.

Though Mr. Dorsey suggests that the workers' compensation judge erred by not discussing the settlement with him, the workers' compensation judge was not required to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cormier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9362544\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/841/1032/#p1037\">\n    841 So.2d 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, we find that there is no merit in Mr. Dorsey's assertions that the workers' compensation judge erred by not further inquiring into his understanding of the terms of the settlement and by not more extensively ensuring that he understood that the settlement was a compromise of his claim, thereby resulting in ill practices. Moreover, we observe that Mr. Dorsey has not otherwise presented evidence of \"fraud or misrepresentation made by any party\" so as to justify setting aside or modifying the settlement pursuant to La.R.S. 23:1272(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Penalties, attorney fees, and legal interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Next, Mr. Dorsey alleges that the workers' compensation judge erred by not assessing a penalty for ProTemp's failure to have workers' compensation insurance.

Mr. Dorsey argues that the workers' compensation judge erred in allowing ProTemp and Boise Cascade \"To Ajudicate [sic] The Permanency of [his] Temporary Total Disability[.]\" Louisiana Revised Statutes 23:1271 (emphasis added) provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [A.] A lump sum payment or compromise settlement in exchange for full and final discharge and release of the employer, his insurer, or both from liability under this Chapter shall be allowed only:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (3) Upon the expiration of six months after termination of temporary total disability.\n   <em>\n    However, such expiration may be waived by consent of the parties.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The \"Joint Petition for Compromise Settlement of Workers' Compensation Claim\" states: \"Movers waive the six month waiting period of L.A.-R.S. 23:1271.\" Additionally, a completed \"Waiver of Six Month Waiting Period for Joint Settlement and Compromise\" was also submitted to the workers' compensation judge. The waiver provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    CAREY DORSEY\n   </strong>\n   ... who after being duly sworn did depose and state:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   That he is the petitioning\n   <strong>\n    EMPLOYEE\n   </strong>\n   in these proceedings; that it has been explained to him that pursuant to La. R.S. 23:1271 a lump sum payment or compromise settlement in exchange for full and final discharge and release of the EMPLOYER,\n   <strong>\n    PROTEMP STAFFING SOLUTIONS, INC.\n   </strong>\n   , and DEFENDANT,\n   <strong>\n    BOISE CASCADE COMPANY\n   </strong>\n   , from liability under the worker's compensation laws of the State of Louisiana, shall be allowed only upon the expiration of six months after the termination of payment of benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   That he fully understands and intelligently waives the six month waiting period which is required under Louisiana law pursuant to La. R.S. 23:1271.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Considering the foregoing, we detect no error in the workers' compensation judge's conclusion. Rather, as evidenced above, the six month waiting period for a lump sum payment or compromise settlement after termination of temporary total disability was waived by consent of Mr. Dorsey, ProTemp, and Boise Cascade in accordance with La.R.S. 23:1271. Therefore, we find no merit in Mr. Dorsey's assignment in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Entry of the settlement at a hearing on the merits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Mr. Dorsey also asserts that the workers' compensation judge erred in permitting the entry of the settlement agreement at what should have been a hearing on the merits. However, Mr. Dorsey fails to point to a provision in the workers' compensation law prohibiting the entry of a settlement into the record on the date scheduled for a hearing on the merits. Thus, we find no merit in Mr. Dorsey's assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    Penalty allegedly due for late payment of settlement funds\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Lastly, Mr. Dorsey lodges a seemingly alternative argument whereby he contends that the workers' compensation judge erred in not enforcing the settlement agreement and, in turn, by not assessing a penalty in accordance with La.R.S. 23:1201(G) due to the alleged untimely payment of the settlement funds following the November 16, 2016 hearing. In his brief to the Court, he asserts that he received a check in the amount of $19,200.00 on December 19, 2016. Mr. Dorsey states that on January 23, 2017, he received a check for $23,701.85, which constituted the remainder of the settlement. However, appellate courts will not, in general, consider issues that are raised for the first time on appeal and which were not addressed by the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Uniform Rules-Courts of Appeal, Rule 1-3 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen v. Affordable Home Furnishings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13-176%20%28La.App.%203%20Cir.%2011/13/13%29\">\n    13-176 (La.App. 3 Cir. 11/13/13)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7273513\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/130/345/\">\n    130 So.3d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Review of the record reveals that Mr. Dorsey's allegation that a penalty is owed for late payment of the settlement is presented for the first time on appeal and was not considered by the workers' compensation judge. As such, we do not consider Mr. Dorsey's assertions regarding the penalty allegedly owed for late payment of the settlement funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    DECREE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the ruling of the workers' compensation judge, denying Mr. Dorsey's Motion to Amend Judgment and Motion for New Trial, is affirmed. All costs of this proceeding are assessed against Carey Dorsey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Smith v.
