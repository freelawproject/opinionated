Smith appeals his capital-murder convictions and sentences of death. Smith was convicted of murder made capital for intentionally killing Kevin Thompson during a kidnapping,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(1), Ala. Code 1975, and for intentionally killing Kevin Thompson during a robbery,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(2), Ala. Code 1975. The jury, by a vote of 11 to 1, recommended that Smith be sentenced to death. The Calhoun Circuit Court accepted the jury's recommendation and sentenced Smith to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the night of April 20, 2011, Kevin Thompson was speaking on the telephone to Chris Wilkerson, his friend, when he heard someone at his front door. Thompson opened the door. Wilkerson heard Thompson say, \" 'I didn't know you was bringing all these people with you.' \" (R. 1157.) Then, the telephone call was disconnected. Wilkerson dialed Thompson's telephone number and Thompson answered. The telephone call was brief, with Thompson telling Wilkerson that he would call him right back. A few hours passed without Thompson returning the telephone call. Worried, Wilkerson telephoned Thompson repeatedly around midnight, but Thompson did not answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thompson's absence from his position as a teacher at Wellborn Elementary School was noticed early the following morning. Wendy Burns, a fellow teacher, became concerned when she saw that Thompson's classroom was dark as students were arriving. As Assistant Principal Jeanna Chandler testified, it was \"just so out of character for Mr. Thompson not to be there, not to call.\" (R. 631.) Multiple individuals attempted to contact Thompson by telephone to no avail. Deputy Brendan Harris of the Calhoun County Sheriff's Office, the school's resource officer, was dispatched to an address to conduct a welfare check. The address, though, led Deputy Harris to the residence of Thompson's mother and sister, Frances and Rena Curry. Deputy Harris was able to make contact with Rena Curry and expressed to her the concern the staff at the elementary school had regarding Thompson's absence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rena Curry telephoned her mother and then drove to Thompson's apartment. Two things stood out to Rena Curry upon her arrival. First, Thompson's vehicle, a silver Honda Civic, was not in the parking lot. Second, and more peculiar, was a single shoe, which she believed belonged to Thompson, lying in the parking lot. The front door to Thompson's apartment was unlocked, and Rena Curry did not notice anything amiss inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Frances Curry telephoned the Jacksonville Police Department and asked that an\n   officer meet her at Thompson's apartment. An officer responded to Thompson's apartment and briefly investigated before leaving. In Frances Curry's opinion, law enforcement seemed unconcerned about Thompson's whereabouts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Undeterred, Frances Curry continued her search for her son. Frances Curry telephoned Thompson's bank and learned that several withdrawals had been made from Thompson's account the previous night at various financial institutions. Frances Curry again contacted the Jacksonville Police Department to inform them of the account activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Officers obtained surveillance footage from the area credit unions and banks where withdrawals had been made that corresponded with the times of activity on Thompson's account. Video from the Jacksonville branch of the Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank depicted a silver vehicle arriving at 10:19 p.m. A man wearing a baseball cap bearing a script \"A\" made multiple withdrawals from the bank's automatic-teller machine (\"ATM\"). In an apparent attempt to obscure his identity, the man held his left arm across his face; the attempt, though, made visible a distinct tattoo on the man's left hand. The video also appeared to depict a passenger in the front seat of the vehicle aiming a rifle toward the backseat of the vehicle. Photographs from the Jacksonville branch of the Ft. McClellan Credit Union depicted what appeared to be the same man make a withdrawal from the ATM at 10:26 p.m. Photographs from the Anniston branch of the Ft. McClellan Credit Union depicted a silver vehicle and a dark-colored sport-utility vehicle arrive at 12:13 a.m. on April 21. There, a man walked up to the ATM and made a withdrawal. Officers presented photographs generated from the surveillance footage to Frances Curry and Rena Curry to see if an identification could be made. Rena Curry was able to identify Tyrone Thompson. Rena Curry explained that Tyrone Thompson was a family acquaintance whom Thompson had known since the two were children. Thompson had recently made contact with Tyrone Thompson; after Tyrone Thompson's latest release from incarceration, Tyrone Thompson's mother had asked Thompson to provide guidance to her son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Investigator Clint Parris of the Anniston Police Department located Tyrone Thompson, and he agreed to be interviewed. During an interview with Investigator Parris and Investigator Joseph Martin of the Jacksonville Police Department, Tyrone Thompson identified Smith as being involved with Thompson's disappearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Meanwhile, Cynthia Warf, who had been visiting her husband, Andrew Jones, at the hospital, returned to her residence to find multiple individuals in her husband's garage. Warf saw Jessica Foster, her daughter; Whitney Ledlow; Smith; and two other males, who were later identified as Blake Hamilton and Teddy Lee Smith, in the garage with a silver vehicle. Unbeknownst to Warf and Jones, the silver vehicle had been in the garage since early that morning. Smith had telephoned Ledlow at 3:00 a.m. that morning to ask Foster if he could park his friend's vehicle at Warf's house and Foster had agreed. When Smith met with Ledlow and Foster later that morning, Smith told them he needed someone to \"chop\" the vehicle. At Ledlow's request, Hamilton and Teddy Lee Smith agreed to take the vehicle apart for scrap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Warf, assuming that the vehicle had been stolen, told the individuals to remove the vehicle from the garage and threatened to telephone law enforcement. As she walked back to her residence, the individuals fled; Ledlow, Foster, and Smith went in search of a trailer to remove the vehicle, which by this point was not operable. Warf\n   telephoned her husband about the silver vehicle in his garage and he telephoned law enforcement. When officers arrived at the garage, it was apparent that the silver vehicle was in the process of being dismantled. Assistant Chief Bill Wineman of the Jacksonville Police Department testified that the silver vehicle was registered to Thompson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ledlow, Foster, and Smith planned to return to Warf's house, tow the vehicle away, and burn it. That plan was abandoned, though, because they saw a number of police vehicles as they neared Warf's house. Smith told Ledlow and Foster that they \"were deeper in it than [they] thought,\" so they drove away. (R. 849.) Ledlow and Foster decided to travel to Carrollton, Georgia, to give themselves time to consider their next step. Ledlow stated that she did not know what Smith had done to Thompson and described Smith's behavior during the trip to Carrollton as \"perfectly fine.\" (R. 853.) In Carrollton, Ledlow rented a motel room for the night. There, Smith admitted to Ledlow and Foster that he had been involved in a murder with Tyrone Thompson and Jovon Dwayne Gaston. Smith detailed for them the crime and generally described the location of Thompson's body. Ledlow testified that she was initially incredulous because Smith was so calm. The three then went to a Walmart retail store to purchase clothes and toiletries. Ledlow playfully struck Smith in the arm while at the store, and Smith responded, \"[D]on't you know you don't punch a killer.\" (R. 857.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The following day, Warf contacted Investigator Parris and informed him that Smith's black Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle was parked in a parking lot near her house. She also told Investigator Parris that Foster, Ledlow, and Smith were likely traveling in a GMC Yukon sport-utility vehicle that belonged to her son. Meanwhile, Smith was making arrangements to enter a drug-rehabilitation program in Florida. Ledlow, Foster, and Smith left the motel in Carrollton and traveled to the airport in Atlanta. On the way, Ledlow saw a number of police vehicles following them. When she parked near the taxi terminal at the airport, officers swarmed their vehicle and took the three into custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A search of the Yukon yielded a camera, which Foster admitted was taken from Thompson's vehicle. Officers also found a black baseball cap with a script \"A,\" which appeared to match the hat that was captured by the ATM surveillance footage. Ledlow also admitted to taking a ring from Thompson's vehicle, which she pawned for $200. Ledlow and Foster provided lengthy statements to officers following their arrest, and Ledlow consented to a search of her property. Officers recovered several items of evidentiary value on Ledlow's property. From an exterior trash can, officers recovered: a pair of Nike Air Jordan basketball shoes, which had dried mud and vegetation stuck on the soles and several reddish-brown stains on the uppers; cardboard packaging for duct tape; a nearly expended roll of gray duct tape; and a t-shirt wrapped around a serrated steak knife, which appeared to bear a mixture of dried blood and mud on the blade and handle. Inside Ledlow's house, officers recovered: a pair of COOGI brand denim jeans, which bore dried mud; and a pair of boxer shorts, which bore red stains. Subsequent DNA testing established that the bloodstains found on the jeans, knife, and basketball shoes were consistent with Thompson's DNA. Smith was listed as a potential contributor for DNA found inside the basketball shoes, and DNA on the inside of the jeans was consistent with Smith's DNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Officers obtained information that Thompson's body had been disposed of down an embankment near a set of guardrails on U.S. Highway 278. Based on that description, Investigator Seth Rochester of the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office was able to locate Thompson's body in the early morning hours of April 23. Thompson's wrists were bound with duct tape, and a subsequent analysis of the tape revealed that the tape was consistent with the tape found in Ledlow's trash can.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The injuries suffered by Thompson were substantial. Dr. Emily Ward, a state medical examiner with the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, performed the autopsy on Thompson's body. Dr. Ward noted a cut across the front of the neck, which was deep enough to compromise the windpipe and left jugular vein. This injury caused blood to aspirate into Thompson's lungs. Thompson suffered four haphazard stab wounds to left side of his chest-two pierced the heart and all four pierced the left lung. Dr. Ward stated that the orientation of the wounds suggested that Thompson's assailants were standing while Thompson was in a submissive position on the ground. Thompson sustained a contusion to the entire left side of his face, consistent with punching or kicking. In Dr. Ward's opinion, this injury was caused by a \"tremendous\" amount of force. (R. 753.) Thompson bore superficial abrasions on his extremities, which could have been caused by falling; bruises to his wrists, which were consistent with his wrists being bound by duct tape; and defensive wounds to his palms. Dr. Ward stated that, although the stab wounds and injury to the throat were severally fatal, Thompson's death was not quick because Thompson did not sustain arterial bleeding. In Dr. Ward's opinion, Thompson would have been aware of his injuries and would have experienced significant pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Shane Golden, a forensic scientist with the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, processed Smith's Explorer. Golden applied a luminol reagent, which reacts with iron in the hemoglobin of blood, to the interior of Smith's vehicle. The reagent revealed three areas of luminescence in the vehicle-the back of the rear seat, the rear driver's side door panel, and the armrest of front driver's side door. Subsequent DNA testing of blood swabs taken from Smith's Explorer revealed that the samples were consistent with Thompson's DNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Golden noted a smell of cleaners in the Explorer. That odor was explained by John Robinson, who owned a detail shop. Robinson identified Smith as having come to his detail shop on the morning of April 21. Smith's visit was memorable to Robinson because Smith wanted only the interior of his vehicle cleaned and because Smith emphasized that he wanted the cleaning to be thorough. Robinson testified that he saw red spatter on the carpet in the back seat and around the console.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Smith was extradited to Alabama on April 27. Upon his return he waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights and provided a statement to Investigator Parris and Investigator Martin, which gave the officers a horrifying glimpse into Thompson's final hours. Smith's statement included several versions, each more incriminating than the last. Smith stated that Tyrone Thompson had telephoned him around 10:00 to 10:30 p.m. on April 20 to \"go get some money\" and drink some beer. (State's Exhibit 60.) Tyrone Thompson picked up Gaston and Smith, and then the three went to Thompson's apartment. Tyrone Thompson, Gaston, and Smith walked up to the front door. Thompson met the men at the front door and Tyrone Thompson took a telephone from Thompson and smashed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thompson was then taken to his vehicle. Gaston retrieved his rifle and all four men entered Thompson's vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Smith drove Thompson's vehicle to a bank where he withdrew funds from Thompson's account. The men returned to Thompson's apartment, at which point Thompson was forced into the trunk of his vehicle. After picking up Smith's Explorer, the men took both vehicles to Tyrone Thompson's house, where they drank beer and discussed who would kill Thompson. Following an unsuccessful search for a chop shop in Coldwater, Alabama, the men traveled to Warf's house and then to a branch of the Ft. McClellan Credit Union. Thompson's debit card did not work at the credit union, so the men returned to Warf's house. After a brief trip to a Shell gasoline station to purchase duct tape, the men returned to Warf's house and used the tape to bind Thompson. Thompson, though, had broken some of his bindings and was screaming in the trunk, so he was moved to Smith's Explorer. The men traveled to Piedmont, Alabama, and found an isolated stretch of Highway 278. Thompson was escorted off the road. Tyrone Thompson handed Smith a knife and held Thompson's hands while Smith slit Thompson's throat. Thompson, who was crying and pleading for help at this point, was held down as a vehicle passed. Then Gaston took the knife from Smith and stabbed Thompson several times in the chest. Thompson was held down as another vehicle passed, and then was held up and again stabbed by Gaston. After pushing Thompson to the bottom of the embankment, Smith, Tyrone Thompson, and Gaston left the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In his statement, Smith attempted to marginalize his role by suggesting that he unwittingly had become involved in Thompson's murder and that he had been a reluctant participant. This suggestion, however, was rebutted by other evidence offered at trial. For instance, Smith told Investigator Parris and Investigator Martin that he had become involved in the murder of Thompson when Tyrone Thompson telephoned him around 10:00 p.m. on the evening of April 20. However, Ledlow and Foster testified that Smith had telephoned them around 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on April 20 to ask about the maximum amount that could be withdrawn from an ATM. In addition, it was Smith who was captured on security footage driving Thompson's vehicle, making withdrawals from Thompson's account, and purchasing the duct tape to bind Thompson, and it was Smith who arranged for Thompson's vehicle to be dismantled. Ledlow and Foster further testified to Smith's calmness following the murder and to Smith's apparent embracing of his role as a \"killer.\" (R. 857.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \" 'When evidence is presented ore tenus to the trial court, the court's findings of fact based on that evidence are presumed to be correct,'\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Perkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7439236\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/646/46/#p47\">\n    646 So.2d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47 (Ala. 1994) ; '[w]e indulge a presumption that the trial court properly ruled on the weight and probative force of the evidence,'\n   <em>\n    Bradley v.

Smith argues that the evidence lacked probative value and that it was intended only to inflame the jury. Smith cites testimony given by multiple witnesses as being improper victim-impact evidence. Thompson's mother, Frances Curry, was invited during direct examination to tell the jury about her son and his childhood. Frances Curry spoke of Thompson's love and their strong family and shared anecdotes about Thompson's saving money to buy her flowers and\n   Thompson's transferring funds into her bank account when she needed financial assistance. Frances Curry also explained to the jury that Thompson had a strong work ethic, was well mannered, and was passionate about his work as a teacher. Thompson's coworkers described their maternal relationship with the young teacher and the close bond they all shared as educators. Chris Wilkerson, Thompson's friend, disclosed Thompson's intention to pursue his doctorate and Thompson's plans to take leave from work to attend Wilkerson's graduation. Rena Curry, Thompson's sister, told the jury that Thompson was murdered while she was in the midst of taking her final examinations and that as a result of his murder she did not receive passing grades. Smith also argues that the State increased the prejudice by improperly relying on victim-impact evidence in its opening and closing arguments during the guilt phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This issue was raised at trial outside the hearing of the jury.

It was Thompson's family that generated the first lead in the case by contacting Thompson's bank, and this evidence explained why Thompson's family took that action.

On the contrary, Investigator Parris offered only to inform the district attorney's office of Smith's cooperation, Smith's drug problem and that Smith was asking for mercy. Based on the totality of the circumstances, Smith's statement was not rendered involuntary by\n   Investigator Parris's offer.

Specifically, Smith argues that it was error for the circuit court to admit: a) photographs of him that depicted his tattoos; b) photographs of him that depicted him in restraints; c) evidence indicating that he previously had been incarcerated and that he was serving a term of probation at the time Thompson was murdered; and d) evidence in the form of 9mm ammunition and a receipt for a 9mm pistol that was unconnected to Thompson's murder.

Smith describes the photographs as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   \"In one close up photo, along the lower side of his right forearm, is the word \"gangsta\" in large, graffiti-like block letters. (C. 657.) The shoulders and upper area of both arms are covered with gang-related tattoos, signifying membership in the Gangster Disciples. These include two hands forming a gang sign with the letters 'BOS' for 'Brothers of the Struggle,' a trident with the letters G, D, and N for 'Gangster Disciple Nation,' and a small six-pointed star (C. 653-54), as well as a large six-pointed\n   star with the letters 'GD' (C. 658). Additional Gangster Disciples tattoos included 'MMM'-an abbreviation for \"money, macks, murder\"-and '74,' which represents G and D-the seventh and fourth letters of the alphabet. (C. 653-54.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   \"Two photos depicted a tattoo taking up the entirety of Mr. Smith's right lower leg, where the words 'looks like $ $ $' appear in large block letters on a backdrop of stacks of 100 dollar bills and several large diamonds. (C. 648.) On Mr. Smith's right hand is the word 'dirty,' and on his left is the word 'south.' (C. 647, 653-55.) In nearly all the photos, Mr. Smith is shirtless and wearing baggy jeans that fit low on his waist such that several inches of his underwear are visible.

He did not ask for a cautionary\n   instruction or a poll of the jury. Furthermore, the videotape at issue here was taken at the scene of the crime, not at the police station. Thus, jurors likely would infer that handcuffing was simply standard procedure when a defendant is taken outside the jail. The viewing of the defendant in handcuffs on television rather than in person further reduces the potential for prejudice. In light of the foregoing facts, and the fact that Gates sat before the jury without handcuffs for several days during his trial, we conclude that the relatively brief appearance of the defendant in handcuffs on the videotape did not tend to negate the presumption of innocence or portray the defendant as a dangerous or bad person.

Only Count 1 contained the extra element of abducting a victim.\" (Smith's brief, at 77.) Thus, Smith argues, capital murder/robbery is a lesser-included offense of capital murder/kidnapping under the counts in this case.

In the present case, the goal of the appellant's criminal intent in committing the abduction was to accomplish or aid in the commission of a felony, specifically, robbery. The commentary to this kidnapping statute states as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   \" 'Note that none of the purposes listed in \u00a7 13A-6-43(a)(1)-(6) must be actually accomplished in order for the crime of kidnapping to be committed; the crime is complete when there is an \"abduction,\" i.e., intentional or knowing restraint, coupled with an intent to secrete or to hold the victim where he is not likely to be found, or use, or threaten to use deadly physical force. Section 13A-6-40(1) and (2). Proof of any one of the additional purposes increases the gravity of the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   All of these criminal purposes pose substantial danger to the life of the victim or afford a strong incentive to kill him in order to avoid identification or apprehension.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   \"Thus, because the intended purpose of the abduction need not be completed, while the felony of robbery was required to be completed in the first count, Count one was not a lesser-included offense of Count two, and the appellant's rights against double jeopardy were not violated.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

No error, plain or otherwise, resulted from the circuit court's instruction on reasonable doubt. As such, this issue does not entitle Smith to any relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Smith argues that the circuit court erred by allowing the State to elicit and argue the opinions of Thompson's family to persuade the jury to recommend a sentence of death. Specifically, Smith argues that the State improperly elicited testimony from Frances Curry and Rena Curry regarding their characterization of Smith, his crime, and the appropriate punishment. Smith did not object to the Currys' testimony at trial; therefore, this issue will be reviewed for plain error only. Rule 45A, Ala. R. App. P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   During the penalty phase, the State asserted in its opening argument to the jurors that Thompson's mother, Frances Curry, wanted Smith to be put to death: \"[The death penalty is] what his mother[, Frances Curry,] wants, and we'll put her on the stand to tell you that.\" (R. 2014.) The State called Curry to testify and specifically asked Curry how she wanted Smith punished. Frances Curry not only told the jury that she wanted Smith to be put to death but also told the jury that it was her opinion that Smith's killing her son was not an \"accident\"; that it was her opinion that the killing was not merely \"a bad choice\"; that it was her opinion that Smith's taking Thompson's life was Smith's \"conscious choice\"; that it was her characterization and opinion that \"her baby\" had \"suffered\"; that it was her opinion that \"if you murder\" you must be executed; and that it was her opinion that even if the jury punishes Smith with death, \"[Smith] will still live longer than my baby did.\" (R. 2045-46.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   State: \"What punishment are you asking me to pursue here in this case?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   Frances: \"Death.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-212\">\n   State: \"And can you tell me why?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n   Frances: \"I believe if you take a life and no one is doing anything to you, that you must give your life.

Rena testified that she not only wanted Smith to be executed, but also she essentially told the jury that despite mitigating evidence reflecting that Smith had had a terrible childhood, it was her opinion that Smith was not thinking about his childhood when he murdered Thompson; and, she essentially told the jury that if you murder you must be murdered.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   State: \"And it would be pretty fair to say you and I have had some pretty in depth conversations getting ready for trial.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   Rena: \"Yes, sir.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-218\">\n   State: \"But a question I'm going to ask you-a decision I don't want to make on my own.

As detailed by the majority's opinion, Smith's crime was particularly heinous and overwhelmingly aggravated. Smith, a violent felon who was under a sentence of imprisonment at the time, accompanied his accomplices to Thompson's home and kidnapped him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 13A-5-49(1) - (2), (4), Ala. Code 1975. After kidnapping Thompson, Smith and his accomplices tortured him both physically and mentally while robbing him. \u00a7 13A-5-49(4) and (8), Ala. Code 1975. When Thompson was of no further use to Smith, Smith cut Thompson's throat with a serrated steak knife. While Thompson's lungs and stomach filled with his own blood, one of Smith's accomplices stabbed Thompson in the chest multiple times. Thompson was then thrown to the bottom of an embankment where he was left to die. Smith's character, his past, and the facts of his crime established five aggravating circumstances: 1) that he was under a sentence of imprisonment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-49(1), Ala. Code 1975; 2) that he had been previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to a person,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-49(2), Ala. Code 1975; 3) that his capital offense was committed while he was engaged in a kidnapping,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-49(4), Ala. Code 1975; 4) that his capital offense was committed while he was engaged in a robbery,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-49(4), Ala. Code 1975; and 5) that his capital offense was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel when compared to other capital offenses,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-49(8), Ala. Code 1975. Although, as the majority notes, Smith presented some evidence in mitigation, the force of the aggravating circumstances in this case mightily outweighed that mitigating evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schwab v. Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3269529\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/451/1308/#p1330\">\n    451 F.3d 1308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1330 (11th Cir. 2006) (holding that a penalty-phase error does not require reversal when the aggravating circumstances far outweigh the mitigating circumstances);\n   <em>\n    Randolph v.

Specifically, the circuit court instructed the jury that an \"aggravating circumstance is a circumstance which is specified by law\" and \"that the punishment that should be imposed upon the defendant depends on whether any aggravating circumstances exist beyond a reasonable\n   doubt, and, if so, whether the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances.\" (R. 2418.) The circuit court then identified and defined for the jury the five aggravating circumstances that it could consider. (R. 2420-22.) Presuming, as this Court must, that the jury followed the circuit court's instructions, it did not consider Frances Curry's and Rena Curry's testimony when deciding whether to sentence Smith to death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Belisle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7055139\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/11/323/#p333\">\n    11 So.3d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 333 (Ala. 2008) (\"[A]n appellate court 'presume[s] that the jury follows the trial court's instructions unless there is evidence to the contrary.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cochran v. Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8484055\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/935/1169/#p1176\">\n    935 So.2d 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1176 (Ala.2006) );\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892525\" index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/153/84/#p158\">\n    153 So.3d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158 (Ala. Crim. App. 2012). Likewise, the circuit court did not mention Frances Curry's and Rena Curry's testimony when reweighing the aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances and when sentencing Smith to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Finally, this Court must presume that the \"jurors [did] not leave their common sense at the courthouse door.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Rieber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7454797\" index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/663/999/#p1006\">\n    663 So.2d 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1006 (Ala. 1995). The jury had already found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Smith had committed his offense in the manner described by the Currys, i.e., intentionally. Moreover, the State's desired outcome in the penalty phase was the imposition of the death penalty. Consequently, by virtue of the fact that Frances Curry and Rena Curry took the stand to testify for the State in the penalty phase of Smith's trial, the jury should have been well aware that the Currys wanted Smith to be sentenced to death. Further, any impact the Currys' testimony conceivably could have had was tempered by Smith's Aunt Arleen Pollard's impassioned plea to the jury for it to recommend a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   In light of all these factors, I am of the firm conviction that the improper admission of the Currys' testimony did not influence the jury's or the court's sentencing determination, and Smith has not met his burden to show otherwise. Therefore, I disagree with the majority's decision to reverse Smith's sentences of death, and I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
