Belsome, Judge Sandra Cabrina Jenkins, Judge Regina Bartholomew-Woods)\n </judges>\n <opinion id=\"p-8\">\n  Judge Regina Bartholomew-Woods\n  In this negligence case, Plaintiff-Appellant, 639 Julia Street Partners, appeals the August 21, 2017 judgment granting the joint exception of prescription in favor of Defendants-Appellees, the City of New Orleans through its Department of Parks and Parkways, the Downtown Development District, and Bayou Tree Service, Inc. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  <strong>\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  Plaintiff-Appellant, 639 Julia Street Partners (\"Appellant\"), owns a two (2) story, red brick building (\"building\") situated at the corner of Saint Charles Avenue and Julia Street in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  Peter Trapolin (\"Trapolin\"), Appellant's managing partner, alleged that in 2010, he noticed \"new cracks in the building that seemed to coincide with the maturation of Chinese pistachio trees that were planted as saplings years before by (Defendants-Appellees) the City of New Orleans (\"the City\") and the Downtown Development District (\"the DDD\") (collectively, \"Appellees\"). Trapolin asserted that he wrote to Appellees and requested that the trees be removed; however, Appellees refused, and on April 5, 2011, Appellant filed suit in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans. Appellant asserts that suit was filed within a year of his knowledge of the new cracks in the building, which he attributed to the maturation of the Chinese pistachio trees.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  In 1998, Appellant filed suit against the City for damage caused to the building by red oak trees that the City had planted along Saint Charles Avenue in preparation for the 1984 World's Fair. In his brief, Appellant explains that \"the roots of the mature oak trees had grown under the foundation and pulled the moisture out of the clay causing the foundation and walls to crack.\" In 2001, the trial court rendered judgment finding the City negligent and awarded damages in favor of Appellant.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The building's address is 639 Julia Street, New Orleans, Louisiana.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the present matter, Appellees contend that the Chinese pistachio trees at issue in this appeal were planted between 1996 and 1998. Appellees deny that the building has sustained any damage caused by the trees, but argue that Appellant \"acquired or should have acquired knowledge of the damage caused by the trees in September 2000,\" during the pendency of the earlier lawsuit. Appellees argue further that this is a delictual action involving an immovable property subject to one (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   year liberative prescription;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   therefore, Appellant's claim has prescribed because the present suit was filed more than ten (10) years after Appellant acquired or should have acquired knowledge of the damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellant asserts that, in 1998, the Chinese pistachio trees were planted as saplings and were small, young trees during the pendency of the earlier suit. Appellant further asserts that at issue in this suit is new damage along the Julia Street side of the building where the roots of the now-mature Chinese pistachio trees have reached and damaged the building's foundation. By contrast, the damage in the earlier suit was on the St. Charles side of the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 27, 2017, Appellees filed a joint exception of prescription. On August 21, 2017, the trial court rendered judgment with incorporated reasons maintaining the exception and dismissing Appellant's claims. It is from this judgment that Appellant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellant raises the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. Whether the trial court committed manifest error in maintaining Appellees' joint exception of prescription, because Appellees did not introduce any evidence into the record to support its exception? Accordingly, in the absence of evidence, the joint exception of prescription must be decided solely on the facts alleged in Appellant's petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2. Alternatively, if this court finds that Appellees did, in fact, introduce evidence into the record, whether the trial court committed manifest error in maintaining Appellees' joint exception of prescription, because there is no evidence that the Chinese pistachio trees, planted as saplings along the Julia Street side of the building between 1996-1998, had the potential to damage the building prior to 2000?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This Court, in\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Fin.

To advance their position, Appellees rely on\n   <em>\n    Fontaine v. Roman Catholic Church of Archdiocese of New Orleans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7489919\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/625/548/#p554\">\n    625 So.2d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 554 (La. App. 4th Cir. 1993), a case in which this Court was \"convinced\" that a matter was prescribed by relying on evidence not properly introduced into the record and citing \"[j]udicial economy and logic.\" Despite the fact that Fontaine has not yet been expressly overruled, it is evident that the Louisiana Supreme Court, via\n   <em>\n    Denoux\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cichirillo\n   </em>\n   , has departed from\n   <em>\n    Fontaine\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Appellees also rely on\n   <em>\n    Hunt Petroleum Corp. v. Texaco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 2004-0729 (La.

However,\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   concerned a motion for summary judgment. The Louisiana Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Cichirillo\n   </em>\n   , clarified difference in considering evidence in support of a motion for summary judgment, as opposed to evidence in support of a peremptory exception of prescription. The Court stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [t]he failure to appropriately file exhibits into evidence is problematic. Some confusion apparently arises due to the differences in a court's consideration of motions for summary judgment and peremptory exceptions. In considering a motion for summary judgment, the court shall render judgment \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to material fact, and that mover is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" LSA-C.C.P. art. 966. Appellate review of motions for summary judgment is\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schroeder v. Board of Supervisors of Louisiana State University,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7500172\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/591/342/#p345\">\n    591 So.2d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 345 (La. 1992). Thus, the appellate court considers the pleadings, depositions, answers\n   to interrogatories, admissions on file, and any affidavits submitted by the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   On the other hand, at the trial of a peremptory exception of prescription, \"evidence may be introduced to support or controvert any of the objections pleaded, when the grounds thereof do not appear from the petition.\" LSA-C.C.P. art. 931. Appellate review of the record following a hearing on exceptions is governed by manifest error when evidence has been introduced at the hearing.\n   <em>\n    Carter v.
