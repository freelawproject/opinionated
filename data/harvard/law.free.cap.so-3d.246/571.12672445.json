Rogers claims the trial court violated his rights under section 394.916, Florida Statutes (2017), when it did not commence a jury trial within thirty days of his request in open court. Because Rogers has an adequate remedy below, we dismiss his petition for writ of prohibition as premature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Osborne v.
