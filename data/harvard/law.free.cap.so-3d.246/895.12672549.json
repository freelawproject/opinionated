Following a jury trial in the Warren County Circuit Court, Bryan Morton was found guilty of attempted murder, armed robbery, and burglary of a dwelling. Morton was sentenced to thirty years for the attempted-murder conviction and thirty years for the armed-robbery conviction,\n   with the sentences ordered to run consecutively. He was sentenced to twenty years for the burglary conviction, which was ordered to run concurrently with the attempted-murder and armed-robbery convictions, with all sentences to be served in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Morton now appeals. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On May 4, 2014, Charlie Arnold's house in Warren County, Mississippi, was broken into while she was asleep in her bed. Arnold testified that she awoke to Kimberly Chapman hitting her over the head with a walking stick. Arnold recognized Chapman because Chapman had dated Arnold's son while he was in high school. Arnold testified that she heard a baby crying and that Chapman continued to hit her. She also testified that she noticed a man in her house during the attack, and that he hit her on top of the head with a shotgun. She could not recall all of the attack because she kept passing out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Around 11:30 a.m., Investigator Jason Bailess with the Warren County Sheriff's Department responded to a dispatch call where someone had reported seeing a woman stranded on Highway 80 in Vicksburg, holding an infant and covered in blood. Investigator Bailess arrived on the scene and noticed a woman-later identified as Chapman-covered in what appeared to be wet blood and holding a baby while standing next to a maroon Cadillac sedan. Investigator Bailess questioned Chapman about the blood on her clothes and body, and Chapman stated she had been in a fight the night before. Investigator Bailess, however, noticed that Chapman did not have any injuries and also had dried blood on her hands around her fingernails. He called for another officer to come to the scene and had Chapman and her baby sit in the officer's car while he looked in the window of Chapman's Cadillac. Investigator Bailess noticed from outside the car that a sportsman's license was on the front seat of the car and had the last name \"Arnold\" on it with an address. Once the other officer arrived, Investigator Bailess went to the address, which he stated he was familiar with from previous calls, to check on the woman who lived there. He called for assistance to meet him at the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Investigator Bailess testified that when he knocked on the door of the house, it opened because it was not properly shut. He called out for Arnold, and noticed blood spots on the living-room floor. When the officers got to Arnold's bedroom, Investigator Bailess noticed that the mattresses were flipped over off the bed, and that there was blood all over the bedroom. They found a broken shotgun with blood on the butt of the gun. Arnold was on the side of the bed opposite the bedroom entrance. She was covered in blood and had severe head wounds. At the scene, she told officers that a woman named Kim Chapman had broken into her house and started beating her and that there was a man with Chapman, but she did not see him. She stated that she heard a man's voice behind her and then was hit from behind. And that Chapman stabbed her. Arnold was taken to the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi. Upon her release, she spent 120 days in the Vicksburg Convalescent Home for further recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. At the police station, Chapman gave a statement, telling police that she and Morton had gone to Arnold's house to borrow money from her. She stated that Morton went through the window and assaulted Arnold. In her statement, Chapman admitted to hitting Arnold only once,\n   although months later at a bond hearing she admitted to hitting Arnold multiple times. She denied having a gun or knife, and stated she never saw Morton with the shotgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. In Chapman's Cadillac, investigators found Arnold's driver's license, Visa card, Social Security card, prescription medications, and a check from Arnold's account. They also recovered a jacket from the front-passenger floorboard, which was sent to the crime lab for testing. A data extraction performed on Chapman's phone showed contacts, including one titled \"Brian,\" with a text sent from Chapman to Morton on the day of the burglary and attack, asking \"wanna come[ ] help[?]\" From the night of May 3 to morning of May 4, Morton and Chapman exchanged twenty-nine calls altogether, including missed and answered calls. An arrest warrant was issued for Morton. Sheriff's deputies collected a knife and shotgun barrel from a Jeep that Morton had been known to drive, which was parked at Colby Ashley's house on Massey Road. Ashley is Chapman's cousin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. DNA testing on the jacket recovered in Chapman's car yielded results consistent with the sample taken from Arnold. Male DNA was also found on the jacket, and the forensic examiner could not exclude Morton or any of his patrilineal male relatives. A sample from the broken gun stock was consistent with Arnold's DNA. The sample from the walking cane yielded a partial profile that could have come from Arnold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. At trial, Arnold testified that Chapman or the man entered the home through a side window of the house and that she suspected that the one who entered through the window let the other through the front door. She testified that Chapman and the man took cash from her purse, the purse itself, her prescription pills, and her wedding ring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Chapman testified against Morton at trial and stated that she had only met Morton a couple of times before the night of May 3-once at Ashley's house, and another time when she bought crystal meth from Morton. She testified that she initiated contact with Morton on the night of May 3 because she needed money and thought Morton could help her get it. She mentioned Arnold's house to Morton, and Morton agreed to help Chapman steal from Arnold. Chapman stated that when she and Morton got to Arnold's house, the window she had planned to enter through was blocked, and Morton entered through another window. When Chapman went inside, she saw Morton tying up Arnold with a rope, and that Arnold was already covered in blood at this point and had a gash in her forehead. While they were looking for valuables to take, Arnold got loose, so Morton handed her a weapon, and Chapman hit Arnold with it. She stated that while she was trying to put Arnold back on the bed, Morton left in Chapman's car. Chapman called Morton, but he did not answer. Morton eventually returned to Arnold's house to pick Chapman up, and they went back to Ashley's house on Massey Road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. Morton testified in his own defense that he never left Ashley's house on Massey Road that night. Waylon Jones, who was also living at Ashley's house at the time, testified as an alibi witness for Morton. Jones told investigators that Morton never left Ashley's house that night. Ashley's girlfriend, Lee Ann Elliot, also lived at the house on Massey Road. Elliot told investigators that she had gone to sleep early that night, but the next day Morton told her that he and Chapman had gone to Arnold's home with the intention of stealing her prescription medicine and money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   She further testified that Morton told her that when Arnold recognized Chapman, Chapman told Morton that she would now have to kill Arnold. Morton said that he did not want to hit Arnold, but he had to because she saw Chapman's face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11. Following a trial on the merits, a jury found Morton guilty of attempted murder, armed robbery, and burglary of a dwelling. Morton now appeals, and we address his issues in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Sufficiency of the Indictment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12. In his first issue on appeal, Morton claims that the indictment was fatally defective for failure to charge an essential element of the crime. Specifically, Morton argues that the indictment failed to state whether he \"failed\" to complete or was \"prevented\" from completing the act of murder; thus, he argues that indictment was legally insufficient to charge him with attempted murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13. \"[W]hether an indictment is defective is an issue of law and therefore deserves a relatively broad standard of review, or de novo review.\"\n   <em>\n    Colburn v.

Morton argues that the jury instruction S-1B omits the words \"under such circumstances that, if accomplished, would constitute an offense of murder,\" and thus, the instructions omitted an essential element of the crime. The S-1B instruction, in relevant part, provided that for the jury to find Morton guilty of attempted murder, it must find that Morton: \"1. Did purposefully or knowingly and unlawfully and with deliberate design ... attempt to commit the murder of Charlie Arnold, a human being; and 2. [he] failed to actually kill Charlie Arnold, and therefore did not meet the elements of murder ....\" While jury instructions\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   track the language in the indictment, their failure to do so is not fatally defective, so long as \"they do accurately follow the requisite elements of the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Neal v.

In regard to Morton's claim that the jury instructions constructively amended the indictment, we note that \"[n]ot all variances between the indictment and instructions constitute a constructive amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

In the instant case, the variance between the indictment and the jury instructions did not substantially alter the elements of proof necessary for a conviction. The jury was charged that to convict Morton of attempted murder, it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Morton had intended to commit murder, attempted to do so, and failed to do so. Thus, the jury was instructed on all the elements of proof necessary for a conviction, and the variance in no way prejudiced Morton's defense. As such, this issue is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Armed-Robbery Instruction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 22. Morton also claims that the instruction on armed robbery materially varied from the indictment and constituted a constructive amendment. In relevant part, the indictment stated that Morton \"did willfully, unlawfully[,] and feloniously take\" certain property from Arnold, while the jury instructions charged an \"attempt to take.\" Morton argues that this variance amounted to a constructive amendment of the indictment because it did not require the jury to find that Morton actually took the items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 23. Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-3-79 (Rev. 2014) defines the crime of armed robbery:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Every person who shall feloniously take or attempt to take from the person or from the presence the personal property of another and against his will by violence to his person or by putting such person in fear of immediate injury to his person by the exhibition of a deadly weapon shall be guilty of robbery ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 24. \"[I]n Mississippi both an attempt to take and an actual taking of another's personal property against his will by violence to his person or by putting such person in fear of immediate injury to his person by the exhibition of a deadly weapon constitutes robbery.\"\n   <em>\n    Houston v.

Morton argues that Chapman's statement was evidence of prior criminal activity and thus the trial court erred in admitting the testimony. However, the record reflects that the trial court did not admit the testimony. Morton's counsel objected to the statement on the ground of hearsay, and the objection was sustained. Additionally, the trial court made an on-the-record finding that Chapman's statement be stricken. Thus, the statement was not admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 33.
