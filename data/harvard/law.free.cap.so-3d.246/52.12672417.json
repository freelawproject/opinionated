The evidence revealed that the defendant had battered the victim on multiple prior occasions. In fact, on the day of the incidents in question, the defendant pled guilty to domestic abuse battery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 12, 2017, the defendant's grand jury indictment was amended to charge the defendant with: 1) Count one-attempted second degree murder, a violation of La.R.S. 14:27 and 14:30.1, \"in that he did, on or about and between the 15\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of March, 2016 and the 16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of March, 2016, attempt to commit Second Degree Murder of Rene Mason\"; 2) Count two-aggravated second degree battery, a violation of La.R.S. 14:34.7, \"in that he did, on or about and between the 15\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of March 2016, and the 16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of March 2016, without the consent of the victim, intentionally inflict serious bodily injury with a dangerous weapon, to wit a barbecue pit, upon Rene Mason\"; 3) Count three-aggravated second degree battery, a violation of La.R.S. 14:34.7, \"in that he did, on or about and between the 15\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of March 2016, and the 16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of March 2016, without the consent of the victim, intentionally inflict serious bodily injury with a dangerous weapon, to wit a barbecue pit, upon Rene Mason\"; and 4) Count four-second degree battery, a violation of La.R.S. 14:34.1, \"in that he did, on or about and between the 15\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of March 2016, and the 16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of March 2016, without the consent of the victim, intentionally inflict serious bodily injury upon Rene Mason.\" After a trial by jury held June 13, 2017, to June 15, 2017, the defendant was found guilty as charged on all counts. Thereafter, on August 14, 2017, the defendant was sentenced as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Attempted second degree murder-35 years\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Aggravated second degree battery-15 years\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Aggravated second degree battery-15 years\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Second degree battery-8 years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court ordered the sentences to run concurrently with the sentence imposed for attempted second degree murder. Additionally, the trial court ordered \"the sentence\" to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Thereafter, on August 16, 2017, the defendant filed a Motion for Appeal and Designation of Record, which was granted on August 18, 2017. On September 12, 2017, the defendant filed a pro se \"Motion to Reconsideration.\" On September 19, 2017, the defendant filed a pro se \"Motion to Reconsider the Imposed Sentence and Contradictory Hearing.\" The trial court denied the motion as untimely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant is now before the court alleging four assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. The trial court erred in denying the objection to the hearsay testimony of Kevin Thomas\n   a) through a police officer's testimony; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   b) in a statement made by Thomas for investigative purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Kevin Thomas' statements had not been subject to confrontation or cross-examination in violation of the confrontation clause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2. Should this Honorable Court find the lack of objection to the introduction of the statement of Kevin Thomas precludes review of the Assignment of Error No. 1, then review should be allowed as the failure to object constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   3. The equal protection guarantees outlined in\n   <em>\n    Batson v. Kentucky\n   </em>\n   were violated in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   4. The trial court erred in sentencing Troherro Keith Batiste without benefit of parole on counts 2-4 as the crimes of aggravated second degree battery and second degree battery do not provide for that restriction in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR NUMBERS ONE AND TWO\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In assignment of error number one, the defendant challenges the trial court's admission of a statement made by Kevin Thomas, a witness who refused to testify at trial. The defendant argues the admission of Mr. Thomas's statement through the testimony of Officer Torrence Bowens violated his right to confront his accusers. In assignment of error number two, the defendant, out of an abundance of caution, asserts his counsel was ineffective for failing to reassert his objection to the introduction of Mr. Thomas's written statement. We will discuss both assignments together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Deputy Jerry McKinney testified that he went to the cell block to get Mr. Kevin Thomas to testify, but Mr. Thomas refused to accompany the deputy to the courtroom. The state requested the trial court order Mr. Thomas to come into the courtroom and testify. The trial court then asked Deputy McKinney to instruct Mr. Thomas that he was being ordered by the trial court to testify. According to Deputy McKinney, Mr. Thomas continued to refuse to testify. Mr. Thomas was never brought to the courtroom. The trial court did not directly address Mr. Thomas regarding his refusal to testify. The state asked the trial court the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   BY MR. METOYER:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Your Honor, we would ask, that under Code of Evidence, Article 804.2, that when a witness-when a witness persist or refusing [sic] to testify concerning the subject matter of his statement, despite an order of the Court to do so, that he be declared unavailable as a witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defense counsel responded that he had no objection, stating that he believed that was the law. The following colloquy then took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   BY MR. METOYER:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   And, Your Honor, since that is the state of the law, that also entitles the-the State to have his record put in, and we can publish it to the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   BY THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court declares him unavailable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   BY MR.

METOYER:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Neither has the-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   BY THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court will-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   BY MR. METOYER:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Neither has the State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   BY THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court will allow it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   BY MR. METOYER:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Thank you. Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   BY THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   So objection's overruled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   BY MR. METOYER:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Your Honor, uh, I think, and just for purposes of the record for Mr. Smith-to Mr. Smith's objection, according to, uh, Justice Scalia, before he died, uh, my understanding is this, the State-the State's duty is to provide the witness to be available for cross-examination. By having him subpoenaed and having Mr. Thomas here, we have certainly made him available, but we-and the Court has ordered him. So we're-we've met out [sic] burden in terms of providing the ability to cross-examine him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   So, if there is some objection to that, the State-it's a-it's an evil-even playing field, because the State did not get him on direct. Plus, these statements have been provided to-to Mr. Smith in the beginning. They're not-they're not surprise, and there's no prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   BY MR. SMITH:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Agreed. I-I just-it's-it's-I believe I have a Sixth Amendment Right to cross and confront the-my accusers. I will, however, uh, I-I will-I will, un, [ sic] I will admit that I-I've seen-I've seen his statements way back. And, uh, that-that's all I can say.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The state called Officer Torrance Bowens to testify regarding his investigation of the incident at issue. As part of his investigation, Officer Bowens spoke with Kevin Thomas. Officer Bowens identified State's Exhibit 49 as Mr. Thomas's transcribed statement. When asked to testify as to the substance of the statement, Officer Bowens stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A. Yes, sir. Mr. Thomas advised, when asked, uh, I believe I asked him did-was he aware of an incident that took place, uh, between Mr. Batiste and Ms. Mason on the 16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   of March. And he advised yes, he was aware. He said, on-on that, uh, I would assume it would be before day at-at-on the 15\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , Ms. Mason and Mr. Batiste, he said they were seen at a-at an abandoned house in the area where he hangs. He said that he heard Ms. Mason scream, and she ran toward where they were, where they were hanging and drinking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   He said that-and when she came close, she said, \"Help, he's trying to kill me. He's trying to hurt me.\" He advised that Mr. Batiste was coming toward her, and a group of men that were there stopped Mr. Batiste from coming close to her. He said, during that time, Mr. Batiste picked up a barbecue pit and hit Ms. Mason with it, and also hit her with a crate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Q. Okay. If you would, um, I want to direct your attention to Page 2, okay. And at the top of, uh, Page 2, can you read-that 'Q', what does that-what does that mean?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   A. Question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Q. And who-who was giving the question?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   A. That would be me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Q. Okay. And the 'A' means what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   A. Answer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Q. Who was giving the answer in this statement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A. That would be Mr. Thomas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q. Can-at the top of Page 2, can you tell me what the question is that you asked?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A. \"Can you tell me, in your own words, exactly you saw [sic] and what happened?[\"]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q. And can you please read what Mister-the answer that was giving [sic] to you by Mr. Kevin Thomas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A. Yes, sir. \"That night, I was in-I was in the backyard, right there at 1416 Sixth Street, and we was all barbecuing, you know, drinking a couple of beers and stuff. And we heard, you know, Rene scream. We looked up, and she was running. She came over there, and she-she was saying he was trying to beat her up, you know. He was going to hurt her. You know, she could-she could have hung, kind of hung around. And a little short while after, he came, you know, over there where he was trying to get her. And she was, you know, piling behind us. You know what I'm saying? That he was going to kill her. He's going to kill her. He's going to hurt her.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Q. Wait, let me-let me stop you for a second. So Kevin Thomas heard Mr. Batiste say that he was going to kill her? Is that what the-is that-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   A. It's-it's unclear if-if it was Mister-from reading this, I-I-.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Q. Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   A.-remember, from taking the statement, that Mr. Thomas was saying Ms. Mason was gonna-was-was the one saying-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Q. So, it's Mr.-it's Mr. Thomas saying that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   A. Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Q. \"I'm saying that he was going to kill her.\" Okay-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   A. Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Q.-go ahead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   A. \"He's going to hurt her. A couple of the guys kind of talked him down, and, uh, he left. Then he came back, and he tried to get her again, and the same thing just repeated itself over and over. She's running behind us, and he picked the barbecue pit up off the top of the barbecue grill and threw it at her, and hit her with it, kind of, but-and she kind of bent down. She was crying and screaming he was going to kill her. So that's when the guys kind of pushed him off-off of her, I'm sorry, and made him leave out of the yard. Then both, five minutes later-I'm sorry, then about five minutes later, he came back again. Then that's when he was trying to tell me he wasn't going to hurt her, he just wants to talk to her and every-and, uh, and everything.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \"So everybody's kind of like-everybody kind of like left him alone. He's trying to start talking, and kind of got back close. And they left and went back over there by the white house. And that was the last time I saw him or heard anything from him, until the next day when I found out that he had got-that he had hurt her.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Q. Okay. And what was the next question that you asked?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   A. \"Okay, did you, other than the barbecue pit, did you see him hit-did you see him hit her?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Q. And what was the answer?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   A. \"Well, I saw him pick up a-I'm sorry, I saw him throw a plastic crate at her. But when he initially-when he first came over there, they wouldn't let him get close enough to hit her.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Q. Okay. Keep going.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   A. \"You know, that's when he grabbed the barbecue pit and picked it-and picked it up, and threw it at her. After he hit her, then that's when he grabbed again\"-I'm sorry, \"that's when they grabbed him again, and made him leave.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Q. And keep going.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   A. My next question is, \"Where did the barbecue hit her-hit her?\" \"I think it\n   was like either on her arm or elbow, or on her arm, somewhere in that area. But it made a contact noise. You could hear it when it hit her.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Q. Okay. And I-I think that's sufficient. But your understanding was, was that he hit her with the barbecue pit lid, I'm guessing, and-and the crate as well?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Q. And that would have been not only from this statement and it's transcription, but from your notes that you took before the statement was made?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The state introduced Mr. Thomas's statement as State's Exhibit 49, and defense counsel stated, \"Without objection.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Defendant's Argument in Brief\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Appellate counsel argues the trial court erred in allowing Officer Bowens's testimony regarding Mr. Thomas's statement since Mr. Thomas's statement was testimonial in nature and was introduced without the defendant having the opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Thomas. Additionally, appellate counsel argues the erroneous introduction of the statement was not harmless:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   The hearsay testimony and hearsay statement of Kevin Thomas likely tipped the scales with the jury in establishing the \"intent to kill\" element of count 1, attempted second degree murder, as the State failed to prove a weapon was used and Ms. Mason had little recollection of the events. Likewise, without this evidence, the jury had no evidence to show the use of a barbecue pit or crate in Counts 2 and 3. Thus, there was no proof in those counts to prove that a dangerous weapon was used to cause the injuries. Thus, this evidence was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In assignment of error number two, appellate counsel raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the event this court finds the defendant's initial objection to Officer Bowens's testimony regarding Mr. Thomas's statement was not sufficient to preserve the objection to Mr. Thomas's written statement. As noted earlier, defense counsel stated he had no objection to the state's introduction of the written statement. When defense counsel initially asserted the \"confrontation clause\" objection, it was in response to the state's declaration that Mr. Thomas's unavailability allowed it \"to have his record put in, and ... publish[ed] ... to the jury.\" Officer Bowens then proceeded to testify as to the substance of Mr. Thomas's statement. Since defense counsel made his objection known to the trial court prior to Officer Bowens's testimony regarding Mr. Thomas's statement, defense counsel's lack of objection to the introduction of the written statement does not impede review of this assignment of error. Further, when there is an issue regarding the possibility of the violation of a basic constitutional right, failure to object does not preclude appellate review. Accordingly, there is no need to address defense counsel's ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     State's Argument in Brief\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The state focuses its argument on the fact that Mr. Thomas was, in fact, unavailable since he refused to testify. Although the state argues the trial court did not err in admitting Officer Bowens's testimony regarding Mr. Thomas' statement, the state contends any error would be harmless:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Here, the testimony of Detective Torrence Bowens related to the statement of Kevin Thomas pales in comparison to the testimony of the Library personnel who found Renee Mason unable to hold her head up and who had obviously been\n   beaten; hospital personnel who testified to the extent of Rene Mason's injuries, indicating Rene Mason was dying when she arrived at the hospital; the medical records that were submitted which describe traumatic brain injury, brain swelling, and the necessity of immediate brain surgery on Rene Mason.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Additionally, because of Rene Mason's admission to transport personnel and hospital personnel that \"her boyfriend, the defendant, had caused her injuries and the fact that Renee Mason was moved to a Level 1 trauma, the hospital was put on lock down. Further, due to the severity of her injuries, Renee Mason was unable to eat on her own and was placed on a nasal gastric tube; was unable to breath [sic] on her own and was intubated; and had to undergo a craniotomy. When Renee Mason arrived at the hospital she had a broken collar bone and not only bruising over her entire body, but lacerations to the face and hands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   In addition to eyewitness and medical testimony to the extent of Renee Mason's injuries, the State introduced numerous incident reports related to the defendant beating Renee Mason. In an effort to corroborate these incident reports, the State offered the testimony of seven (7) Alexandria Police Officers who had encountered the defendant in altercations with Renee Mason for the course of 2-3 years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Finally, the State introduced the Defendant's own statement made on March 16, 2016 that he inflicted Renee Masons' injuries; the Defendant's guilty plea entered on March 16, 2016 for the battery of Renee Mason; and not one (1) BUT three (3) admissions to causing the injuries to Renee Mason on March 15-16, 2016, which were filed by the Defendant into the court record as letters to the Rapides Parish Clerk of Court and a 9\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Judicial District Court Judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   ALL of this testimony and ALL of these documents were presented to the jury AND submitted into evidence\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     prior\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to the testimony of Detective Torrence Bowens related Kevin Thomas [sic].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Law and Analysis\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Louisiana Code of Evidence Article 804 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In his police statement, Gurganus admitted stealing a van on the morning November 25, 2000. It appears that Gurganus' statement qualifies under the declaration against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule making the statement admissible. In his statement, Gurganus incriminates himself in the additional crime of stealing a van, thereby subjecting himself to additional criminal charges, which gives reliability to his statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Crawford v. Washington\n   </em>\n   however, which was rendered after the present case was tried and decided, the United States Supreme Court found that certain ex parte examinations, while admissible under modern hearsay rules, are exactly the kind of testimonial evidence against the accused that the confrontation clause is supposed to prevent: that is, testimonial evidence in the form of an out-of-court declaration to establish or prove a fact. The Supreme Court found that under the Sixth Amendment a necessary condition for the admissibility of the testimonial statements against an accused in a criminal case is the prior opportunity to confront the unavailable witness. The Court noted that statements taken by police in the course of interrogations are testimonial hearsay for purposes of the Sixth Amendment, and that these statements present a unique opportunity for prosecutorial abuse. Therefore, in light of\n   <em>\n    Crawford v. Washington,\n   </em>\n   in order for Gurganus' police statement to be admissible in the present case, the State had to show that Gurganus was unavailable and that there was a prior opportunity to confront the witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   The first question under this analysis is whether Gurganus was unavailable. Under LSA-C.E. art. 804, \"a declarant is 'unavailable as a witness' when the declarant cannot or will not appear in court and testify to the substance of his statement made outside\n   of court.\" This includes situations in which the declarant is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of his statement, persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of his statement despite an order of the court to do so, or testifies to a lack of memory of the subject matter of his statement. Here, Gurganus first asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege, and then persisted in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of his statement when questioned by the prosecutor, which would make him unavailable under LSA-C.E. art. 804.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   The State argues in its brief that Williams cannot claim that he was denied his right to confrontation, because Gurganus agreed to answer the questions posed by the defense, and the defense instead chose not to confront the witness on the subject matter of his statement, but rather focused its questions on his mental health. The State is correct that the defense's questions focused on Gurganus' mental health, but the record reveals that prior to the witness's cross-examination Gurganus stated that he did not give a statement to the police and suggested that it must have been somebody with the same name. If Gurganus did not give the statement to the police, it would, in fact, have made no sense for the defense to ask Gurganus about a statement that he testified he did not make. Assuming that Gurganus had made the statement, he was still unavailable because he testified to a lack of memory of the subject matter of his statement. Under\n   <em>\n    Crawford v. Washington\n   </em>\n   the only remaining question for determining the admissibility of the testimonial statement is whether there was a prior opportunity to confront the unavailable witness. The record reveals that there was no prior opportunity for the defense to confront Gurganus. Therefore, it appears that the trial court violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation by admitting Gurganus' statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1100-02 (footnotes omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   Like\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   the record in the current case does not reflect that there was an opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the time she made the statement or any time subsequent. The victim refused to testify regarding her statement at trial, and it was very unlikely that she was going to answer the defendant's questions either. It was error for the trial court to allow the admission of the victim's written statement, even though it was an excited utterance or present sense impression, because the statement was testimonial in nature and the defendant had no prior opportunity to confront the victim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <em>\n    Savoy\n   </em>\n   , 11-1041 at pp. 10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In the present case, the lack of the defendant's opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Thomas appears to be uncontested.

The statement was given on March 23, 2016, seven days after the incidents in question. Thus, Mr. Thomas was not speaking about events as they were happening but was describing events that occurred several days beforehand. It is also clear that Officer Bowens's questions were posed to learn what happened in the past rather than to resolve a current emergency. We find Mr. Thomas's statement to Officer Bowens was testimonial and, thus, subject to the defendant's confrontation rights. Contrary to the state's argument, there is no such thing as an \"even playing field\" in a criminal trial. The burden lies wholly with the state to prove every element of an offense charged. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution specifically provides that the defendant has the right \"to be confronted with the witnesses against him[.]\" The state's lack of opportunity to question a witness is irrelevant and does not excuse the violation of the defendant's constitutional right to confront his accusers. The trial court erred in admitting the statement without the defendant having an opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Thomas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   As both the defendant and the state acknowledge in their briefs, a harmless error analysis is appropriate when evidence is introduced at trial in violation of the defendant's confrontation rights.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   An error in the defendant's right to confrontation is subject to a harmless error analysis. If a confrontation error occurred, a reviewing court must determine whether the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In determining whether the guilty verdict rendered was unattributable to the error the following factors should be considered: 1) whether the witness' testimony was important; 2) whether the testimony was cumulative in nature; 3) whether corroborating or contradictory evidence regarding the major points of the testimony existed; 4) the extent of cross-examination permitted; and 5) the overall strength of the State's case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9179813\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/889/1093/\">\n    889 So.2d at 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The sufficiency of the evidence is not challenged on appeal. After a review of the record, we find the erroneous introduction of Mr. Thomas's statement was not harmless error. Mr. Thomas's statement was important since it was essential to proving the elements of the charges against the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Aggravated second degree battery is defined at La.R.S. 14:34.7 as \"a battery committed with a dangerous weapon when the offender intentionally inflicts serious bodily injury.\" \"[S]pecific intent to kill is required to support an attempted second degree murder conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Spriggins\n   </em>\n   , 13-1114, p. 3 (La.App. 3 Cir. 4/2/14),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6974271\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/135/1252/#p1254\">\n    135 So.3d 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1254,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9655187\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/322/189/\">\n    322 So.2d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1975). The state relied on Mr. Thomas's statement to prove the dangerous weapon element of aggravated degree battery and the specific intent to kill element of attempted second degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   As the state points out in its brief, the victim identified the defendant as her attacker, and the defendant admitted to battering the victim. Thus, the defendant's identity was proven by other evidence. Additionally, the medical testimony regarding the severity of the victim's injuries is arguably sufficient to prove the defendant's specific intent to kill (attempted second degree murder) and the defendant's specific intent to inflict serious bodily injury (aggravated second degree battery and second degree battery). However, as the defendant points out in his brief, Mr. Thomas's statement was the only evidence as to the dangerous weapon element of the two counts of aggravated second degree battery, both of which specify the barbecue pit as the dangerous weapon used. The necessity of Mr. Thomas's statement is evident in the following colloquy between the state and Officer Bowens:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   Q: Okay. Okay, so according to Mr. Thomas' statement, Mr. Batiste hit Ms. Mason with the lid of a barbecue grill and a crate. Correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   Q: And according to Mr. Batiste own [sic] statement, in addition not only did he hit her multiple times, he pushes her down, right, and her head is close to the stairs, right? And the steps are made of what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   A: Concrete.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Although Mr. Batiste admitted that he hit the victim several times, Mr. Batiste did not admit to using the dangerous weapons necessary to prove the two counts of aggravated second degree battery. Mr. Thomas's statement is the only evidence presented by the state that a dangerous weapon was used. Further, the state extensively quotes the inadmissible statement in its closing argument as evidence of the defendant's intent to kill the victim. Thus, Mr. Thomas's statement was essential to the state's case on the charge of attempted second degree murder. The wrongly admitted evidence, therefore, was clearly prejudicial evidence which tainted the process as to all charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we find the introduction of Mr. Thomas's statement violated the defendant's constitutional right to confront his accusers and created reversible error. Accordingly, the trial court's ruling allowing introduction of the evidence is reversed, defendant's convictions and sentences are vacated and the case is remanded for a new trial. This ruling renders both Assignments of Error Three and Four moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The defendant's convictions and sentences are vacated and the case remanded for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED; CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCES VACATED; AND REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    We note that the trial judge that denied the motion to reconsider as untimely was Judge Thomas Yeager, a different judge from the judge who presided over trial and sentencing (Judge Monique Freeman Rauls).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
