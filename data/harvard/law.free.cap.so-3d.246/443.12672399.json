Although he asked for and was granted a competency evaluation, Hernandez claims the trial court erred by failing to either conduct a competency hearing or enter an order as to his competency before accepting his plea. In accord with several recent cases from this court on the subject, and considering the State's concession of error, we agree and reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Hernandez's counsel filed a written motion under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.210(b), and requested the appointment of an expert to examine his client's competency to proceed. The motion indicated that the rule required the court to hold a competency hearing within twenty days of the motion's filing. Four days later, the trial court entered an order granting the motion, and directed the appointed expert to submit a written evaluation of Hernandez's mental condition to each party within thirty days of the order. However, the trial court's order did not set a date for the competency hearing, nor does the expert's written evaluation appear in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Thereafter, Hernandez entered a plea of no contest to the charged crime. Yet there is no record that a competency hearing ever occurred, nor does the record contain a written order establishing whether Hernandez was competent to proceed. If appellant's competency was ever discussed in court prior to the acceptance of the plea, or if the motion was ever withdrawn, such a discussion is also not in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The procedure for determining a defendant's competency is governed by Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure 3.210 through 3.215. Competency requires strict adherence to the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dortch v.
