For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Strother and Appellee, Ronda Maxwell Hudson, are the unmarried parents of Kristen Marie Strother, born on June 16, 2010. By judgment rendered on November 10, 2011, based upon the stipulations of the parties, and signed on January 10, 2012, the parties agreed to share joint custody of Kristen, with Ms. Hudson being designated as the primary custodial parent and with Mr. Strother having reasonable visitation rights. The parties entered into another Consent Judgment on June 30, 2014, wherein Mr. Strother was awarded every-other-weekend custodial visitation and alternating weekly summer custodial visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Subsequently, Mr. Strother filed a Rule for Change of Custody, Rule for Contempt and For Other Relief on June 2, 2017, based on numerous allegations, including that the child had excessive tardiness and unexcused absences from school, that Child Protection had telephoned him, and that the mother, Ronda Hudson, had been involved in physical violence with the man with whom she is living while the minor child was in the home. In this pleading, he also sought and obtained a Temporary Ex Parte Custody Order, whereby Ms. Hudson was given only supervised visitation at her mother's home until the matter could be heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 24, 2017, a hearing was held; at the conclusion of which the trial court denied the Rule for Change of Custody, holding that \"the Court finds that there is insufficient evidence to take the child away from the mother and place it with the father at this point.\" This appeal by Mr. Strother followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, Mr. Strother alleges four assignments of error, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1. The trial court committed legal error by applying an incorrect legal standard to determine custody and visitation rights to the minor child, and thus a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review by this court is appropriate and necessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2. The trial court was manifestly erroneous in failing to recognize that the evidence presented established that sole or domiciliary custody for the father and supervised visitation for the mother would be in the best interest of the child and in failing to tailor a custody and visitation order in a manner that would minimize risk of harm to the minor child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   3. The trial court erred in failing to find that the violent acts against mother by her paramour in front of the child triggered the Post-Separation Family Violence Relief Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   4. The trial court erred in failing to recognize that the [Appellee's] failure to call her paramour to testify or to explain his failure to testify about matters material to the case and peculiarly within his knowledge created an adverse presumption that his testimony would be damaging and unfavorable to her case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard Applied by the Trial Court for Change of Custody\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Strother first asserts that the trial court erred in applying the incorrect standard of law in denying his rule for a change in the custody arrangements of the parties' minor child. As such, he argues, this court should review the trial court's decision de novo. The standard of review by this court in cases involving child custody issues is well settled.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   An appellate court may not set aside a trial court's findings of fact in absence of manifest error or unless it is clearly wrong.\n   <em>\n    Stobart v.

He cites no authority for his argument that it held him to the stricter standard. To attempt to establish his claim that the trial court applied the heavier burden of proof required by\n   <em>\n    Bergeron\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Strother points to language used by the trial court in its oral ruling on July 24, 2017. First, he notes the trial court's statement that \"even with all the allegations of drug use being thrown about, there have been no drug charges ever filed against the mother.\" We do not find that this language supports Mr. Strother's argument. It is clear that the trial court found that the allegations of a change in circumstances based on alleged drug use were not proven, especially given the evidence of Ms. Hudson's clean urine screen, and thus, did not support a finding of a change of circumstances for the purposes of child custody. Showing a change in circumstances is still a prerequisite for amending child custody even when set by a consent judgment.\n   <em>\n    Guidry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8384485\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/979/603/#p605\">\n    979 So.2d 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Further, even Mr. Strother admits in brief that the language used by the trial court established that it \"did not find it in the child's best interest to change the domiciliary status\". Nevertheless, he continued to cite language from the trial court's oral ruling, particularly language concerning the child's schooling and Ms. Hudson's employment situation, to attempt\n   to support his contention. While the trial court did note specific concerns it had in regard to Ms. Hudson's parenting style, it also specifically addressed Mr. Strother, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Strother, I'm-I understand your concerns and your concerns are legitimate. At the same time, I-I want to advise you that-that the child may be better off with you at this time, but guess what, it's not sufficient to take the child away from the mother. All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The trial court explicitly found that the evidence produced did not support proof of a change in circumstances, nor was it proof that a change in custody was in the child's best interest at this time. A trial court's decision is afforded substantial deference and will not be disturbed on review absent a clear showing of abuse as the trial court is in a better position to evaluate the best interest of a child from his observance of the parties and the witnesses.\n   <em>\n    Deason v.

However, the evidence in the record does not support such a statement. The trial court heard the testimony of multiple witnesses, including both parties, all of whom testified to factors pertinent to determining the best interest of the child. After a full day of hearing witness testimony and arguments of counsel, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court notes that ... the mother needs to seek employment so she's not dependent upon anyone else to take care of the child. The Court also notes that support for the child has not been forthcoming by Mr. Strother but has been provided for by the mother. The Court is concerned about the child's education in that there is no reason for the tardiness and/or absences by the mother. But with that said, the Court finds that there is insufficient evidence to take the child away from the mother and place it with the father at this point. So the child will remain with mother as the domiciliary parent[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The best interest of the child standard in a child custody case is a fact intensive inquiry that requires the weighing and balancing of factors favoring or opposing custody in the competing parties on the basis of the evidence presented.\n   <em>\n    Gary v.

Rather, he contends that Ms. Hudson's boyfriend has been physically abusive to Ms. Hudson. He further asserts that Ms. Hudson, merely by remaining in her boyfriend's home, has \"subjected her child to domestic violence on more than one occasion[.]\" There are no allegations that Ms. Hudson's paramour committed physical violence against Kristen. \"Application of the Act is mandatory when there has been one serious injury, resulting from abuse, or simply more than one act of violence during the marriage.\"\n   <em>\n    Hicks v.

Further, Mr. Strother's allegations of domestic violence committed against Ms. Hudson were contradicted by Ms. Hudson herself. Though Ms. Hudson's mother testified that she had seen Ms. Hudson with bruises on her arms, no one could testify as to actually witnessing abusive behavior by Ms. Hudson's boyfriend. In fact, Ms. Hudson's mother testified that Ms. Hudson bruised easily, and the bruises on her arm could have been caused by her arm being grabbed too hard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Additionally, Mr. Strother could only point to one specific incident, in which Ms. Hudson got into an argument with her boyfriend resulting in her and the minor child leaving the house and eventually being forced to spend the night at the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office in 2016. Again, the only evidence of violence or abuse was some bruising found on Ms. Hudson's upper arm. She did not seek any help or medical care. Mr. Strother puts forth no other corroborating evidence nor does he cite any other time or incident of violence other than blanket statements that Ms. Hudson's boyfriend is abusive, which was denied by Ms. Hudson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The provisions of the Post-Separation Family Violence Relief Act create a presumption against granting custody to any parent who is perpetuating family violence. La.R.S. 9:364. \"The court may find a history\n   of perpetrating family violence if the court finds that one incident of family violence has resulted in serious bodily injury or the court finds more than one incident of family violence.\" La.R.S. 9:364(A). In the instant matter, only one incident of family violence is even alleged, committed against and not by Ms. Hudson, which resulted in bruising to Ms. Hudson's arms, requiring no medical attention and involving no serious bodily injury. Ms. Hudson testified that she and her boyfriend merely yelled at each other and that the bruises came from his grabbing and throwing her on the bed. Mr. Strother offered no contradictory evidence.
