He now appeals. For the following reasons, Defendant's sentence is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 27, 1978, 17-year-old Defendant was indicted on one count of second degree murder, in violation of La. R.S. 14:30.1. Following a jury trial, he was found guilty of the January 28, 1978 shooting death of Shelly Diggs. On November 20, 1978, the trial court imposed the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence for the first 40 years. Defendant did not appeal his conviction or sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 8, 2017, Defendant filed a pro se motion to correct an illegal sentence, arguing that his mandatory life sentence\n   was unconstitutional under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , because he was a juvenile when the crime was committed. Counsel was appointed to represent him. The state did not oppose his motion. On April 27, 2017, the trial court resentenced Defendant to life imprisonment at hard labor, with the benefit of parole eligibility. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to hold a sentencing hearing to consider any possible mitigating factors prior to resentencing and that automatically resentencing him to life imprisonment with the benefit of parole does not take into account the need for individualized sentencing. He further argues that the sentence is excessive, even though it falls within the statutory guidelines, and that the trial court has the authority to deviate from a mandatory sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For those offenders convicted of second degree murder in 1978, La. R.S. 14:30.1 provided for a sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence for the first 40 years. The current version of La. R.S. 14:30.1 provides for a sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence.

C. Cr. P. art. 878.1 and La. R.S. 15:574.4(E), which became effective on August 1, 2013. When enacted, La. C. Cr. P. art. 878.1 required a trial court to conduct a hearing prior to imposing a life without parole sentence on a juvenile murder defendant. In the event that the trial court imposes a life sentence with parole eligibility, La. R.S. 15:574.4(E) provided the conditions, such as serving 35 years of the sentence imposed, which must be satisfied before the defendant can apply to the parole board for parole consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the U.S. Supreme Court held that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   applied retroactively; and, in addressing concerns that the retroactive application of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   would place an undue hardship on states, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Giving\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   retroactive effect, moreover, does not require States to relitigate sentences, let alone convictions, in every case where a juvenile offender received mandatory life without parole.\n   <em>\n    A State may remedy a Miller violation by permitting juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole, rather than by resentencing them.\n   </em>\n   See, e.g.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-10-301\">\n    Wyo.

Allowing those offenders to be considered for parole ensures that juveniles whose crimes reflected only transient immaturity-and who have since matured-will not be\n   forced to serve a disproportionate sentence in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Extending parole eligibility to juvenile offenders does not impose an onerous burden on the States, nor does it disturb the finality of state convictions. Those prisoners who have shown an inability to reform will continue to serve life sentences. The opportunity for release will be afforded to those who demonstrate the truth of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's central intuition-that children who commit even heinous crimes are capable of change.

On appeal, the defendant alleged that La. C. Cr. P. art. 878.1 was unconstitutional in light of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , because article 878.1 still provides for an automatic sentence without parole, probation or suspension of sentence, with parole eligibility only occurring after a defendant serves 35 years of his sentence. The defendant further asserted that because \"Louisiana does not often, if ever, release people convicted of homicide on pardon or parole,\" mere access to the Parole Board for consideration of parole failed to comply with\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . The defendant also complained that he should have been granted a sentencing hearing to consider the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and that the failure to conduct such a hearing was unconstitutional. The court found no merit in the defendant's claims. The court noted that in\n   <em>\n    Fletcher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , this court upheld the constitutionality of La. C. Cr. P. art. 878.1 and La. R.S. 15:574.4(E). Additionally, as to the defendant's argument that the mere possibility of parole was inadequate to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The Attorney General also argues that the argument raised by Defendant-the mere possibility of parole is not sufficient to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   -has already been rejected in principle by the Louisiana Supreme Court.

As the Attorney General points out, if the mere possibility of being released on parole is sufficient to satisfy the mandatory parole eligibility established in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   for juvenile non-homicide offenders, the mere possibility of being released on parole is more than sufficient to satisfy the chance of parole eligibility after a hearing established in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   for juvenile homicide offenders.

Instead, a sentencing court's obligation to consider youth-related mitigating factors is limited to cases in which the court imposes a sentence of life, or its equivalent, without parole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   The sole question to be answered in a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   hearing is whether the defendant is eligible for parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the sentence of Defendant Calvin Ray Palmer is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    <em>\n     Miller\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , drew a line between children whose crimes reflect transient immaturity and those rare children whose crimes reflect irreparable corruption. Life without parole can be a proportionate sentence only for the latter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Defendant has already served 39 years of his original sentence, so he would soon be eligible for parole regardless of the trial court's resentencing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
