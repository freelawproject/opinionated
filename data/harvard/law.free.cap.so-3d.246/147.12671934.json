Erich Bergdolt, asst. city atty., Mobile, for appellant.\n </attorneys>\n <attorneys id=\"p-7\">\n  Henry Brewster, Mobile, for appellee.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   THOMPSON, Presiding Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The City of Mobile (\"the city\") appeals from a judgment of the Mobile Circuit Court (\"the circuit court\") affirming an order of the Mobile County Personnel Board (\"the board\"). The board's order reversed a decision by the city terminating the employment of Fred Wayne Lawley, Jr., a Mobile police officer. Lawley's employment was terminated in February 2015, after he was charged with stealing $2,050 worth of property while responding to a reported burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record indicates the following. At a hearing before the board on March 15, 2016, the attorney for Lawley moved to dismiss the matter on the ground that, at the predisciplinary hearing held before a\n   disciplinary trial board (\"the trial board\") of the Mobile Police Department on February 18, 2015, Lawley \"was not permitted to sit in on the predisciplinary hearing other than when his testimony was given.\" Lawley argued to the board that the trial board's refusal to allow him to be present for the questioning of other witnesses deprived him of due process and violated the board's procedural rules that, he said, required that an employee be given the opportunity to observe all witnesses called to testify in a predisciplinary hearing such as that held by the trial board. In presenting his argument to the board, Lawley relied at least in part on a July 2015 order of the board in which the board concluded that a Mobile public-works employee had been denied his due-process rights by the Public Works Department because, the board said, the predisciplinary hearing was held without allowing the employee to be present in the hearing room during the testimony of other witnesses. The city argued that the law is well settled that the board could not dismiss the matter on due-process grounds because, it said, constitutional questions are beyond the scope of the board's authority or jurisdiction to decide. After hearing the arguments of the parties, but without taking any testimony, the board dismissed the matter in an order dated March 29, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The city filed a timely appeal to the circuit court. Upon consideration of the parties' briefs, the circuit court recognized that the board and, on appeal, the circuit court, did not have the authority to decide constitutional questions because such decisions are beyond the board's administrative capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright v. City of Mobile\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6861187\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/170/656/\">\n    170 So.3d 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. Civ. App. 2014). Nonetheless, the circuit court stated, the board had the right to interpret its own rules and regulations. The board interpreted Personnel Board Rule 14.3(a) regarding the dismissal, suspension, or demotion of city employees to require that an employee must be given the opportunity to observe all witnesses called to testify in a predisciplinary hearing. The circuit court concluded that, in giving deference to the board's interpretation of Rule 14.3, it found that the interpretation was not unlawful or unreasonable, and it therefore dismissed the city's appeal to that court. The city filed a timely appeal to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The city first contends that the board did not have jurisdiction to consider a question of constitutional law, that is, whether Lawley's right to due process was violated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright v. City of Mobile\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6861187\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/170/656/\">\n    170 So.3d at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the board's authorizing statute did \"not authorize the [b]oard to decide questions of constitutional law, which is beyond its administrative capacity\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In his appellate brief, Lawley concedes that the city's argument is legally correct. However, he contends that the reason the board dismissed his appeal was not based on a constitutional violation; instead, he says, the board's decision to dismiss the appeal was based on its interpretation of its own rules. In its judgment affirming the dismissal, the circuit court also agreed that the board did not have jurisdiction to address questions of constitutional law. However, it said, \"the issue before this court is whether [the board] has the right to interpret its own rules.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The board's order does not expressly state a reason for its decision. The board made no factual findings. Without stating a reason, the board determined \"that the\n   termination is void and of no force and affect,\" and it ordered that Lawley be reinstated with back pay. Because the parties-and the circuit court-agree that the board did not have jurisdiction to consider constitutional issues, including whether the trial board violated Lawley's right to due process, and because the basis for the board's decision is not clear, we turn to the city's second issue, i.e., whether the board correctly determined that the appeal was void based on its own rules.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The standard of appellate review to be applied by the circuit courts and by this court in reviewing the decisions of administrative agencies is the same.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alabama Dep't of Youth Servs. v.

The pre-disciplinary hearing must be held within seven (7) days after written notice to the employee.

The same rationale holds true in this case. Because Lawley is entitled to a de novo hearing before the board to review the trial board's decision to terminate his employment, Lawley's procedural due-process concerns would be adequately addressed by a hearing before the board. The trial board's proceeding, however, functioned \"merely as an 'initial check against mistaken decisions.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11083678\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/788/146/#p152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After carefully reviewing the rule at issue in this case, we conclude that there is no language in Rule 14.3 requiring the \"Appointing Authority,\" in this case the Mobile Police Department, to allow the employee to be present at a\n   <em>\n    predisciplinary\n   </em>\n   hearing while other witnesses are being questioned. The board goes beyond merely interpreting the rule and, instead, adds a requirement to the rule that is not suggested in the existing language of the rule. To the extent Lawley asserts that the use of the phrase \"due process\" in the rule entitled him to be present during the testimony of other witnesses at the predisciplinary hearing, for the reasons set forth in\n   <em>\n    Loudermill\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    City of Orange Beach,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11083678\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/788/146/#p152\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   we again disagree. The \"due process\" to which Lawley or any employee is entitled is set forth in Rule 14.3. Specifically, the rule provides that Lawley was entitled to notice of the reasons for possible action against him at least 24 hours before the predisciplinary hearing, and he was entitled to present a written or oral response to those reasons. The rule does not provide that Lawley was entitled to be present during the questioning of witnesses at the\n   <em>\n    predisciplinary\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, we hold that the circuit court erred in affirming the board's order dismissing Lawley's appeal. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the circuit court for it to enter an order reversing the board's order and reinstating Lawley's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Pittman, Thomas, Moore, and Donaldson, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The board delayed hearing Lawley's appeal until after the resolution of the criminal charges against Lawley.
