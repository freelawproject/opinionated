The information received indicated that a bail bond agency in Pittsburgh known as the Steve Levitt Agency had been making systematic money payments to various magistrates,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> constables, minor Allegheny County court employees and other law enforcement officials in return for the referral to the Steve Levitt Agency of defendants who had been brought before the magistrates for the setting of bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-17\">On September 23, 1975, the FBI agents obtained a search warrant authorizing them to conduct a search of the agency premises for business records evidencing the above described bribery scheme. The affidavit upon which the warrant was issued contained information supplied by a confidential informant and two former employees of the Agency. The warrant was signed at 7:45 p. m. by the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania and the search of the Agency premises began at 8:12 p. m. Records reflecting the business of the Agency and evidence of the payoff-referral scheme were seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-18\">On July 23, 1976, three indictments charging a total of 33 defendants with violations of RICO were returned by a grand jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On August 27, 1976, three more in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>dictments were returned against an additional 38 defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Numerous motions to suppress the evidence seized during the September 23rd search and to dismiss the indictments were filed. On February 22, 1977, the district court judge, having heard testimony and argument on the motions, issued a memorandum and order suppressing the evidence and dismissing the indictments against all but two<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the defendants. <em>United States v. Forsythe, </em>429 F.Supp. 715 (W.D.Pa.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">A. <em>Validity of the Search Warrant</em></p>\n<p id=\"afc-dedup-0\">The initial question on this appeal is whether the search warrant was properly issued. Appellee Frank Mazzei<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> contends there was not sufficient probable cause for issuance because the facts in the affidavit on which the warrant was based were stale as of the date the warrant was signed. One informant ceased employment with the Agency in August of 1975 and the other (a former partner) had left in 1974. Mazzei argues that the informant\u2019s statements do not tend to show that the documents they described were on the Agency premises as of September 23,1975, the date the warrant was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">The district court judge observed that a month long time lapse might be significant had the items been of a volatile or fugitive nature, such as narcotics or stolen cars. 429 F.Supp. at 725. He found, however, that the Agency\u2019s business, involving bail bonds valid for considerable periods of time, was such that there was reason to believe that the documents would, in all probability, be preserved for more than one month. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-14\">The Supreme Court recently upheld a warrant against a similar argument in a case where there had been a three-month delay between the completion of the transactions on which the warrants were based and the ensuing search. <em>See Andre-sen v. Maryland, </em>427 U.S. 463, 478 n. 9, 96 5. Ct. 2737, 49 L.Ed.2d 627 (1976).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the instant case, as in <em>Andresen, </em>the records sought were prepared in the ordinary course of the Agency\u2019s business and it was reasonable to believe that they would be maintained there for a period of time of over one month. Moreover, the agents had reason to believe that the Agency had been conducting its bribery operations over a five-year period, and there was no reason to believe that this operation had ceased. We hold, therefore, that there was no error in the district court\u2019s finding that the warrant was properly issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-16\">B. <em>Execution of the Search Warrant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-17\">The district court held that the evidence seized during the search must be suppressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>because the search warrant was invalidly executed. He so concluded because the warrant stated that the search was to be conducted \u201cin the daytime\u201d and it was undisputed that the search began at 8:12 p. m. 429 F.Supp. at 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-4\"><em>Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure </em>41 governs searches and seizures in the federal system. Section (h) of Rule 41 provides that \u201cthe term \u2018day-time\u2019 is used in this rule to mean the hours from 6:00 a. m. to 10:00 p. m. according to local time.\u201d It is plain that a search beginning at 8:12 p. m. is a daytime search within the meaning of Rule 41(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">The district court further found that the warrant was invalidly executed because the search was conducted in an \u201cunreasonable, surreptitious and clandestine manner.\u201d This description is not supported by the record. The FBI agents were admitted to the Agency premises by the building security guard after exhibiting the warrant to him and after the guard, pursuant to the agents\u2019 instructions, had notified Michael Isaac that a search was being conducted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The record indicates that Mr. Isaac arrived at the Agency about an hour later. Agent Vidovich testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-6\">\u201cApproximately one hour after we began searching, Mr. Levitt and Mr. Isaac arrived, whereupon, we identified ourselves to them and had a short discussion, showing them our search warrant and the fact that Judge Weber had signed it and told them, generally what we were going to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-7\">On January 4, 1977, Isaac testified:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1193-11\">\u201cQ. Now, you do recall, do you not, the evening of the search?</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-12\">\u201cA. Yes. About five minutes after eight the security guard called me at my house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-13\">\u201cQ. The security guard from where?</p>\n<p id=\"aaf-dedup-0\">\u201cA. For \u2014 for the Lawyers Building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-14\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-15\">\u201cQ. O.K. Now the security guard called you. Did you go to the office?</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-16\">\u201cA. No, excuse me, the answering service called me and told me \u201cthe security guard wanted you urgent. Call the security guard in your building; urgent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aqh\">\u201cQ. O.K.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-17\">\u201cA. The answering service called me. I am sorry. O.K. I called the security guard. He say, \u2018Michael, some people here \u2014 some FBI people want to get to your office.\u2019 I say, \u2018Go ahead, That\u2019s ok.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-18\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-19\">\u201cThe Court: Did you say that you told the security guard that it was all right for the FBI men to go ahead?</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-20\">\u201cThe Witness: Yes sir, I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-21\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-22\">By Mr. Scarlata:</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-23\">\u201cQ. Did he indicate whether or not they had a warrant or anything like that?</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-24\">\u201cA. They told me they got some paper a warrant. Yea, I think so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-25\">\u201cQ. Did the security guard tell you, is my question?</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-26\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t remember that. But he told me there was some people with paper here and they want to get to my office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>The Constitution condemns only unreasonable searches. This search was instituted and conducted in a reasonable manner. <em>See Mengarelli v. United States, </em>426 F.2d 985, 987-88 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">The appellees assert that the search was unconstitutional because the agents seized some items not listed in the search warrant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They argue that because of this, all the evidence seized should be suppressed. The district court implicitly rejected this argument and correctly so. <em>See Andresen v. Maryland, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 482 n.11, 96 S.Ct. 2737. The Supreme Court has stated that the exclusionary rule has never been interpreted to proscribe the introduction of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 486, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976); <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 348, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974). Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the seizure of the items not listed in the warrant was illegal, this does not justify suppression of highly probative evidence consisting of those documents and records which were legally seized pursuant to a valid warrant. <em>See Stone v. Powell, supra, </em>428 U.S. at 485, 96 S.Ct. 3037.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">A. <em>The Statute of Limitations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1194-7\">The court below granted motions to dismiss indictments against some defendants because the indictments were returned after the state statute of limitation had expired.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We hold that the applicable period of limitations is governed by federal, rather than state, law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-9\">\u201cExcept as otherwise expressly provided by law, no person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any offense, not capital, unless the indictment is found within five years next after such offense shall have been committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANN\">Had Congress intended state statutes of limitations to apply to a federal criminal statute it would have so stated. An examination of the legislative history of Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act, Title 18, U.S.C., Section 1961, <em>et seq., </em>reveals that the original proposed legislation now embodied in Title 18, U.S.C., Section 1962 included a proposed subsection (e). Proposed Section 1962(e) provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-10\">\u201cA violation of this section shall be deemed to continue so long as the person who committed the violation continues to receive any benefits from the violation.\u201d S.Rep. 91-617 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1194-11\">The legislative history of proposed Section 1962(e) is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-12\">\u201cSubsection (e) provides that a violation is a continuing offense so long as one of the acts in the pattern produces a benefit to the offender. While the general criminal statute of limitations is five years, 18 U.S.C., Section 3282, certain offenses which produce a continuing result are also treated as continuing offenses. Conspiracy is such an offense. <em>See United States v. Borelli, </em>336 F.2d 376 (2d Cir. 1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 960, [85 S.Ct. 647, 13 L.Ed.2d 555] (1965); <em>see also, Bramblett v. United States, </em>231 F.2d 489 (9th Cir. 1958).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1194-13\">For another statutory provision making an offense continuing, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3284.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-14\">The fact that proposed \u00a7 1962(e) was not enacted as part of RICO indicates that Congress intended to rely on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3284.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>RICO is a federal law proscribing various racketeering acts which have an effect on interstate or foreign commerce. Certain of those racketeering, or predicate acts violate state law and RICO incorporates the elements of those state offenses for definitional purposes. State law offenses are not the gravamen of RICO offenses. RICO was not designed to punish state law violations; it was designed to punish the impact on commerce caused by conduct which meets the statute\u2019s definition of racketeering activity. To interpret state law offenses to have more than a definitional purpose would be contrary to the legislative intent of Congress and existing state law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">B. <em>The Scope of RICO</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">The district court granted motions to dismiss the indictments against all the magistrate defendants and the constable defendants because, as he interpreted \u00a7 1962(c) of RICO, the independent status of these defendants removed them from the statute\u2019s purview. Section 1962(c) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"apd-dedup-0\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly in the conduct of such enterprises\u2019 affairs through a pattern of racketeering activities . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1195-10\">The district court held that the magistrates and constables were not \u201cassociated\u201d with the enterprise within the meaning of the statute, concluding that \u00a7 1962(c) covers only those \u201cinside\u201d the enterprise rather than \u201coutside\u201d. 429 F.Supp. at 725-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-11\">We note at the outset that Congress specifically directed that the provisions of RICO \u201cshall be liberally construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>to effectuate its remedial purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Courts have interpreted RICO in accordance with this Congressional mandate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The legislative intent was to make RICO violations dependent upon behavior, not status. <em>See United States v. Mandel, </em>415 F.Supp. 997, 1018 (D.Md.1976). Section 1962(c) prohibits <em>any </em>person from engaging in the proscribed conduct, and defines the term \u201cassociated with\u201d as direct or indirect participation in the conduct of the enterprise. At the least, the activities of the magistrates and constables as described in the indictments constitute indirect participation in the Agency\u2019s affairs. Indeed, a strong argument may be made that the allegations in the indictments, if true, rendered the defendants employees of the Agency who participated directly in its affairs.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This is so because without the referrals from the magistrates and the assistance of the constables, the Agency\u2019s business and its income would have been less than it was during the period from 1970 to 1975. Moreover, it is alleged that these defendants were paid directly by the Agency in return for referral of clients, just as salesmen or agents would be paid a commission for like services.

The district judge reasoned that since the former Pennsylvania bribery statute <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> provided for a term of imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>not exceeding one year for one convicted of offering a bribe (a bribor),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> such offenses were not cognizable under RICO, which provides that the state offense must carry a penalty exceeding one year\u2019s incarceration.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">We note that prior to the recodification of the state bribery statute, 18 P.S. \u00a7 4304 punished a person engaging in \u201ccorrupt solicitation\u201d by imprisonment of not more than two years.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Following the \u201coccupation or profession\u201d of corrupt solicitation was also punishable by imprisonment not exceeding two years.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The indictment at Criminal No. 76-163 charged the former employees of and partners in the Agency with the practice or occupation of corrupt solicitation in violation of 18 P.S. \u00a7 4305 and, accordingly, states a predicate offense under \u00a7 1961(1) of RICO for those acts occurring prior to June 3, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">We note further that by systematic paying of bribes to public officials and employees, those making payments committed \u201cact[s] . . . involving bribery\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1)(A). The word \u201cinvolving\u201d utilized in the statutory definition of racketeering activity is broad enough to reach the conduct of owners and employees of a corrupt enterprise. The legislative history of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1)(A) specifically states that \u201cState offenses are included by generic designation.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This statement manifests the legislative' intent to incorporate the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Nardello, </em>393 U.S. 286, 89 S.Ct. 534, 21 L.Ed.2d 487 (1969), into the RICO statute. <em>Nardello </em>stands for the proposition that alleging a state violation which falls within the generic category of the predicate offense is adequate to charge a violation of the Travel Act.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The test for determining whether the charged acts fit into the generic category of the predicate offense is whether the indictment charges a type of activity generally known or characterized in the proscribed category, namely, any act or threat involving bribery. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961(1) and 1962(c) quoted at note 2 above. The Court stated that \u201c. the inquiry is not the manner in which States classify their criminal prohibitions but whether the particular state involved prohibits the extortionate activity charged.\u201d 393 U.S. at 295, 89 S.Ct. at 539. We conclude that under former Pennsylvania law there were several offenses fitting within the generic category of bribery <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and carrying prison terms in excess of one year. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>These were common law bribery<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and the above-mentioned offenses of corrupt solicitation and the practice of corrupt solicitation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Indeed, when the statute was reco-dified, all of these offenses were included in the new statute.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> For these reasons, we conclude that the indictments charge offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) and (d).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">In conclusion, we hold that the district court erred in suppressing the evidence and dismissing the indictments. We find the indictments to be sufficient, both on the conspiracy and the substantive counts, and reverse their dismissal by the district court.

Judge Fullam stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0d\">\u201cI perceive no merit in this argument. The RICO statute is concerned with defining the predicate offenses. An offense which, when committed, would have been indictable under Pennsylvania law is within the statutory definition. Any other construction would render the definition of \u2018pattern\u2019 essentially meaningless, and would render state statutes of limitations paramount over the federal limitations provisions. I therefore deem it unnecessary to consider whether prosecution for the state offenses would have been time-barred as of the date of the federal indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1195-8\">Additional support for our conclusion is found in case law interpreting similar statutes. In <em>United States v. Revel, </em>493 F.2d 1 (5th Cir. 1974), the appellants challenged the incorporation of state gambling statutes into Title 18 United States Code, Section 1955, as an element of that federal offense, arguing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoU\">\u201cA violation of state law is an element of the offense under \u00a7 1955. The Alabama statute of limitations for the crime alleged in the indictment expired before the date of the indictment. Therefore, no violation of state law existed at the time of the indictment, and because there was no state law violation, there could not have been a federal law violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1195-12\">Rejecting appellant\u2019s contention, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-13\">\u201cCertainly Congress could have incorporated state statutes of limitations into the federal statutes, but we cannot perceive any indication that it has done so ... To the contrary, Congress, in passing the 1970 act, emphasized the federal interest in dealing with organized crime because of the influence of organized criminal activities on the economy, security and general welfare of the entire country. Congress excluded local, transitory gambling activities from the scope of the law, leaving their regulation to state and local authorities, but it asserted federal jurisdiction over racketeering and large-scale gambling activities. In view of this bifurcated system of enforcement, it seems reasonable to use federal standards in enforcing the federal law. This is proper for \u00a7 1955, just as it is for \u00a7 1952. <em>United States v.
