Citizens Casualty Company of New York et al., </em>5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b258-5\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Joseph Guardino appeals from his conviction of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. His sole contention on appeal challenges the sufficiency of the evidence introduced to sustain his conviction. This contention is meritless as there was more than ample evidence to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Guardino was riding with a friend, Vernon Brewer, when Brewer\u2019s car was stopped for a routine citizenship check at the permanent Border Patrol checkpoint at Falfurrias, Texas. The Border Patrol officer detected the smell of marijuana and asked Brewer to open his trunk. A brief search revealed 49 pounds of marijuana in brick form located in a gunny sack in the trunk of Brewer\u2019s car. Brewer and Guardi-no were immediately arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">At trial, Guardino testified on his own behalf. He admitted knowing of the marijuana deal which was arranged by his brother, Brewer, and a family in south Texas. He also admitted knowing that the car he was riding in with Brewer, when stopped, was loaded with the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">This Court must sustain the verdict rendered below if there is substantial evidence to support it, taking the view most favorable to the government. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Here, the evidence clearly supports the inference that appellant was engaged in a joint venture with his brother and his friend, Brewer. Furthermore, appellant was plainly in constructive possession of the marijuana and the quantity discovered clearly supports the inference that distribution was intended. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>5 Cir. 1972, 469 F.2d 973. The conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
