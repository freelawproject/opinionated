This case is one in which a skilled and knowledgeable businessman formulated a plan to attempt to bring Grosse Pointe Mills, Inc. (Grosse Pointe), a Rome, Georgia carpet manufacturer, from a losing operation into the capitalist haven of profitability. The plan was to increase sales dramatically in hopes of reversing the nonprofit trend. To do so, Grosse Pointe had to acquire significantly increased inventories of production materials which required obtaining correspondingly greater amounts of credit. The pivotal aspect of this plan for Grosse Pointe, as with all financially weak companies, was how to secure additional credit. How this credit was obtained and how a guarantor seeks to avoid his guaranty obligation is the essence of this diversity based enforcement action which we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-16\">Under the direction of James S. Briggs, chief financial officer and a director of Grosse Pointe, and his hand-picked president for Grosse Pointe\u2019s operations, the strategy to get this increased credit for Grosse Pointe was developed and implemented. Briggs knew that Grosse Pointe\u2019s ability to obtain ready cash by factoring<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> its own accounts receivable had been extended as far as possible. Thus, any credit for the purchase of increased production inventories had to be procured via credit purchases from the suppliers. One of the earliest suppliers under this scheme was Integrated Products, Inc. which obtained a large yarn contract from Grosse Pointe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-17\">Since Integrated Products did not desire to extend credit directly to Grosse Pointe, it factored the account receivable from the Grosse Pointe purchase. However, before Crompton-Richmond as factor for Integrated, and later for seven other suppliers, would grant credit at Crompton-Richmond\u2019s risk for Grosse Pointe purchases, Crompton-Richmond <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sought and obtained on January 14,1970, the personal guaranty of James S. Briggs. Thus, the entire scheme as devel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>oped and executed by Briggs was to gain credit for the expansion of Grosse Pointe\u2019s business by having suppliers factor the accounts receivable created by Grosse Pointe\u2019s purchases<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 at least for those suppliers unwilling to extend credit directly to Grosse Pointe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">At the time James Briggs executed the guaranty agreement to ensure that Grosse Pointe obtained its inventory purchases- on credit, only an initial purchase of approximately $50,000 from Integrated was involved. However, Briggs did not sign a limited guaranty. The agreement covered \u201cany concern for which [Crompton-Rich-mond] may now or in the future act as factors to extend credit to Grosse Pointe Mills, Inc.\u201d Essentially Briggs was personally guarantying present and future contracts, obligations, and indebtedness of Grosse Pointe which Crompton-Riehmond factored. Also included in the guaranty agreement was a waiver of any notice requirements and any basis for Briggs\u2019 discharge except for full payment of Grosse Pointe\u2019s liabilities to Crompton-Riehmond.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>The agreement is by its very terms \u201c. . . an absolute, continuing, unconditional and unlimited guaranty of payment . . .. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">Unfortunately, the Briggs rescue plan failed and Grosse Pointe was declared bankrupt in September 1972. At that time, despite some concern over Grosse Pointe\u2019s financial position, Crompton-Richmond had, on the basis of the Briggs guaranty, factored approximately $645,040.23 for Cromp-ton-Richmond clients who had been suppliers to Grosse Pointe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">In refusing to pay Crompton-Richmond for the Grosse Pointe liabilities covered by the guaranty agreement, Briggs has presented before both this Court and the trial court two arguments contesting the fact of liability, (i) The $645,040.23 exceeds by far any reasonable amount contemplated by the parties at the execution of the guaranty agreement and, thus, requires his discharge for at least part of this figure, (ii) Crompton-Richmond\u2019s failure to observe a duty of good faith and due diligence or commercial reasonableness owed to Briggs as a guarantor necessitates his total discharge from liability under the guaranty. Appended to these defenses, Briggs contends that Crompton-Richmond failed to sufficiently prove the exact dollar extent of his liability under the guaranty agreement. Lastly, Briggs argues that the Trial Judge\u2019s denial of a -\u00a1ontinuance two days before trial was an anase of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-11\">\n<em>Erie Choices</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-12\">In evaluating the diversity claims presented, a federal court\u2019s normal procedure is to evaluate the E\u00f1e-Klaxon<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> mandated choice of law decision. However, by calling for application of the law of New York, the Briggs-Crompton-Richmond guaranty agreement relieves us of determining whether the trial court made the appropriate choice of law selection.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Ideal Structures Corp. v. Levine Huntsville Development Corp., </em>5 Cir., 1968, 396 F.2d 917, 925; Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws \u00a7\u00a7 186, 187. On oral argument the applicability of New York law was conceded by Briggs\u2019 counsel. Consequently, our review of the substantive liability challenges to the Trial Judge\u2019s findings under the clearly erroneous rule, F.R.Civ.P. 52(a), is framed in the context of New York guaranty law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>\n<em>The Unbuckled Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">As formulated by Briggs, the due diligence and reasonable contemplation arguments amount to a request to be discharged from liability based on the concept that a guarantor or surety is a \u201cfavorite of the law\u201d deserving protections from changes in the risks assumed by the guarantor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Despite these protests, we find that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are sufficiently supported under the protection of the Buckler and Shield of F.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">The record before this Court adequately demonstrates that this creditor-debtor-guarantor situation was one in which a highly educated and skilled businessman with extensive experience in factoring developed and executed a plan to finance Grosse Pointe\u2019s expansion program. During this period while acting as Grosse Pointe\u2019s chief financial officer, it is an unfathomable assertion that Briggs did not know that the very credit transactions he had contemplated were transpiring. How else would Grosse Pointe achieve its expansionary goal? And as each new purchase was procured from materials suppliers, which were not paid directly by Grosse Pointe, Briggs of all people knew of it. An additionally important point exists. Because the controlling ownership of Grosse Pointe was in his wife\u2019s name, Briggs\u2019 interest in the company extended further than that of a mere officer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This indirect ownership interest coupled with Briggs\u2019 officer status is indicative of the high degree of awareness of Grosse Pointe\u2019s financial status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-6\">Briggs occupies the status of one who knew what Grosse Pointe needed to survive and who obtained what was needed \u2014 even if later to no avail. In the apt words of the District Court,</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-9\">\u201c . . . the way to obtain increased supplies and materials was by execution of the guaranty contract with plaintiff, inasmuch as that guaranty was the vehicle by which Crompton permitted its factoring clients to extend additional credit to Grosse Pointe; such was in fact the result achieved by defendant, who was aware of the implications of signing the guaranty in his efforts directed at turning the company around.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-11\">\n<em>A Legal Shield</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-12\">Nor may the District Court\u2019s findings be set aside because an improper legal standard was utilized or a proper one was misapplied. <em>See, e. g., Theriault v. Silber, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 547 F.2d 1279, 1280; <em>Costello v. Lipsitz, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 547 F.2d 1267, 1277 n. 33. Briggs\u2019 theory that his obligation under the guaranty far exceeds any reasonable amount contemplated and that CromptonRichmond violated a duty owed him as a guarantor are belied by the guaranty agreement and are precluded by the relevant law. The guaranty is by its terms a continuing, unconditional one. Such a guaranty is recognized by the New York courts. See <em>Walter E. Heller &amp; Co. v. Cox, </em>2 Cir., 1972, 486 F.2d 1398, aff\u2019g, S.D.N.Y., 343 F.Supp. 519; <em>Indianapolis Morris Plan Corp. </em>v. <em>Karlen, </em>1971, 28 N.Y.2d 30, 319 N.Y.S.2d 831, 268 N.E.2d 632; <em>La Mar Hosiery Mills, Inc. v. Credit &amp; Commodity Corp., </em>1961, 28 Misc.2d 764, 216 N.Y.S.2d 186; <em>M. Lowenstein &amp; </em>Sons <em>v. Roselle Manufacturing Co., </em>1958, 9 Misc.2d 617, 171 N.Y.S.2d 7, aff\u2019d, 8 A.D.2d 592, 185 N.Y.S.2d 216. Under the guaranty Briggs could and did waive any duty Crompton-Richmond might arguably have owed him. <em>Cf. Walter E. Heller, supra, </em>at 527.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the New York Court stated in an analogous situation</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>\u201c . . . therefore, he may consent to anything to which the debtor has power to agree, that is, everything except to waive the equity of redemption in advance, and when he does so consent, he is not discharged because the creditor does that to which he has consented and to which lawfully he could consent (57 N.Y. Jur., Suretyship &amp; Guaranty \u00a7 202).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"An5\"><em>Indianapolis Morris Plan Corp., supra, </em>319 N.Y.S.2d at 835, 268 N.E.2d at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">Briggs agreed to an absolute, unconditional, and <em>unlimited </em>guaranty. He obtained what he wanted- \u2014 credit for Grosse Pointe \u2014 knowing that the guaranty possessed a waiver of the duty or duties he now urges as a basis for discharging his liability. Briggs\u2019 knowledge and intent added to the law\u2019s recognition of such a guaranty necessitates our upholding the trial court\u2019s determination that Briggs is liable under the unlimited guaranty for Grosse Pointe\u2019s indebtedness. See <em>Franklin National Bank of Long Island v. Palm Beach Builders, Inc., </em>1961, 28 Misc.2d 986, 221 N.Y. S.2d 133. To hold otherwise, this Court would permit a sophisticated guarantor knowingly to obtain extensions of credit for a debtor of the kind, form, and amount conceived and to subsequently renege on his guaranty of payment. We decline to allow one in Briggs\u2019 position to do so. <em>Cf. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith v. Brooks, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 548 F.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-7\">Insofar as Briggs\u2019 argument that some New York decisions, in recognizing the obligation of scrupulous fairness between surety-obligor, find breaches of such requirements, the Judge\u2019s findings and this total record negative the existence of any such equitable demands here. His complaint boils down to the assertion that he had to be informed of the conditions he, of all people, knew existed. It is almost to say that Crompton-Richmond had to tell him that he should not incur any further credit obligations for Grosse Pointe because if things did not work out he would owe the factor for the loss. If Crompton-Richmond did not have a duty to tell him those things, it certainly did not have to say \u201cNo\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-11\">\n<em>A Charge Back Made, A Penny Saved?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-12\">Although imposition of liability in a guaranty case generally ends the dispute when the amount owed is easily ascertainable, this case, which properly should have fallen into this category, does not. Because of Crompton-Richmond\u2019s cavalier approach to discovery, it denied that it had made any charge backs<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and denied the existence of records showing charge backs. Subsequently, almost $45,000.00 of such charges was revealed. Added to this factor is the destruction of records sought by Briggs\u2019 counsel to cross-check the accuracy of Cromp-ton-Richmond\u2019s trial proof on the extent of credit granted Grosse Pointe under the guaranty agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-13\">As proof of the amount of credit factored from Grosse Pointe suppliers, Crompton-Richmond introduced into evidence computer printouts of the account supported by testimony of the appropriate Crompton-Richmond personnel. The Trial Judge accepted this evidence and utilized it to determine the extent of Briggs\u2019 liability.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>The finding of $588,907.40 as Grosse Pointe\u2019s liability was not made simply on the basis of evidence adduced at trial. After the trial\u2019s conclusion, the Trial Judge ordered further delivery of Crompton-Richmond\u2019s records to Briggs\u2019 counsel and both sides filed post argument briefs which covered this proof of the amount of liability issue. Thus Briggs had the opportunity, by using the factor\u2019s records, trial evidence, and Grosse Pointe\u2019s own records, to point out in detail the claimed errors and deficiencies. Only after this additional, post-trial discovery did the District Judge make his findings. The trial court\u2019s reliance on these records, properly admitted into evidence as business records, and the post-trial discovery was proper and the evidence sufficiently supported this finding within the standard of F.R.Civ.P. 52(a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">\n<em>Nonabusive Denial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">Approximately two days prior to trial, information previously denied under oath relating to \u201ccharge backs\u201d was revealed to be incorrect. As already indicated, $44,-815.46 was charged back by Crompton-Rich-mond to one supplier, Delta Finishers, Inc. Because of this discovery only shortly before trial, Briggs\u2019 counsel sought a continuance so he could further investigate the existence of other charge backs and verify the amount of liability claimed by Cromp-ton-Richmond. This request was denied by the Trial Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">The grant or denial of a continuance is within the sound discretion of the Trial Judge. <em>Roberts v. Williams, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 456 F.2d 819, 824, <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 866, 92 S.Ct. 83, 30 L.Ed.2d 110; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>5 Cir., 1968, 402 F.2d 266, 267; Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Civil \u00a7 2352. Although we deplore Crompton-Richmond\u2019s attitude toward requests for information made during discovery and the filing by its counsel of statements under oath that turned out to be untrue, we find no abuse of discretion arising from the denial of Briggs\u2019 continuance motion. This is particularly true in light of the post-trial discovery and briefing ordered by the Trial Judge which fully ventilated Briggs\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1257-14\">, Factoring is used in this opinion in its usual connotation. A seller has certain accounts receivable which it acquired from the sale of goods or services. Instead of retaining these accounts receivable until paid by the purchaser, the seller can obtain cash for them by selling, assigning, or borrowing against his accounts receivable. Companies which extend cash on the basis of one\u2019s accounts receivable are factors. Generally, these accounts are accepted for less than face value, the difference representing the factor\u2019s fee for advancing immediate cash to the seller. One item included in determining this difference is the degree of risk of loss the factor assumes. The accounts receivable may be accepted at the factor\u2019s risk or at the client-seller\u2019s risk. If taken at the factor\u2019s risk, any loss due to the noncollectibility of an. account receivable is borne solely by the factor. Otherwise, the seller \u2014 not the factor \u2014 ultimately bears the loss for worthless accounts receivable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1257-19\">. Subsequent to the transactions involved in this lawsuit, Crompton-Richmond sold its factoring business to another corporation. However, it retained the account involving the suppliers of Grosse Pointe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">. Indeed, this is expressly stated in the guaranty agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">.

As part of a termination and division of business interests with a former partner, Grosse Pointe represents one of those businesses which became Briggs\u2019.

Viewed from the perspective that the purpose of the guaranty was known to Briggs, and that the extent of its usage was known or should have been known to the chief financial officer who developed this financing strategy, the existence of any due diligence or reasonableness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>requirement is questionable for one in Briggs\u2019 position vis-\u00e1-vis the debtor, Grosse Pointe\u2014 even absent the waiver provisions which exist in this case. This is particularly true when Briggs\u2019 ownership of Grosse Pointe through his wife is coupled with his executive status. See <em>generally </em>Restatement of Security \u00a7 86, comment c (1941).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">. Instead of the factor bearing the loss on an account receivable, the value of an account receivable in default is collected from or charged back to the seller \u2014 here one of Grosse Pointe\u2019s suppliers. \u201cCharge back\u201d is the terminology for this procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1261-14\">.

No question exists about the propriety of the admission of this evidence into the record. It was properly admitted. See <em>Hanley v.

Although Briggs does not contest the admission of this evidence, his attack is essentially one arguing its inaccuracy and incompleteness. As indicated in <em>Hanley, supra, </em>this is an assault on its weight, not on its admissibility. Of course, the weight accorded to such records is within the domain of the trier of fact \u2014 in this case the Trial Judge. See <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Peacock Constr.
