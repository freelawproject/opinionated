Senn contends that the Commission improperly concluded that Senn had failed to prove a public need for the proposed service and that it was error for the Commission to decline to grant a \u201cG\u201d application for service where Senn had secured the protection stemming from its \u201cE\u201d notices. We conclude that the Commission acted properly and legally. We therefore affirm its orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-9\">In <em>Russell Transfer, Inc. v. United States, </em>547 F.2d 231 (4 Cir. 1976), we had occasion to review the history of the Commission\u2019s treatment of \u201ctacking\u201d by common carriers holding two or more certificates having a common point of service. We repeat the history here:</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-14\">For years the Commission permitted irregular-route motor common carriers,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of which Senn is one, to combine, or \u201ctack,\u201d separate and unrestricted (as to tacking) operating authorities at their common points or \u201cgateways,\u201d so that they could provide a through service between points authorized in one certificate and those in another. In permitting this practice, the Commission never found a public need for such through service because the respective authorities were obtained in separate proceedings. It merely acquiesced in the practice of tacking. <em>Motor Common Carriers of Property </em>\u2014 Routes <em>and Service, </em>88 M.C.C. 415, 423 (1961). In such circumstances a \u201cright to tack\u201d did not constitute a part of the carrier\u2019s certificate. <em>Thompson Van Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>399 F.Supp. 1131, 1135-36 (D.D.C.1975), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>423 U.S. 1041, 96 S.Ct. 763, 46 L.Ed.2d 630 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-15\">To rationalize the resulting tacking operations, which involve high degrees of circuity when more direct operations would be in the public interest, the Commission established certain standards for elimination of those gateways. <em>Childress </em>\u2014 Elimination <em>Sanford Gateway, </em>61 M.C.C. 421, 428 (1952). If a carrier made an appropriate showing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it was authorized to operate directly without observing the gateway.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-17\">With the advent of the fuel crisis in 1973, the Commission concluded that its pri- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>or benign attitude toward gateway operations should be modified because of the inefficiencies which resulted from gateway use. <em>Motor Common Carriers of Property </em>\u2014 Routes <em>and Service </em>(hereafter <em>\u201cGateway Elimination\u201d), </em>119 M.C.C. 170, 171 (1973), 119 M.C.C. 530, 533 (1974). The gateway-elimination regulations of April, 1974, which resulted required all irregular route carriers to apply for expedited direct authority by either (a) \u201cletter-notice\u201d (or \u201cE\u201d notice) procedure, if the circuity involved was less than twenty percent (the amount of circuity which the Commission judged not to affect the competitive balance of existing carriers) (49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1065.-1(d)(1)); or (b) formal or \u201cG\u201d application, if the circuity was greater than twenty percent (49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1065.1(d)(2)). Since \u201cG\u201d applications require Commission adjudication before gateways can be eliminated, the Commission chose to follow the criteria articulated in <em>Childress </em>in deciding whether a \u201cG\u201d certificate should be granted. <em>Gateway Elimination, </em>119 M.C.C. at 550. Essentially, the carrier must establish, by evidence of prior operations, that it actually performs service through the gateway point, or, by evidence of shipper support, that a public need for the proposed through-service exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">Letter-notices filed with the Commission were not adjudicated at all, but were simply published in the Federal Register and became effective in fifteen days unless the carrier was otherwise notified by the Commission. Thus, by merely setting forth the appropriate information called for by the applicable gateway-elimination regulation, any carrier could eliminate its gateways and use a direct route where the involved circuity was less than twenty percent. <em>Gateway Elimination, </em>119 M.C.C. at 537, 541, 543-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">The regulations, as promulgated, have been found to be valid by the United States Supreme Court, <em>Thompson Van Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>423 U.S. 1041, 96 S.Ct. 763, 46 L.Ed.2d 630 (1976), <em>aff\u2019g per curiam, </em>399 F.Supp. 1131 (D.D.C.1975), and were upheld, as applied to transfers and acquisitions of irregular route certificates, in <em>Common Carrier Conference </em>\u2014 Irregular <em>Route v. United States, </em>534 F.2d 981 (D.C.Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 921, 97 S.Ct. 317, 50 L.Ed.2d 288 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-9\">The gateway regulations allowed the filing of \u201cG\u201d applications with respect to applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity which were pending before the agency on the date the regulations became effective. Senn had pending such an application for its Sub 80 certificate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Sub 80 application was granted on July 24, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-10\">Within sixty days after the issuance of the Sub 80 certificate, Senn filed the gateway-elimination application now under review. At the time that the gateway-elimination application was filed, Senn had already filed 170 letter-notices seeking to eliminate gateway use in order to commence direct operations between points involving circuities of twenty percent or less. A substantial portion of these notices sought authorization duplicating that involved in the \u201cG\u201d application, and Senn requested the Commission to take official notice of the letter-notices. The Commission denied Senn\u2019s \u201cG\u201d application because, <em>inter alia, </em>Senn failed to prove a public need for the proposed service or to delineate the extent of duplication between Senn\u2019s letter-notice applications and the \u201cG\u201d application. In its petition for reconsideration, Senn admitted that sixty-nine of its \u201cE\u201d notices were \u201ccompletely duplicated\u201d by the instant application. Senn also represented that it did not seek duplicating operating authorities but sought to eliminate the difficulties of multiple \u201cE\u201d notices; it therefore recognized that the grant of its \u201cG\u201d application would automatically cancel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>the duplicating \u201cE\u201d notices. Senn was, however, responding to the Commission\u2019s reliance on duplication as a reason for denying the \u201cG\u201d application, and Senn made no request that its outstanding \u201cE\u201d notices be exchanged for an identical \u201cG\u201d certificate, nor did it argue that any such exchange would be authorized or required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">By final order served August 16, 1976, the Commission denied Senn\u2019s petition for reconsideration, and Senn\u2019s petition for review followed on or about August 31, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">Senn\u2019s first attack on the validity of the Commission\u2019s order is that its application for a \u201cG\u201d certificate should have been granted to the extent that it duplicated its \u201cE\u201d notices. Its theory is since it is permitted to perform the services described in its \u201cE\u201d notices, it should be given the greater protection of a \u201cG\u201d certificate. Senn, in its petition for reconsideration, did not advance the argument in precisely the same form which it presses before us. As a consequence, the Commission urges on us the authorities which hold that, before a court may review a decision of the Commission, the Commission must have erred against a proper objection, and thus the failure to raise an issue or press an argument at the administrative level before the Commission forecloses a party seeking review from asserting it before us. <em>United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., </em>344 U.S. 33, 36-37, 73 S.Ct. 67, 97 L.Ed. 54 (1952); <em>see also United States v. Capital Transit Co., </em>388 U.S. 286, 291, 70 S.Ct. 115, 94 L.Ed. 93 (1949)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we view Senn\u2019s arguments before the Commission, they did raise, albeit in somewhat different form, the issue of whether the operating authority stemming from an \u201cE\u201d notice is identical to the operating authority granted by a \u201cG\u201d certificate. As a consequence, we think that we are not foreclosed by the <em>Tucker </em>rule from addressing the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-8\">Senn asserts that it would acquire greater rights or rights entitled to greater protection if it were granted a \u201cG\u201d certificate than if it were the possessor of only those rights flowing from an \u201cE\u201d notice. We are not persuaded that this is so. While Senn asserts that \u201cthere is a monumental difference between letter-notice authority and a certificate of public convenience and necessity,\u201d Senn can cite little to support this statement. It does cite <em>Artim Transportation System, Inc., Elimination of Gateways </em>(Unreported, Docket No. MC-41406, Sub. Nos. E-9, E-18, E-19, October 28, 1975), wherein it claims that the Commission indicated that letter-notice authority has no existence apart from its underlying certificated authority. Yet, as the Commission points out, it has held that both \u201cG\u201d certificates and \u201cE\u201d notices are separately transferable under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 5(2) and 212(b) of the Interstate Commerce Act when after the transfer the transferor will not retain a duplicating operating authority. <em>Maxwell Co., Petition for Declaratory Order, </em>126 M.C.C. 166 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-9\">Senn also calls attention to 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1065.1(d)(l)(ii) which provides that, in granting letter-authority the \u201cCommission reserves the right to require that a carrier terminate these operations if it should later be discovered that the carrier\u2019s operations do not qualify for the benefits of this rule.\u201d But that provision does not appear to introduce any greater substantial doubt concerning a carrier\u2019s rights to operate under an \u201cE\u201d notice than under a \u201cG\u201d certificate, since the Commission always has the right to correct inadvertent errors in certificates of public convenience and necessity. <em>American Trucking Associations, Inc. v. Frisco Transportation Co., </em>358 U.S. 133, 144-46, 79 S.Ct. 170, 3 L.Ed.2d 172 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"aqh-dedup-0\">In reply to Senn\u2019s contentions, the Commission asserts that <em>Eagle Motor Lines, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number><em>Inc. v. ICC, </em>545 F.2d 1015 (5 Cir. 1977), and <em>Maxwell Co., Petition for Declaratory Order, supra, </em>make it clear that a carrier has no fewer rights or less protection under a letter-notice than under a \u201cG\u201d certificate. <em>Eagle </em>held that the holder of operating rights under an \u201cE\u201d notice was entitled to the same notice and hearing before it could be revoked as the holder of a formal certificate of public convenience and necessity. <em>Maxwell, </em>as before stated, held that \u201cE\u201d rights were separately transferable from the underlying certificates if the transferor would not retain duplicating rights after the transfer was effected. While we agree that these decisions go far toward supporting the Commission\u2019s contention, there may be other differences between the two types of operating rights of which neither we nor Senn are presently aware. We therefore decide the issue by accepting the Commission\u2019s assertion that the carrier\u2019s rights under an \u201cE\u201d notice and a \u201cG\u201d certificate are identical but without prejudice to Senn\u2019s right to reopen the point if in future and in the context of actual facts it appears that there are substantial differences between the authority conferred upon a carrier under an \u201cE\u201d notice as distinguished from a \u201cG\u201d certificate. Unless and until those differences materialize, we agree that the Commission acted properly in denying Senn\u2019s \u201cG\u201d application to the extent that it duplicated Senn\u2019s \u201cE\u201d notices and that Senn had no right to exchange its \u201cE\u201d notice authorities for a \u201cG\u201d certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">Senn does not challenge the adequacy of the Commission\u2019s findings in denying its non-duplicating application under the usual Commission standards, nor does Senn claim that they are unsupported by substantial evidence under the established standards of judicial review. Instead, Senn contends that the Commission incorrectly found that Senn had failed to prove a public need for the authority sought in its \u201cG\u201d application because the Commission, as a matter of course, applies a lesser standard of proof in determining whether to grant unopposed applications and Senn met this lesser standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">Initially, as we view the record, parts of Senn\u2019s non-duplicating application were challenged by other carriers and all were challenged by at least one carrier so that any such lesser standard should not have been applied. In any event, the presence of opposition is not determinative. The regulation governing the granting of \u201cG\u201d applications by a carrier, like Senn, who relies on certificated authorities issued to it after November 23, 1973, as a result of an application pending on that date, spells out that the applicant is required to prove, with shipper support, that a public need exists for the proposed service. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1065.-1(d)(2)(ii)(B). The Commission has stated that carriers like Senn must prove that \u201cthe present or future public convenience and necessity\u201d required the proposed direct operations. <em>Gateway Elimination, </em>119 M.C.C. at 554. That standard, as well as the language of the regulation, embodies the mandate of \u00a7 207(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 307(a), that a certificate shall be issued \u201cif it is found that the proposed service . . . is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity; otherwise such application shall be denied . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-9\">The Commission has announced the criteria by which it evaluates public convenience and necessity, <em>Pan American Bus Lines Operation, </em>1 M.C.C. 190, 203 (1936), and it has described the type of evidence that it expects an applicant to produce, <em>John Novak Contract Carrier Application, </em>103 M.C.C. 555, 557 (1967). In both pronouncements, as well as in the statute, there is no suggestion that the statutory standard, the criteria for proof or the type of evidence, is any different to support an unopposed application than to support an opposed application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-10\">Nor do we see in any of the cases cited by Senn any clear emergence of a principle that an unopposed application requires a different quantum or quality of proof from one which is opposed. We do not think that legally or factually the proposition is established. It therefore follows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>that we reject this attack upon the correctness of the Commission\u2019s orders; and since the Commission\u2019s orders have substantial evidentiary underpinnings, they are</p>\n<p id=\"ArKl\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1240-10\">. \u201cIrregular-route\u201d carriers are those authorized to operate between designated points without restriction as to the route or highway to be utilized. <em>See generally Motor Common Carriers Property </em>\u2014 Routes <em>and Service, </em>88 M.C.C. 415 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1240-11\"><em>. . . . </em>(1) whether applicant is actually transporting a substantial volume of traffic from and to the points involved by operating in good faith through the gateway and, in so operating, is effectively and efficiently competing with the existing carriers, and (2) whether the elimination of the gateway requirement would enable applicant to institute a new service or a service so different from that presently provided as to materially improve applicant\u2019s competitive position to the detriment of existing carriers. In the former instance, a grant of authority sought is justified solely upon proof that the proposed operations would result in operating economies. ... In the latter instance, . . . it is incumbent upon applicant to prove public convenience and necessity the same as in any other application for new authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1241-7\">.

Senn could seek a declaratory judgment with respect to its rights under \u00a7 554(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(e).
