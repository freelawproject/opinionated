Weigel, United States District Judge, Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b462-15\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b462-16\">The jury returned a verdict of $50,000 for appellant in his action under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, against school officials and a school district, alleging termination of appellant\u2019s employment as a high school teacher for exercising rights under the First Amendment. The trial judge granted appellees\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. On appeal we reversed. On petition for certio-rari the Supreme Court vacated our judgment and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Mt. Healthy City School District v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977). <em>Murray v. Wagle, </em>431 U.S. 935, 97 S.Ct. 2645, 53 L.Ed.2d 252 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-17\"><em>Mt. Healthy </em>held that a teacher allegedly fired for exercising First Amendment rights has the burden of proving his conduct was constitutionally protected and was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in the decision not to rehire him. The burden then shifts to the school district and officials to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the teacher would have been fired even in the absence of the protected conduct. <em>Mt. Healthy City School District v. Doyle, supra, </em>429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-18\">In the present case the jury was instructed that appellant contended his contract would have been renewed \u201cbut for\u201d his exercise of constitutionally protected rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>and had the burden of showing that his contract was not renewed \u201cbecause of\u201d his exercise of those rights. The jury was further instructed that in order to find against the school officials, as it did, it must find they did not renew appellant\u2019s contract \u201cwithout having probable cause to believe that plaintiff was ineffective as a teacher.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">These instructions considered as a whole required appellant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that his contract would have been renewed except for his exercise of constitutionally protected rights. This is a greater burden of proof than that imposed upon the teacher in <em>Mt. Healthy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Appellees argue that the comments of the district judge when he granted judgment n. o. v. establish that the judge applied the <em>Mt. Healthy </em>standard, and that the court\u2019s judgment should therefore be affirmed. <em>Mt. Healthy </em>indicates the \u201ctrier-of-fact\u201d should determine whether the firing would have occurred without the protected conduct. <em>Mt. Healthy City School District v. Doyle, supra, </em>429 U.S. at 286, 97 S.Ct. 568. In <em>Mt. Healthy, </em>the case was tried to the judge. <em>See id. </em>at 287, 97 S.Ct. 568. In the present case, however, trial was to a jury. It was for the jury, not the judge, to determine whether appellant would have been fired in any event. The judgment n. o. v. can stand only if the evidence was insufficient for the jury to arrive at its verdict. <em>Cockrum v. Whitney, </em>479 F.2d 84, 85 (9th Cir. 1973). As indicated in our original opinion, the evidence was sufficient. <em>See Wagle v. Murray, </em>546 F.2d 1329, 1334-35 (9th Cir.), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>431 U.S. 935, 97 S.Ct. 2645, 53 L.Ed.2d 252 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Upon reconsideration, therefore, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion and the opinion at 546 F.2d 1329.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
