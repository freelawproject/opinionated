Their income is taxable directly to the shareholders, all of whom must consent to such treatment. The question in this ease is whether William B. Wilson, Inc. validly elected to come within subchapter S. That question in turn depends upon the definition of \u201cshareholder\u201d for purposes of determining who must consent. More particularly, the issue is whether that term extends to an individual who was the record holder of one out of 100,000 shares issued at one cent par but who held the share only to accommodate his brother, never assumed any role in the corporation, never actually received a stock certificate, neither received nor reported any income or loss with respect to the share, and surrendered the share upon request for no consideration. This issue arises because the individual\u2019s wife did not consent to subchapter S treatment, and her consent would concededly have been required in this community property state had the individual been a \u201cshareholder.\u201d We conclude that beneficial, not mere record, ownership of a share is a prerequisite to \u201cshareholder\u201d status, and we Uphold the Tax Court\u2019s determination that the individual here was not a shareholder. This corporation therefore came within subchapter S despite the absence of the wife\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-24\">Appellant William B. Wilson, a Midland, Texas rancher, incorporated his business on October 30, 1961, under the name William B. Wilson, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Believing that Texas law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>required a corporation to have three shareholders, appellant enlisted the aid of his fiancee Monetta Gauntt and his brother Ira Duke Wilson. Appellant caused the corporation to issue 100,000 shares of stock at one cent par, for which he paid the entire $1,000. He took 99,998 shares, and the corporation issued one share each to Ira and Monetta.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At some later time Ira paid appellant one dollar for the share issued in his name. Ira never received a stock certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">In November 1961 the corporation filed the appropriate IRS form electing subchap-ter S treatment. Appellant, Ira and Monet-ta executed the accompanying consent statement. Ira\u2019s wife, Adele Wilson, was not asked to sign the statement and has never consented to the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">In November 1963 Ira transferred his share to appellant. The transfer, made at appellant\u2019s request, was without consideration. During his two years as a record shareholder, Ira had taken no action whatsoever with respect to the corporation other than his execution of the subchapter S consent. Although he was also a director, he attended no meetings, received no information, and neither requested nor was asked to assume any role in corporate affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">The corporation and appellant successfully claimed subchapter S treatment for each year from 1961 through 1967. Accordingly, the corporation paid no tax on its income. The corporation suffered losses in five of those seven years, and its net loss for the seven-year period exceeded $130,000. In 1961 appellant deducted on his individual return the corporation\u2019s entire loss. From 1962 through 1966 appellant reported a proportionate share of the earnings or losses. He computed his share for each year as though he held 99,998 of 100,000 shares.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1967 appellant deducted the corporation\u2019s entire loss.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No one questioned the propriety of the 1961 through 1967 tax returns, and those years are apparently closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-14\">In December 1968 the corporation was liquidated and all its assets transferred to appellant. He included his distributive share of the corporation\u2019s 1968 income on his individual return.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The corporation submitted a return pursuant to subchapter S indicating that no corporate tax was payable. The Commissioner determined, however, that subchapter S treatment was inap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>propriate because the corporation\u2019s \u201cpassive investment income\u201d exceeded twenty percent of its gross receipts for that year. See I.R.C. \u00a7 1372(e)(5)(C). Finding that the corporation owed $12,513.86 in taxes on its 1968 income of $38,660.51, the Commissioner sent a notice of liability to appellant, who is concededly the corporation\u2019s transferee under \u00a7 6901 and who therefore would be liable for any 1968 corporate deficiency. Appellant filed suit in the Tax Court. Unable to fault the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion that subchapter S treatment was inappropriate for 1968, appellant challenged the liability determination on the grounds that subchapter S treatment had been improper all along because of Adele\u2019s failure to sign the consent in 1961. Accordingly, he argued, the pass through of the 1967 corporate losses to appellant individually had been made in error, and those losses properly remained with the corporation, available for carryover to 1968. The effect of such a conclusion would be to provide the corporation with sufficient carryover losses to offset all the corporation\u2019s 1968 income, eliminating any corporate tax liability for that year. The Tax Court rejected appellant\u2019s position, 34 T.C.M. 463 (1975), and he appeals. The sole issue before us is whether Adele\u2019s consent to subchapter S treatment was necessary. The Commissioner concedes that if Ira was a \u201cshareholder\u201d for consent purposes, appellant must prevail.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">A corporation\u2019s election of subchapter S treatment is valid \u201conly if all persons who are shareholders in such corporation . consent to such election.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 1372(a). One reason for this requirement is the effect that subchapter S election has on a shareholder\u2019s individual taxes. A shareholder must include in income his proportionate share of the electing corporation\u2019s undistributed taxable income, I.R.C. \u00a7 1373, and may deduct his share of the corporation\u2019s net operating losses, I.R.C. \u00a7 1374. Congress authorized these tax consequences only for individuals who choose them.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">This rationale for the consent requirement provides the backdrop for our inquiry. For purposes of the consent provision, the term \u201cshareholders\u201d must mean those who bear the tax consequences of the election. <em>See </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.1371-l(d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because beneficial ownership of stock, not mere record ownership or other formal indicia, determines who bears those tax consequences,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> beneficial ownership also provides the standard for determining who must consent to the subchapter S election. <em>See Pacific Coast Music Jobbers, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>457 F.2d 1165 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>Kean v. Commissioner, </em>469 F.2d 1183 (9th Cir. 1972); <em>Hook v. Commissioner, </em>58 T.C. 267 (1972); <em>Hoffman v. Commissioner, </em>47 T.C. 218 (1966), <em>aff\u2019d on basis of tax court opinion, </em>391 F.2d 930 (5th Cir. 1968).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>We need not and do not attempt in this opinion to articulate an overriding standard for determining beneficial ownership. Shareholders in close corporations generally have some role (however formal or minor) in corporate governance, bear a risk of corporate failure, and stand to share in corporate successes. The extent to which the individual in question exhibits these characteristics helps determine whether he is a beneficial shareholder.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These characteristics are generally evidenced by the parties\u2019 understanding of their relationship to the corporation and by their behavior both before and after the challenged transaction. That understanding and behavior provide a much more reliable guide than the formal rights that may exist between the parties. No one criterion is controlling; different factors will carry weight in different contexts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">We recognize the interest in providing rules clearly specifying the \u201cshareholders\u201d who must consent to an election.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Other things being equal, it would be desirable for taxpayers to know whether they had complied with the subchapter S prerequisites. But at least when, as here and in <em>Hook v. Commissioner, </em>58 T.C. 267 (1972), the issue is whether a record shareholder also qualifies as a beneficial shareholder, taxpayers can assure qualification by securing the consent of all record shareholders.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In any event the interest in certainty must yield to the rule that those whose taxes are affected by the subchapter S election must give their consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">Before turning to apply the governing principles to the case at bar, we must determine the scope of review of the Tax Court\u2019s decision. The issue of the appropriate standards for determining beneficial ownership is of course a question of law with respect to which our review is plenary. Given the proper standards, however, the question whether an individual meets them and qualifies as a beneficial shareholder is one of fact. If the finder of fact applies the correct principles, we must uphold the decision unless it is clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>In the ease at bar the Tax Court applied the appropriate standards.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The question before us is therefore whether that court\u2019s conclusion that Ira was not the beneficial owner of any stock is clearly erroneous. We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The circumstances indicate that Ira became record holder of a single share solely to accommodate his brother but that he never sought or received any of the incidents of ownership that would give the transaction economic substance. Ira took no part in corporate activities and exhibited no interest in them. He earned no return and did not report his proportionate share of the corporate earnings. He readily surrendered his share without consideration.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In sum, Ira\u2019s objective behavior would have been no different had there been an explicit agreement that he would hold a share in name only, having no right to participate in corporate affairs or earnings, and having no power to alienate his share or even to retain it against a request for its return. The absence of such an explicit agreement does not undermine the conclusion that Ira held no beneficial interest; in these cases we must often rely upon the circumstantial evidence that the parties\u2019 observable behavior provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Appellant emphasizes that both he and Ira, called as witnesses by the opposing sides, testified that they considered Ira a shareholder. Even if we were to assume that they used the term in accordance with its meaning under the relevant tax provision, the contrary inferences properly drawn from their behavior would entitle the finder of fact to conclude that Ira was not a beneficial shareholder. Although, as the government concedes, the evidence would be consistent with a finding for appellant, it is also consistent with the Tax Court\u2019s contrary conclusion. The Tax Court\u2019s determination is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">In reaching our result we have emphasized the facts here rather than undertaken a detailed analysis of the factual patterns in other cases. In this area precedents provide only limited guidance. We pause briefly, however, to reject the appellant\u2019s argument that the result here is inconsistent with <em>Millar v. Commissioner, </em>34 T.C.M. 554 (1975), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>540 F.2d 184 (3d Cir. 1976). In <em>Millar, </em>R. H. Jamison, Jr. organized a corporation and provided its funding but took none of its stock. The record shareholders consented to the subchapter S election, and the Tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Court held that those shareholders were entitled to deduct their proportionate shares of the corporate losses. Unlike in the case at bar, the shareholders at issue in <em>Millar </em>\u201cfully exercised their rights as shareholders,\u201d 34 T.C.M. at 563,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and reported their shares of corporate losses on their individual returns. Jamison, whom appellant here attempts to analogize to himself, owned no stock and claimed no losses. Nothing in <em>Millar </em>suggests that a record shareholder who takes absolutely no part in corporate affairs and who holds his share only at the request of a predominating shareholder automatically qualifies as a \u201cshareholder\u201d for purposes of the consent provision of subchapter S.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Indeed, the other authorities strongly support our conclusion that Ira did not come within the beneficial ownership standard. In <em>Hook v. Commissioner, </em>58 T.C. 267 (1972), the case bearing the closest factual resemblance to ours, the sole shareholder transferred 5,000 shares to his attorney. Exactly as in the case at bar, the attorney took no action as a shareholder, failed to reflect the transaction on his tax return, and surrendered the shares upon request without consideration. The court concluded that the attorney\u2019s consent to subchapter S treatment was not required. Just as Ira took his' share to assist his brother, in <em>Hook </em>the attorney accepted his shares \u201cas an accommodation to a valued client.\u201d 58 T.C. at 276.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See also Hoffman v. Commissioner, supra; Pacific Coast Music Jobbers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, supra; Kean v. Commissioner, supra. Cf. Beirne </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>52 T.C. 210 (1969) (applying beneficial ownership concept for purposes of determining to whom a subchapter S corporation\u2019s income was allocable); <em>Duarte v. Commissioner, </em>44 T.C. 193 (1965) (same); <em>Rupe Investment Co. v. Commissioner, </em>266 F.2d 624 (5th Cir. 1959) (applying beneficial ownership concept for purposes of record holder\u2019s taxation regarding non-subchapter S corporation\u2019s dividends and record holder\u2019s subsequent \u201csale\u201d of shares at loss).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Because Ira was not a beneficial shareholder, his wife\u2019s consent to subchapter S taxation was not necessary. The 1961 election was therefore valid, and the corporation\u2019s 1967 losses were properly allowed to the shareholders. The losses were not available for carryover to 1968, and because of that year\u2019s subchapter S termination, the corporation was accountable for income taxes. As transferee, appellant is liable for those taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">We do not today write for all shareholders or all corporations in the shadow of subchapter S. We attempt economic realism and an avoidance of making the S more sinuous than corporate life demands. We simply posit the proposition that not every person whose name appears on a certificate of stock or on a stock ledger is a shareholder who must consent to subchapter S election.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">The Tax Court\u2019s decision is</p>\n<p id=\"AvtB\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-19\">.

Commissioner, </em>469 F.2d 1183 (9th Cir. 1972); <em>Hoffman v. Commissioner, </em>47 T.C. 218 (1966), <em>aff\u2019d on basis of tax court opinion, </em>391 F.2d 930 (5th Cir. 1968).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b749-12\">. <em>See Beirne v. Commissioner, </em>52 T.C. 210 (1969); <em>Duarte v. Commissioner, </em>44 T.C. 193 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b749-13\">. Appellant cites <em>W &amp; W Fertilizer Corp. v. United States, </em>527 F.2d 621 (Ct.Cl.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 974, 96 S.Ct. 2173, 48 L.Ed.2d 798 (1976) for the proposition that formal, not beneficial, ownership controls. That case, however, dealt with a different issue: the definition of shareholder for purposes of the rule that a subchapter S corporation can have no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>shareholders other than individuals. The requirements that shareholders be individuals and that they give their consent serve distinct purposes; the definitions of shareholder need not be the same. A conclusion that formal ownership governs the <em>W &amp; W Fertilizer </em>issue therefore would not be inconsistent with the well established rule that beneficial ownership determines who must consent to the subchap-ter S election.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b750-6\">. Additional considerations may affect other cases. We do not attempt to formulate exclusive or comprehensive factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\">. The Commissioner renounces reliance on any suggestion that Ira\u2019s one-share holding was de minimis. As the Commissioner concedes, a subchapter S election requires the consent of the holder of even a single share having little value and representing an inconsequential proportion of the business. The Commissioner\u2019s contention is solely that in substance Ira was not the holder of even a single share.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b750-8\">. The Commissioner of course does not assert, and we would view as frivolous, any suggestion that Congress intended the shareholder\u2019s path to subchapter S treatment to be a tortuous one. We attribute no significance to the choice of the meandering \u201cS\u201d as a label. Subchapter O, after all, is not well rounded; subchapter L does not turn square corners'; and subchapter I is not straightforward. We view as mere coincidence the fact that subchapter X is unknown and subchapter M has its ups and downs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b750-12\">. Even in the converse situation when the issue is whether someone not a record holder is a beneficial owner, courts have consistently held that beneficial ownership is the governing standard. <em>See Pacific Coast Music Jobbers, supra; Kean v. Commissioner, supra; Hoffman v. Commissioner, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b750-13\">. Our prior decisions have not expressly invoked the clearly erroneous standard but are consistent with our conclusion that that standard applies. <em>See Pacific Coast Music Jobbers, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>457 F.2d 1165, 1173 (5th Cir. 1972) (concluding that evidence was \u201cquite sufficient to uphold the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion\u201d); <em>cf. Rupe Investment Co. v. Commissioner, </em>266 F.2d 624 (5th Cir. 1959) (framing beneficial ownership question in non-subchap-ter S setting as \u201cwhether the Tax Court drew the correct inferences from the undisputed facts\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b751-6\">. Appellant disagrees, emphasizing the Tax-Court\u2019s use of part of Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.1371 \u2014 1(d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJk\">Persons for whom a stock in a corporation is held by a nominee, agent, guardian, or custodian will generally be considered shareholders of the corporation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">The applicability of this language to the consent issue is not free from doubt. <em>See </em>note 7 <em>supra. </em>Appellant focuses however, not on the regulation\u2019s relevance but on the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that Ira was a \u201cnominee.\u201d Citing cases from other contexts purportedly defining that word, appellant argues that the Tax Court ascribed to \u201cnominee\u201d an unduly broad meaning. We disagree. We reject any attempt to divine that term\u2019s universal meaning. We read the regulation to mean simply that the governing standard is not record or formal ownership but rather that concept that, for want of a better word, courts have labeled beneficial ownership. The Tax Court did not waver in its adherence to the appropriate standard. That court, like the regulation, used \u201cnominee\u201d as a convenient phrase to express a result rather than as a substantive concept that aided analysis. The regulation is but another indication that the task before us is to ferret out the real owners of the corporation\u2019s stock.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b751-11\">. We note that the corporation\u2019s apportionment of its earnings and losses among its shareholders did not change in 1963 when Ira surrendered his share. The corporation continued to show as Ira\u2019s share 1/100,000. Appellant asserts that this indicates only that the corporation was not too closely in touch with its accountant. Presumably, however, had the transaction carried real substance, those concerned might have brought the transfer to the accountant\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">In addition, the corporation did not assign Ira any share of the corporate losses for 1961. While the amount of Ira\u2019s share would have been nominal, our conclusion is not undermined by this initial failure to include Ira as a shareholder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b752-5\">. Appellant notes that the only rights the <em>Mil-lar </em>opinion expressly states the shareholders exercised were the electing of subchapter S, the pledging of their stock, and the claiming of corporate losses on their individual returns. The opinion does not, however, indicate they exercised no other rights, and as the sole record shareholders they presumably performed the formal tasks that must be performed by shareholders. Moreover, there was apparently no question that corporate earnings, which were sought but never materialized, would have inured to the benefit of the record shareholders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b752-10\">. In <em>Hook </em>the sol\u00e9 shareholder sought to terminate the subchapter S election effective in 1966. He had missed the January 31, 1966 deadline for voluntary termination, <em>see </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 1372(e)(2), and he claimed that the December 1966 transfer to his attorney, coupled with the attorney\u2019s refusal to consent to the continuation of subchapter S treatment, revoked the subchapter S election for 1966. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 1372(e)(1). The court expressly reserved the question whether the apparent purpose of avoiding subchapter S continuation would support its result, relying wholly on the attorney\u2019s lack of beneficial ownership irrespective of tax avoidance motives.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
