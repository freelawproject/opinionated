Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 4097 Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b262-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b262-22\">Appellants in this case, seeking to represent in a class action some 47 vocational educational teachers at the Macon Area Vocational-Technical School, filed suit against members of the Bibb County Board of Education; alleging that the Board had deprived them of federally protected rights by not giving them the same supplement, normally $800 annually, to the state-paid minimum base salary that the Board provides for the elementary and secondary school teachers it employs. Alleging jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), they sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as the award of back pay. They also alleged that the Board\u2019s policy violated their rights under Constitution Article 1, Section 10 (impairing obligation of contracts). On June 4, 1976, the district court entered a preliminary order, based on this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Muzquiz v. City of San Antonio, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 528 F.2d 499 (en banc), that it was without jurisdiction to award the back pay damage claim, but it maintained jurisdiction for consideration of the claim for declaratory and injunctive relief. The parties agreed to submit the case on briefs with evidentiary docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ments attached. On Feb. 16, 1977, final judgment was entered by the court, ruling that appellants were not entitled to any relief, based essentially on the following considerations:</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">1. Under the present schedules, the base salaries for \u201cvo-tech\u201d teachers in the secondary schools were higher than those for teachers of academic subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">2. The classification in this case was not a suspect one calling for stricter scrutiny, since the classification was based on economic and policy considerations and was totally unrelated to the types of personal traits and stereotyped group characteristics which have formed the basis for classifications which have been found to be suspect. See <em>Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia, </em>427 U.S. 307, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">3. One of the chief considerations advanced by the Bibb County Board to justify its policy was that its secondary and elementary schools were operated solely for the benefit of students in Bibb County, whereas its post-secondary vocational programs serve not only Bibb County students but also students from neighboring counties throughout the state. Thus the Board\u2019s decision reflects a determination to roughly correlate local financial support of educational programs with local utilization and benefit from them, and because of the limited funds available, if the Board did otherwise, a curtailment of all vocational programs and diminution in their quality might result.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">4. The Supreme Court has stated with respect to the administration of public education that, \u201cThe very complexity of the problems of financing and managing a statewide public school system suggests that \u2018there will be more than one constitutionally permissible way of solving them,\u2019 and that, within the limits of rationality, \u2018the legislature\u2019s efforts to tackle the problems\u2019 should be entitled to respect.\u201d <em>San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 41 \u2014 42, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 1301-1302, 36 L.Ed.2d 16,48 (1973). Here since the Board of Education acted well within its constitutional discretion, the plaintiffs are not entitled to declaratory or injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">We affirm the judgment of the district court, both as to the claim for back pay, and as to the denial of declaratory and injunc-tive relief, concluding that the classification in this case is constitutional and rationally related to a legitimate state end.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
