The Commission issued subpoenas to many tour operators, including appellants. Appellants refused to comply, claiming that they were indirect air carriers and thus subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Civil Aeronautics Board. Acting under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 49, the Commission sought enforcement of its subpoenas in federal district court. The court granted enforcement, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-21\">The Commission\u2019s investigative powers derive primarily from 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 46(a) &amp; (b). These powers have express limits: with some exceptions, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 46(h), the Commission may not investigate, or require reports from, \u201cbanks and common carriers subject to\u201d the Interstate Commerce Act. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46(a) &amp; (b). Appellants do not claim that anything in \u00a7 46 immunizes them from the Commission\u2019s subpoenas. Instead, they point to \u00a7 45, which defines the Commission\u2019s regulatory powers and contains more exceptions than \u00a7 46. In particular, it withholds from the Commission any power to prevent unfair competition or deceptive practices by \u201cair carriers and foreign air carriers subject to the Federal Aviation Act of 1958\u201d. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 45(a)(6). Appellants claim that they are air carriers because they undertake \u201cindirectly ... to engage in air transportation.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-22\">Appellants would have us read the air carrier exemption of \u00a7 45 into \u00a7 46. We decline to do so. The legislative history cited by appellants is not compelling, and in any event we see no need to resort to it. The language of \u00a7 46 is plain, and appellants do not convince us that the inconsist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>encies between sections 45 and 46 create an unworkable regulatory scheme. <em>Barry v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>555 F.2d 3 at 7 (1st Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Appellants note, however, that 'the Commission\u2019s purpose in this investigation is to determine whether tour operators and others have engaged in unfair competition or deceptive practices in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Because \u00a7 45 deprives the Commission of power to enforce this Act against them, they believe, the investigation must be halted. The Commission counters by claiming that appellants are not in fact indirect air carriers and thus that they may be regulated by the Commission. This is not, however, the sort of dispute that ought to be settled in a subpoena enforcement proceeding. An agency\u2019s investigations should not be bogged down by premature challenges to its regulatory jurisdiction. <em>See, e. g., FTC v. Crafts, </em>355 U.S. 9, 78 S.Ct. 33, 2 L.Ed.2d 23 (1957); <em>Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. v. Walling, </em>327 U.S. 186, 66 S.Ct. 494, 90 L.Ed. 614 (1946); <em>Endicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins, </em>317 U.S. 501, 63 S.Ct. 339, 87 L.Ed. 424 (1943). These subpoenas do not fit within the narrow exception proscribing agency investigations that wander unconscionably far afield; the Commission\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction over appellants may be clouded but it is not plainly spurious. <em>See SEC v. Howatt, </em>525 F.2d 226 (1st Cir. 1975); <em>Oklahoma Press, supra, </em>327 U.S. at 213, 66 S.Ct. at 508 (investigation may go forward unless \u201cirrelevant to any lawful purpose or . unauthorized by law\u201d); <em>Endicott Johnson, supra, </em>317 U.S. at 509, 63 S.Ct. at 343 (evidence may be gathered unless \u201cplainly incompetent or irrelevant to any lawful purpose\u201d of agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
