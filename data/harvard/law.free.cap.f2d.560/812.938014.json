The Government voluntarily dismissed the \u00a7 1014 count (Count Nine) prior to trial. At the close of all the evidence, the court directed a verdict of acquittal on five of the eight remaining counts. The case was submitted to the jury on the conspiracy count (Count One), one count of aiding and abetting a misapplication of bank funds (Count Two), and one count of aiding and abetting a false entry (Count Eight). The jury convicted Barclay only on the false entry violation charged in Count Eight of the indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>quently, Barclay was placed on probation for a period of five years, the first 120 days to be spent in the custody of the Attorney General on a work release program, and ordered to make restitution to the Steel City National Bank for the balance owing on the loan involved in Count Eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Because of the manner in which we resolve this appeal, a full statement of the transactional facts regarding Barclay\u2019s dealings with the Steel City National Bank is unnecessary. It is sufficient to state that Barclay, President of Rittenhouse Investment Inc., (Rittenhouse) needed loans in order to satisfy the liquidity requirements of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange applicable to the corporation. Neither Barclay nor Rittenhouse could borrow a sufficient amount from the bank without going over the bank\u2019s lending limit. On May 14, 1970, the bank ostensibly lent $35,000 to Charles Wasserman, a Rittenhouse commodity salesman. Wasserman signed a note for the amount of the loan, and Barclay signed guarantees for the loan personally and on behalf of Rittenhouse. Barclay and his wife also executed an assignment of the beneficial interest in their residence as collateral for the Wasserman loan. Stanley Johnson, vice-president of the bank, requested Wasserman to cash the check at another bank. Wasserman took the check to the National Boulevard Bank where he had an account, deposited it, and wrote a certified check to Barclay for $35,000 so that Rittenhouse could meet the Exchange\u2019s latest financial requirements. The Wasser-man loan resulted in a bank Interview and Memorandum Sheet for Charles Wasserman which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-10\">5/14/70 SJ Loaned him $35,000 for 30 days unsecured at 9/2%. He may need an additional 30 or 60 days extension but he expects to have in [sic: it] paid in full not later that [sic: than] August, 1970.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">The entry of information on this Interview Sheet was the subject of the \u00a7 1005 charge set forth in Count Eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">On appeal, Barclay argues that he was deprived of a fair trial by virtue of the district court\u2019s refusal to define specific intent for the jury, the court\u2019s improper instruction regarding the elements of the offense of making a false entry, and the court\u2019s failure to properly instruct the jury with regard to the essential elements of the offense of aiding and abetting. Additionally, Barclay argues that the Government failed to prove that the principal, Stanley Johnson, actually made the entry on the bank records, thus precluding an aiding and abetting conviction, that the entry recorded on the bank memorandum sheet was literally true, and that no logical distinction can be drawn between the court\u2019s grant of judgments of acquittal on three counts of the indictment and its denial of the judgment of acquittal on Count Eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">The record establishes that both the Government and the defendant tendered the La Buy \u00a7 4.04 \u201cspecific intent\u201d instruction, but that the district court refused to give that instruction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>Government concedes that it was required to prove that Barclay shared the intent of the principal, Stanley Johnson, and that the intent to injure or defraud is the specific intent required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>United States v. Pollack, </em>503 F.2d 87 (9th Cir. 1974). The Government contends, however, that, when the instructions given in the instant ease are examined, it is apparent that the trial judge accurately instructed the jury concerning the essential elements of the crime of aiding and abetting false statements by a bank official. In its brief to this court the Government omits to mention that it tendered, and the district court refused an instruction substantially incorporating La Buy \u00a7 4.07.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead it argues that its Instruction No. 32, which was given by the district court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> adequately stated the essential elements necessary to convict Barclay of aiding and abetting Johnson in violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">The trial judge refused four of the defense-tendered instructions and three of the Government-tendered instructions which focused attention on the degree of specific intent necessary to find Barclay guilty. We have found no instruction from our examination of the record which, standing alone, adequately explained the specific mental state which the Government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Although Government Instruction No. 32 does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>state as an essential element that Barclay must have knowingly aided and abetted Johnson, there is no explanation that Barclay must have acted with the required specific intent to defraud or injure the bank or aid Johnson in doing so. The Government candidly admits that because there can be no violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 alone, the intent required is defined by the substantive offense and is to aid or abet its commission. <em>See Snyder v. United States, </em>448 F.2d 716 (8th Cir. 1971). As the Eighth Circuit later explained, \u201c[t]he defendant must act or fail to act with the specific intent to facilitate the commission of a crime by another.\u201d <em>United States v. Bryant, </em>461 F.2d 912, 920 (8th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-23\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>Third: that the defendant Donald Barclay did knowingly aid and abet Stanley Johnson in causing the false entry to be made. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>In the opinions articulating this \u201cspecific intent\u201d requirement the trial judge had ready access to an acceptable formulation of a \u201cspecific intent\u201d instruction. Nonetheless, the trial judge not only refused the jointly requested La Buy \u00a7 4.04 but stated he deemed inapplicable to the case the Government\u2019s formulation of La Buy \u00a7 4.07. <em>See </em>note 4 <em>supra. </em>Denial of the former instruction apparently rested in large part upon the court\u2019s view that the traditional distinction between \u201cgeneral intent\u201d and \u201cspecific intent\u201d is less than comprehensible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The difficulty of formulating clarifying instructions so as to avoid incomprehensibility is one which we readily recognize. \u201cBecause of the very commonness of [some pertinent] words, the straining for making the clear more clear has the trap of producing complexity and consequent confusion.\u201d <em>Lawson, supra, </em>507 F.2d at 442. Nevertheless, where the articulation of the law is essential to the trial\u2019s propriety, the task cannot be avoided, as difficult as it may be. It would be, we reluctantly admit, unrealistic to think that every juror understands every concept to which he or she is exposed in the court\u2019s charge. The best we can do under our adversary system is to see that the necessarily applicable law is made available to the jury in as understandable as possible form.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">The denial of the latter instruction, La Buy \u00a7 4.07, rested on the judge\u2019s view that the facts made it an unacceptable part of the jury charge. Still, as the trial judge himself recognized, the court had ample power to reformulate in comprehensible English the essential requirement of an intent to injure or defraud the bank or to deceive any of its officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">We think the district court\u2019s refusal of instructions bearing on both \u201cspecific intent\u201d and the \u201cintent to defraud\u201d led to a jury charge which failed to provide adequate criteria by which the jury could determine whether or not both Johnson and Barclay had the requisite specific intent to injure or defraud the bank. In fact, it appears that the jurors did experience some confusion over the \u201cintent\u201d requirement. After more than eleven hours of actual deliberation, the jury sent out written questions, one of which asked for a definition of intent. At that point, the district court replied</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-10\">The word \u201cintent\u201d refers to the purpose one has in performing an act. The instructions previously given you describe the intent required under each Count of the indictment, and I do not believe I can add anything to what I have already said.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlO\">Assuming that the Government\u2019s assertion that the words \u201cintent\u201d and \u201cpurpose\u201d express the same thought and idea finds support in the decided cases, we do not agree that the court\u2019s supplemental charge was both accurate and complete. We agree with the defendant-appellant that the court\u2019s reply to the jury\u2019s question reinforced the basic misconception that Barclay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>could be found guilty of aiding and abetting a \u00a7 1005 violation by merely knowingly securing a loan from Johnson without also knowing that Johnson was going to make a false entry with the specific intent to injure or defraud the bank and without Barclay himself having the specific intent to injure or defraud the bank, commit a crime, or aid Johnson in committing a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The situation might have been corrected somewhat if the judge had not refused to give Government Instruction No. 6 or some reformulation thereof. In one colloquy with the attorneys, the trial judge stated that</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">the real crux of this case is going to be a finding of the conspiracy count with specific reference to what the facts of this case are, finding of false entries, <em>the intent to defraud. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"AFZ7\">Having recognized that the question of intent to defraud was of particular significance in the case, the trial judge subsequently determined that the Government-tendered version of La Buy \u00a7 4.07 \u2014 the standard \u201cintent to defraud\u201d instruction\u2014 was inapplicable. There is nothing in the record which either explains or justifies the judge\u2019s shift in position.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">The Government argues that <em>United States v. Scoblick, </em>124 F.Supp. 881 (M.D.Pa. 1954), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>225 F.2d 779 (3d Cir. 1955), supports affirmance of the instant conviction. We do not agree. In that case, Scobiick was convicted of aiding and abetting a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005. Even though the term \u201cspecific intent\u201d was never formally included in the instructions of the trial court,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the appellate court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The Government argues for a similar affirmance under the circumstances of this case. We note, however, that in the <em>Scobiick </em>case, the trial judge did not limit his charge to a mere recitation of the full language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005, but also informed the jury that it must determine from the evidence whether Senio, the charged principal, had caused false entries to be made. In elaborating upon the bare language of the statute, the trial judge charged that in order to find that any false entries had been made, the jury must find that \u201cthe entries on the bank records were false and were intended to mislead and deceive * * * \u201d 124 F.Supp. at 889 n.6. As to the charged abetters, one of whom was Scobiick, the trial judge devoted two paragraphs of his charge to the task of explaining for the jury that they could not find the defendants guilty unless satisfied that they acted with the same intent as had Senio, the indicted principal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">Thus, the Third Circuit\u2019s affirmance of the <em>Scobiick </em>case depended in large measure on the fact that the trial judge had instructed the jury that for the abetters\u2019 guilt to be established they must have shared in the principal\u2019s intent to \u201cunlawfully, wilfully, and feloniously\u201d make false entries in the bank\u2019s records. In that case, unlike the present one, the absence of a \u201cspecific intent\u201d instruction such as La Buy \u00a7 4.04 was mitigated by a clear delineation of the essential elements of the offense in the instructions as a whole. We think that the pertinent portion of the <em>Scobiick </em>opinion, <em>supra, </em>225 F.2d at 783-84, cannot fairly be read as ruling on the specific arguments which Barclay presses in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">The Government\u2019s position in the present ease calls into question the traditional dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>tinction between \u201cgeneral intent\u201d and \u201cspecific intent.\u201d We recognize that many commentators have regarded these jurisprudential concepts as awkward and unhelpful. Nonetheless, we cannot agree with the Government that the trial court\u2019s instructions on intent were complete. Only in Instruction No. 32 was the jury informed that the principal, Stanley Johnson, must have had the intent to injure or defraud the bank. Nowhere in the jury charge do we find any language specifying the criteria by which that particular mental state must be measured. As previously noted, both the Government and the defense tendered instructions seeking to make the statutory language more comprehensible to the jury, but the trial judge consistently rejected any such attempts to clarify the statutory language. Finally, we note that the Government, at the trial level although not at this court, took the position that the judge\u2019s rejection of the jointly-requested La Buy \u00a7 4.04 bordered on reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Under <em>Bryant, supra, </em>461 F.2d 912, we are of the opinion that a reversal of the conviction is required. We have viewed the instructions given herein, and we do not believe that the jury was properly advised regarding the intent which Barclay must have entertained in order to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 1005. It may well be true that Congress would be well advised to reformulate the criminal code in a manner comparable to the Model Penal Code promulgated by the American Law Institute. Such legislative action would remove from criminal jurisprudence some of the problems which the traditional \u201cgeneral-specific\u201d criminal intent analysis engenders. Absent such legislative action, however, both the Government and the defendant can rightly insist that the jury be adequately apprised of the mental state legislatively defined as an element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Because the inadequate jury charge requires a reversal, we need not consider nor rule upon Barclay\u2019s other claims of reversible error. We do note Barclay\u2019s contention regarding an arguable inconsistency between the court\u2019s grant of judgments of acquittal on Counts Three, Four, and Seven and its denial of a judgment of acquittal as to Count Eight. He argues that this court should mandate a judgment of acquittal as to the latter count. The district court judge, after reflection on his ruling, observed on the record that the more he thought about Count Eight, the more he thought it was a valid count. Thus, the record establishes that the trial judge was advised as to the possibility of an inconsistent ruling, reflected on that claim of error, and persisted in his ruling. Although the case may be a close one, based upon our examination of the evidence in this case, and bearing in mind that from the sufficiency viewpoint the evidence and all reasonable inferences therein must be regarded in the light most favorable to the Government before a directed verdict would be authorized, we are unable to conclude that a properly instructed jury might not have convicted Barclay without the verdict being subject to challenge on the ground of insufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">For the reasons hereinbefore stated, the judgment of conviction is reversed and the cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-17\">. Count Eight of the indictment stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b873-27\">The March 1975 Grand Jury further charges:</p>\n<p id=\"Agi\">On or about May 14, 1970, in the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, Stanley Johnson, not named as a defendant in this indictment, being an officer and employee of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>the Steel City National Bank, Chicago, Illinois, did wilfully, knowingly, and with intent to injure and defraud the said Bank, make and cause to be made in the Interview and Memorandum Sheet of said Bank in the name of Charles Wasserman, a false entry opposite the heading May 14, 1970, a wit: a statement indicating the loan proceeds in the amount of $35,-000 were to be used by Charles Wasserman, whereas, in truth and in fact, as the defendant then well knew, the proceeds of the said loan were to accrue to the use and benefit of Ritten-house Investment Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">In violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1005, and</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Donald Barclay</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">defendant herein, did, knowing the foregoing, wilfully aid, abet, and procure the commission of the above-described offense by Stanley Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-16\">In violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 2 and 1005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b874-17\">. The duality aspect of the tender of instructions is not without precedent. Thus, in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>507 F.2d 433 (7th Cir. 1974), cert. <em>denied, </em>420 U.S. 1004, 95 S.Ct. 1446, 43 L.Ed.2d 762 (1975), both the Government and the defendant tendered instructions defining reasonable doubt, although the instructions so tendered there were not identical as in the case at bar. In Lawson, this court held that the failure of the court to give such a definitional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>instruction was not reversible error. Nevertheless it does appear to us that when both sides to litigation deem a particular instruction to be necessary, one from the point of view of the theory of defense and the other from the point of view of obviating possible error, that the trial judge should exercise considerable caution in declining to give the instruction tendered by both sides, particularly when both instructions are identically worded.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">La Buy \u00a7 4.04 reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">The crime charged in this case requires proof of specific intent before the defendant can be convicted. Specific intent, as the term implies, means more than the general intent to commit the act, To establish specific intent the government must prove that the defendant knowingly did an act which the law forbids, (or knowingly failed to do an act which the law requires,) purposely intending to violate the law. Such intent may be determined from all the facts and circumstances surrounding the case (and from similar prior crimes and transactions).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">33 F.R.D. at 550-51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b875-9\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"at3-dedup-0\">Whoever makes any false entry in any book, report, or statement of such [national or insured] bank with <em>intent to injure or defraud </em>such bank, or any other company, body politic or corporate, or any individual person, or <em>to deceive </em>any officer of such bank, or the Comptroller of the Currency, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any agent or examiner appointed to examine the affairs of such bank, or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\u2014 Shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
