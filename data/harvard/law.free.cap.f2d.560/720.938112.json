Citizens Casualty Company of New York, et al. </em>5 Cir 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b781-17\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b781-18\">Appellants challenge their state-court convictions of knowingly selling obscene materials in violation of Birmingham City Ordinance 67-2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court, on the basis of the state court record, denied habe-as relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-14\">Appellants first attack the ordinance. They argue it was unconstitutionally vague, failing to give them fair warning that their activities were illegal. They also advance the separate claim that the ordinance, as construed by the Alabama courts, fails to accord with the requirement of <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), that the proscribed sexual conduct be specifically defined. We reject these claims on the authority of <em>McKinney v. Parsons, </em>513 F.2d 264 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 960, 96 S.Ct. 276, 46 L.Ed.2d 289 (1975), which dealt with this same ordinance and found these same contentions unavailing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-15\">Appellants also contend that the relevant publications were not obscene under the governing standards. Because appellants\u2019 sales occurred prior to the decision in <em>Miller v. California, supra, </em>they are entitled to any benefits of the then-prevailing standards of <em>Memoirs v. Massachusetts, </em>383 U.S. 413, 86 S.Ct. 975, 16 L.Ed.2d 1 (1966) (plurality opinion). They may also invoke any benefits of <em>Miller. See Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977). The Alabama courts and the district court on this habeas challenge found these materials obscene under both <em>Memoirs </em>and <em>Miller. </em>That conclusion violates the standards of neither case. The decision is</p>\n<p id=\"b781-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-19\">. That ordinance has apparently been repealed. <em>See McKinney v. Parsons, </em>513 F.2d 264, 266 n.l (5 th Cir.) (quoting ordinance in full), <em>cert, denied, </em>423 U.S. 960, 96 S.Ct. 376, 46 L.Ed.2d 289 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b781-20\">. The firm rule in this circuit is to adhere to a prior panel\u2019s decision absent intervening contrary authority from the Supreme Court or our en banc court. Here the only relevant intervening authority is <em>Ward v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 767, 97 S.Ct. 2085, 52 L.Ed.2d 738 (1977), which does not undermine <em>McKinney. </em>We thus reject appellants\u2019 attack on <em>McKinney </em>and adhere to its holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
