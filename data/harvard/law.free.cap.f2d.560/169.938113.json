Order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>2569<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied a petition of the National Rail Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) for an order \u201cauthorizing, instructing, and directing\u201d the trustees of the Penn Central to carry out a March 24, 1976, judgment of the United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which confirmed an arbitration decision<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the trustees should restore or cause to be restored certain rail lines in Indiana so as to provide for the same level of passenger service which was in effect as of May 1,1971. We vacate the first sentence of paragraph 2 of Order 2569 and affirm it in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">Initially on this appeal, Amtrak\u2019s arguments relied on the <em>res judicata </em>effects of a June 25, 1976, declaratory judgment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Indiana district court which held that its March 24, 1976, confirming order was a conclusive bar against any further claims by the trustees that the Rail Act rendered the arbitration award unenforcible. In this connection, Amtrak also argued that the Reorganization Court had no jurisdiction to take any action in this matter except to enforce the now confirmed arbitration award.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the entry of the Reorganiza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>tion Court\u2019s Order 2569 in October 1976 and the filing of briefs for the appeal in this Court but before oral argument here on April 1,1977, a panel of the Seventh Circuit reversed the June 25th declaratory judgment of the Indiana district court. <em>See National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Blanchette, </em>551 F.2d 127 (7th Cir. 1977) (hereinafter cited as <em>Blanchette). </em>In reversing the district court, the Seventh Circuit held, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">\u201c[T]hat the Declaratory Judgment of the Indiana Court was an improper exercise of its limited jurisdiction and was wrong on the merits. Accordingly, the judgment of the Indiana Court is reversed. This case is remanded to the Indiana Court with directions to vacate its declaratory judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-13\">\u201cThe issues hereinabove discussed are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Reorganization Court and it may now proceed therewith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 136. In our view the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision either mooted or severely undermined most of Amtrak\u2019s contentions in its initial brief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, because certain language in Part III<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the Reorganization Court\u2019s opinion and order 2569 is ambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>or might be read to have an effect <em>in futuro </em>far outstripping that justified by the hearings conducted, we asked that the parties respond to additional questions<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>each be covered in oral argument. Our concerns are essentially twofold: first, the language of order 2569 seemed to preclude further resort to the Arbitration panel should any further disputes arise that, otherwise, would have been within the purview of that forum\u2019s jurisdiction. Secondly, the contextual nexus of the order and Part III seemed to preclude Amtrak from ever asserting any claim for contractual breaches occurring during the preconveyance period (/. e. the period from May 1,1971 to April 1, 1976).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Language of a subsequent opinion of the Reorganization Court has alleviated many of these concerns as will be discussed below (see pp. 177-178 <em>infra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">For the sake of clarity and to frame an essential perspective into this case, it is necessary that we outline the rather complex statutory and factual background of this case. We are indebted to Judge Hastings\u2019 analysis in the Seventh Circuit opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In accordance with the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 501 <em>et seq., </em>Amtrak was authorized to contract with each railroad undergoing reorganization and operating passenger trains in a basic system, for use by Amtrak of railroad tracks, facilities and services \u201con such terms and conditions as the parties may agree.\u201d See 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 562(a). Pursuant to this statutory authorization, Amtrak entered into The National Railroad Passenger Corporation agreement of April 16, 1971 (the \u201cBasic Agreement\u201d). The Basic Agreement\u2019s purpose was \u201cto relieve the railroad of its entire responsibility for the provision of intercity rail passenger service\u201d under \u201csuch terms and conditions as necessary to permit the Corporation [Amtrak] to undertake passenger service on a timely basis.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 562(a). Article 6 of the Basic Agreement incorporated by reference the National Railroad Passenger Corporation Arbitration Agreement (the \u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d). Essentially, the Arbitration Agreement established a system of adjusting <em>contract disputes </em>through resort to an arbitration panel, rather than through constant resort to the Reorganization Court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u201cUnder the terms of the Basic Agreement, Amtrak undertook to assume the intercity rail passenger responsibilities of the Trustees of Penn Central and all other contracting railroads, and Penn Central undertook to render certain services to Amtrak and to maintain its rail lines used by Amtrak at an agreed upon \u2018level of utility.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">\u201cUnder Article Six of the Basic Agreement any \u2018claim or controversy\u2019 between Amtrak and Penn Central was to be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions of The National Railroad Passenger Corporation Arbitration Agreement separately contracted to by the parties on April 16, 1971. Referred to by the parties as the \u2018Arbitration Agreement,\u2019 Section 4.2 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">\u2018 * * * [A]ny arbitration award hereunder made by a <em>majority </em>of the members of any Arbitration Panel shall be binding upon the parties thereto. Any arbitration award hereunder shall declare the rights of the parties thereto and <em>may make awards of money, or enjoin or otherwise operate in such a way as to require specific performance by a party of any act or obligation.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Section 4.3 of the Arbitration Agreement further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-11\">\u2018Judgment may be entered upon any arbitration award hereunder * * * in any United States District Court.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM5\"><em>Blanchette, supra </em>at 130.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-13\">\u201cIn authorizing the Trustees of Penn Central to enter into the Basic Agreement with Amtrak, the Reorganization Court in Order No. 238, in pertinent parts, stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-14\">\u20181. The Trustees are authorized to execute a contract with Amtrak in substantially the form submitted to the Court at the hearing, PROVIDED, however, * * * (b) that whenever any matter is resolved by arbitration pursuant to the Main Agreement or the Arbitration Agreement, the decision shall be submitted to this court for review and approval before becoming finally binding upon the Trustees or the Debtor, during the pendency of these reorganization proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-15\">\u20184. The Court reserves jurisdiction over said contract for the purpose of directing such actions and granting such further relief as may be necessary to protect the interests of the Debtor\u2019s Estate.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3L\"><em>Id. </em>at 131-32.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-16\">\u201cA dispute arose between Amtrak and Penn Central concerning the \u2018level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>utility\u2019 of about 360 miles of certain rail lines of Penn Central connecting Kanka-kee, Illinois, with Louisville, Kentucky, and Cincinnati, Ohio, via Indianapolis, Indiana, under the Basic Agreement of 1971. Amtrak\u2019s claim that Penn Central had defaulted in its obligation to maintain the track was duly submitted to the National Arbitration Panel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">\u201cAfter the parties submitted extensive written memoranda and oral testimony was heard, the arbitration was interrupted by an \u2018Emergency Order\u2019 of the Federal Railroad Administration on August 1, 1974. This emergency order terminated Amtrak\u2019s service on the above-mentioned Penn Central line because the track had been found to be \u2018in an unsafe condition,\u2019 creating \u2018an emergency situation involving a hazard of death or injury to persons affected by the use thereof.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">\u201cWithout objection from Penn Central and in accordance with its rules, the Panel began additional hearings, accepted a revised request for an award from Amtrak, and received additional evidence on September 11, September 24, September 29 and December 16, 1975, and January 20, 1976. Thereafter, on February 3, 1976, the National Arbitration Panel issued a written award in NAP Case No. 11, <em>In Re: Level of Utility, </em>with the following declarations and awards:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"avq-dedup-0\">\u201cFirst, the Panel declared that Amtrak had a contract right to have the Penn Central Rail lines connecting Kankakee with Cincinnati and with Louisville via Indianapolis kept \u2018at no less than the level of utility\u2019 which existed on May 1, 1971.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-10\">\n<em>\u201cSecond, the Trustees of Penn Central had defaulted in keeping this bargain.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>12</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-11\">\u201cThird, the Trustees were ordered to \u2018cause\u2019 the restoration of these lines to their proper condition by January 1,1978, in accordance with a \u2018Panel Program,\u2019 which provided, <em>inter alia, </em>for a detailed work schedule to be submitted to Amtrak within ninety days of this award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-12\">\u201cThe estimates of the cost of these repairs ranged from 22 million dollars, based upon independent evaluation, to 11 million dollars, estimated by Penn Central using its own employees. Costs were estimated in terms of October 1975. The Panel\u2019s award further provided that Penn Central would bear the entire financial burden of the repairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 130-31 (emphasis supplied) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-15\">\u201c[T]he Arbitration Panel held that it was without jurisdiction to decide the [issue of whether the passage of the Rail Act and the pending conveyance of Penn Central properties to ConRail would operate to excuse the performance of Penn Central\u2019s contractual obligations to Amtrak]. The issue was not raised before the Indiana Court. Yet, Amtrak urged and the Indiana Court held [in its declaratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>judgment of June 25,1976] that the Trustees could not raise the issue of the transfer of the subject lines to ConRail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 136.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201cOn February 4, 1976, pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 9, United States Arbitration Act, and Section 4.3 of the Arbitration Agreement, <em>supra, </em>Amtrak petitioned the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Indianapolis Division, for confirmation of the arbitration award. However, on February 17, 1976, Penn Central petitioned the Reorganization Court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for an order requiring Amtrak to show cause \u2018why it should not be required * * * to comply with the provisions of Order No. 238 and, pending the filing of said petition, why it should not be enjoined from proceeding further in the [Confirmation Proceedings].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 131.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">\u201cThe Reorganization Court, however, never ruled on Penn Central\u2019s February 17, 1976, petition to show cause, because the Trustees of Penn Central subsequently consented to the entry of a judgment in the Indiana Court. <em>The consent of the Trustees, and by implication that of the Reorganization Court, was induced by the assurances of counsel for Amtrak that it was only attempting to liquidate its claim in the Indiana court, and that Amtrak was well aware of and, in fact, accepted the primary jurisdiction of the Reorganization Court.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 132 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">\u201cThereafter, the Trustees consented to the entry of judgment in the Confirmation Proceedings in Indiana, based upon the above assertions in the Reorganization Court, that the Indiana Court would review the arbitration proceedings \u2018to see that the award was a proper award and that the arbitrators acted honestly and did not exceed their powers.\u2019 Thereafter, the Indiana Court entered an Order of Confirmation on March 24, 1976.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-11\">\u201cOn April 9, 1976, Amtrak petitioned the Reorganization Court for enforcement of the now confirmed Arbitration Award. Penn Central, thereafter, filed an answer to the petition for enforcement, asserting that the award could not be enforced against Penn Central because the rail tracks in question had been conveyed to ConRail pursuant to the Rail Act, and therefore, Penn Central\u2019s obligation to restore the tracks was terminated. Amtrak secured an indefinite postponement of its petition in the Reorganization Court, returned to the Indiana Court and filed its . declaratory judgment action in Indiana.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">Following oral argument in this court, on April 22, 1977, the Reorganization Court entered Memorandum and Order Nos. 2921 and 2922. Generally, the Memorandum discussed and the Orders dealt with certain aspects of the Penn Central Trustees\u2019 Proposed Plan of Reorganization not at issue in this appeal; however, as Amtrak objected to certain of the trustees\u2019 proposals, the Reorganization Court had occasion to enter into the following discussion which has particular relevance to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-15\">\n<em>\u201cAmtrak\u2019s Objections</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-16\">\u201cAmtrak is not a direct provider of passenger service, but rather contracts with operating rail carriers for them to provide Amtrak\u2019s passenger service. The Debtor performed such services for Amtrak from May of 1971 until the conveyance of the Debtor\u2019s rail property to Con-Rail on April 1, 1976. Amtrak has been pursuing a rather complex litigation strategy to assert certain claims allegedly arising from the Trustees\u2019 failure to meet their pre-conveyance contractual obligations. As part of this effort, Amtrak presented to this Court a petition for enforcement of an award made by an arbitration panel, which determined that, during the period before conveyance of the rail system to ConRail, the Trustees had failed to maintain certain passenger track at the level of utility required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>the contract between the Trustees and Amtrak. The relief sought was in the nature of specific performance: an order requiring the Trustees to perform certain engineering services and to plan for, and thereafter carry out, certain large-scale track restoration. I denied Amtrak\u2019s request because the conveyance of the railroad to ConRail pursuant to the RRRA render performance of track maintenance by the Trustees a legal and practical impossibility. <em>See In re Penn Central Trans. Co. (Petition of Amtrak to Enforce Arbitration Award), </em>422 F.Supp. 67 (E.D. Pa.1976).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\">\u201cAlthough I had no occasion at that time to decide whether Amtrak had a claim for damages, I did point to some possible obstacles to the successful assertion of any such claim: Before the arbitrators, Amtrak expressly disavowed any claim for damages; the causal relationship between the level of track maintenance and Amtrak\u2019s revenues might be difficult to establish; and the amount of money due the estate from Amtrak under the agreement would have been greater if the Trustees had spent the amount of money for track maintenance which Amtrak contended was necessary. <em>By reiterating these potential infirmities, I do not mean to preclude Amtrak from asserting any claim it may feel is justified. </em>The Third Circuit presently has under advisement Amtrak\u2019s appeal in that matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201cIt would be difficult to conclude that Amtrak has standing to object to the tax compromise if the only basis for such objection is its alleged right to have the Trustees do heavy track work on Con-Rail\u2019s railroad. <em>However, Amtrak now seems to be asserting that it has administration claims against the estate of approximately $150 to $170 million in contract damages </em>(Docs. Nos. 12096,12694).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>While the validity and amount of these claims has not yet been established, </em>the reasonable course at this point is to accord Amtrak standing as an administrative claimant. <em>Cf. </em>Rule 8-306(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">\n<em>. Amtrak\u2019s claims are not even liquidated. ... If and when Amtrak establishes that it has an administration claim, adequate provision can be made to satisfy its claim.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-10\"><em>Id. </em>at pages 20-22 of slip opinion (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">II. THE SCOPE OF THE REORGANIZATION COURT\u2019S ORDER 2569</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">The issue yet to be decided is whether the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 <em>et seq., </em>as amended, and the consequent conveyance of certain of Penn Central\u2019s rail assets to ConRail excused the Penn Central trustees from performance of work or damages claims related to Penn Central\u2019s pre-conveyance contractual track maintenance obligations to Amtrak as required under the Basic Agreement. At this point in the litigation, the Reorganization Court has not definitively granted or denied any claim made by Amtrak related to the alleged pre-conveyance contractual breaches of the Penn Central because the Arbitration Panel never decided whether the conveyance to ConRail relieved the trustees of liability for money damages and did not consider the effects of the Rail Act on the performance of the obligations. In short, the Rail Act issue has never been litigated in any forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">In developing the record below, Amtrak relied almost exclusively on the <em>res judicata </em>effect of the Indiana district court\u2019s declaratory judgment without ever reaching the substantive merits of the Rail Act\u2019s effects; this position has been vitiated by the reversal in <em>Blanchette, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>der the Indiana district court\u2019s confirmation order of March 24, 1976, however, Amtrak has established, at least, a case of pre-con-veyance contractual breaches by the Penn Central trustees. We have noted that the record is substantially undeveloped with regard to the Rail Act issue and to the effect of the Final System plan in relieving the Penn Central trustees of liability, as an expense of administration, for damages for the breach of contract found by the Arbitration Panel and \u201cconfirmed\u201d by the Indiana district court. We express no opinion on these issues at this time. See, e. <em>g., </em>note 12 above. It is also clear that the determination of the amount of damages is still to be decided. See <em>Arbitration Award </em>at 32a-33a.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The language of Order 2569 would be too sweeping if we did not have the Reorganization Court\u2019s Memorandum and Order Nos. 2921-2 of April 22, 1977. However, in light of the wording used there, it is clear that Amtrak has the right to request enforcement of the arbitration award by the Reorganization Court or to establish its claims to damages as a result of the pre-conveyance breaches.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although we believe the language of the Reorganization Court\u2019s order in this case contemplated no more than that enforcement of the <em>Arbitration Award, supra, </em>is now to be reviewed by the Reorganization Court in the light of any defenses which the trustees may raise, we have concluded that the language of the first sentence of paragraph 2 of Order 2569 is too sweeping and will be vacated.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">We agree with Judge Hastings\u2019 holding that \u201cthe Indiana Court was without jurisdiction by declaratory judgment, or other judicial means, to circumscribe the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Reorganization Court as to the enforcement of an arbitration award which was subsequently confirmed by the Indiana Court, and we now so hold.\u201d <em>Blanchette, supra, </em>at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">For the reasons stated, the first sentence of paragraph 2 of Order 2569 will be vacated and that order will be affirmed in all other respects, with directions to the court, on remand, to join ConRail under Rule 719, if this has not already been done (see footnote 8 at pages 173-174 above). That Court may now proceed to the question of any enforcement of the <em>Arbitration Award </em>or the claim on which it is based, taking into consideration any defenses that may be raised by the trustees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-5\">.

Amtrak framed the issues as follows at page 2 of their brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">\u201c1. When the Trustees in a bankruptcy reorganization appear with the consent of their bankruptcy court in a confirmation proceeding in a coordinate federal district court to determine the validity of an arbitration award, is the bankruptcy court empowered to limit, by its own order, the scope of the judicial review of the award so judgment entered thereon does not have the effect prescribed by \u00a7 13 of the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 13?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">\u201c2. Can a court sitting in a \u00a7 77 reorganization by its own order reserve to itself powers to review collaterally the enforceability and legal validity of an arbitration award against the Trustees of the debtor when final judgment has been entered upon the award by a coordinate federal district court pursuant to the provisions of the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-14?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">\u201c3. Must a court sitting in a \u00a7 77 reorganization give <em>res judicata </em>effect to a judgment of a coordinate federal district court upon an arbitration award against the Trustees of the debtor when such judgment is presented to the bankruptcy court for satisfaction and enforcement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">\u201c4. Is a judgment entered by a United States District Court other than the reorganization court, declaring the rights and obligations established by a judgment confirming an arbitration under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 13 and stating that the trustees of the debtor are estopped by judgment from asserting that the award is legally unenforceable under the Rail Act, binding upon the Trustees in subsequent reorganization proceedings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-16\">\u201c5. Does an injunction issued by a \u00a7 77 reorganization court against \u2018any legal proceeding\u2019 by Amtrak to resolve disputes arising under a statutory contract with the Trustees by an arbitration process specifically agreed to by all railroads contracting with Amtrak under the Amtrak Act violate the statutory or constitutional rights of Amtrak or contravene the prohibitions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 959 or 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 205(j)?\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b232-17\">. Part III provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-18\">\u201c[8] The basic agreement between Amtrak and the Trustees required the Trustees to maintain the trackage at its May 1, 1971 level of utility for a period of 25 years. But on April 1, 1976, as mandated by the Rail Act and the final System Plan promulgated thereunder, the Trustees\u2019 ownership of the railroad and responsibilities for operating it became vested in ConRail. The suggestion that the Trustees nevertheless remain liable to maintain the property for all, or any part of, the remaining 20 years of the term of the agreement deserves serious consideration only if one assumes that Amtrak, unlike all of the thousands of other parties having legal relationships with the Penn Central, has been granted some kind of immunity from the impact of Congressional action. Needless to state, no such immunity has been conferred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-19\">\u201c[9] Congress plainly intended to eliminate the involvement of bankrupt estates and reorganization courts in the ownership and operation of the rail system in the northeastern part of the United States. By providing, in the Final System Plan approved by Congress, for the conveyance of ownership and operating responsibilities to ConRail as of April 1, 1976, Congress achieved that goal. The Final System Plan itself expressly deals with the question of ongoing maintenance and improvement of trackage to the level required by Amtrak (see Final System Plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Vol. 1, pp. 30, 43-44). To require the Trustees to plan for, finance, and carry out maintenance and improvements after the April 1 cutoff date would be clearly inconsistent with these provisions, as well as with the provisions of \u00a7 211(h) of the Rail Act (governing the transitional financial arrangements between ConRaii and the Trustees) and the valuation process now under way in the Special Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">\u201cThe contract between the Trustees and Amtrak makes it abundantly clear that the question of maintenance and improvement is inseparable from continued ownership. The Trustees were required to maintain their own railroad, not someone else\u2019s. They were required to use their own employees (because of the terms of existing collective bargaining agreements), not someone else\u2019s. The contract purports to be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Trustees, without regard to whether such successor or assignee did or did not assume the obligations of the contract. Whether this means that Amtrak is entitled to enforce these obligations as against ConRaii is not for this Court to decide. Depending upon how that question is ultimately resolved, it may be that Amtrak might be able to establish that implementation of the Rail Act has deprived it of valuable rights, for which it is entitled to a remedy; or ConRaii might be able to establish that its assumption of these liabilities comes within the \u2018other benefits\u2019 aspect of the valuation proceedings in the Special Court. I express no view as to any of these matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">\u201cFor the reasons thus far discussed, the relief sought by Amtrak in the present case cannot and will not be granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6x\"><em>Reorganization Court's Opinion, supra </em>at 73-74 (footnotes omitted). We note that \u00a7 211(h) was amended after the Reorganization Court\u2019s opinion and order in this case.

We express no view of the point at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\">. The four pertinent questions were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">\u201c1. Under Part III of the district court Memorandum and Order No. 2569 of September 30, 1976 (87a ff.), are all of the Penn Central trustees\u2019 obligations under the 1971 agreement now excused because of the operation of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq. (\u2018the Rail Act\u2019), or are only the obligations under Section 4.2 (maintenance) of the contract excused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">\u201c2. Does the above Memorandum and Order operate as a bar against (1) any action by Amtrak for damages for any breach of contract which may have occurred prior to April 1, 1976, or (2) any other remedy, such as restitution, which Amtrak may have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">\u201c3. What is the significance of the citation in the above Memorandum Opinion to \u00a7 211(h) of the Railroad Revitalization Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 ff.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-12\">\u201c4. Did Conrail become an indispensable party to this case upon the passage of the Regional Reorganization Rail Act in 1973?\u201d We note that in the briefs responding to the</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAv\">above questions the parties have taken diametrically opposed positions on each point. It is now evident that these require a fuller development on the record. However, we turn to Con-Rail\u2019s status as an indispensable party. Con-Rail has filed a memorandum in this case which indicates that it had specifically rejected the Basic Agreement of 1971 and had entered into a 1976 agreement with Amtrak whereby \u201cThe ConRaii Rail Lines used in Amtrak\u2019s Intercity Rail Passenger Service . . <em>shall be maintained by ConRaii in no less than the condition in which such Rail Lines were conveyed to ConRaii under the Rail Act.\" </em>Con-Rail\u2019s position is that the \u201cBill of Sale and Assignment\u201d conveying Penn Central\u2019s rail assets to ConRaii specifically provided that Con-Rail was not to assume Penn Central\u2019s pre-con-veyance maintenance obligations to Amtrak. For its authority, ConRaii relies on Section 303(b)(2), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 743(b)(2) of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 <em>et seq., </em>P.L. 93-236, January 2, 1974, 87 Stat. 986 (hereinafter the \u201cRail Act\u201d) which provides that the rail properties were conveyed to ConRaii \u201cfree and clear of all liens and encumbrances.\u201d ConRail\u2019s contentions concerning its responsibilities on the 1971 Basic Agreement between Amtrak and Penn Central have never been subjected to judicial review and, at this point, they are entitled to no more weight than the contentions of any other litigant. Other sections of the Rail Act indicate that upon conveyance of the properties Con-Rail was to assume the responsibility for maintaining and upgrading lines used by Amtrak. See e. <em>g., </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 716(a)(7), 742(c), (d). The fundamental purpose of the 1971 Amtrak Act that an efficient and effective rail passenger service was needed in the Northeast and Midwest as a matter of national policy was never repealed or abandoned by the Congress when it enacted the 1973 Rail Act; if anything, the Rail Act demonstrates that this purpose was reiterated and in reiteration strengthened. <em>Compare </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 501 <em>with </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 701. In short, the merits of ConRail\u2019s views on its obligations to Amtrak are not as clear cut as ConRaii urges. Finally, ConRail\u2019s obligations to maintain Amtrak\u2019s passenger routes as reflected in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>the Final System Plan are tenuous and without any statement of firm priorities; the ICC order of March 31, 1976, also filed in this case, goes no further; thus, Amtrak\u2019s needs may never be fulfilled and the Congressional purpose of 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 501 may be defeated if we allow this matter to remain as it now stands without a full adjudication. <em>But see </em>Part III as set forth in note 7, supra. Therefore, upon remand the Reorganization Court shall order the joinder of ConRail as an indispensable party in this action under Bankruptcy Rules 8-602(b) &amp; 719. Join-der of ConRail may serve to eliminate those problems generating the Reorganization Court\u2019s concern that Penn Central might be compelled to complete its contractual obligations to Amtrak but be foreclosed from recovering their value in the Special Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\">. Amtrak understood the opinion and order in this manner and raised the point in its initial briefs. In their answering brief the Penn Central trustees asserted that any remedy for damages that Amtrak might otherwise have against Penn Central now had to be asserted against the United States as a Tucker Act claim. In Penn Central\u2019s brief responding to our question, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>the trustees conceded that Amtrak\u2019s damage claims could be pressed in the Reorganization Court, subject, however, to any defenses or offsets Penn Central might have; the Reorganization Court\u2019s latest opinion in regard to this matter takes a similar point of view.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Amtrak has conceded on this appeal that the conveyance of the Penn Central rail assets to ConRail on April 1, 1976, excused the trustees from the balance of their maintenance obligations on the contract; thus, we need not consider that point here. We note, however, that although Penn Central took the position on its brief that the conveyance was an eminent domain taking excusing its obligations to Amtrak, in its brief replying to our letter and at oral argument, its counsel nevertheless asserted that the conveyance did not vitiate the entire contract thereby suggesting that Amtrak continued to have unexecuted obligations under the agreement to Penn Central. In other words, Penn Central\u2019s position in regard to the effect of the conveyance on different portions of the contract seems to be somewhat inconsistent. In any event, the record in this case in regard to these contentions is not sufficiently developed for us to take a point of view on the matter at this time and it is unnecessary that we do so. However, if Penn Central feels that portions of the contract continue to create binding obligations between it and Amtrak, the precise boundaries of that contention are to be developed by the Reorganization Court on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b234-10\">. Language within the <em>Arbitration Award, supra, </em>is instructive on this point; it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbN\">\u201cArticle Six of the Basic Agreement limits the authority of the Panel to \u2018the interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>tion, application, or implementation of this Agreement,\u2019 and Section 4.5 of the Arbitration Agreement requires that the Panel \u2018be governed by the provisions and language of the applicable Basic Agreement or Agreements.\u2019 Accordingly, the Panel does not consider that it is the proper body to decide whether, or to what extent, the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 or the Final System Plan thereunder may affect the carrying out of this award.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-9\"><em>Arbitration Award, supra </em>at 11 (reproduced at 35a, appendix). It is this language \u2014 explicitly limiting the scope of the matters adjudicated before the arbitration panel \u2014 that is at the very heart of this suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b235-10\">. The Reorganization Court\u2019s reasons for the entry of this order and its view of the order\u2019s effects is outlined in the Court\u2019s opinion. See <em>Reorganization Court\u2019s Opinion, supra </em>at 70-72. It is clear that Amtrak representatives were fully aware of the order <em>prior </em>to the time of execution of the Basic Agreement. In view of <em>Blanchette, supra, </em>it is unnecessary that we extensively analyze Amtrak\u2019s contention on this appeal that Order 238 was improper; it would appear that the Reorganization Court\u2019s analysis is substantially correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-18\">\u201cLanguage from Amtrak\u2019s memorandum, as it appears in the record in the Reorganization Court, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-19\">\u2018any judgment entered by the Indianapolis District Court upon Amtrak's Petition to Confirm will not serve to make the award of the National Arbitration Panel finally binding upon the Trustees. To become finally binding, execution on the judgment would be necessary. Yet execution in any court other than this Reorganization Court would so manifestly interfere with the Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction to control the administration of the estate that it would be impossible to support in law or fact. Therefore, in order for Amtrak to make the award <em>finally binding </em>upon the Trustees, the entire matter will eventually have to be submitted in the bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>ruptcy proceedings * * * The mere fact that the arbitration claim has been reduced to a judgment will not prevent this Court from making an inquiry since the merger of a claim into a judgment does not change its nature as far as provability is concerned.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASS\"><em>Blanchette, supra </em>at 132.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b236-7\">. In other words, the breach considered by the Arbitration Panel occurred during the precon-veyance period, May 1, 1971, to April 1, 1976. Furthermore, the fact that arbitration was initiated on January 11, 1973, suggests that a significant percentage of the deterioration occurred prior to passage of the Rail Act on January 2, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Reduced to its essentials, the trustees\u2019 argument is simply that the Rail Act excused their performance not only for preconveyance breaches of the Basic Agreement occurring after passage of the Act but also for those occurring prior to January 2, 1974. There may be grounds, as the trustees assert, that will excuse their performance after passage of the Act, but it is more difficult to see how their asserted Rail Act defense applies to the pre-passage breach. On the other hand, the record before the court is not sufficiently developed for us to determine the Arbitration Panel\u2019s position on this point or even to ascertain if evidence was introduced at the arbitration proceeding that would delineate the scope of the pre-passage breach. Also, the trustees\u2019 position on this point is not clear. See also discussion in note 15, <em>infra. </em>Accordingly, we express no view of the outcome of the problems pointed out in this note other than to indicate that it should be considered on remand.

Therefore, even if we disagreed with the Seventh Circuit, it would be anomalous if we were to reach a result on this appeal which would have the practical effect of reinstating the declaratory judgment of the Indiana district court.

Although specific performance of the trustees\u2019 maintenance responsibility would appear to have been unenforceable after April 1, 1976, financial arrangements could conceivably be made by the trustees to carry out the terms of their undertaking concerning which the <em>Arbitration Award </em>found they were in default prior to April 1, 1976.

These considerations depend first on a precise delineation of Amtrak\u2019s property interests under the Basic Agreement and a careful theoretical analysis of the Rail Act and the effects of the 1976 conveyance.
