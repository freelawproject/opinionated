During the period involved (1975), Robert MacNally was the divisional Vice President and General Manager of the Sta-Hi portion of the plant, and Francis Haggerty was the senior Kollsman official at the plant. The labor relations aspects of the Sta-Hi operation were the responsibility of William Machaver, Vice President of Personnel and Industrial Relations for Sun Chemical, and of Stanley Rosen, Sun Chemical\u2019s Director of Labor Relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">At a meeting in mid-June, employees asked MacNally about the possibility of a cost-of-living wage increase. His response was not encouraging. At another meeting of Sta-Hi employees on July 23, Haggerty told the employees that Kollsman was conducting an area wage survey which had not yet been completed. He did not state whether or not the employees could expect a raise as a result of the survey, and his answers to questions did not quiet the employees\u2019 unrest over their wages and other working conditions. MacNally was not present at the July 23 meeting, but he learned of the employees\u2019 questions and Haggerty\u2019s answers soon after. Although he had heard rumors of union interest among the employees, he was not aware at this time that the Union had undertaken an organizing campaign; nor did he think that unrest among the employees was a serious problem. However, on July 29, he telephoned Sun Chemical\u2019s headquarters in Fort Lee, New Jersey, with a view to having something done about the problem.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He talked to Rosen and recommended an immediate raise for the employees on the basis of the Kollsman survey, some of the details of which he had learned from Hag-gerty. Rosen reported MacNally\u2019s recommendation to Machaver and recommended a raise of eight percent. Machaver concurred and took the recommendation to the president of Sun Chemical who, on the evening of July 30, approved an immediate raise of eight percent for Sta-Hi\u2019s hourly employees. Machaver told Rosen to relay the news to MacNally, which he did on the morning of July 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Later that morning MacNally called back and told Rosen that he had just received a letter from the Union claiming to represent Sta-Hi employees. Rosen instructed Mac-Nally to do nothing about the raise until he (Rosen) got back to him. Rosen reported the new development to Machaver and gave his legal opinion that it would be an unfair labor practice to implement the decision to grant a raise under the circumstances and recommended that the raise be cancelled. Machaver agreed, and Rosen reported the decision to MacNally. Accordingly, the raise was not announced to the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">Machaver went to Nashua on Sunday evening, August 3, to try to do something about the problem of unrest among the employees. He conferred with MacNally and his manufacturing manager in the morning and early afternoon of August 4. During the conference, MacNally received the copy of the representation petition the Union had filed with the board which had been mailed by the board\u2019s Regional Office on August 1. It was decided that an open meeting would be held with all of the employees. Machaver testified that he told MacNally that \u201cif anything in the economic area comes up, we must tell them that by law we are prevented from making any comments that . . . could be construed to be coercive, or promises, or so forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">The August 4 meeting lasted from around 3:30 until after 5:00 P.M., with Sta-Hi\u2019s 38 production and maintenance employees present, along with Machaver, Mac-Nally, the manufacturing manager, and a foreman. Machaver spoke for about fifteen minutes. He testified that, among other things, he told the employees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>. I wanted to discuss with them the fact that I did not believe a union was needed, but I would not be discussing it with them at this meeting; that my primary objective at this meeting was to find out what problems there were, to develop constructive relations between the management and the people, because that was the only way we found that we could run a profitable business that was to everybody\u2019s benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The meeting was then opened for \u201ccomments, suggestions, criticisms, anything they had to offer that would be helpful to us to improve the situation.\u201d Machaver answered questions appropriately, taking care not to make statements that might be interpreted as promises of benefits if the employees would vote against the Union; and when a question called for such a response, he told the employees explicitly that was the reason for his not saying more.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Machaver testified that, at one point, when wages were being discussed, one employee said, in so many words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">Mr. Machaver, you know for a fact that the company never considered giving an increase, has no intention of giving an increase, and the only reason that you\u2019re here talking to us is because you want us to vote against the union. And, is it true if we do vote against the'union, we\u2019re not going to get an increase anyway?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agg\">Thereupon, according to Machaver, he turned to MacNally and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">\u201cThis comment is not really a question, Bob. It is designed to impugn the credibility of our company, the reputation of our company, and to really leave a feeling with the people that our word isn\u2019t worth anything.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">\u201c[T]he question in the form of a statement is false. Therefore, I think, within the law, we ought to tell the people the facts. Would you do so?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">According to Machaver, MacNally then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-11\">\u201cWell, on Tuesday of last week . I called up Mr. Rosen, and told him that based on all the circumstances, namely the meetings we\u2019ve had with people, where there were complaints about wages, the fact that there were across-the-board increases being given in the area, and the general unsettlement in the plant, that we ought to give the people an increase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-14\">\u201cBill, you ought to pick it up from here, because you know what happened after I talked to Stan Rosen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-15\">Machaver testified that he continued from that point as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-16\">\u201cMr. Rosen came to me, and told me that Mr. MacNally recommended an increase. He reviewed this survey information which he had, and made a recommendation to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-17\">\u201cI then met with the president the following night, which was Wednesday night, and we arrived at a decision. On Thursday, when that decision was to be communicated to Mr. MacNally, we found there was a union petition. And at that point we could go no further, so we did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-18\">In November, following the representation election, petitioner placed a nine percent wage increase into effect, retroactive to October 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-19\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b533-20\">(1) <em>Section 8(a)(1) and (3) Violations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-21\">Although the record does not show that petitioner, in <em>ipsis verbis, </em>\u201ctold its employees on August 4 that they would have received a wage increase but for the initiation of the union campaign,\u201d we are persuaded that the reasonable inference from William Machaver\u2019s statement, quoted above, was that because of the union representation petition a decision to increase wages (by how much and by what date <em>not </em>inferable) was not going to be carried out. We agree with the board that the words \u201cwe could go no further,\u201d in their setting, \u201ceffectively admitted that \u2018the decision\u2019 was to grant a raise; otherwise there would have been nowhere \u2018further\u2019 to go.\u201d Accordingly, we do not agree with petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>argument that Machaver\u2019s statement was privileged under section 8(c) of the Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found \u201cno evidence, as of July 31, that Machaver\u2019s purpose in canceling the raise was anything other than protecting Respondent [petitioner here] from charges of unlawful conduct,\u201d and stated, with respect to the August 4 meeting, \u201cI do not find that undermining the Union was uppermost in his mind when he spoke out.\u201d Petitioner argues that such findings preclude a holding that it violated either section 8(a)(1) or (3), citing this court\u2019s statement in <em>NLRB v. Otis Hospital, </em>545 F.2d 252, 254, n.3, 93 LRRM 2778 (1st Cir. 1976);</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj2\">An employer violates section 8(a)(1) if the effect and purpose of his actions can be said to impinge upon the employees\u2019 right to unionize. <em>NLRB v. Exchange Parts Co., </em>375 U.S. 405, 409 [84 S.Ct. 457, 11 L.Ed.2d 435] (1964). A violation of section 8(a)(3) requires proof of a \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d act undertaken by the employer with the intent to prejudice his employees because of their membership or nonmembership in the union; \u201csome element of antiunion animus is necessary.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Brown, </em>380 U.S. 278, 286 [85 S.Ct. 980, 985, 13 L.Ed.2d 839] (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">However, the failure of the ALJ to specifically find that an antiunion animus was present in Machaver\u2019s August 4 remarks does not render unreasonable the board\u2019s conclusion that the foreseeable effect of those remarks was \u201cto impinge upon the employees\u2019 right to unionize,\u201d resulting in, as the board argues, at least a violation of section 8(a)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">We are not unsympathetic with an employer who, having decided to increase his employees\u2019 wages, finds himself trying to navigate a \u201cperilous\u201d course between the <em>Scylla </em>of a violation of the Act for granting a wage increase to his employees when a representation election is pending<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the <em>Charybdis </em>of a violation of the Act for withholding such an increase when such an election is pending.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> His uncertain compass is the board\u2019s rule to act \u201cas he would if a union were not in the picture.\u201d <em>The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., </em>166 N.L.R.B. 27, 28, n.l (1967); <em>McCormick Longmeadow Stone Co., </em>158 N.L.R.B. 1237, 1242 (1966). The navigation was made more difficult here by the unseemly remarks of one employee, quoted above, which clearly required a meaningful response. Although Machaver labelled the remarks \u201cfalse,\u201d more was required; and we do not regard as realistic the board\u2019s argument that petitioner \u201cwas free only to reiterate its assurance of sincere interest in the employees\u2019 well being, and to explain its inability to promise improvements at that time.\u201d On the other hand, the board\u2019s suggestion that \u201cthere was nothing to prevent the Company from announcing . . . that the wage increase would be put into effect immediately after the election, regardless of the outcome, with the Union\u2019s consent [if it won the election],\u201d although somewhat inconsistent with the board\u2019s rule to act as if the Union were not in the picture, constitutes one approach that would have been both an effective response and a neutral response. See <em>NLRB v. Hendel Manufacturing Co., </em>483 F.2d 350, 353 (2d Cir. 1973). Doubtless a reviewing tribunal, far removed from the fray, could devise other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>effective and neutral approaches that could have been used. Unfortunately, \u201cMachaver\u2019s carefully chosen words\u201d as petitioner calls them, were, technically, the wrong words.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">In view of the foregoing, we affirm the board\u2019s decision that petitioner committed a section 8(a)(1) violation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">(2) <em>Order to Make Whole Employees for Wages Lost</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The ALJ ordered petitioner to \u201cMake its employees whole for the wages they lost in the period from July 31 to October 25,1975, plus interest, as the result of its decision on July 31, 1975, to cancel an 8-percent raise.\u201d However, the board found that petitioner\u2019s initial decision on July 31 to cancel the wage increase \u201cwas lawful and not a violation of Section 8(a)(3) and (1),\u201d pointing out that no such violation had been alleged by the General Counsel in the complaint and that, as the ALJ himself found, petitioner\u2019s decision \u201cwas motivated by its good-faith desire to avoid committing the unfair labor practice of granting an increase in benefits after learning of a union campaign.\u201d Thereupon, it modified the order for petitioner to make whole to cover the period from August 4, 1975 to October 25,1975, \u201cas the result of its announcement on August 4, 1975.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">As both the dissenting panel member and petitioner have pointed out, since the decision of July 31, 1975, to cancel the wage increase was lawful, the employees were not deprived of any wage increase by the mere \u201cannouncement\u201d on August 4,1975, of the lawful decision of July 31, albeit that the \u201cannouncement\u201d itself constituted a violation of section 8(a)(1).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, the board\u2019s order to make whole petitioner\u2019s employees, resting on a clearly erroneous rationale (\u201cto provide for compensation . for wages they lost\u201d), appears to be neither accurate nor responsive to the policy of the Act. <em>See Nathanson v. NLRB, </em>344 U.S. 25, 27, 73 S.Ct. 80, 97 L.Ed. 23 (1952); <em>Edison Co. v. Labor Board, </em>305 U.S. 197, 236, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938); <em>Morrison-Knudsen Co. v. NLRB, </em>275 F.2d 914,918 (2d Cir. 1960), <em>cert. denied, </em>366 U.S. 909, 81 S.Ct. 1082, 6 L.Ed.2d 234 (1961). Recognizing the breadth of the board\u2019s discretion, we would be inclined to affirm or at least remand if a supportable rationale for the order to make whole were readily apparent even if unexpressed. But such is not the case before us. Petitioner\u2019s technical violation of section 8(a)(1) is sufficient to support the board\u2019s order that the election held on October 16, 1975, be set aside and a second election be held. However, with respect to the order to make whole, as appellant points out, the \u201cannouncement,\u201d which was made more than two months before the election, was not even cited in the Union\u2019s letter of objection to the election mailed to the board or in the Union\u2019s unfair labor practice charge. We simply do not see how this incident warrants compensation for \u201clost\u201d wages since, by the board\u2019s own logic, no wages were lost. The record does not indicate that the make-whole order was regarded as a means of assuring employees the unfettered future exercise of organizational rights, the basis upon which our dissenting brother would affirm the board\u2019s order. Nor can we discover where it was suggested that such an order was necessary to eradicate employee resentment against the Union and assure them that support for the Union in the future will not result in further wage increase cancellations. While the board might conceivably obtain enforcement of a make-whole order on the basis of either rationale, had it been developed in the record or at least articulated by the board, post hoc rationalizations of counsel cannot serve to fill the gap. <em>NLRB </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number><em>v.

NLRB, </em>379 U.S. 203, 216, 85 S.Ct. 398, 406, 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964). A remedial order may not be disturbed \u201cunless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d <em>Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v.

The August 4 announcement had been found to discourage the employees from exercising their \u00a7 7 right to organize by informing them that such activity carried with it a risk of economic injury. The backpay order would undo the effects of the \u00a7 8(a)(1) violation by restoring to the employees what Sta-Hi said had been withdrawn. This remedy, the Board could conclude, is not only reasonably necessary to reassure the employees that they will be fully protected in the exercise of their right to organize but also appropriate as a means of deterring other employers from engaging in similar misconduct. <em>See NLRB v. Otis Hospital, </em>545 F.2d 252, 257 (1st Cir. 1976). I observe that the general, if not uniform, practice of the Board in cases such as this is to award backpay beginning at the time of the unlawful act. <em>See Colorado Seminary, </em>219 N.L.R.B. 1068 (1975); <em>cf. NLRB v. Otis Hospital, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">While recognizing the force of these considerations, the court refuses to enforce this portion of the order because it believes it rests on a clearly erroneous ground: that is, that the August 4 announcement deprived the employees of a wage increase. I have difficulty understanding why the court insists on regarding the Board\u2019s remedial decision as defectively rationalized. It is pertinent to quote the troublesome portion of the Board\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-14\">\u201c[W]e find the initial decision by [Sta-Hi] on July 31, 1975 to cancel the wage increase was lawful and not a violation of [the Act] . .. We shall therefore modify the recommended Order accordingly. Furthermore, we shall change the recommended make-whole order to provide for compensation to employees for wages they lost between August 4 and October 25, 1975, rather than July 31 and October 25, 1975.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-16\">While the Board did use the technically inaccurate language \u201ccompensation, for wages lost\u201d, making the employees whole for an economic injury simply cannot be the Board\u2019s rationale for the backpay order. Since the Board held that the July 31 decision to cancel the wage increase was lawful, it obviously knew that, in a technical sense, no wages had been lost. Unless we attribute an immediate loss of memory to the Board, the only plausible explanation is that this language was intended only to indicate the formula for determining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>amount of the backpay, cf. <em>NLRB v. Otis Hospital, supra </em>at 257, and that the Board failed to state its actual justification for the backpay order because it assumed that \u2014 in light of its established practice \u2014 the justification would be obvious to all. If limited review and deference to the Board\u2019s remedial choices mean anything, I would think it is our obligation to find a reasonable interpretation for the Board\u2019s decision and not to set aside an order because inartful and technically inaccurate language appears in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">While I would enforce the order, I can see the merit in insisting on less misleading language in Board opinions. Yet even if the Board\u2019s decision has to be taken as defectively rationalized, the proper course for the court would be to remand, rather than simply to refuse to enforce this portion of the order. <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Chenery, </em>318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943) establishes the proposition that when an agency gives the wrong reasons for a supportable decision of law or policy, the reviewing court is to send the case back for a new determination. Accord <em>NLRB v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>380 U.S. 438, 85 S.Ct. 1061, 13 L.Ed.2d 951 (1965); <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, </em>313 U.S. 177, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941); <em>see </em>2 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 16.12 at p. 480 (1958 ed.). Since the backpay order could, even in the court\u2019s view, be supported, I think a remand is mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">I would therefore not set aside the back-pay provision of the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
