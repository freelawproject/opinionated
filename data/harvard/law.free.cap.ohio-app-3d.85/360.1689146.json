Geasley, was observed by Officer Douglas of the Tallmadge Police Department, driving his automobile at an excessive speed. Radar indicated that Geasley\u2019s vehicle was traveling fifty-eight m.p.h. in a thirty-five m.p.h. zone. After making a routine traffic stop, Officer Douglas detected a strong odor of alcohol on Geasley\u2019s breath and took note of his disheveled appearance and watery, bloodshot eyes. Having reason to believe that Geasley was intoxicated, Officer Douglas requested that he perform three field sobriety tests. After failing the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, Geasley refused to perform the walk and turn and one-leg balancing tests. Thereafter, Geasley was placed under arrest and transported to the Tallmadge Police Station.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">At the station, Officer Douglas gave Geasley his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and explained that he was required to ask certain questions from a standardized form. In response Geasley stated: \u201cYou can stop right now. I\u2019m not * * * going to do them.\u201d While acknowledging his refusal, Officer Douglas continued to question Geasley. And, although asserting his right to remain silent, Geasley made numerous statements as the questions were asked. This exchange between Geasley and Officer Douglas was recorded on videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">Geasley was charged with speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol. Prior to trial, the defense moved to suppress the videotape in its entirety. On June 9, 1992, the Cuyahoga Falls Municipal Court refused to permit any portion of the tape, video or audio, following Geasley\u2019s indication that he would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>answer any questions. Pursuant to Crim.R. 12(J), the state appeals from this order, raising three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Assignment of Error I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\u201cThe lower court erred in suppressing the videotape of any questioning which occurred after the defendant stated he was not going to answer any questions, because such a blanket suppression was not required by Miranda.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, and its companion cases, the United States Supreme Court recognized that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination protects individuals not only from any legal compulsion to testify in the courtroom, but extends to \u201cinformal compulsion exerted by law-enforcement officers during in-custody questioning.\u201d <em>Id., </em>384 U.S. at 461, 86 S.Ct. at 1620-21, 16 L.Ed.2d at 716. To adequately protect this right, the court fashioned what have become popularly known as the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, required to be given every criminal suspect taken into custody. Included within these warnings is the admonishment that a criminal suspect \u201chas the right to remain silent.\u201d <em>Id., </em>384 U.S. at 468, 86 S.Ct. at 1625, 16 L.Ed.2d at 720. Although a suspect may waive this right, once it is asserted the police must \u201cscrupulously\u201d honor the suspect\u2019s \u201cright to cut off questioning.\u201d <em>Michigan v. Mosley </em>(1975), 423 U.S. 96, 104, 96 S.Ct. 321, 326, 46 L.Ed.2d 313, 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Even though a suspect has the right to discontinue an in-custody interrogation at any time, this does not mean that police must cease all questioning. In <em>Pennsylvania v. Muniz </em>(1990), 496 U.S. 582, 110 S.Ct. 2638, 110 L.Ed.2d 528, the court adopted a \u201croutine booking question\u201d exception to the strict prescripts of <em>Miranda. </em>Thus, an arrestee, even after asserting his right to remain silent, may still be asked questions to secure \u201cbiographical data necessary to complete booking or pretrial services.\u201d <em>Id., </em>496 U.S. at 601, 110 S.Ct. at 2650, 110 L.Ed.2d at 552. While finding that such questioning constitutes interrogation, the court held it permissible when \u201creasonably related to the police\u2019s administrative concerns.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">In addition, the right against self-incrimination during custody extends only to interrogation and its \u201cfunctional equivalent.\u201d <em>Rhode Island v. Innis </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1690, 64 L.Ed.2d 297, 308. Under <em>Miranda, </em>the term \u201cinterrogation\u201d refers not only to \u201cexpress questioning\u201d but also \u201cwords or actions on the part of the police * * * reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Police instructions on a state\u2019s implied consent law do not fall within this definition of \u201cinterrogation.\u201d <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 604, 110 S.Ct. at 2651, 110 L.Ed.2d at 554. See, generally, R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>4511.191(D) for Ohio\u2019s implied consent law and the concomitant requirements placed upon police officials. Such instructions and inquiry of the arrestee as to whether they are understood are \u201cnecessarily \u2018attendant to\u2019 the legitimate police procedure\u201d and do not call for an incriminating response. <em>Muniz, </em>at 604, 110 S.Ct. at 2652, 110 L.Ed.2d at 554, quoting <em>South Dakota v. Neville </em>(1983), 459 U.S. 553, 564, 103 S.Ct. 916, 923, 74 L.Ed.2d 748, 759, fn. 15. Accordingly, even after asserting the right to remain silent, statements made by a suspect in response to instructions on a state\u2019s implied consent law are admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In response to Geasley\u2019s motion to suppress, the state submitted to the trial court, without objection, a transcript of the audio portion of the videotape. In determining what portions, if any, of this videotape are admissible at trial, we have broken this transcript down into three parts, examining each separately.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">\u201c[PART ONE]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">\u201c[By Officer Douglas]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">\u201cTell you what that means here. Well, this one form here has a question section, about 20 questions. I\u2019m going to ask you one at a time.

I\u2019m not going ... not going to do them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">\u201cDouglas: That\u2019s OK cause I\u2019m still going to read them. That\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-12\">\u201cDefendant: That\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-13\">\u201cDouglas: I know that\u2019s fine. Want to sign here to show that I read this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-14\">\u201cDefendant: I ain\u2019t signing shit. You had a bad night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-15\">\u201cDouglas: Uh huh. Don\u2019t matter to me, Bud. Now if you want to get out of here tonight you\u2019re gonna have to sign your bond paper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-16\">\u201cDefendant: I\u2019ll sign that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-17\">\u201cDouglas: Thought you weren\u2019t going to sign anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-18\">\u201cDefendant: That\u2019s a bunch of bull shit. OK, dick head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-19\">\u201cDouglas: Fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-20\">\u201cDefendant: With all respect, F\u2014 your attitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-21\">\u201c[Officer Douglas begins reading implied consent statement to Defendant.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-22\">\u201cDefendant: (Interrupts Douglas while Officer is reading. Defendant mumbles [unintelligible]) ... I\u2019m not going to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-23\">\u201cDouglas: What this means is down at the end I\u2019m going to ask you to take the chemical test. You don\u2019t have to take the test if you don\u2019t want to ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>\u201cDefendant: I don\u2019t want to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">\u201cDouglas: Oh, I know. But the state will suspend your license ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">\u201c[Defendant mumbles. Douglas finishes reading implied consent. Sgt. (Diezman) witnesses reading.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u201cDouglas: OK uh, there\u2019s two questions here, Chris [Geasley]. Is there any physical or medical condition which would not permit you to take the test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">\u201cDefendant: You\u2019re Mr. Douglas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">\u201cDouglas: Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">\u201cDefendant: No. You\u2019re not helping.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-11\">\u201cDouglas: Do you want to submit to the chemical test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-12\">\u201cDefendant: No, no, no, negative. Totally negatory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-13\">\u201cDouglas: I want you to understand, the state will suspend your license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-14\">\u201cDefendant: I understand, sir. Stick it up you butt, basically. With all due respect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-15\">\u201cDouglas: OK, have a seat, all right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">In this first portion of the transcript, Officer Douglas\u2019 comments were limited to advising Geasley about the requirement of signing for his bond and information about Ohio\u2019s implied consent law. The questions asked by Officer Douglas concerned Geasley\u2019s understanding of these instructions and whether there was any medical condition which prevented Geasley from taking a breathalyzer test. Officer Douglas\u2019 statements fall either within the \u201croutine booking question\u201d exception to <em>Miranda </em>or statements not \u201ccalling\u201d for any incriminating response. <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 601-605, 110 S.Ct. at 2650-2652, 110 L.Ed.2d at 552-554. Therefore, even though he asserted his right against self-incrimination, Geasley\u2019s responses are admissible. Accordingly, the trial court erred in excluding this portion of the videotape.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-17\">\u201c[PART TWO]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-18\">\u201cDouglas: Well, if you don\u2019t think you\u2019re drunk you can take the test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-19\">\u201cDefendant: I\u2019m sure I\u2019m drunk. That\u2019s ... it is (mumbles). I\u2019m drunk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-20\">\u201cDouglas: OK.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-21\">\u201cDouglas: How much you weigh now, Chris?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-22\">\u201cDefendant: You weigh me, sir. It\u2019s up to you. I ain\u2019t answering your questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-23\">\u201cDouglas: Were you operating this motor vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-24\">\u201cDefendant: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u201cDouglas: OK. Where were you going?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">\u201cDefendant: Up you[r] butt. Next line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">\u201cDouglas: Where did you start from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">\u201cDefendant: Uh, no capish. I\u2019m not going to cooperate. Just fill in your blanks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">\u201cDouglas: I will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">\u201cDefendant: Did your mother get killed or what? F\u2014 you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">\u201cDouglas: When did you leave tonight?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">\u201cDefendant: No. Negatory. Fill it in, man. Don\u2019t waste time. I\u2019m not going to play with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-12\">\u201cDouglas: You been drinking tonight?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-13\">\u201cDefendant: Oh, no. No. What do you think? If I was sober I\u2019d say yes. Come on. Be realistic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-14\">\u201cDouglas: What time is it now? Give me your best guess. Any idea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-15\">\u201cDefendant: 10:00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-16\">\u201cDouglas: What have you been drinking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-17\">\u201cDefendant: If it was up you[r] ass you\u2019d know. I\u2019ll answer the Sergeant\u2019s questions, but as far as you\u2019re concerned, Mr. Hot Shot, F\u2014 You.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-18\">\u201cDouglas: How many drinks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-19\">\u201cDefendant: (Silence).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-20\">\u201cDouglas: When did you start?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-21\">\u201cDefendant: F\u2014 you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-22\">\u201cDouglas: What time did you stop?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-23\">\u201cDefendant: Zero</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-24\">\u201cDouglas: Where were you drinking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-25\">\u201cDefendant: Zero.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-26\">Part Two of the transcript begins with Officer Douglas stating, \u201cif you don\u2019t think you\u2019re drunk you can take the test.\u201d While not a direct question, we find that it falls under the \u201cfunctionally equivalent\u201d test enunciated in <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301, 100 S.Ct. at 1689, 64 L.Ed.2d at 308. This statement places Geasley in the trilemma of either admitting his intoxication, denying it or remaining silent. The latter two alternatives would give rise to speculation by the trier of fact as to why Geasley thereafter refused to submit to a breathalyzer test. This comment by Officer Douglas was \u201creasonably likely to elicit an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>incriminating response\u201d and, therefore, violated Geasley\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Except for the next question wherein Officer Douglas asked Geasley for his weight, which falls under the \u201croutine booking question\u201d exception, every other question constituted interrogation. Geasley having asserted his right against self-incrimination, the police were obliged to honor Geasley\u2019s \u201cright to cut off questioning.\u201d <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 104, 96 S.Ct. at 327, 46 L.Ed.2d at 321. Therefore the police could not go immediately forward in asking Geasley about the events of that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The state argues that Geasley\u2019s answers and comments were not responsive to the questions being asked, thereby concluding they were volunteered. We acknowledge that \u201c[v]olunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 478, 86 S.Ct. at 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d at 726; <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 300, 100 S.Ct. at 1689, 64 L.Ed.2d at 307. However, because police immediately continued the interrogation after Geasley asserted his privilege, \u201cno evidence obtained as a result of [the] interrogation can be used against him.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 479, 86 S.Ct. at 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The state next argues that Officer Douglas\u2019 question, wherein he asked Geasley the time, was admissible because the response was not testimonial, but physical evidence. The state analogizes this question to requesting a suspect to recite the alphabet or count. It argues that such requests do not seek an incriminating response, but rather an example of the mode and manner in which the response is given. It has been recognized that slurred speech, like breath testing, is physical and not testimonial evidence and therefore not protected by the Fifth Amendment. <em>Muniz, </em>496 U.S. at 590-593, 110 S.Ct. at 2644-2646, 110 L.Ed.2d at 545-546. However, we disagree with the proposition that the response was strictly physical evidence and not testimonial. In <em>Muniz, </em>the court had to decide whether asking the defendant the date of his sixth birthday sought a testimonial response or physical evidence. The court found the question sought a testimonial response. The basis of the decision was that beyond seeking a voice exemplar of the defendant, it required the defendant to perform mental calculations which, when verbalized, became testimonial in nature. <em>Id., </em>496 U.S. at 593-601, 110 S.Ct. at 2646-2650, 110 L.Ed.2d at 547-551. Similarly, asking Geasley to state the present time required him to perform mental calculations in making temporal distinctions. For this reason, the question was prohibited once Geasley asserted his right against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Accordingly, except for the question concerning Geasley\u2019s weight, the trial court correctly suppressed this portion of the videotape.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u201c[PART THREE]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">\u201cDouglas: Are you ill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">\u201cDefendant: Zero.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">\u201cDouglas: Have you been to a doctor or dentist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">\u201cDefendant: Zero.

The police must be permitted some leeway into inquiring into the present medical condition of the arrestee. The purpose of such inquiry is not to elicit incriminating responses, but rather to ensure the safety and well-being of the suspect while in the custody of the police. Accordingly, asking an arrestee whether he has recently seen a physician, is taking medication, or has any medical condition requiring special treatment is a legitimate police concern when booking a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Based upon the foregoing, we find the trial court erred in suppressing the videotape in its entirety and sustain, in part, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Assignment of Error III</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">\u201cEven if, <em>arguendo, </em>the court properly suppressed the audio portion of the tape, it erred in suppressing the video.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">In applying the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, courts must distinguish between evidence which is \u201ctestimonial\u201d and that which is \u201creal or physical evidence.\u201d The Supreme Court in <em>Schmerber v. California </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 757, 764, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 1832, 16 L.Ed.2d 908, 916, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">\u201cThe distinction which has emerged, often expressed in different ways, is that the privilege [against self-incrimination] is a bar against compelling \u2018communications\u2019 or \u2018testimony\u2019, but that compulsion which makes a suspect or accused the source of \u2018real or physical evidence\u2019 does not violate it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">The court went on to note that the privilege provides \u201cno protection against compulsion to submit to fing\u00e9rprinting, photographing, or measurements, to write or speak for identification, to appear in court, to stand, to assume a stance, to walk, or to make a particular gesture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An accused is afforded no protection against compulsion to produce such physical evidence because it does not require the accused \u201cto disclose the contents of his own mind.\u201d <em>Curcio v. United States </em>(1957), 354 U.S. 118, 128, 77 S.Ct. 1145, 1151, 1 L.Ed.2d 1225, 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">In the present case the video portion of the tape, showing Geasley\u2019s movements, gestures and overall appearance, in no way involves his privilege from self-incrimination. Other courts passing upon this same issue have held similarly. See, for example, <em>Poulos v. Texas </em>(Tex.App.1990), 799 S.W.2d 769, 771; <em>People v. Anderson </em>(1991), 150 Misc.2d 339, 343, 568 N.Y.S.2d 306, 309. However, we do caution that if the trier of fact may discern from any portion of the video alone testimonial responses of the defendant made in violation of his rights, then such portion must also be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">Accordingly, the trial court erred in suppressing the video portion of the tape. The state\u2019s third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">Assignment of Error II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-13\">\u201cThe lower court erred in suppressing the videotape on the grounds of irrelevance and prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">In suppressing the videotape the trial court found alternatively that even if Geasley\u2019s statements were not obtained in violation of his right against self-incrimination, they were irrelevant, having \u201ca very serious prejudicial effect on the defendant by the trier of fact.\u201d Having already addressed the admissibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>of the videotape with regard to Geasley\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights, we must decide whether the Rules of Evidence precluded admission. Under the facts of this case, we find the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Geasley\u2019s overall demeanor, including his use of profanity and verbal threats toward Officer Douglas, is relevant to whether Geasley was under the influence of alcohol. Although relevant, the court may permissibly exclude such evidence when its probative value is \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d Evid.R. 403(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In <em>State v. Bakst </em>(1986), 30 Ohio App.3d 141, 144, 30 OBR 259, 262, 506 N.E.2d 1208, 1212, the court, addressing an identical situation, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">\u201cWe hold that evidence about an accused\u2019s own actions or language, so long as it is relevant to the essential elements of the offense, cannot be \u2018unfairly prejudicial.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">We agree that it would be the rare case in which an \u201caccused\u2019s own actions or language\u201d would be unfairly prejudicial. We find the trial court erred in excluding the videotape on the basis of relevancy and unfair prejudice to Geasley. There is a difference between being unfavorable to the defendant and being prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Accordingly, the state\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">The order of the trial court suppressing the videotape in its entirety is hereby reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to admit those portions of the videotape consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b409-12\">Cook, P.J., and Baird, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
