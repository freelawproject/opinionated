In the judgment entry and decree of divorce, the trial court ordered that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">\u201c * * * Plaintiff shall pay to Defendant, as and for permanent alimony, the sum of Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) per week, which shall be subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the Court to modify the order in the event of a significant change in circumstances, such as the remarriage of the Defendant consistent with 3105.18 of the Ohio Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">On October 3, 1991, appellant filed a motion for an order terminating permanent alimony for the reason that appellee was planning to remarry. Appellee remarried on October 18, 1991. On January 31, 1992, the referee filed a report explaining that \u201c[i]n the original divorce, I found that the Defendant had contracted herpes from the Plaintiff during the marriage, that she would suffer the pains of this illness and require medication the rest of her life, that Plaintiff physically abused the Defendant, that the Plaintiff earned $29,536.49 and Defendant $19,163.00 and made no award to Defendant on her attorney fees because of the Plaintiffs debt obligations. The award of alimony to defendant under these circumstances was an award based on the \u2018physical, mental and emotional condition\u2019 of the Defendant and \u2018other factors the court expressly considered relevant\u2019 rather than an award of sustenance or support. While the remarriage of the Defendant at least suggests that she no longer suffers from depression, there was no evidence before me regarding her physical or mental condition other than the stipulation that she was remarried. I recommend that the <em>[sic </em>] be no change in the order for spousal support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">The trial court adopted the referee\u2019s recommendation in an entry filed on April 21, 1992, thereby denying appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">Appellant filed a timely appeal in this court, raising a single assignment of error. Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>terminate the alimony payments. Appellant relies upon <em>Dunaway v. Dunaway </em>(1990), 58 Ohio St.3d 227, 560 N.E.2d 171, in support of his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In <em>Dunaway, </em>at 232, 560 N.E.2d at 176, the court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\u201cwhere a dependent divorced spouse remarries, the obligation of the first spouse to pay sustenance alimony terminates as a matter of law, unless: (1) the sustenance alimony constitutes a property settlement, (2) the payment is related to child support, or (3) the parties have executed a separation agreement in contemplation of divorce that expressly provides for the continuation of sustenance alimony after the dependent party remarries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In this case, the divorce decree explicitly provides for the trial court to retain jurisdiction \u201cto modify the order in the event of a significant change in circumstances, such as the remarriage of the Defendant [appellee].\u201d Also, the decree contains separate provisions regarding property division and child support, and the parties did not explicitly agree that the alimony would continue after appellee remarried. Thus, this case does not fall within any of the three exceptions enumerated by the court in <em>Dunaway. </em>Therefore, we conclude that appellant\u2019s obligation to make alimony payments to appellee terminated as a matter of law on the date appellee remarried, October 18, 1991, under the <em>Dunaway </em>rule, and the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Appellee argues that the <em>Dunaway </em>rule does not control in this case because the alimony was awarded upon the basis of exceptional circumstances, namely, appellee\u2019s physical condition as discussed in the referee\u2019s report. In essence, appellee is asking this court to create a fourth exception to the rule of <em>Dunaway </em>for \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d Although we recognize the trial court\u2019s commendable intention to compensate appellee for her physical ailment resulting from appellant\u2019s conduct, we are unwilling to alter the clear mandate of <em>Dunaway.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">The trial court was bound by the rule of <em>Dunaway, </em>as is this court, and erred in failing to apply it. <em>Durbin v. Schoeber </em>(Jan. 27, 1992), Butler App. No. CA9103-048, unreported, 1992 WL 12612. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision denying appellant\u2019s motion and remand this case for the trial court to grant appellant\u2019s motion to terminate alimony as of the date of appellee\u2019s remarriage pursuant to <em>Dunaway.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b258-11\">Jones, P.J., Koehler and Walsh, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
