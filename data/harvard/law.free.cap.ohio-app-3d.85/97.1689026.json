As Lewis approached the intersection of Azel and Elmont Avenue, he slowed the ambulance to between ten and fifteen miles per hour and proceeded through a stop sign. While in the intersection, the ambulance and an automobile driven by Jeffrey Lipscomb (\u201cLipscomb\u201d) collided. Lewis claims that the ambulance siren and signal lights were in operation before, during, and after the accident. Lipscomb contends that he neither heard nor observed a siren or signal lights. It is uncontroverted, however, that Lewis was responding to an emergency call as instructed by the fire department dispatcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">On March 14, 1991, appellants filed a complaint against Lewis and the city for the personal injuries and loss of consortium caused by the accident. Lewis filed a counterclaim, which is not at issue in the present case. Subsequently, Lewis and the city filed a motion for summary judgment based on the immunity defenses contained in R.C. 2744.02(B)(1) and 2744.03(A)(6). The trial court granted the motion on March 6, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">In their sole assignment of error, appellants assert that the lower court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Lewis and the city. Summary judgment was appropriate only if there was no genuine issue as to any material fact, if Lewis and the city were entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and if reasonable minds could come only to a conclusion adverse to appellants. <em>Morris v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 45, 517 N.E.2d 904; Civ.R. 56(C). In addition, this court must construe the evidence most strongly in appellants\u2019 favor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Appellants present two issues for review. First, they argue that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Lewis was responding to an \u201cemergency alarm,\u201d one of the statutory prerequisites for sovereign immunity. Specifically, appellants contend that an ambulance operator must utilize the siren and signal lights during an \u201cemergency alarm,\u201d making summary judgment in favor of the city improper because whether Lewis activated the siren and signal lights is disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">R.C. 2744.02(B)(1) contains the applicable sovereign immunity provision. It states in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\u201c(B) Subject to sections 2744.08 and 2744.05 of the Revised Code, a political subdivision is liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to persons or property allegedly caused by an act or omission of the political subdivision or of any of its employees in connection with a governmental or proprietary function, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">\u201c(1) Except as otherwise provided in this division, political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to persons or property caused by the negligent operation of any motor vehicle by their employees upon the public roads, highways, or streets when the employees are engaged within the scope of their employment and authority. The following are full defenses to such liability:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\"><em>(( </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">\u201c(b) A member of a municipal corporation fire department or any other firefighting agency was operating a motor vehicle while engaged in duty at a fire, proceeding toward a place where a fire is in progress or is believed to be in progress, or in answering any other emergency alarm and the operation of the vehicle did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(b) provides a complete defense to a political subdivision for the negligent operation of a motor vehicle by a member of its fire department if three conditions are met. First, the individual at fault must be a member of a municipal corporation fire department or any other firefighting agency. Second, for purposes of this case, the individual must have been operating a motor vehicle while answering an \u201cemergency alarm.\u201d Third, the operation of the vehicle cannot constitute willful or wanton misconduct. In their first issue presented for review, appellants address the second condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Construing the evidence most strongly in appellants\u2019 favor, we will assume for purposes of this appeal that Lewis did not operate the ambulance siren or signal lights. For the following reasons, however, we still conclude that Lewis was answering an \u201cemergency alarm\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2744.02(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Appellants rely on R.C. 4513.21 and 4511.45 in arguing that an ambulance operator is statutorily required to utilize the siren and signal lights during an \u201cemergency alarm.\u201d R.C. 4513.21 allows the driver of an emergency vehicle to operate the siren only when responding to an \u201cemergency call.\u201d R.C. 4511.45 requires drivers to yield the right of way to approaching public safety vehicles, including ambulances, equipped with flashing lights and giving audible signal by siren.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">Neither statute explicitly requires an ambulance\u2019s siren and signal lights to be used during an \u201cemergency alarm.\u201d R.C. 4513.21 and 4511.45 simply specify under which conditions an ambulance operator may take advantage of warning devices and an absolute right of way in traffic, which enable the operator to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>expedite arrival at the scene of an emergency. To determine whether R.C. 4513.21 and 4511.45 also require an ambulance operator to utilize the siren and signal lights during an \u201cemergency alarm,\u201d this court must give effect to the words of these statutes, cannot ignore the words of these statutes, and cannot supply words not included. <em>E. Ohio Gas Co. v. Limbach </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 363, 365, 575 N.E.2d 132, 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The term \u201cemergency alarm\u201d is not used in either of the above statutes and is not defined in the definitional sections of R.C. Chapters 4513 or 2744. Giving R.C. 4513.21, 4511.45, and also 2744.02 their plain meanings, we are of the opinion that the operation of an ambulance\u2019s siren and signal lights is not required to characterize an event as an \u201cemergency alarm.\u201d As evidenced by the list of protected conduct set forth in R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(b), including \u201coperating a motor vehicle while engaged in duty at a fire\u201d and \u201cproceeding toward a place where a fire is in progress or believed to be in progress,\u201d it is the character of the event requiring assistance from a fire department that defines an \u201cemergency alarm,\u201d not whether an ambulance operator utilized the siren and signal lights. See <em>Brockman v. Bell </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 508, 605 N.E.2d 445. If the Ohio General Assembly wished to restrict \u201cemergency alarms\u201d to only those occasions when warning devices are deployed, it could have done so by defining \u201cemergency alarm\u201d or by including such a provision in R.C. 4513.02 or 4511.45. Furthermore, the Supreme Court of Ohio has found an \u201cemergency alarm\u201d occurred despite an allegation that an ambulance was proceeding without sounding its siren or flashing its signal lights. See <em>King v. Williams </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 137, 5 OBR 269, 449 N.E.2d 452.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Because appellants offer no evidence other than the alleged absence of the siren and signal lights to challenge the presence of an \u201cemergency alarm,\u201d because we conclude that the operation of these warning devices is not a statutory requirement for an \u201cemergency alarm,\u201d and since it is not in dispute that Lewis responded to an emergency call from the fire department dispatcher, we find that a genuine issue of material fact does not exist on the question of whether Lewis was answering an \u201cemergency alarm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>In their second issue presented for review, appellants challenge the trial court\u2019s determination that the third condition for R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(b) sovereign immunity was satisfied. As articulated above, the third condition is that, for the city to receive immunity, Lewis\u2019s driving cannot constitute willful or wanton misconduct. Additionally, for Lewis to receive immunity in his individual capacity, he must not have acted with \u201cmalicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\u201d R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b). To support their allegations of willful and wanton misconduct and recklessness,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellants rely on Lewis\u2019s alleged failure to utilize the siren and signal lights, Lewis\u2019s failure to obey the stop sign, and the accident reconstruction report of their expert which states that Lewis \u201cshould have slowed up more, or come to a stop, prior to entering onto Elmont Avenue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Again construing the evidence most strongly in favor of appellants, we conclude that a genuine issue of material fact does not exist as to whether Lewis was guilty of willful or wanton misconduct or recklessness. The Supreme Court of Ohio has determined that an individual acts \u201crecklessly\u201d when \u201c \u2018he does an act or intentionally fails to do an act which it is his duty to the other to do, knowing or having reason to know of facts which would lead a reasonable man to realize, not only that his conduct creates an unreasonable risk of physical harm to another, but also that such risk is substantially greater than that which is necessary to make his conduct negligent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompson v. McNeill </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 102, 104-105, 559 N.E.2d 705, 708, quoting 2 Restatement of the Law 3d, Torts (1965), at 587, Section 500. This standard may also be applied to characterize conduct as \u201cwillful and wanton.\u201d <em>Thompson, supra, </em>at 104, 559 N.E.2d at 708, fn. 1. In addition, this court has defined \u201crecklessness\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b) as a perverse disregard of a known risk. <em>Poe v. Hamilton </em>(1990), 56 Ohio App.3d 137, 138, 565 N.E.2d 887, 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Even assuming that Lewis did not operate the siren or signal lights and that he should have slowed the ambulance <em>more </em>when entering the intersection, appellants have not established issues of fact indicating the total absence of care or the perverse disregard of a known risk required before the operation of an automobile is considered \u201creckless\u201d or \u201cwillful\u201d or \u201cwanton.\u201d As explained above, Lewis was not statutorily required to sound the ambulance siren or to operate its signal lights, however desirable such action may be. Moreover, the posted speed limit in the area where the accident occurred is twenty-five miles per hour. It is undisputed that Lewis slowed the ambulance to only ten to fifteen miles per hour as he approached the intersection and proceeded through the stop sign. This conduct demonstrates caution, not a failure to exercise care toward other drivers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Furthermore, because he was responding to an emergency call, Lewis was authorized by R.C. 4511.03 to proceed through the stop sign.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While a failure to operate the siren and signal lights may make Lewis negligent, both Lewis and the city are immune from liability for negligence in this context. See R.C. 2744.02(B)(1) and 2744.03(A)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Because genuine issues of material fact do not exist on the issues of whether Lewis was responding to an \u201cemergency alarm\u201d and whether his actions constituted \u201cwillful,\u201d \u201cwanton\u201d or \u201creckless\u201d conduct, because Lewis and the city were entitled to judgment as a matter of law under R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(b) and 2744.-03(A)(6), and since reasonable minds could come only to this conclusion, the trial court properly awarded summary judgment to Lewis and the city. Appellants\u2019 sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The assignment of error properly before this court having been ruled upon as heretofore set forth, it is the order of this court that the judgment or final order herein appealed from be, and the same hereby is, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-8\">Jones, P.J., Koehler and William W. Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\">. Appellants argue that <em>King </em>is inapposite because it was decided under R.C. Chapter 2744\u2019s predecessor, former R.C. 701.02. A comparison of the two statutes reveals, however, that the language contained in R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(b) is identical to that in former R.C. 701.02(B). In addition, contrary to appellants\u2019 view, former R.C. 701.02 did not provide a municipality with immunity for the willful and wanton misconduct of its employees. See <em>Adams v. Peoples </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 140, 18 OBR 200, 480 N.E.2d 428. Furthermore, the Supreme Court of Ohio has not overruled <em>King, </em>and we find nothing in R.C. Chapter 2744 to indicate that the General Assembly intended to preclude application of the <em>King </em>court\u2019s finding of an \"emergency alarm\u201d despite the question of whether the ambulance operator in that case utilized the siren and signal lights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\">. Lewis is not accused of acting with \"malicious purpose\u201d or in \"bad faith.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b139-17\">. R.C. 4511.03 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-18\">\"The driver of any emergency vehicle or public safety vehicle, when responding to an emergency call, upon approaching a red or stop signal or any stop sign shall slow down as necessary for safety to traffic, but may proceed cautiously past such red or stop sign or signal with due regard for the safety of all persons using the street or highway.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
