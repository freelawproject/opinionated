Pounds with a violation of R.C. 2937.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The state advances two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">\u201c(1) The trial court erred in its finding that Section 2937.29, Ohio Revised Code, does not state an offense and in dismissing the indictment against defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-11\">\u201c(2) The trial court erred in ruling that R.C. 2937.29 can be violated only by a failure to appear as ordered before a court or magistrate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">We agree with the state as to its first assignment, and disagree with the state as to its second assignment. Because our disposition of the second assignment is dispositive of this appeal, the error of the trial court asserted in the first assignment is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">The stipulated facts giving rise to this controversy are that Jerry Pounds was charged with aggravated burglary and appeared before the Dayton Municipal Court February 11, 1992, at which time bond was set at $5,000 cash. On February 20, 1992, the municipal court \u201creduced\u201d the bond, and \u201cset\u201d bond at \u201cCR/EHDP,\u201d which stands in part for \u201cElectronic Home Detention Program.\u201d On March 16, 1992, Pounds failed to keep \u201ca scheduled appointment with PreTrial Services,\u201d which was the basis of the indictment charging a violation of R.C. 2937.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">R.C. 2937.29 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-15\">\u201cWhen from all the circumstances the court is of the opinion that the accused will appear as required, either before or after conviction, the accused may be released on his own recognizance. A failure to appear as required by such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>recognizance shall constitute an offense subject to the penalty provided in section 2937.99 of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">R.C. 2937.99 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\u201cWhoever fails to appear as required, after having been released pursuant to section 2937.29 of the Revised Code, shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">\u201c(A) If the release was in connection with a charge of the commission of a felony or pending appeal after conviction of such felony, be fined no more than five thousand dollars or imprisoned in the penitentiary not less than one nor more than five years, or both[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">In determining that R.C. 2937.29 does not state an offense, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">\u201cR.C. 2937.29 says a \u2018failure to appear as required by such recognizance shall constitute an offense.\u2019 What offense? The offense should be identified by a statute number and a name given to the offense and the prohibited conduct of a person should be set forth in the same form as all other criminal statutes. This Court does <em>not </em>find a statute that states \u2018no person shall fail to appear at a prescribed time before any pretrial reporting program.\u2019 Every criminal statute clearly and unambiguously prohibits certain conduct by stating \u2018no person * * * shall * * *.\u2019 This Court can not find a statute that prohibits the failure to appear before a pretrial agency of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">\u201cThere are no common-law crimes, only statutory crimes in Ohio. Since there is no statute establishing the crime of \u2018failure to appear\u2019 there can not be an indictment. R.C. 2937.29 provides a penalty but it does not describe \u2018the offense\u2019 or prohibit specific conduct. A failure to appear as required by paragraph two of the \u2018Conditions and Terms of Home Arrest Confinement\u2019 subjects the person to the sanctions of the court and constitutes a breach of the conditions of bail or personal recognizance. The remedy is direct court action and not State action to obtain an additional indictment for a felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">In holding that R.C. 2937.29 fails to state an offense, we think the trial court went too far. The offense is \u201cfailure to appear as required by [the defendant\u2019s own] recognizance,\u201d which is readily ascertainable from the words of the statute. R.C. 2937.29 is not fatally flawed because it does not follow the usual format of other statutory sections that define and prohibit offenses. Nor does the statute fail to \u201cprohibit specific conduct.\u201d R.C. 2937.29 prohibits failures to appear as required by the defendant\u2019s own recognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">The trial court, in addition to and prior to its above-quoted statement, observed that the pertinent provisions of R.C. Chapter 2937 and Crim.R. 46 discuss bail and alternatives to bail solely in the context of ensuring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>defendant\u2019s appearance before the court or magistrate, and the consequences of the defendant\u2019s failure to appear before the court or magistrate. Reading R.C. 2937.29 together with the other pertinent provisions of R.C. Chapter 2937, we are persuaded that the only appearances contemplated by the legislature in R.C. 2937.29 as required by the defendant\u2019s own recognizance are court appearances. Thus, Pounds\u2019s failure to keep a scheduled appointment with pretrial services was not an indictable offense. The Court of Appeals for Hancock County has come to the same conclusion in <em>State v. Hayes </em>(Jan. 14, 1983), Hancock App. No. 5-82-11, unreported, 1983 WL 7178.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The indictment was dismissed for failure to state an indictable offense. This was error, but harmless, for the above reasons. The first assignment is overruled. Because Pounds\u2019s conduct did not constitute an offense under R.C. 2937.29, dismissal of the indictment on that basis would have been proper. The second assignment is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The order appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b246-10\">Brogan and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
