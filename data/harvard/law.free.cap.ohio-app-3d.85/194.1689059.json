America, Inc. appeals from the trial court\u2019s decisions which affirmed the allowance of Yvonne Brown\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim and awarded her attorney fees. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">On December 31, 1987, Yvonne Brown was employed by B.P. America as a CRT operator in what was then the Midland Building on Prospect Avenue in Cleveland. At 9:30 in the morning on that date, Brown left her office to go to the Ameritrust bank office located <em>off </em>the lobby shared by the Midland Building with other adjacent buildings. Apparently B.P. America allowed its employees to go to the bank during regular working hours on pay days. After leaving the elevator and going towards Ameritrust in this common lobby, Brown fell and injured her back. Brown did not know what caused her fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Brown\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim was allowed by a district hearing officer. Her claim was affirmed by the regional board of review and on further appeal. B.P. America then appealed the claim to the common pleas court pursuant to R.C. 4123.519, and the court affirmed the claim. The court also awarded Brown attorney fees pursuant to R.C. 4123.519(E). B.P. America timely appealed allowance of the claim in Cuyahoga App. No. 61581 and appealed the award of fees in Cuyahoga App. No. 61949. The cases were consolidated in appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-12\">\u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law in \u2018affirming\u2019 the \u2018Decision of the Ohio Board of Employment Services Industrial Commission,\u2019 and in finding that plaintiff-appellant sustained an injury on December 31, 1987 in the course of, and arising out of, her employment, entitling her to participation in the benefits of the Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statute covers \u201cany injury, whether caused by external accidental means or accidental in character and result, received in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d R.C. 4123.-01(C). In <em>MTD Products, Inc. v. Robatin </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 66, 572 N.E.2d 661, syllabus, the Ohio Supreme Court recently held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u201cAs a general rule, an employee with a fixed place of employment, who is injured while traveling to or from his place of employment, is not entitled to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund because the requisite causal connection between the injury and the employment does not exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Case law prior to <em>MTD Products, supra, </em>allowed claims when an employee was not on the employer\u2019s premises but was within the so-called \u201czone of employment.\u201d See, <em>e.g., Frishkorn v. Flowers </em>(1971), 26 Ohio App.2d 165, 55 O.O.2d 310, 270 N.E.2d 366 (claim allowed for employee injured in communal parking lot on his way to work at a store in the mall); <em>Indus. Comm. v. Henry </em>(1932), 124 Ohio St. 616, 180 N.E. 194 (claim allowed for employee killed on railroad tracks adjacent to employer\u2019s premises while returning to work after meal). However, <em>MTD Products </em>indicates that injuries occurring off the employer\u2019s premises but within the \u201czone of employment\u201d will be compensable henceforth only when the employment itself created a special hazard. The court stated the requirements for a special hazard as follows, quoting from the syllabus of <em>Littlefield v. Pillsbury Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 389, 6 OBR 439, 453 N.E.2d 570:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">\u201c(1) \u2018but for\u2019 the employment, the employee would not have been at the location where the injury occurred, and (2) the risk is distinctive in nature or quantitatively greater than the risk common to the public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\"><em>MTD Products </em>overruled <em>Littlefield. </em>In <em>Littlefield, </em>the employee was returning to work by car from a lunch break. He was rear-ended while waiting to make a left-hand turn into the plant entrance of his employer. The <em>MTD Products </em>court explained that the <em>Littlefield </em>claim should not have been allowed because \u201c[t]he risk to an employee making a turn from a busy roadway and into the plant entrance is no different from, and no greater than, the risk that any number of the driving public encounters every day on crowded and congested city streets.\u201d <em>MTD Products, supra, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 69, 572 N.E.2d at 664. The court affirmed the special hazard rule as set forth in <em>Littlefield, </em>see <em>supra, </em>explaining that <em>Littlefield </em>was an incorrect application of the law to the facts. The court went on to state that MTD created no special hazard where its employee Robatin was rear-ended while slowing down to turn into the MTD premises. Accordingly, Robatin\u2019s claim was disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">In the case at bar, Brown was not on B.P. America premises when she was injured, but was nearby in the communal lobby. While Brown would not have been traversing the lobby but for her employment in the adjacent building, the risk of falling in that lobby was not a special hazard created by B.P. America. Yvonne Brown took the same risk as any other member of the public who chose to enter the lobby. Accordingly, pursuant to <em>MTD Products, </em>Brown\u2019s claim should not have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>We also note that Brown\u2019s claim was also problematical pursuant to prior case law because she was engaged with a personal errand, not the business of her employer. Compare <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 275, 551 N.E.2d 1271 (claim allowed where employee injured on employer\u2019s premises while collecting for an employees\u2019 flower fund). See, also, <em>Lord v. Daugherty </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 441, 20 O.O.3d 376, 423 N.E.2d 96 (claim not allowed where employee was killed three miles way from his last assignment) and <em>Hill v. Gen. Metal Heat Treating, Inc. </em>(1988), 47 Ohio App.3d 72, 547 N.E.2d 405 (claim not allowed where employee killed on lunch break).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Since Brown was engaged with a personal errand and fell in a public place outside the employer\u2019s premises where there was no special hazard created by her employer, the trial court erred in upholding her claim. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law in granting plaintiffs motion for attorney fees and awarding plaintiffs counsel attorney fees in the amount of $2500.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">R.C. 4123.519(E) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">\u201c(E) The cost of any legal proceedings authorized by this section, including an attorney\u2019s fee to the claimant\u2019s attorney to be fixed by the trial judge, based upon the effort expended, <em>in the event the claimant\u2019s right to participate or to continue to participate in the fund is established upon the final determination of an appeal, </em>shall be taxed against the employer or the commission if the commission or the administrator rather than the employer contested the right of the claimant to participate in the fund. The attorney\u2019s fee shall not exceed twenty-five hundred dollars.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Since we have determined that Brown is not entitled to participate in the fund, she is also not entitled to attorney fees. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b233-13\">Dyke, C.J., and James D.
