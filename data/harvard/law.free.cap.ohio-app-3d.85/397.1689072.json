The rates for the first ten years of the lease agreement were specified in the agreement, and, thereafter, \u201c * * * the rates which may be charged to consumers of gas from the Utility shall be those fixed by Lessor [appellant] from time to time subject, however, to any right of the Lessee [appellee] to appeal therefrom to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">In early 1990, appellee alleges that it initiated negotiations between the parties regarding a rate increase. An alleged response from appellant is not included as part of the record. Thereafter, appellee filed an application for \u201cinitial rates\u201d with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (\u201cPUCO\u201d). After permitting appellant to intervene in the PUCO proceedings and initiating its own investigation, PUCO issued an order pursuant to its investigation and appellee\u2019s request regarding the rates to be charged. After appellant\u2019s request for rehearing was denied by PUCO, it initiated the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Appellant\u2019s complaint alleged that appellee breached paragraph nine of the lease agreement, quoted <em>supra, </em>and sought to have the lease agreement declared to be null and void. Appellee filed an answer and counterclaim to appellant\u2019s complaint, which denied that it had breached the provisions of the lease agreement. Appellant thereafter filed a reply to appellee\u2019s answer and counterclaim. Subsequently, appellee filed a motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint and for judgment on the pleadings. Appellee\u2019s motion was based on three theories: first, that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action; second, that the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel barred the complaint; and third, that the complaint failed to state a claim for relief. After the appropriate responses from the parties, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion. As neither of the parties requested findings of fact and conclusions of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>pursuant to Civ.R. 52, the trial court issued none and appellant\u2019s three assignments of error in its brief parallel appellee\u2019s three bases for granting its motion for judgment on the pleadings and motion to dismiss. Since no findings of fact and conclusions of law were requested, we will address all three bases and assignments of error to determine whether the trial court properly granted appellee\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Before confronting the assignment of error we must address some preliminary matters. First, we direct appellant\u2019s attention to Loc.App.R. 11, which states that \u201cpropositions of law\u201d may not be substituted for assignments of error. Although appellant labels its bases for review as \u201cassignments of error,\u201d the substantive content of its bases for review do not allege error by the trial court. Rather they simply state propositions of law. However, in the interests of justice, we will further address appellant\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Second, we must determine what part of the record this court and the trial court could review in reaching a decision regarding appellee\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint. In determining whether to grant a motion for judgment on the pleadings, a court must examine solely the pleadings. <em>Peterson v. Teodosio </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 161, 63 O.O.2d 262, 297 N.E.2d 113. In determining whether to grant a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim in the absence of the conversion of the motion into one for summary judgment, a court must only examine the complaint. <em>Stephens v. Boothby </em>(1974), 40 Ohio App.2d 197, 69 O.O.2d 189, 318 N.E.2d 535, paragraph two of the syllabus. Thus, in reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision, we are limited to appellant\u2019s complaint and reply and appellee\u2019s answer and counterclaim, to determine whether the trial court properly granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint and for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">If, after reviewing the pleadings, a court finds that there exist no material issues of fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the moving party\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Civ.R. 12(C), should be granted. <em>Calhoun v. Supreme Court of Ohio </em>(1978), 61 Ohio App.2d 1, 15 O.O.3d 13, 399 N.E.2d 559. And, to deny a party\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, a court must find that the allegations contained in the complaint set forth facts which if established by evidence would entitle one to relief. <em>Stephens, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Having set forth the proper parts of the record necessary to our determination and the standard necessary to our determination, we turn to the first assignment of error. Appellant argues that the Henry County Court of Common Pleas had subject matter jurisdiction to determine the parties\u2019 rights under the lease agreement. We agree with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\">\u201cA court of common pleas has jurisdiction to determine and declare the rights, status and other legal relations of parties to a contract, even where one party is a public utility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Appellant specifically charged in its complaint that appellee had breached a condition of the lease agreement entered into between the parties. A claim that a party breached a condition or covenant of a contract constitutes a claim for relief and needs no citation. The facts in appellant\u2019s complaint set forth facts which could be established by evidence entitling it to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Also, the trial court herein had subject matter jurisdiction over the issue. Again, appellant\u2019s complaint rests on the claim that appellee breached the contract between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\u201cThis court has stated that the courts of this state are available to supplicants who have <em>claims sounding in contract against a corporation coming under the authority of the Public Utilities Commission. </em>* * * As stated in <em>New Bremen [v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1921), 103 Ohio St. 23, 132 N.E. 162], <em>supra, </em>at page 30 [132 N.E. at page 164], \u2018[t]he public utilities commission is in no sense a court. It has no power to judicially ascertain and determine legal rights and liabilities, or adjudicate controversies between parties as to <em>contract rights </em>or property rights.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. v. Riley </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 168, 7 O.O.3d 317, 373 N.E.2d 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Appellee relies upon <em>Kazmaier Supermarket, Inc. v. Toledo Edison Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 147, 573 N.E.2d 655, to dispute appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to rule upon appellant\u2019s complaint. Appellee argues that the Supreme Court of Ohio determined that P\u00daCO has exclusive jurisdiction in matters involving rate disputes. <em>Kazmaier </em>differs from the facts of the matter <em>sub judice. Kazmaier </em>essentially involved whether the rate charged by the utility company was unreasonable and in violation of the law, pursuant to R.C. 4905.26. However, <em>Kazmaier </em>left intact the rule stated above that PUCO does not have the power to determine the legal rights and liabilities regarding a contract or property right, as previously noted. <em>New Bremen v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1921), 103 Ohio St. 23, 132 N.E. 162; <em>State ex rel. Dayton Power &amp; Light Co., supra; Marketing Research Serv., Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 52, 517 N.E.2d 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">The present matter does not have, at the root of the controversy between the parties, a rate dispute as in <em>Kazmaier. </em>Rather, appellant\u2019s central problem is the <em>procedure </em>that culminated in PUCO\u2019s final order imposing rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Therefore, the trial court had before it a complaint which properly stated a claim for relief and over which it had subject matter jurisdiction. This assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">\u201cSince the merits of the private contractual dispute between these litigants had not previously been adjudicated by a judicial tribunal of competent jurisdiction, the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel did not bar the Village\u2019s complaint for declaratory judgment in the common pleas court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel are applied to circumstances wherein an issue that has arisen between parties has been adjudicated and cannot be relitigated. 63 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1985), Judgments, Sections 400 and 380. Such doctrines are inapplicable to the matter before us. As noted above, PUCO could not have determined the legal rights and liabilities of the parties; therefore, the issue of whether appellee breached a provision of the lease agreement has not yet been determined. Therefore, this assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Assignment of Error No. 3</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">\u201cThe complaint states a claim for declaratory relief occasioned by Suburban\u2019s breach of the lease agreements with the Village.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">As noted in assignment of error No. 1, appellant\u2019s complaint states a claim for relief because it is supported by allegations which could be established by evidence. There is no doubt herein that appellant\u2019s claim that appellee breached a provision of the contract sufficiently amounts to a valid claim for relief. Moreover, after a review of appellant\u2019s complaint, we find that appellant made sufficient allegations of fact, which if proven by it, establish that it is entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">Further, the trial court could not have granted appellee\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings on the basis that the pleadings revealed that there were no issues of material fact and that appellee was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Calhoun, supra. </em>To the contrary, a genuine issue of material fact still exists herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">The issue of whether appellee breached a provision of the lease agreement was not a matter to be resolved by PUCO, as noted in Assignments of Error Nos. 1 and 2. Thus, the precise issue posed by appellant in its complaint is to be resolved by the lease agreement of the parties, pursuant to Section 4, Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution, or, in other words, pursuant to the specific language, and the interpretation thereof, of the contract. See <em>Interurban Ry. &amp; Terminal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number><em>Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1918), 98 Ohio St. 287, 120 N.E. 831; <em>Link v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1921), 102 Ohio St. 336, 131 N.E. 796. However, before the trial court could decide the issue, it needed more evidence than was contained in the pleadings to determine whether such a breach occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Appellant\u2019s complaint and reply indicate that appellee had nothing from which it could \u201cappeal\u201d; therefore, it breached a provision of the contract. Appellee\u2019s answer and counterclaim that it was \u201cappealing\u201d from an alleged response of the Village of McComb\u2019s council member(s) indicating that it would not accept appellee\u2019s rate proposal. Since the pleadings created an issue of material fact (what appellee was \u201cappealing\u201d from) the trial court could not have properly granted appellee\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Therefore, this assignment of error is sustained and the judgment of the Henry County Court of Common Pleas in this matter is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b439-8\">Evans, P.J., and Shaw, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
