Vollmar </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 378, 385, 614 N.E.2d 1136, 1141. We also determined, pursuant to <em>Moore v. Sweda </em>(1985), 27 Ohio App.3d 38, 27 OBR 40, 499 N.E.2d 371, that the trial court did not err in awarding compensatory damages to appellee in the absence of a specific monetary prayer therefor. <em>Vollmar, supra, </em>83 Ohio App.3d at 389, 614 N.E.2d at 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">In their application for reconsideration, appellants urge two grounds for reconsideration: (1) many significant events have transpired during the course of proceedings in this case and, \u201c[w]hile none of those events are included in the record of this appeal, the trial court should not be prevented from considering those events in the first instance in order to ascertain what the proper date of dissolution should be\u201d; and (2) we did not consider appellants\u2019 argument that <em>Moore </em>was \u201cpresumptively overruled\u201d by <em>Bishop v. Grdina </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 26, 20 OBR 213, 485 N.E.2d 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">As stated in <em>Matthews v. Matthews </em>(1981), 5 Ohio App.3d 140, 143, 5 OBR 320, 324, 450 N.E.2d 278, 282, the test generally applied upon the filing of an application for reconsideration in the court of appeals is whether such application \u201c * * * calls to the attention of the court an obvious error in its decision or raises an issue for our consideration that was either not considered at all or was not fully considered by us when it should have been.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">As to appellants\u2019 first ground for reconsideration, although the events which appellants claim we failed to consider are not part of the record, we nevertheless did fail to fully consider that there may be events that could cause the trial court, in the first instance, to establish the date of dissolution at a time previous to its final judgment entry. We find, therefore, that appellants\u2019 application for reconsideration is well taken as to the date of dissolution of the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>As to appellants\u2019 second ground for reconsideration, we did consider appellants\u2019 argument that <em>Moore </em>was \u201cpresumptively overruled\u201d by <em>Grdina, </em>but rejected it. We found in our opinion of November 20, 1992, that <em>Grdina </em>represents the general rule and <em>Moore </em>is an exception. To further clarify, <em>Grdina </em>did not explicitly overrule <em>Moore </em>and, since <em>Grdina </em>did not involve an action for partnership accounting, neither did it \u201cpresumptively overrule\u201d <em>Moore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Upon full consideration of appellants\u2019 \u201cMOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION,\u201d this court finds said motion well taken in part as set forth above and, to that extent, said motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">As to the matter concerning appellants\u2019 \u201cBILL OF.COSTS,\u201d filed November 24, 1992, although this is not a motion, this court construes appellee\u2019s memorandum in opposition thereto as a motion to exclude , from \u201ccosts\u201d under App.R. 24 the expenses incurred in preparing the trial transcript. Appellee relies upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>Diefenthaler v. Diefenthaler </em>(1989), 56 Ohio App.3d 150, 565 N.E.2d 857. That case, however, has been specifically superseded by App.R. 24(B), amended effective July 1, 1992. See, also, Staff Note to App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Appellee\u2019s motion to exclude from \u201ccosts\u201d the expenses incurred in preparation of the trial transcript is not well taken and is denied. The cost of preparing the trial transcript will be taxed as \u201ccosts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b236-8\">Glasser, P.J., Ajbood and Sherck, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
