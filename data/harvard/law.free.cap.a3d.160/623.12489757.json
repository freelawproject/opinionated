Copsey, the widow of Lance D. Copsey, individually and as the personal representative of the Estate of Lance D. Copsey, deceased, along with the minor children and mother of the decedent are the petitioners. They allege that the respondents, John S. Park, M.D. (\"Dr. Park\") and his employer, Brown, Croft and Frazier, P.A. (\"Annapolis Radiology\"), were negligent when Dr. Park interpreted radiological images on June 4, 2010, leading to Lance D. Copsey's (\"Mr. Copsey\") fatal stroke on June 10, 2010. Initially, the petitioners sued Dr. Park and three subsequent treating physicians, along with their employers. Prior to trial, however, the petitioners partially settled their claims and dismissed two of the doctors and their employer. A day after trial had begun, the petitioners also dismissed the remaining subsequent treating physician. The trial judge denied the petitioners' motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   which opposed the admission of evidence regarding the non-parties' statuses as former defendants and Dr. Park's raising the defense that the negligence of subsequent treating\n   physicians was an intervening and superseding cause of Mr. Copsey's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We shall hold that evidence of non-party negligence was relevant and necessary in providing Dr. Park a fair trial as it tended to show he was not negligent;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   thus, the alleged prejudice did not outweigh its probative value. Further, causation was an issue for the jury to determine and Dr. Park presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that he was not negligent; and if found to be negligent, his negligence was superseded by the independent and extraordinary negligence of others. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals which held that both of the motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   were properly denied because the\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   case permits the introduction into evidence of non-party negligence and causation.\n   <em>\n    Martinez ex rel. Fielding v. Johns Hopkins Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675011\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/212/634/\">\n    212 Md.App. 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675011\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/212/634/\">\n    70 A.3d 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Copsey had several risk factors for stroke including moderate obesity, hypercholesterolemia,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   hypertension, and a smoking habit. On February 4, 2010, Mr. Copsey was presented to the Anne Arundel Medical Center (\"AAMC\") emergency room after slipping, falling, and hitting the back of his head while playing racquetball. He complained of nausea and a headache. The hospital released him after treatment and a reportedly normal cranial CT scan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Three months later, on May 26, 2010, Mr. Copsey returned to the AAMC emergency room. He complained of recurring episodes of dizziness since the morning of May 26. Another CT scan revealed normal results. He was referred to his internal medicine physician, Aditya Chopra, M.D. (\"Dr. Chopra\"), for a follow-up appointment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 1, 2010, Mr. Copsey saw Dr. Chopra. Mr. Copsey complained of difficulty walking, nausea, headaches, and persistent vertigo. Dr. Chopra prescribed a generic brand of Dramamine and antibiotics and suggested Mr. Copsey consult an ophthalmologist and, if the symptoms did not improve, also advised him to see an ear, nose, and throat doctor. Mr. Copsey did meet with an ophthalmologist, on June 2, 2010, who determined there was no ophthalmological etiology for his diplopia\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and recommended a neurologic consultation and a neuroradiologic evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 4, 2010, Mr. Copsey returned to see Dr. Chopra who performed both of the recommended neurological assessments and found signs of neurological problems and thus advised Mr. Copsey to return to the emergency room for immediate attention. On that afternoon, Mr. Copsey returned to the AAMC emergency room. He told Charles Iliff, M.D. (\"Dr. Iliff\"), that he had vertigo occurring for about a week, numbness in the right side of his face, right arm, and right leg, headaches, mild shortness of breath, mild diplopia, and trouble walking. Dr. Iliff's examination of Mr. Copsey was normal, but after consulting with a neurologist, Larry Blum, M.D. (\"Dr. Blum\"), a CT scan and a brain MRI/MRA\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   were conducted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On the same date, a radiologist, Dr. Park, interpreted the CT scan at 4:02 p.m. and the MRI/MRA at 6:45 p.m. Dr. Park reported an allegedly normal CT scan and MRI/MRA. Specifically, he found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, infarction, mass effect, or midline shift. No abnormal extraaxial fluid collections are identified. The ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are normal. There is no acute injury to the skull base or calvarium.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   There is normal anatomy of the circle of Willis with no evidence of aneurysm, anteriovenous malformation, or abnormal vessel cut-off. No hemodynamically significant stenosis is identified. Incidental note is made of fenestration of the left vertebral artery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, infarction, mass effect, or midline shift. No abnormal extraaxial fluid collections are identified. The ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are normal. The flow voids at the skull base are normal. There is no acute injury to the skull base or calvarium.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 5, 2010, Dr. Blum independently reviewed the MRI and MRA images after Dr. Park and also confirmed there were no abnormalities. Dr. Blum believed Mr. Copsey's symptoms were merely evidence of migraines. Mr. Copsey was discharged on June 6, 2010, and diagnosed with migraines, cluster migraines, vertigo, hypercholesterolemia, mildly elevated blood pressure, and hypertension ; his discharge summary indicated he was \"otherwise doing fine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 7, 2010, Mr. Copsey was seen by Dr. Chopra for outpatient evaluation. Mr. Copsey indicated he had no chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, aches or pains, headache, or burning urination. Dr. Chopra noted that Mr. Copsey had no neurological issues and told him to go back to the emergency room or follow-up with Dr. Blum if his symptoms returned. His symptoms did return towards the end of the day, but he did not return to see Dr. Blum at AAMC for a follow-up evaluation until June 9, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the follow-up, Mr. Copsey stated that his symptoms, including diplopia and headaches, had returned and that he had begun experiencing hiccups and trouble swallowing. Mr.\n   Copsey's neurological exam was normal, but the new symptoms concerned Dr. Blum. Thus, he ordered an urgent interpretation of a new brain MRI, writing \"*STAT*\" on the order form and telling Mr. Copsey to return to him with the results. Dr. Blum's requisition to the radiologist specified an urgent call back from the radiologist. Vijay Viswanathan, M.D. (\"Dr. Viswanathan\"), in the radiology department, interpreted the MRI at 4:02 p.m. and noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   1. Ill-defined new band-like signal abnormality within the right lateral medulla which is nonspecific but is concerning for acute infarction. This is a new finding since the prior study dated June 4, 2010.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   2. This could be suggestive of lateral medullary syndrome /Wallenberg syndrome.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   3. Left vertebral artery abnormal flow void which is nonspecific. It is difficult to appreciate the connection between right medullary abnormality and left vertebral artery abnormality. Clinical correlation advised.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   4. No evidence of intraorbital pathology.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   I discussed these findings with Dr. Alkaitis, covering physician for Dr. Blum at 1030 p.m., 6-9-10.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   An \"infarction\" is brain-cell death caused by insufficient flow of blood. Dr. Viswanathan dictated the report at 4:42 p.m., but it was not until 10:30 p.m. that Dr. Viswanathan notified the on-call neurologist, Damanhuri Alkaitis, M.D., (\"Dr. Alkaitis\") of the findings. Dr. Viswanathan did not report these results to Dr. Blum, as he was asked to do, or anyone else at AAMC or to Mr. Copsey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Copsey returned to see Dr. Blum around 6 p.m. with the images. In his report, Dr. Blum reflected that the radiology department never called him despite his request for an urgent call back. However, Dr. Blum could have accessed Dr. Viswanathan's findings earlier by checking the Medical Center's computer database or by contacting the radiology department. He reviewed the images himself and found no abnormalities. Thus, Dr. Blum released Mr. Copsey from the hospital. Mr. Copsey had already been released by the time Dr. Viswanathan\n   notified Dr. Alkaitis of the MRI results at 10:30 p.m. Mr. Copsey was not informed that a lateral medullary infarct had been discovered nor did Dr. Viswanathan or Dr. Alkaitis take any action in contacting Mr. Copsey, his family, or arranging for an ambulance to transport Mr. Copsey back to the hospital emergency room for treatment that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On June 10, 2010 at approximately 4:00 a.m., Mr. Copsey suffered a stroke when he woke up to use the bathroom. His wife took him to the AAMC emergency room after she found him on the floor of their home unable to get up. A CT scan conducted at approximately 6:07 a.m. revealed a right medullary hypodensity, reflective of an acute stroke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mr. Copsey's condition worsened by approximately 11:00 a.m. He was then transferred to Johns Hopkins Hospital (\"JHH\"). JHH diagnosed Mr. Copsey with bilateral vertebral dissections; multiple acute brainstem and cerebellar strokes ; hyperlipidemia ; and head trauma from the racquetball fall in February.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On June 12, 2010, Mr. Copsey underwent angioplasty and received a stent in his right vertebral artery. However, the following day he became unresponsive. After treatments failed, Mr. Copsey's condition continued to deteriorate. He died on June 13, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The petitioners filed survival and wrongful death actions on September 27, 2011, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County against Dr. Park and Annapolis Radiology, Dr. Viswanathan and his employer, Anne Arundel Diagnostic Imaging, Inc., and Dr. Blum and Dr. Alkaitis, and their employer, Bay Area Neurology, LLC (\"Bay Area\"). According to the petitioners, between June 4 and June 10, each doctor involved in the treatment negligently failed to timely diagnose Mr. Copsey's evolving stroke. They sought to hold all of the doctors involved jointly and severally liable for the death of Mr. Copsey. The petitioners reached pre-trial settlements with the defendants, Dr. Blum, Dr. Alkaitis, and Bay Area Neurology. Those defendants were dismissed from the action. On September 17, 2014, a day after the trial had begun, the\n   petitioners voluntarily dismissed Dr. Viswanathan and his employer, Anne Arundel Diagnostic Imaging, Inc. Thus, Dr. Park and his employer, Annapolis Radiology, were ultimately the only defendants left in the case to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On August 26, 2014, the petitioners moved\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   , to prevent introduction of certain evidence, prior to trial. The first motion was to exclude all evidence relating to Dr. Blum's and Dr. Alkaitis' prior statuses as defendants and the pre-trial settlements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The second was to preclude Dr. Park from raising as a defense that the negligence of subsequent treating physicians was an intervening and superseding cause of Mr. Copsey's alleged injuries. After hearing arguments from both parties on the first day of trial, the Honorable Paul G. Goetzke, presiding, denied both of the motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Prior to trial, the petitioners' attorney wrote a letter to their expert witness, Dr. Caren Jahre (\"Dr. Jahre\"), a radiologist/neuroradiologist, discussing all of Mr. Copsey's history, the studies performed, his symptoms, and the cause of death. The respondents suggested that Dr. Adam Hecht (\"Dr. Hecht\"), a neurologist and Dr. Jahre's partner, may have read this letter, but Dr. Hecht testified at trial that he could not recall whether or not he had read the letter. Moreover, Dr. Jahre indicated in her\n   <em>\n    de bene esse\n   </em>\n   deposition testimony that she could not recall if she looked at the letter before her review, but also stated that she\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   does blind reviews when an attorney directs it, which was not done here, and that she did know in advance of conducting her review to look for\n   vertebral artery occlusions. Dr. Hecht and Dr. Jahre testified that the June 4 MRA showed abnormalities in the left vertebral artery (\"LVA\") and the right vertebral artery (\"RVA\"), which should have been detected by Dr. Park.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A defense witness, Dr. Susan O'Sullivan (\"Dr. O'Sullivan\"), a radiologist, pointed out that an objective blind review is meant to prevent bias from a hindsight review where a radiologist knows exactly what to look for when reviewing a study.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two of the defense experts, Dr. Alan Hyman (\"Dr. Hyman\") and Dr. O'Sullivan, conducted blind reviews and did not notice any problems or abnormalities that went unnoticed by Dr. Park. Dr. Hyman, an assistant clinical professor of neuroradiology at Mt. Sinai Medical School, found the MRI/MRA, including the LVA and RVA, from the June 4 results to be normal. Both of the defense experts concluded that Dr. Park had acted within the standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Michael Horowitz, M.D. (\"Dr. Horowitz\"), a neurosurgeon and the petitioners' causation expert, testified that if Dr. Blum, Dr. Alkaitis, or Dr. Viswanathan had obtained medical attention for Mr. Copsey on June 9, one day before his stroke, the stroke could have been prevented. Guy Rordorf, M.D. (\"Dr. Rordorf\"), an expert witness for the petitioners, also testified that had Dr. Blum, Dr. Viswanathan, and Dr. Alkaitis given Mr. Copsey medical attention on June 9, his major stroke on June 10 would have been avoided and his life saved. Further, expert witnesses on\n   both sides testified regarding the negligence of all three of the subsequent treating doctors in their care of Mr. Copsey:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Dr. Blum:\n   </strong>\n   Expert witnesses opined that Dr. Blum's treatment of Mr. Copsey was below the standard of care. Dr.\n   Rordorf testified that Dr. Blum was negligent on June 9 when he reviewed the MRI results on his own, did not wait for the STAT test results he had ordered from the radiology department, and sent Mr. Copsey home. Dr. Rordorf noted that Mr. Copsey presented symptoms of stroke which should have been apparent. Another one of the petitioners' witnesses, Dr. Horowitz, stated that a reasonable neurologist would have acted to treat Mr. Copsey's symptoms immediately. As to June 4, Dr. Owen Samuels (\"Dr. Samuels\"), the respondents' witness, testified that it was not reasonable for Dr. Blum to rely solely on Dr. Park's interpretations of the MRI/MRA on June 5 because a stroke is a clinical diagnosis and Mr. Copsey was exhibiting apparent stroke-like symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Dr. Viswanathan:\n   </strong>\n   Despite receiving notice from Dr. Blum to contact him, Dr. Viswanathan did not contact Dr. Blum after Dr. Viswanathan obtained the radiology scans on June 9 shortly after 4:00 p.m. He only contacted Dr. Alkaitis, who was substituting for Dr. Blum, six hours later that night, after Mr. Copsey had already been released by Dr. Blum. Dr. Hecht stated that Dr. Viswanathan's actions fell below the standard of care for a treating radiologist and every effort should have been made to contact the patient's physician immediately after discovering these alarming results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Dr. Alkaitis:\n   </strong>\n   Dr. Hecht also testified that Dr. Alkaitis' conduct fell below the standard of care for a physician when he received news of Mr. Copsey's condition from Dr. Viswanathan at 10:30 p.m. on the night of June 9, but did not take further action. Dr. Rordorf testified that he was surprised that Dr. Alkaitis did nothing because it is the responsibility of a neurologist in such a situation to call the patient to let them know of a critical MRI finding. Further, Dr. Rordorf indicated that Dr. Alkaitis should have had the patient rushed to the emergency room and should have called the emergency room to notify them that a patient with a stroke would be coming in for emergency treatment. Dr. Rordorf testified that such treatment would have saved Mr. Copsey's life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The case was tried before a jury from September 16, 2014 through September 24, 2014. On September 24, 2014, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant, Dr. Park. The jury found that Dr. Park did not breach the standard of care and acted as a reasonable physician under the circumstances. The petitioners filed a timely appeal. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court as explained in its opinion filed on May 31, 2016. The intermediate appellate court applied\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   to uphold the introduction of evidence of a non-party's negligence and causation.\n   <em>\n    Copsey v.

In addition, the court held that a reasonable jury could have found that the negligence of the subsequent treating physicians were both intervening and superseding causes contributing to Mr. Copsey's death.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307615\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/228/107/#p121\">\n    228 Md.App. at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307615\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/228/107/#p121\">\n    137 A.3d at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Jenny J. Copsey, et al. filed a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court. We granted certiorari to answer the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   1. Did the trial court err in admitting evidence of the negligence of non-party, subsequent treating physicians, including evidence that they were once defendants in the instant suit?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   2. Did the trial court err in instructing the jury on superseding cause when the negligence of all the treating physicians amounted to one indivisible injury, that being death?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Copsey v.

It was not error to admit evidence of the negligence of the non-party subsequent treating physicians. Evidence of a non-party's negligence was relevant and necessary in providing Dr. Park a fair trial; the potential prejudice did not outweigh the probative value of the evidence. We further hold that causation was an issue for the jury to determine. The evidence presented by Dr. Park tended to show that he was\n   not negligent and that if he were negligent, the negligent omissions of the other three subsequent treating physicians were intervening and superseding causes of the harm to the patient. Therefore, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We have held that \"on review, we will not disturb the trial court's evidentiary rulings absent error or a clear abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

The evidence also deflected, according to the petitioners, the jury's attention from Dr. Park's performance and injected notions into the consciousness of the jurors that the \"guilty\" parties had once been defendants who had settled and therefore Dr. Park must not have been negligent. The petitioners also assert that the judgment of\n   the Court of Special Appeals should be reversed because the\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   decision requires review by this Court as well as the improper application of the doctrine of intervening and superseding causes in the context of a medical negligence action involving acts of multiple concurrent tortfeasors. Petitioners argue that each of the physicians contributed to the six-day delay that proximately caused Mr. Copsey's death. In other words, their delay worked, in conjunction with one another, to cause Mr. Copsey's death and thus they are jointly and severally liable. The petitioners maintain that if Dr. Park had diagnosed Mr. Copsey's evolving stroke on June 4, 2010, and referred him for appropriate treatment, it is more probable than not that he would not have died. Further, the petitioners maintain that the subsequent negligence of the other physicians, Dr. Blum, Dr. Viswanathan, and Dr. Alkaitis, in also failing to timely diagnose and treat Mr. Copsey's condition was foreseeable and was not the superseding cause of Mr. Copsey's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The respondents, on the other hand, contend that admitting the evidence sought to be excluded by the two motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   was proper. They posit that it is the authority of the jury to weigh evidence and make the determination of superseding causation. Moreover, the negligence of the other doctors between June 9-10 broke the chain of causation between Dr. Park's reading of the radiological images on June 4 and the stroke Mr. Copsey suffered on June 10. Further,\n   they argue that under the guise of preventing a \"distraction\" the petitioners want a rule that gives them veto power over Dr. Park's defense. Moreover, under a \"battle of the experts\" theory, the respondents indicate that the jury found Dr. Park's expert witnesses more credible because their experts reviewed the CT scan and MRI/MRA images blindly, whereas petitioners' experts were informed of where to locate abnormalities before making an assessment of whether Dr. Park was negligent in his reading of the results. A jury, the respondents maintain, would be more likely than not to find it more trustworthy when experts view the images in the same manner that Dr. Park would have, versus experts who view the images through bias. Finally, according to the respondents, the extraordinary failures of the three subsequent physicians (two neurologists and one radiologist), each of whom failed to avert Mr. Copsey's impending major stroke just hours before it occurred, despite knowing the acute risk, superseded any alleged error by Dr. Park which had occurred days earlier. They assert that the sequential subsequent negligence of these three doctors, Dr. Blum, Dr. Viswanathan, and Dr. Alkaitis, was astonishing and unforeseeable because Dr. Park could not have anticipated that three subsequent treating doctors, not relying on his report, would all act below the standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion\n    <em>\n     in Limine\n    </em>\n    : Prohibiting Dr. Park from Presenting Evidence Relating to Dr. Blum's and Dr. Alkaitis' Prior Statuses as Defendants or Pre-trial Settlements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   was the first Maryland decision to address a non-party's negligence in a medical malpractice action and held that evidence of a non-party's negligence should not be excluded in a medical injury case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675011\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/212/634/\">\n    212 Md.App. at 663, 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675011\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/212/634/\">\n    70 A.3d at 413, 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is true that in\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , the alleged negligence by the midwife, the non-party, preceded the hospital's alleged negligence. Ultimately, however, the issues\n   involved in\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   dealt with a defendant presenting evidence of a non-party's negligence and causation similar to the issues in the case at bar. Subsequent superseding events on June 9-10 followed Dr. Park's alleged negligence and were classic intervening events that Dr. Park could not have reasonably foreseen. Dr. Park was able to present evidence of the negligence of the other treating physicians at the same hospital. Similarly, in addition to claiming that the other treating physicians were superseding causes, Dr. Park also completely denied any liability. Not unlike\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , evidence of a third-party's negligence is admissible because without the evidence \"the jury [would have been] given a materially incomplete picture of the facts, which\n   [would have] denied [Dr. Park] a fair trial.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675011\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/212/634/\">\n    212 Md.App. at 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675011\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/212/634/\">\n    70 A.3d at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The petitioners also argue that allowing the defendants to point the finger at non-parties will distract the jury and a jury may speculate that the actual \"guilty\" parties who were once part of the case settled with the injured party and left the \"innocent\" party to stand alone. However, as the respondents note, this point of view ignores the fact that a jury may also speculate that an \"innocent\" party settled for a low figure, while a \"guilty\" party decided to remain and go to trial. We do not believe these concerns have merit because the issues of liability and damages are matters left to the considered determination of the trier of fact. The trier of fact takes into consideration all of the relevant and material evidence in the case and determines the weight to be given to that evidence. In addition, upon request, the trial judge may give cautionary instructions to the jury as needed to allay either parties' fears that the jurors would be prone to speculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.

But, a defendant would not ordinarily generate a jury issue on lack of substantial factor causation only by showing the dangerousness of a non-party's product to which the claimant was exposed. Ordinarily a defendant would have to follow up the evidence of exposure to the products of non-parties with evidence tending to prove that the defendant's product was not unreasonably dangerous or was not a substantial causal factor.

Hence a reasonable trier of fact could have found that under (b), the doctors on June 9-10 knew or should have known that Mr. Copsey was on the verge of a fatal stroke and that it could have been prevented. The failures of the three doctors, who did not rely on Dr. Park's interpretations of the images, were extraordinary and unforeseeable as all three acted below the standard of care despite being presented with grave conditions. Even assuming that Dr. Park was negligent in his interpretation of the June 4 images and it was foreseeable that if left untreated, Mr. Copsey would have suffered from a fatal stroke, the jury was entitled to determine whether it was foreseeable that other doctors would have negligently treated the patient, days later, without reliance on Dr. Park's original interpretation of the images. Under (c), these were independent acts because none of the doctors on June 9-10 were relying on Dr. Park's report, even assuming that Dr. Park was initially negligent, and thus was a substantial factor in bringing about harm to Mr. Copsey.\n   The undisputed facts indicate that Dr. Blum had ordered a new report on June 9 because Mr. Copsey's condition had deteriorated. Moreover, nothing indicated that Dr. Viswanathan and Dr. Alkaitis relied on Dr. Park's report. Under (d), Dr. Blum, Dr. Viswanathan, and Dr. Alkaitis' actions were not connected to Dr. Park because they acted independently, or failed on their own to act reasonably. Under (e), the respondents' and the petitioners' experts testified regarding the negligence and wrongful acts of Dr. Blum, Dr. Viswanathan, and Dr. Alkaitis. The expert witnesses indicated that had the doctors acted on June 9-10, Mr. Copsey's fatal stroke would have been prevented. Under (f), the subsequent treating doctors all engaged in negligent conduct on June 9-10 resulting in Mr. Copsey's death. The jury was entitled to hear all the evidence regarding negligence, including the negligence of other non-parties. It was appropriate for the jury to determine whether Dr. Park was negligent and whether his negligence caused injury to the patient, taking into account whether\n   the non-parties' actions were superseding causes of Mr. Copsey's fatal stroke. As noted by the Verdict Sheet, the jury was free to decide whether Dr. Park breached his duty of care, whether any such breach was the proximate cause of Mr. Copsey's death, and whether the other non-parties' acts or failures to act superseded the act of Dr. Park.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Negligence by a subsequent actor breaks the chain of causation when the action by the subsequent actor is extraordinary and not reasonably foreseeable.\n   <em>\n    Hartford Ins.

According to Dr. Thomas, the nurses failing to call him back when the patient's symptoms worsened \"was an intervening act of sufficient negligence which broke the chain of causation between his negligence and Corso's death.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1899584\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/265/84/\">\n    265 Md. at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20379\">\n    288 A.2d at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court, however, held that \"the jury could have reasonably concluded that under the circumstances of this case that if Dr. Thomas had performed his duty to attend Corso personally, shortly after he was telephoned at 11:30 p.m., Dr. Thomas might well have been able to have saved his life.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, \"[Dr. Thomas'] negligent conduct was one of the direct and proximate causes of Corso's death, concurrent with the negligence of the nurses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20379\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Notwithstanding Dr. Thomas' negligence, he was permitted to present\n   testimonial evidence of the nurses' subsequent negligence in an attempt to prove he was not liable.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1899584\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/265/84/\">\n    265 Md. at 100-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20379\">\n    288 A.2d at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Similar to the\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   case, Dr. Park was entitled to present evidence of the subsequent negligence of other individuals in his own defense. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   , where the negligence of Dr. Thomas occurred within the same hour of the patient's deteriorating condition and ensuing death, here there was, at least, a six-day gap between Dr. Park's alleged negligence and the alleged negligence of the three subsequent treating doctors. Between June 4 and June 9, Mr. Copsey presented new symptoms, new images were taken and interpreted by Dr. Blum and Dr. Viswanathan, Dr. Park's interpretation of the images were not relied on, and both Dr. Viswanthan and Dr. Alkaitis were actually aware of Mr. Copsey's impending stroke, but failed to notify him or render immediate medical attention. On June 9, Dr. Blum determined that Mr. Copsey needed urgent\n   testing because of his new symptoms and therefore placed a STAT order to the radiologist asking for an immediate response. Dr. Park's interpretation of images on June 4 was unrelated to Dr. Blum's decision to send Mr. Copsey home on June 9, without waiting for a report on the results and interpreting Mr. Copsey's symptoms and images on his own. The jury could reasonably have found that these events both were not foreseeable by Dr. Park and extraordinary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Moreover, expert witnesses called by Dr. Park to testify, namely, Dr. O'Sullivan and Dr. Hyman, both radiologists like Dr. Park, pointed out that they conducted objective blind reviews to prevent bias and did not notice any abnormalities that went unnoticed by Dr. Park on June 4. On the other hand, the petitioners' expert witnesses, Dr. Hecht, a neurologist like Dr. Blum, and his partner Dr. Jahre, a radiologist/neuroradiologist, testified that abnormalities should have been detected by Dr. Park. However, there was evidence at trial that both doctors may have been biased in their review of the images. The jury was permitted to give the testimony of a witness the weight the jury believed the testimony deserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    Plastic Assembled Prod., Inc. v. Benkoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1966518\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/224/256/#p259\">\n    224 Md. 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 259,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=167%20A.2d%20589\">\n    167 A.2d 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591 (1961). Moreover, Dr. O'Sullivan and Dr. Hyman testified that Dr. Park was not negligent and acted within the standard of care. Thus, all of the evidence was for the jury to weigh in determining whether Dr. Park was negligent, and if he was, whether the intervening actions of the subsequent treating physicians were independent and superseding causes of Mr. Copsey's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Ultimately, the jury was persuaded that Dr. Park was not negligent. Dr. Park was entitled to show both that he was not negligent and that he did not cause Mr. Copsey's injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. Dr. Park, who generally denied liability, was entitled to present evidence of the non-parties' negligence as it was relevant and necessary in providing him a fair trial. Further, causation was an issue for the trier of fact and the evidence Dr. Park presented tended to show that he was not negligent and that other independent causes contributed to the death of Mr. Copsey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

In order to excuse Dr. Park that intervening cause must be a superseding cause of Mr. Copsey's death.
