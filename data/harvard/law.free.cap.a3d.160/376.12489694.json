Robinson, appeals from the judgment of the trial court denying his postjudgment motion to modify his child support obligation to the plaintiff, Margaret Robinson. The defendant claims that the court erroneously denied his motion for modification because (1) its calculation of presumptive child support was erroneous; (2) it erroneously found shared physical custody; and (3) there was no justification for ordering an upward deviation from the presumptive amount of child support provided for in the guidelines. We do not agree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The record discloses the following relevant facts and procedural history. The parties were married in September, 1993. There are four minor children issue of the marriage. The parties were divorced on February 3, 2014. The divorce was uncontested and the court incorporated by reference the parties' separation agreement in its judgment of dissolution. That agreement provided that the parties were to share joint legal custody of their minor children, whose primary residence was to be with the plaintiff, while the defendant was to enjoy\n   \"liberal and unrestricted parental access.\" It also provided that the defendant was to pay the plaintiff $400 per\n   week in child support for the first year subsequent to the dissolution, $300 per week in the second year, and $200 per week in the third year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agreement provided as well that the defendant was to pay periodic alimony to the plaintiff in the amount of $1000 per week.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 18, 2015, the self-represented defendant\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   moved for a downward modification of child support and a modification in the formal custody status, such that the primary residence of the three minor children, who were then actually living with him, be changed to reflect that reality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following a hearing, the court denied the defendant's motion for modification of child support. The court did order that the primary residence of three of the four then minor children be changed so that it would be with the defendant, but found, nonetheless, that there was a shared physical custody arrangement. The court found that the presumptive amount of child support according to the guidelines was $221 per week, but that an upward deviation to $300 per week, the same amount called for in the agreement and the dissolution judgment, was justified in the circumstances. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court erred in its calculation of presumptive child support, because, in\n   its application of the child support guidelines, it neither reduced the defendant's income by the amount of alimony he paid nor increased the plaintiff's income by a corresponding amount. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant contends that \u00a7 46b-215a-1(11)(B) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies is specific as to the items excluded from the definition of \"gross income,\" and because that list does not include alimony as an exclusion, it must be included in the income attributed to the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further argues that the list in \u00a7 46b-215a (11) (A) of twenty-two items included as \"gross income\" is nonexhaustive; therefore, the fact that alimony is not included in that list is not dispositive. The amount of alimony, then, should have been added to the plaintiff's income and subtracted from the defendant's income for the purpose of computing the proportionate shares of child support to be paid by either party under the guidelines, according to the defendant's reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Our review of the court's interpretation of ... \u00a7 46b-215a-1(11)... of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies is plenary.\"\n   <em>\n    Lusa\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grunberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4036893\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/101/739/#p761\">\n    101 Conn.App. 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 761,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=923%20A.2d%20795\">\n    923 A.2d 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). Section 46b-215a-1(11) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies defines gross income as \"the average weekly earned and unearned income from all sources before deductions ....\" That section includes a nonexhaustive list of twenty-two inclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In that list of inclusions is: \"alimony being paid by an individual\n   <em>\n    who is not a party to the support determination\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-1(11)(A)(xix). The specific wording of this inclusion makes clear that only alimony received from a nonparty to the\n   support determination is included in gross income.

Because the defendant is a party to the action, his alimony payments to the plaintiff are not included as income to her. Further, alimony paid is not listed as an exclusion serving to reduce the defendant's income for the purpose of determining child support payments. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-1(11)(B). We conclude that the court properly applied the guidelines to find that the presumptive amount of child support to be paid by the defendant was $221 per week.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant next claims that the court erred in finding a shared physical custody arrangement. We note at the outset that this appeal presents a degree of analytical murkiness. The defendant's motion for modification was, by its terms, grounded on the proposition that there had been a substantial change of circumstances because of the change of residence of three of the\n   children. The court, which did not write a formal memorandum of decision but, rather, announced its decision on the record and issued brief written orders, appears to have reasoned that there had been a change of circumstances, but that the change did not equitably compel a departure from the prior agreement in the amount of child support to be paid. The court further based its ultimate decision on a finding that the child support guidelines provided for a presumptive payment of $221 per week, and an upward deviation to $300 per week was justified, at least in part, by a finding of shared physical custody and the inability of the plaintiff to provide appropriately unless she received the greater amount. In this context, the self-represented defendant quite understandably chose to address the court's reasoning in his statement of issues on appeal and for most of his argument. The equitable considerations underlying decisions whether to deviate from the guidelines are consistent with the more general considerations underlying motions to modify, and indeed overlap in the unusual circumstances of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We address, then, the defendant's claim that the court erred in denying his motion for modification, and justifying an upward deviation from the guidelines, by finding shared physical custody,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   despite having\n   found that three children primarily resided with the defendant. The standards to be applied in reviewing such orders are well established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"An appellate court will not disturb a trial court's orders in domestic relations cases unless the court has abused its discretion or it is found that it could not\n   reasonably conclude as it did, based on the facts presented....

The court found that the children had in fact moved, so that circumstances had changed, to that extent. But the court found that the change did not compel a lowering of the amount of child support to be paid by the defendant, at least partly because there effectively was shared physical custody.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court's finding of shared physical custody was not clearly erroneous. The court noted that there was no set parenting schedule, and that the children \"pretty much come and go as they please.\" The court alluded to the guidelines: \"[S]hared physical custody means a situation in which the physical residence of the child-children is shared by the parents in a manner that ensures that the children have substantially equal time and contact with both parents and exactly equal sharing of physical care and control of the children is not required for a finding of shared physical custody.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff's testimony supported this finding: she explained that the children \"sleep at [the defendant's] house, but they're at my house constantly ....\" She explained that \"there's no schedule,\" \"we never know when you're gonna have kids or not.... [T]he kids are at any age where if ... they're happy here, things are going well, fine, but the minute someone tells you\n   to do the dishes, you run to the other person's house.\" The court explained: \"we're not dealing with children. We're dealing with young adults, and it sounds like they move fairly freely between your households ....\" The court concluded that \"what's really needed here is for both households to be able to receive the children until they graduate from high school.\" The court did not abuse its discretion in finding shared physical custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The final question is whether, having found the presumptive amount of child\n   support and shared physical custody, the court abused its discretion in deviating upward from the presumptive amount. Stated from the perspective of the motion for modification, the issue is whether, in light of the change of circumstance, i.e., the change in primary residence, the court abused its discretion in not decreasing the amount of child support. We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As discussed previously, a party seeking a modification must show that the continuation of the prior order would be unfair or inequitable.\n   <em>\n    Budrawich\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Budrawich\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Conn.%20App.%20628\">\n    156 Conn.App. at 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20A.3d%2039\">\n    115 A.3d 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Rosier\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rosier\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041344\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/103/338/#p344\">\n    103 Conn.App. at 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=928%20A.2d%201228\">\n    928 A.2d 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, a court may deviate from the presumptive amount of child care if the procedures outlined in \u00a7 46b-215a-5c of the regulations are followed. Notably, an agreement may provide a sufficient basis for a deviation when the agreement cites deviation criteria; the presumptive amount also \"may be rebutted by a specific finding on the record that such amount would be inequitable or inappropriate in a particular case.\" Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-5c(a). The regulations also provide for \"special circumstances,\" which include the best interests of the child and \"other equitable factors.\" Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 46b-215a-5c(b)(6)(D) and (E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court found that it would be inequitable to modify the existing child support orders; it stated: \"If I undo what was done previously, even though the circumstances may have changed in terms of primary residence, it would be unfair and inequitable to, in essence, elevate one household and diminish the other household. So, the orders will remain-the order that I've been asked to modify will remain exactly where it is right now ....\" The court essentially found that, under the circumstances in which the parties shared custody of the children, and both households needed to be maintained in a manner capable of receiving the children, it would be unfair and inequitable to modify the amount of child support specified in the separation agreement, despite the fact that the amount was higher than the presumptive amount contemplated by the child support guidelines. The court expressed the concern that if it \"were to lower the child support ... there would [not] be sufficient remaining funds for the receiving parent to meet the basic needs of the children after that deviation.\" See\n   <em>\n    Amodio\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Amodio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"444013\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/56/459/#p467\">\n    56 Conn.App. 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 467,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=743%20A.2d%201135\">\n    743 A.2d 1135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (purpose of guidelines is to ensure that parent responsible for child support does not pay less than amount dictated by guidelines), cert. granted on other grounds,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"545217,545123,545172\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/253/910/\">\n    253 Conn. 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=754%20A.2d%20160\">\n    754 A.2d 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) (appeal withdrawn September 27, 2000).
