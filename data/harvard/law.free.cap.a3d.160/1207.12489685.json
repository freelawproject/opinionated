Petitioner Terrence Rogers alleges that he was poisoned by lead-based paint as a toddler when he lived in a row house owned by the Respondent Home Equity USA, Inc. (\"Home Equity\"). The property tested positive for lead-based paint throughout its interior in 1976-20 years before Rogers lived there. To survive summary judgment, a plaintiff must establish the subject property as a \"reasonably probable source\" of his lead poisoning. We are faced with the question of whether-without ruling out other possible sources of exposure-the 1976 testing, combined with other circumstantial evidence, clears that bar for Rogers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Terrence Rogers was born on February 28, 1994. For the first few months of his life, Rogers lived at 2328 Nevada Street in Baltimore City. In April 1994, Rogers and his mother, Toni Rogers-Coy, moved to 6149 Chinquapin Parkway (\"Chinquapin\"), where they lived for over two years. In October 1996, they moved to 3738 Towanda Avenue (\"Towanda\"), a\n   row house in northwest Baltimore and the subject property in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After about six months, Rogers and his mother moved to 2534 Loyola Northway (\"Loyola\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the first four years of his life, Rogers' blood lead level was tested six times, with the following results:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-12\"><strong>Date</strong> <strong>Age</strong> <strong>Blood Lead Level</strong><sup>3</sup> <strong>Property</strong> June 29, 1995 1 year, 4 months 7 \u03bcg/dL Chinquapin March 25, 1996 2 years, 1 month 14 \u03bcg/dL Chinquapin January 8, 1997 2 years, 10 months 21 \u03bcg/dL Towanda March 26, 1997 3 years, 1 month 20-21 \u03bcg/dL Towanda April 30, 1997 3 years, 2 months 17-18 \u03bcg/dL Loyola August 22, 1997 3 years, 6 months 13 \u03bcg/dL Loyola</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Editor's Note\n   </strong>\n   : The preceding image contains the reference for footnote\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before the trial court, Rogers presented evidence regarding the history of Towanda, which was owned by Home Equity while he lived there. Towanda was built in 1920, when 95 percent of homes contained lead-based paint. In 1976, the Baltimore City Health Department (\"the Health Department\") conducted an investigation of\n   Towanda after a child who had lived there since birth exhibited elevated blood lead levels. Lead testing detected lead-based paint on 19 surfaces throughout the interior of the home and flaking paint on an additional seven surfaces. In October 1976, the Health Department issued an abatement card indicating that the flaking\n   paint had been corrected. Thirteen years later, in 1989, Towanda was again referred to the Health Department because a child who lived there demonstrated elevated blood lead levels. The Health Department did not re-inspect the home, however, because the family moved shortly after the referral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Between 1976 and 1996, the Baltimore Department of Housing and Community Development (\"DHCD\") issued various building permits for construction projects at Towanda, but none described lead abatement. In 1979, the DHCD issued a permit to install a new gas boiler. In 1983, Towanda was permitted for roofing and carpentry work, plumbing repairs, and painting. Lastly, in 1994, the DHCD authorized $19,000 worth of construction to re-stucco a side wall and repair the first- and second-floor rear decks. In 2006, nine years after Rogers moved out of Towanda, the DHCD issued a permit to replace Towanda's windows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When Rogers' January 8, 1997 blood test indicated a lead level of 21 \u03bcg/dL, the Maryland State Laboratory referred his case to the Health Department's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program. A Health Department caseworker visited Towanda on March 17, 1997 and noted that the home was in a \"very dilapidated condition.\" She also observed Rogers mouthing the windowsills and reported that the property contained flaking paint \"all over.\" After her home visit, the caseworker described the home as \"condemned\" and directed Rogers-Coy to move within a week. The caseworker also noted that Towanda was a suspected source of Rogers' lead exposure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the same January 8, 1997 blood lead test, Rogers' health care provider, South Baltimore Family Health Center, referred him to the Kennedy Krieger Institute Lead Poisoning Prevention Clinic (\"Kennedy Krieger\"). In an intake interview with Kennedy Krieger on March 26, 1997, Rogers-Coy reported flaking paint on the ceiling, walls, and window frames at Towanda. She indicated that the home did not appear to be renovated and that the windows looked as if they were original to the property. She also stated that Rogers spent all of his time at Towanda, playing either inside or outside of the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During her deposition, Rogers-Coy testified that the windows and porch at Towanda had layers of chipping and flaking paint. She also testified that she often sat on the porch with Rogers when they lived there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 29, 2013, Rogers filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against Home Equity for negligence and unfair trade practices in violation of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rogers alleged that he was exposed to lead while he lived at Towanda and suffered permanent brain damage as a result. He claimed that he has undergone extensive medical treatment and will suffer \"substantial\" loss of wages as a result of his injuries. Rogers requested damages \"in excess of $75,000,\" plus costs, for each claim. Home Equity filed its answer on February\n   12, 2014, and the parties entered discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In October 2014, Arc Environmental, Inc. (\"Arc\") conducted lead testing on the exterior of Towanda. The testing found lead-based paint on the front porch, front door frame, and one exterior window. The same month, Robert K. Simon, Ph.D., a lead risk assessor and environmental toxicologist, provided a report concluding that Towanda was a \"substantial contributing source of [Rogers'] lead exposure and lead poisoning during his early childhood.\" To reach this conclusion, Dr. Simon relied upon a variety of documents, including deposition testimony from Rogers-Coy, Rogers' blood lead tests, the Arc testing, and residential information collected by the Health Department, Kennedy Krieger, and the DHCD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Jeanette R. McDaniel, M.D., a pediatrician, also filed a report concluding that Towanda was a substantial contributing factor to Rogers' elevated blood lead levels. She opined that Rogers' blood lead levels \"rose substantially\" while living at Towanda and then, as reflected in the test results, \"dropped\n   upon leaving the property.\" During her deposition, Dr. McDaniel testified that it takes 30 to 45 days for blood to reflect either an increase or decrease in lead exposure. Thus, she explained, Rogers' March 26, 1997 blood lead test reflected his exposure at Towanda even if he had moved out of the property a few days beforehand. Dr. McDaniel also testified that Rogers' April 30, 1997 blood test, which showed that his lead level dropped to 17-18 \u03bcg/dL one month after he moved out of Towanda, indicated to her that Towanda was a source of Rogers' lead exposure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 8, 2014, Home Equity moved for summary judgment. In its motion, Home Equity argued that Rogers had not provided enough evidence to establish that Towanda was a source of his lead exposure or that any such exposure caused his elevated blood lead levels.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Home Equity claimed that to survive summary judgment on these two issues-source and source causation-Rogers had to rule out all other possible sources of lead exposure. At the hearing on the motion, Home Equity also contended that Rogers did not have enough evidence to show that lead exposure at Towanda caused him medical injury. In other words, it argued that Rogers could not demonstrate medical causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The trial court rejected Home Equity's argument as to medical causation, but granted summary judgment on source and source causation. Although the 1976 lead testing was helpful, the court explained, Rogers did not have enough evidence \"from which a jury could conclude that the same lead paint, which was present in the house in 1976 or the mid[-]1970s, remained in the house in 1996 and 1997 when [ ] Rogers was allegedly exposed.\" The trial court clarified that Rogers was not required to rule out other possible sources of lead exposure, but held that he had failed to otherwise provide enough circumstantial evidence for a jury to conclude that Towanda contributed to his elevated blood lead levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the trial court granted summary judgment, Rogers filed a motion for reconsideration. He argued that a lead paint inspection conducted in 2007 revealed that Towanda still contained lead-based paint. Rogers attached a Lead Paint Risk Reduction Inspection Certificate from the Maryland Department of the Environment\n   (\"MDE\"), which listed five categories for inspected homes, including \"Lead Free\" and \"Full Risk Reduction.\" The inspector checked \"Full Risk Reduction\" for Towanda, which, Rogers argued, indicated that the home was not lead free. The trial court denied Rogers' motion for reconsideration, and he filed a timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals declined to decide whether Rogers had presented enough evidence that Towanda was a source of lead exposure and instead affirmed summary judgment on the issue of source causation alone.\n   <em>\n    Rogers v.

Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 702-03, 706 (\"Housing Code\"). Section 702 requires all occupied dwellings to \"be kept in good repair, in safe condition, and fit for human habitation.\" Section 703(2)(c) provides that a dwelling is in \"good repair\" if, in relevant part, \"[a]ll walls, ceilings, woodwork, doors and windows [are] kept clean and free of any flaking, loose or peeling paint.\" Section 706 provides that any \"interior loose\n   or peeling ... paint shall be removed\" and prohibits the use of lead-based paint in the interior of any dwelling. Under Maryland's common-law Statute or Ordinance Rule, Rogers can make out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of negligence based upon a violation of the Housing Code by demonstrating (1) the violation of a section of the Housing Code \"designed to protect a specific class of persons which includes the plaintiff,\" and (2) \"that the violation proximately caused the injury complained of.\"\n   <em>\n    Brooks v.

To satisfy the first prong, Rogers must demonstrate that it is reasonably probable that the subject property contained lead-based paint in violation of the Housing Code. To satisfy the\n   second prong, he must establish that it is reasonably probable that the lead in the subject property caused his elevated blood lead levels, and that his elevated blood lead levels caused him injury.

Rogers argues that this evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to him, establishes Towanda as a reasonably probable source of his lead exposure.\n   Home Equity asserts four arguments to support its position that summary judgment was properly granted as to source. First, Home Equity argues that because Rogers has not presented direct evidence of lead-based paint in the property at the time he resided there, Rogers is required to rule out other possible sources of lead exposure to make out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of negligence. This argument misstates the law. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , to survive summary judgment, Rogers must demonstrate that Towanda was a reasonably probable source of lead exposure. To satisfy this requirement, he can use direct evidence, circumstantial evidence, or both.\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n    439 Md. at 537-38, 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n    96 A.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . His burden of proof remains the same regardless of the type of evidence he uses to meet it. Accordingly, Rogers' use of circumstantial evidence does not require him to eliminate all other possible sources to survive summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, Home Equity argues that Dr. Simon impermissibly concluded that Towanda was a source of lead exposure due to the age of the home. Home Equity points to\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   for its assertion that the age of a home cannot give rise to a reasonable inference of lead-based paint. In\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   , we affirmed summary judgment in two consolidated cases. In one case,\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v. Kirson\n   </em>\n   , two expert witnesses testified that the subject property was a source of the plaintiffs' lead exposure based on the age of home, positive exterior lead testing, the mother's testimony that the children mouthed paint chips, and the children's elevated blood lead levels while they lived in the home.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n    at 518, 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n    96 A.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We held that this circumstantial evidence was not enough to establish the subject property as a reasonably probable source of the plaintiffs' lead exposure without ruling out other possible sources.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n    at 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n    96 A.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We explained that a presumption that houses of a certain age contain lead-based paint is \"insufficient for an expert to reach the conclusion that the interior of a specific property contained lead-based paint during the relevant time period.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In this case, however, Dr. Simon reached his conclusion that Towanda was a source of Rogers' lead exposure based on a\n   robust record, including the 1976 testing, the 1989 referral to the Health Department, and notes from the Health Department's 1997 home visit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although his report indicated that houses built before 1950 \"would most likely contain lead-based paint [ ], unless proven negative by testing,\" Dr. Simon did not rely on this inference to reach his conclusion. Dr. Simon had direct evidence that Towanda contained lead-based paint in 1976-he did not have to infer the presence of lead from the age of the property. Dr. Simon formulated his opinion based largely on the 1976 testing and the 1997 Health Department records describing Towanda's poor condition. He testified that the 1976 testing showed that lead-based paint was on \"basically everything inside the house,\" and that the Health Department's description of Towanda\n   as \"dilapidated\" in 1997 suggested that it was \"extremely unlikely\" that the lead-based paint had been fully abated. Rogers has presented sufficient evidence for both Dr. Simon and a jury to reasonably infer that Towanda still contained lead-based paint in the mid-1990s, without improperly relying on the age of the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Third, Home Equity contends that the 2014 exterior testing cannot give rise to a reasonable inference that Towanda's interior contained lead-based paint in 1996 and 1997. This may be so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n    at 543-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n    96 A.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]o even enter the realm of 'substantial contributing source,'\n   <strong>\n    a house has to be shown to have had lead-based paint-almost invariably in the interior of the building.\n   </strong>\n   \" (emphasis in original));\n   <em>\n    Dackman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676562\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/213/589/\">\n    213 Md.App. at 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676562\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/213/589/\">\n    75 A.3d 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Rogers is not relying on the exterior testing as the mainstay of his claim. Rather, he has produced extensive circumstantial evidence, including the 1976 interior test, which allows a reasonable inference that the interior of Towanda exposed Rogers to lead paint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Lastly, Home Equity argues that Rogers has not presented enough evidence overall to establish Towanda as a reasonably probable source of lead exposure, and thus summary judgment was properly granted on those grounds. Specifically, Home Equity argues that due to the construction projects that took place at Towanda after 1976, including painting, is it not reasonable to infer that the same lead paint that covered the walls in the 1970s poisoned Rogers in the 1990s. It contends that Rogers' circumstantial evidence \"is insufficient to 'rule in' the Towanda Property.\" We disagree. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Rogers' case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   , in which we held that the plaintiffs had not presented sufficient evidence to establish the subject property as a reasonably probable source of their lead exposure.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n    439 Md. at 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n    96 A.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The 1976 interior lead testing, paired with the lack of evidence showing full lead abatement, gives rise to a reasonable inference\n   that Towanda's interior still contained lead-based paint when Rogers lived there. Additionally, the 2014 exterior testing revealed lead-based paint on four surfaces, including the porch where Rogers often played, as opposed to only one, out-of-reach surface in\n   <em>\n    Dackman\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Dackman\n   </em>\n   divided his time between the subject property and his mother's house. In that case, it was possible that another property, where the plaintiff was spending time concurrently, was causing his elevated blood lead levels. Here, Rogers spent all of his time at Towanda during the six months he lived there. There are no possible concurrent sources of exposure. Home Equity argues that Rogers' elevated blood lead levels in January and March of 1997 were due to the lingering effects of his exposure at Chinquapin. But Dr. McDaniel testified that a child's blood lead level will decrease about 30 to 45 days after an exposure has ended. Based on her testimony, it is reasonable to infer that if Towanda was not a source of lead exposure, Rogers' blood lead level would have decreased between January and March 1997. Instead, it remained elevated until he moved out of Towanda. Thus, a jury could reasonably conclude that Towanda was exposing Rogers to lead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Rogers' case is also distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Once a plaintiff has established a property as a reasonably probable source of his lead exposure, a defendant cannot avoid liability by pointing to other properties that also exposed the plaintiff to lead. A plaintiff can demonstrate more than one reasonably probable source of injury-causing lead exposure and still survive summary judgment.\n   Rogers presents the following evidence to show that Towanda was a reasonably probable source of his elevated blood lead levels: (1) his blood tests demonstrating an elevated lead level of 21 \u03bcg/dL in January 1997 and 20-21 \u03bcg/dL in March 1997; (2) his April 30, 1997 test, which read 17-18 \u03bcg/dL, and his August 22, 1997 test, which shows a further decline to 13 \u03bcg/dL; (3) Dr. McDaniel's testimony that it takes 30 to 45 days after the exposure has ended for the level of lead in a child's blood to decrease; (4) a 1997 Health Department caseworker's report that she observed Rogers mouthing a windowsill during a home visit; (5) the 2014 Arc exterior testing that found lead-based paint on the porch, where Rogers-Coy testified that she sat with Rogers;\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (6) Dr. Simon's conclusion that \"to a reasonable degree of scientific probability ... Towanda ... was a substantial contributing source of [ ] Rogers' lead exposure and lead poisoning during his early childhood\"; and (7) Dr. McDaniel's report, which stated \"with a high degree [of] medical probability\" that Towanda \"was a substantial contributing factor to his elevated lead levels.\" Rogers contends that this evidence is sufficient to establish Towanda as a reasonably probable cause of his elevated blood lead levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Focusing on the timing of Rogers' blood tests, Home Equity argues that because of the gap in blood lead testing between March 25, 1996 and January 8, 1997, it is impossible to know whether Rogers' blood lead levels increased when he moved to Towanda. The gap in blood lead testing is illustrated with dashed lines in the chart below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Home Equity contends that because Rogers initially exhibited elevated blood lead levels at Chinquapin, his January 1997 and March 1997 blood lead tests just reflect the continuing effects of the Chinquapin exposure. To demonstrate a reasonable probability that Towanda contributed to his elevated lead levels, Home Equity argues that Rogers must \"show a reasonable probability that the 21 \u03bcg/dL measurement represents an increase over his blood lead level before he moved to [Towanda.]\" Again, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   To reach a jury, Rogers must only show that it is reasonably probable that Towanda contributed to his elevated lead levels-he does not have to demonstrate that his lead level increased when he moved in. As the Court of Special Appeals explained in\n   <em>\n    Dackman\n   </em>\n   , \"[T]he fact that a lead-exposed child might have lived or spent time in more than one lead-based-painted property should not foreclose that child as a matter of law from pursuing any one of those potential sources-as long as he is able to\n   <em>\n    rule in\n   </em>\n   the subject property ....\"\n   <em>\n    Dackman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676562\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/213/589/\">\n    213 Md.App. at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676562\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/213/589/\">\n    75 A.3d 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). Although Rogers cannot prove that his blood lead levels increased when he moved to Towanda, they remained elevated without decrease while he lived there. Dr. McDaniel testified that once Rogers was no longer exposed to lead, his blood lead levels would decrease after about 30 to 45 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   From this, a jury could reasonably infer that if Towanda was not a contributing source, his March 1997 lead level would have been lower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   To explain Rogers' declining lead levels after he moved out of Towanda, Home Equity argues that they were part of a larger declining trend that began once Rogers left Chinquapin. In essence, Home Equity contends that because Chinquapin was almost certainly a source of exposure, Rogers' blood lead level continued to rise after the March 1996 test. Then, when Rogers moved to Towanda, his blood lead level began to decrease because he was no longer being exposed to lead. But, in a summary judgment context, this argument is thwarted by Dr. McDaniel's testimony that blood lead will dissipate after about 30 days, the amount of time between the March 1997 and April 1997 blood tests. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Rogers, a jury could reasonably infer that his blood lead level declined in April 1997 because he had left the\n   source of his exposure, which was Towanda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We hold that Rogers has presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Towanda was a reasonably probable cause of his elevated blood lead levels, and that summary judgment was improperly granted on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Rogers has presented sufficient circumstantial evidence to establish Towanda as a reasonably probable source of his injury-causing lead exposure. Therefore, summary judgment was improperly granted on the issues of source and source causation. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

Simply ruling out\n   properties and having the subject property remain with no evidence indicating it as a reasonable probable source of lead exposure would not fulfill the requisite causation link under a\n   <em>\n    Dow\n   </em>\n   theory of causation. Under a\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   theory of causation, however, a plaintiff in a lead-based paint case must present circumstantial evidence to such a degree that from that circumstantial evidence alone a jury could reasonably infer that the subject property contained lead-based paint and was a reasonable probable source of lead exposure, without the necessity of the plaintiff ruling out all other reasonable probable sources of lead exposure. For example, in the\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   hypothetical, we indicated that evidence that the four properties were built at the same time and that adjacent properties previously tested positive for the presence of lead-based paint in their interiors, coupled with other circumstantial evidence, would have been sufficient to establish that the subject property contained lead-based paint and was a reasonable probable source of lead exposure. Given this framework, I think it is worthwhile to point out that, although the majority opinion does not explicitly make the point, it is evident that the majority opinion applies a\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   theory of causation in this case. Indeed, the majority opinion does not expressly state under which theory of causation it is proceeding. Without identifying any particular theory of causation as the basis for the holding, the majority opinion states: \"Construing all reasonable inferences in favor of Rogers, we hold that he has presented sufficient evidence to establish Towanda as a reasonably probable source of lead exposure. Thus, summary judgment was improperly granted on this issue.\" Maj. Op. at 272-73, 160 A.3d at 1219-20. In actuality, the Majority utilizes the rationale of a\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   theory of causation for establishing the subject property in this case as a reasonable probable source of lead exposure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 267-73, 160 A.3d at 1216-20. To be sure, the Majority is correct that this case is factually distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   , \"in which we held that the plaintiffs had not presented sufficient evidence to establish the subject property as a reasonably probable source of their lead exposure.\" Maj.

Even though the circumstances of the cases may be different, the theory of causation derived from\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   is applicable here and, when applied by the Majority, results in a different outcome from the two cases involved in\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the facts in this case are sufficient to establish that the subject property contained lead-based paint and was a reasonable probable source of lead exposure under a\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   theory of causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Indeed, the circumstances of this case are strikingly similar to the hypothetical that we posed in\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n    439 Md. at 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n    96 A.3d at 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which there are four row houses, in which the subject property, row house \"B,\" which had been built in the\n   1920s, was immediately between two houses that had been built at the same time in the 1920s and that had both tested positive for the presence of lead-based paint in the interior of the houses and where it was unknown if the fourth row house contained lead-based paint. Central to the\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   analysis was the circumstance that the property at issue was located between two houses that had been built at the same time and both of the adjacent properties had tested positive for the presence of lead-based paint. In this case, the subject property itself previously had tested positive in 1976 for the presence of lead-based paint in the interior of the house, twenty years before Rogers resided in the subject property, and there had not been a full abatement. These circumstances, coupled with the other evidence identified by the Majority,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 267, 160 A.3d at 1216-17, is sufficient circumstantial evidence under a\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   theory of causation to establish that the subject property contained lead-based paint and was a reasonable probable source of lead exposure, and there was no need for Rogers to rule out other reasonable probable sources of lead exposure. This is essentially the conclusion reached by the Majority and, to my knowledge, this is the first time that a strict\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   theory of causation has been applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Because it is evident that the majority opinion applies a\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   theory of causation in reaching the determination that\n   the subject property is a reasonable probable source of lead exposure, in my view, it is valuable to explicitly recognize that nothing in the majority opinion purports to alter the\n   <em>\n    Dow\n   </em>\n   theory of causation and the requirement that, when a plaintiff in a lead-based paint case is proceeding under a\n   <em>\n    Dow\n   </em>\n   theory of causation, the plaintiff must rule out other reasonable probable sources of lead exposure. Stated otherwise, the majority opinion does not eliminate from the\n   <em>\n    Dow\n   </em>\n   theory of causation the necessity of ruling out other reasonable probable sources of lead exposure. And importantly, the majority opinion does not eliminate the\n   <em>\n    Dow\n   </em>\n   theory of causation as a required method for a plaintiff in a lead-based paint case to establish a subject property as a reasonable probable source of lead exposure where a plaintiff does not have the level and quality of circumstantial evidence that would satisfy a\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   theory of causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In sum, because there has been a great deal of development in recent years concerning lead-based paint cases and cases must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, to avoid any possible confusion by attorneys or potential misapplications of the majority opinion, I think it sensible to expressly state that the majority opinion applies a\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   theory of causation in this case because Rogers presented sufficient circumstantial evidence to such a degree that a jury could reasonably infer that the subject property contained lead-based paint and was a reasonable probable source of his lead exposure. As such, Rogers was not required to rule out other reasonable probable sources of lead exposure under the circumstances, and nothing in the majority opinion alters the requirement that, when proceeding under a\n   <em>\n    Dow\n   </em>\n   theory of causation, a plaintiff in a lead-based paint case is still required to rule out other reasonable probable sources of lead exposure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For the above reasons, respectfully, I concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Getty, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   I respectfully dissent from the Majority's conclusion that Terrence Rogers met his burden in this case to demonstrate\n   that his brief period of residency at the rental property owned by Home Equity USA, Inc. (\"Home Equity\") at 3738 Towanda\n   Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland (\"the Towanda Property\") caused him harm. Based on the record before us, I would affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Home Equity on the same grounds as the Court of Special Appeals, namely, that Mr. Rogers failed to show that the Towanda Property was a substantial factor in causing his elevated blood lead levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   I write out of concern that today's Majority and Concurring opinions substantially lower the bar that a plaintiff must surpass in order to avoid summary judgment in a lead paint negligence action. Under well-established principles of Maryland tort law, the proper burden of proof as to causation, even at the summary judgment stage, is whether the plaintiff has shown that the defendant's property was a probable, meaning more likely than not, source of his lead poisoning. Therefore, when there are two or more reasonably likely causes of the plaintiff's lead poisoning, as occurred in this case, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's property is a more probable source of the harm than the other(s) in order to survive summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peterson v.

Initially, I believe that the hypothetical described in\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   does not support the Majority's holding. The hypothetical describes a scenario in which a unit of four, side-by-side row houses \"were built at the same time in the 1920[ ]s,\" those houses were \"owned as a group by a series of persons or entities through the 1950[ ]s,\" and the home that is the subject property in the litigation was situated between two others in the group that had tested positive for lead-based paint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n    439 Md. at 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n    96 A.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   Court, \"in the absence of evidence of lead abatement measures,\" that hypothetical shows sufficient \"circumstantial evidence from which a jury could infer reasonably that the subject property contained lead-based paint.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That statement may be true, but even if it is, it is limited to the specific set of facts set forth in the hypothetical-a unit of homes built together in the 1920s, sustained common ownership of those homes for decades, and the absence of any evidence of lead abatement measures. Those facts are entirely divergent from the relevant facts of this case, which involve potential lead\n   exposure in two widely separated homes, not in common ownership, and where there was evidence that lead abatement measures had occurred in the source property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Moreover, as the\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   Court itself recognized, the hypothetical does not describe what kind of circumstantial evidence would be sufficient for a separate prong of the substantial factor analysis for source causation in a lead paint case, namely, whether a plaintiff's period of residency at a given property that may have contained lead-based paint caused his elevated blood lead levels. That prong of the analysis is particularly significant when, as here, the plaintiff has also resided in at least one other home containing lead-based paint. The hypothetical thus has nothing to offer as to what I view as the critical issue in this case-whether Mr. Rogers has shown sufficient evidence that it was his stay at the Towanda Property that caused his elevated lead blood levels, as opposed to his immediately prior stay at another property that the plaintiff's expert conceded contained lead-based paint, 6419 Chinquapin Parkway (the \"Chinquapin Property\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As to that issue, I disagree with the Majority's holding that, at the summary judgment stage, Mr. Rogers could \"rule in\" the Towanda Property as a substantial factor cause of his elevated blood lead levels merely by advancing circumstantial evidence that the Towanda Property was a \"reasonably probable source\" of those elevated blood lead levels, and without showing that it was a more probable source than the Chinquapin Property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op. at 273-75, 160 A.3d at 1220-21. The Majority, relying upon our recent holding in\n   <em>\n    Rowhouses, Inc. v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4165763\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/446/611/\">\n    446 Md. 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 655,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4165763,4165710\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/133/1054/\">\n    133 A.3d 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), defines a \"reasonably probable source\" as floating somewhere between a \"possibility\" that the defendant's property was the source of the plaintiff's lead exposure and elevated blood lead levels and a showing that the property was the \"more probable than not\" source of that harm. Majority Op. at 274, 160 A.3d at 1220-21. I believe that the Majority's holding reflects a troubling trend in this Court's recent lead paint cases, in which the Court has moved away from the longstanding standard in Maryland tort law that a plaintiff must put forth sufficient evidence to enable\n   a jury to find that it was more probable than not that the defendant caused his harm. As this Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Peterson v. Underwood\n   </em>\n   , the more probable than not standard is necessary at the summary judgment stage in order to prevent the jury from assigning fault based on \"mere conjecture or speculation\" that the defendant caused the harm at issue.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1930242\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/258/9/#p17\">\n    258 Md. at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=264%20A.2d%20851\">\n    264 A.2d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court has not provided a clear basis in law or public policy for its recent shift away from the more probable than not standard for causation in lead paint cases at the summary judgment stage, and the nebulously defined \"reasonably probable source\" standard that has taken its place is likely to prove difficult for trial courts to apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Rowhouses\n   </em>\n   , on which the Majority relies, was premised on a\n   <em>\n    Dow\n   </em>\n   theory of causation, in which a plaintiff still has to rule out other sources of the plaintiff's\n   lead exposure in order to show that a defendant's property was the source of his lead poisoning. The Majority's holding that it is enough for a plaintiff to \"rule in\" a property as a \"reasonably probable source\" of the plaintiff's lead exposure and elevated blood lead levels even when, as is true in this case, there are other reasonably probable sources of that harm, thus operates to substantially lower the bar for causation in a lead paint action below even the lessened standard set in\n   <em>\n    Rowhouses\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Rather than endorse a new causal theory that significantly furthers the recent trend towards a lower burden of proof for causation in lead paint cases, I would instead rely on the well-established principle of tort law that, when a plaintiff's own evidence shows that there are two or more potential causes of an injury, each of which is more than a mere possibility, the plaintiff must show that the source for which the defendant is responsible is a more probable source of the harm than the other(s) in order to survive summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1930242\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/258/9/#p17\">\n    258 Md. at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=264%20A.2d%20851\">\n    264 A.2d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying that standard to the\n   facts of this case, I agree with the Majority and Concurrence that the evidence put forth by Mr. Rogers was sufficient for a reasonable jury to infer that it was more probable than not that there was lead-based paint in the interior of the Towanda Property during the time that Mr. Rogers resided at that property. However, I would follow the Court of Special Appeals in holding that the evidence put forth by Mr. Rogers was insufficient to show that his time residing at the Towanda Property was a more probable source of his harm from lead exposure than his time residing at another property that also contained lead-based paint and, therefore, summary judgment was appropriately granted in favor of Home Equity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

And, especially critical to the hypothetical, the houses were held in common ownership as a group for decades, supporting logical inferences that they were painted in the same manner and that maintenance practices in one or two of the homes were replicated in all of them. Two of the houses in common ownership, which bordered the subject property on both sides, had tested positive for lead-based paint\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the period of residency of the plaintiff in the subject property. Finally, there was an absence of any evidence of lead abatement measures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   None of those facts are mirrored in this case. Here, during the period of time at issue, Mr. Rogers lived in two geographically distant properties. These properties were not in common ownership, so there is no assumption that a landlord or management company used similar practices for painting or maintaining the properties. Although there was additional circumstantial evidence that lead-based paint was present in the interior of the Towanda Property, in the form of a 1976 test positive for interior lead-based paint and other reports\n   and witness testimony, that evidence was entirely dissimilar to that advanced in the hypothetical in\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   . And, while there is no evidence in the record of a full, gut rehabilitation of the Towanda Property, there was evidence of some lead abatement measures in the interior of the Towanda Property prior to Mr. Rogers' period of residency at that property, including abatement records from 1976, and building permits for additional renovations between 1976 and 1996.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Thus, contrary to the reasoning advanced in the Concurrence,\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   and the hypothetical stated therein do not support the Majority's holding that there was still lead-based paint in the Towanda Property at the time Mr. Rogers resided there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Concurring Op. at 281-83, 160 A.3d at 1225-26.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, I agree with the\n   Majority that the evidence that the interior of the Towanda Property tested positive for lead-based paint, and that there was no evidence of a full gut rehabilitation or other full abatement of the interior, is sufficient for a jury to infer that it was more probable than not that there was lead-based paint in the interior of the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Because of what it construes as the relatively lower standard of proof for causation in a lead paint case, at least at the summary judgment stage, the Majority holds that even when there are two probable sources of lead-based paint that may have caused a plaintiff's harm from elevated blood lead levels, \"a plaintiff is not required to show that one source of his lead exposure contributed to his injury to a greater degree than another.\" Majority Op. at 274, 160 A.3d at 1221. As I shall explain, I believe that our prior holding in\n   <em>\n    Rowhouses, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , combined with the Majority's holding today, has substantially weakened the showing that a plaintiff must make as to causation in order to avoid summary judgment in a lead paint case, without articulating a clear reason grounded in the law or public policy for that shift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Peterson v.

However, the actual holding in\n   <em>\n    Rowhouses\n   </em>\n   was limited to the facts of the case, in which the plaintiff had sought to use circumstantial evidence to \"rule out\" other probable sources of lead exposure under a\n   <em>\n    Dow\n   </em>\n   theory of causation. As previously discussed, the Majority opinion today appears to be the first time this Court has held that a plaintiff may \"rule in\" a property as a source of lead exposure and a substantial factor cause of the plaintiff's lead poisoning solely through the use of circumstantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   I believe that this Court's departure from\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   's \"more probable than not\" standard of proof for causation in lead paint cases at the summary judgment stage, both by the\n   <em>\n    Rowhouses, Inc.\n   </em>\n   Court, as well as by the Majority today, is unwarranted. First, it may give rise to an artificial distinction between lead paint cases and the rest of our tort law jurisprudence, without a clearly articulated basis in law or public policy to support such a distinction. Second, in defining the \"reasonable probability\" standard as anything between a \"possibility\" and \"more likely than not,\" the Court leaves open the possibility that circumstantial evidence as to causation in a lead paint case that has just one sliver of weight more than outright speculation or inferences not supported by logic might be deemed sufficient to advance beyond summary judgment. Third, it is likely that trial courts will have great difficulty in fairly applying the standard given the absence of any guidance as to what kind of additional evidence is needed to transform a mere possibility that a property was a source of a plaintiff's lead exposure and elevated blood lead levels into a \"reasonable probability\" that the property was the source of the harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Moreover, I am even more concerned by the Majority's extension of the \"reasonably probable\" standard to permit a plaintiff to move past summary judgment merely by \"ruling in\" a property as a reasonably probable source of the plaintiff's lead poisoning, even when there is one or more other reasonably probable sources of that harm. That holding is likely to unfairly burden property owners in factual situations similar to this case: where a plaintiff, who clearly has elevated blood lead levels, has lived in several homes, and the evidence is less than clear, either as to which of those homes had interior lead-based paint while the defendant lived there, or as to which source of lead-based paint was the likely cause of plaintiff's elevated blood lead levels.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1930242\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/258/9/#p17\">\n    258 Md. at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=264%20A.2d%20851\">\n    264 A.2d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that permitting a case to advance to a jury on \"limited proof\" would allow the jury \"to indulge in mere conjecture or speculation\" and thus \"amount to holding that liability may be predicated upon the mere happening of an accident which, exclusive of\n   <em>\n    res ipsa loquitur\n   </em>\n   situations, is not the law of Maryland\");\n   <em>\n    Dackman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676562\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/213/589/\">\n    213 Md.App. at 612-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676562\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/213/589/\">\n    75 A.3d 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing \"the real-life evidentiary challenges that proving lead paint injuries poses\" but noting that courts \"have declined the invitation to assume causation away\" in lead paint cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D.

The Court of Special Appeals agreed with that argument, holding that \"Mr. Rogers did not produce evidence that created a reasonable probability that he was exposed to lead at the Towanda Property that caused his alleged lead-exposure injuries,\" and that his evidence only \"supported a\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   that he was exposed to lead there.\"\n   <em>\n    Rogers v.

Instead, the majority relies primarily upon Dr. McDaniel's testimony, which the Majority characterizes as standing for the proposition that \"once [Mr.] Rogers was no longer exposed\n   to lead, his blood lead levels would decrease after about 30 to 45 days.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   From that testimony, the Majority determines that \"a jury could reasonably infer that if [the] Towanda [Property] was not a contributing source\" of Mr. Rogers' elevated blood lead levels, \"his March 1997 lead level would have been lower,\" and that \"his blood lead level declined in April 1997 because he had left the source of his exposure, which was [the] Towanda [Property].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Majority holds those inferences are sufficient to \"demonstrate that [the] Towanda Property was a reasonably probable cause of [Mr. Rogers'] elevated blood lead levels, and that summary judgment was improperly granted on this ground.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 277, 160 A.3d at 1223.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   I do not believe that Dr. McDaniel's testimony was sufficient to show that the Towanda Property was a more probable source of Mr. Rogers' harm than the Chinquapin Property, where Mr. Rogers resided immediately prior to his stay at the Towanda Property and where he first displayed elevated blood lead levels. Dr. McDaniel's testimony, at most, supports the proposition that Mr. Rogers' blood lead levels would decrease within 30 to 45 days after he was no longer exposed to lead. However, because of the gap in blood lead testing between March 25, 1996 and January 8, 1997-a period during which Mr. Rogers resided at the Chinquapin Property, which Dr. McDaniel agreed was a source of his lead exposure-it may be that Mr. Rogers' blood lead levels were higher during that period than during any of his recorded tests. Therefore, his 21 \u03bcg/dL blood lead level result in January 8, 1997 could, in fact, have reflected a decrease from a higher blood lead level 30 to 45 days earlier, when he resided at the Chinquapin Property. Indeed, Dr. McDaniel explicitly conceded in her deposition testimony that the January 8, 1997 result could reflect a decrease from a higher result from before Mr. Rogers moved into the Towanda Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Critically, Dr. McDaniel did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   testify that, after an initial decrease when Mr.\n   Rogers was removed from the source property of his lead exposure, his blood lead levels would\n   <em>\n    continue to further decrease\n   </em>\n   every additional 30 to 45 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, that is an inference that the Majority believes a jury could reasonably draw from Dr. McDaniel's testimony. And, the Majority believes that a jury could apply that inference to the facts to conclude that, because Mr. Rogers' blood lead level did not show a significant decrease from January 1997 to March 1997, while he resided at the Towanda Property, and declined from March 1997 to April 1997, after he left that property, the Towanda Property was the cause of his injury. But, an equally plausible inference from Dr. McDaniel's testimony and the other evidence in the record is that Mr. Rogers' blood lead levels in January 1997 reflect a decrease from a higher level 30 to 45 days earlier, when he resided at the Chinquapin Property, and that his decrease in lead levels seen in the subsequent test results in March, April, and August of 1997 reflects a gradual decrease in lead leaving his system after he moved from that property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   I agree with the Majority that a jury could logically and reasonably infer from Dr. McDaniel's testimony and the other evidence in the record that the Towanda Property was a \"reasonable probable cause\" of his harm, as the Majority defines that term, along with the Chinquapin Property. But, the evidence in the record and reasonable inferences deducible therefrom are not sufficient to show that the Towanda Property\n   was a\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   probable source of Mr. Rogers' elevated blood lead levels than the Chinquapin Property and, thus, that the Towanda Property was a substantial factor cause of his harm.

Was it improper for the Court of Special Appeals to affirm the grant of summary judgment relying upon a medical expert's opinion stated during her deposition, that in turn relied upon the resolution of a material fact in dispute, when the trial court did not rely upon this opinion as a reason for granting summary judgment, the issue could only be determined by resolving disputes of fact, and the court record only contained eleven non-consecutive pages of the doctor's deposition transcript, and did not reflect the medical doctor's entire causation opinion?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n    4.

As the\n    <em>\n     Kirson\n    </em>\n    Court recognized, \"Maryland courts 'have for some time required more of a plaintiff than simply a showing that he lived in an old house in an area where lead-based paint historically was present.' \"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 541,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p522\">\n     96 A.3d 714\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Hamilton v.

Thus, in addition to the age of the home, the plaintiff must present additional evidence to show that the interior of the home contained lead-based paint.

Thus, in this case, the issue of whether lead-based paint on the Towanda Property was a substantial factor cause of Mr. Rogers' exposure to lead turns entirely on whether he has presented sufficient evidence that his elevated blood lead levels in those tests reflect exposure to lead at the Towanda Property, rather than the Chinquapin Property-the second link in the\n    <em>\n     Ross\n    </em>\n    chain.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    Dr. McDaniel gave an opinion that Mr. Rogers' drop in blood lead levels from 20-21 \u03bcg/dL on March 26, 1997 to 17-18 \u03bcg/dL on April 30, 1997 was consistent with her statement that a decrease in blood lead levels would take 30 to 45 days from his removal from a source of lead exposure.
