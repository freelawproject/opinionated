Eastern Shore Title Company (\"ESTC\"), Petitioners and Cross-Respondents, conducted the title search for Mr. Steven Ochse and Ms. Shari Ochse (\"the Ochses\"), Respondents and Cross-Petitioners, when they purchased the lot from Mr. William Henry and Ms. Jessie Henry (\"the Henrys\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   However, vestiges of the road leading to the Ochses' door were evident in the physical remains of a gravel roadbed.

Thereafter, the Ochses' melancholy ballad took a long winding road through Maryland's appellate courts (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E. Shore Title Co. v.

The trial court granted that motion and reduced its judgment against ESTC and Chicago Title by the full $215,710.60-the amount of attorney's fees that the Ochses had already recovered from the Henrys in the Henry litigation. The Ochses and ESTC appealed the case to the Court of Special Appeals.

A total of fourteen property owners conveyed portions of their land to Dorchester County to create a thirty-foot-wide strip of land, \"for the purpose of making a new county road.\" According to the deed, the strip of land had been \"marked out, partly cut out and opened.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dorchester County thus acquired a fee simple determinable interest in the strip of land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the deed included a reversionary\n   clause, which stated that \"if the [county road] is abandoned by the said County Commissioners of Dorchester County, or their successors in interest, the lands hereby conveyed shall revert back to the said grantors, their heirs and assigns, so far as the same are within the bounds of the lands of the respective grantors heretofore mentioned.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Chronology of Pertinent Property Interests\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   One of the fourteen property owners was Henry B. Messenger, who held title to approximately 150 acres of land in this vicinity south of Federalsburg.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over the years, portions of Mr. Messenger's property were conveyed to various property owners. Of significance to this litigation, one of those conveyances-Mr. Messenger's conveyance on August 30, 1966 of two parcels to the Mayor and Council of Federalsburg for conservation efforts along Marshythorpe Creek, which adjoined his property-referenced two plats that depict a\n   roadway labeled as a \"county road\" within the vicinity of Mr. Messenger's remaining property (the \"1966 plats\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Subsequently, a thirty-five-acre parcel of the Messenger property was conveyed on June 29, 1972 by Esther White\n   Messenger\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   to R.T.R., Inc. On March 18, 1987, R.T.R., Inc. conveyed the same property by deed\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the Henrys. This thirty-five-acre parcel ultimately purchased by the Henrys included the county road owned by Dorchester County as referenced in the 1919 deed and 1966 plats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In 1998, the Henrys subdivided this parcel to create a lot of approximately five acres that included the county road, known as 2890 Mowbray Creek Road, Federalsburg.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, on September 13, 2001, Mr. and Ms. Ochse entered into a contract with the Henrys to purchase the subdivided parcel of land for $325,000.00 (the \"Contract of Sale\"). The Contract of Sale, which was in the standardized form of a Maryland Residential Contract of Sale, provided that \"[t]itle to the Property ... shall be good and merchantable, free of liens and encumbrances except as specified herein.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Significantly to this appeal, the Maryland Residential Contract of Sale, signed by the parties, contained a standard form fee-shifting provision, which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   In any action or proceeding between the [Ochses] and the [Henrys] based in whole or in part, upon performance or no performance of the terms and conditions of this Contract, including, but not limited to, breach of contract, negligence, misrepresentation or fraud, the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to receive reasonable attorney's fees from the other party as determined by the court arbitrator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Contract of Sale further specified that \"[t]he [attorney's fees] provision ... shall survive closing and shall not be deemed to have been extinguished by merger with the deed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Ochse Property Title Search\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Ochses received a policy of title insurance from Chicago Title, which guaranteed and represented that the Ochses' property title was precisely as depicted in the 1998 subdivision plat. As an agent of Chicago Title, and for the benefit of the Ochses, ESTC performed the title search, prepared a title insurance binder and drafted the deed. It is uncontested that the Ochses were the customers of ESTC and dealt directly with ESTC. The title search and title insurance binder were intended to \"permit [the Ochses] to make an informed decision whether to proceed with the purchase.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Closing on the 2890 Mowbray Creek Road Property\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On December 14, 2001, at a real estate closing conducted by the general manager\n   of ESTC, Veronica Wainwright, the Ochses acquired as tenants by entireties, via deed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   a fee simple interest in 2890 Mowbray Creek Road. The Ochses' deed included a provision (the \"driveway provision\") indicating that their property interest was \"SUBJECT, HOWEVER, to the rights of others legally entitled to the use of a 'Driveway', for purpose of ingress, egress and regress, over [the Ochse Property].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   At a subsequent trial proceeding, the Ochses testified that they asked Ms. Wainwright about the meaning of the provision's language during the closing, and that she verbally advised the Ochses that the driveway provision referred to utility easements, with the utility companies being the unidentified \"others\" in the provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Discovery of Ochses' Property Title Defect\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After residing at the property for four years, the Ochses hired a contractor in 2005 to undertake significant renovations\n   and landscaping to their home. Based upon an inquiry from the contractor and prior to finalizing the renovation plans, Ms. Ochse reviewed the property deed to determine whether the gravel roadbed could be removed and contacted ESTC for clarification. In response to Ms. Ochse's questions, ESTC performed a second title search. This second title search again failed to uncover the 1919 county road deed. Based on this second attempt, ESTC offered a new theory that the \"driveway provision\" in the Ochses' deed was not for utility easements, as originally represented to the Ochses at closing, but instead a right-of-way for the benefit of the Henry property. ESTC offered to prepare a release for the Henrys' signature to quitclaim any and all rights and eliminate the driveway provision from the Ochses' deed. However, when presented with the draft release, the Henrys would not agree to sign it or to relinquish their claims to any right-of-way over the Ochses' property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Ochses subsequently wrote a letter to their title insurer, Chicago Title, alerting the insurer to the presence an \"undisclosed right of-way\" that they contended ESTC had either \"failed to pick up on\" during the course of the title search, or failed to list in their Owners Policy. In the letter, the Ochses requested that Chicago Title \"initiate a claim on [their] behalf against Eastern Shore Title Company.\" Chicago Title denied the claim, referring to a portion of the Ochses policy that excepted from coverage \"easements ... and other limitations\" shown on the 1998 subdivision plat. The Ochses subsequently retained an attorney who continued to pursue obtaining a release from the Henrys, but without success.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    The Henry Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Consequently, on December 11, 2007, the Ochses filed a complaint against the Henrys in the Circuit Court for Dorchester County (\"the circuit court\") seeking reformation of their deed and for declaratory,\n   injunctive, and related relief. The Ochses sought damages for breach of contract, breach of special warranties, and fraud in the inducement based on the driveway provision in their deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Thereafter, on February 22, 2008, seven years after purchasing the 2890 Mowbray Creek Road property, the Ochses finally learned of the true legal status of the gravel roadbed-which up until that time they had presumed was, as stated in their deed, a driveway within property which they owned and over which some others merely had rights-of-way-when an attorney representing the Henrys mailed a letter to the Ochses' counsel revealing the existence of the 1919 county road deed, and Dorchester County's ownership of the county road. Then, the Henrys' attorney mailed a second letter to the Ochses' counsel stating that the Ochses' only remedy was to petition Dorchester County to convey the county road to the Ochses and that any judgment against the Henrys was fruitless because they could not deliver title for the roadbed to the Ochses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Instead, on April 11, 2008, the Ochses filed an amended complaint, in which they added Dorchester County as an interested party defendant, while maintaining the same claims as in their earlier complaint: reformation of the deed, declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and damages for breach of contract, breach of special warranties, and fraud in the inducement. The amended complaint requested the circuit court to remove the driveway provision from the Ochses' deed, and to declare that Dorchester County did not have a fee simple interest in the county road. The Henrys thereafter filed a counterclaim seeking an award of attorney's fees pursuant to the fee-shifting provision of the Contract of Sale that specifically survived merger with the deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On May 13, 2008, Dorchester County filed an answer to the Ochses' amended complaint and asserted its fee simple interest in the county road. On August 4, 2008, Dorchester County filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that there was no dispute of material fact regarding Dorchester County's ownership of the county road, including that portion of it described as a \"driveway\" in the Ochses' deed. Dorchester County asserted that it did not abandon, convey away, or otherwise dispose of its interest in the county road. On October 29, 2008, after a hearing, the circuit court granted Dorchester County's motion for summary judgment declaring that Dorchester County owned the thirty-foot-wide strip of land in fee simple.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The circuit court subsequently held a two-day bench trial, on May 26 and 27, 2009, as to the surviving claims made in the Ochses' amended complaint, as well as the Henrys' counterclaim for attorneys' fees pursuant to the fee-shifting provision in the Contract of Sale. Ultimately, in a written opinion and order entered September 18, 2009, the circuit court denied relief to the Ochses, \"conclud[ing] that the [Contract of Sale] merged into the deed and that there was no breach of the special warranties of title.\"\n   <em>\n    Ochse 1\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993721\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/202/521/\">\n    202 Md.App. at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993721,3703301\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/33/480/\">\n    33 A.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The circuit court, however, granted the Henrys' counterclaim, and subsequently, in a supplemental order entered on October 20, 2009, awarded the Henrys $100,020.00 in attorney's fees\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   to be paid by the Ochses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Ochses appealed all of the circuit court's judgments to the Court of Special Appeals.\n   <em>\n    Ochse 1\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993721\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/202/521/\">\n    202 Md.App. at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993721,3703301\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/33/480/\">\n    33 A.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Following court-ordered mediation before the Court of Special Appeals, the parties filed a consent motion to stay proceedings before that court pending the disposition of the petition by Dorchester County.

In that complaint, the Ochses alleged breach of contract against Chicago Title, and breach of contract, negligence, and negligent misrepresentation against ESTC, all stemming from the improper preparation of the Ochses' deed and failure to discover the 1919 deed. The Ochses subsequently filed an amended complaint on July 29, 2011 that added negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims against Chicago Title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The case proceeded to a four-day bench trial beginning on July 9, 2012. At that trial, the circumstances surrounding the faulty title search were revealed. William Price was the title abstractor who performed the title search on the property at 2890 Mowbray Creek Road on behalf of ESTC. Mr. Price\n   testified that he searched deeds in the chain of title back to 1902, and that, in his title abstract forwarded to ESTC settlement staff, he had alerted ESTC to the possible existence of a right-of-way running through the property. However, Mr. Price also testified that he had reviewed the 1966 plats in the Ochses' chain of title that noted a \"county road\" but found them not pertinent to his title search, and had skipped a search of the Grantor Index forward from 1902 that he conceded would have uncovered the 1919 deed that showed the existence of a county road on the property. The Ochses presented expert testimony that, under the circumstances, the 1919 deed should have been discovered and disclosed to the Ochses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   At the conclusion of the Ochses' case, the trial court granted a motion for judgment on behalf of both Chicago Title and ESTC as to the negligent misrepresentation counts, finding that they were barred by the statute of limitations. Then, on June 12, 2013, the trial court issued a memorandum opinion and judgment as to the remaining claims in the case. The trial court began that opinion by tracing what it described as the \"peculiar and extraordinary route\" of the litigation stemming from the failure to detect the 1919 county road deed and the 30-foot wide public road running across the 2890 Mowbray Creek Road property prior to the Ochses' purchase of that property. The trial court first summarized the course of the Henry litigation before the Circuit Court for Dorchester County, in which the Ochses had pursued declaratory relief against the Henrys and Dorchester County to gain clear title to the 30-foot wide strip of land. The trial court then described the ESTC litigation pending before it, in which the Ochses pursued breach of contract and negligence claims against ESTC and Chicago Title for failing to alert the Ochses to the presence of the county road across the 2890 Mowbray Creek Road property, a failure that\n   the Ochses alleged caused them to have incurred significant attorney's fees in the Henry litigation to obtain clear title to their property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As to the specific claims before it, the trial court concluded that Chicago Title could not be held vicariously liable for any\n   negligence of its title searcher agent, ESTC, and therefore dismissed the negligence count against Chicago Title. However, the trial court found in favor of the Ochses as to all remaining counts. The court determined that Chicago Title breached its contract with the Ochses because \"Chicago Title refused to act or provide a defense\" during the initial course of the Henry litigation, as well as because \"Chicago Title, through its agent [ESTC] failed to address the unresolved 'driveway' issue.\" The trial court also held that ESTC was negligent because it had \"breached the standard of care in its title examination\" by not discovering the 1919 county road deed and that, even though the county road was not in use at the time of the Henry litigation, that breach was \"significantly damaging\" to the Ochses, as the cloud in title would have been a major constraint on their ability to sell or develop the property. Finally, the trial court concluded that ESTC's failure to discover the 1919 deed had also breached its contractual obligation to the Ochses to prepare the title search and title insurance binder so that the Ochses' could make an informed decision as to whether to purchase the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Turning to the issue of damages, the trial court determined that the Ochses were not entitled to noneconomic damages, but awarded economic damages based upon the attorney's fees and costs the Ochses had incurred. The trial court entered judgment for the breach of contract claims against Chicago Title and awarded $471,947 to the Ochses for that claim, which the court broke down into $256,237.35 in expenses in the case before it, as well as $215,710.60 in attorney's fees for the Henry litigation. The trial court also entered judgment for the breach of contract and negligence claims against ESTC, and awarded $215,710.60 to the Ochses as to those claims. The $215,710.60 amount was, as the court noted, the amount that the Circuit Court for Dorchester County had determined that \"the Ochses were entitled for the Henry litigation.\" Although relying on that amount, the Circuit Court for Talbot County also stated that the judgment from the Circuit Court for Dorchester County was at that time on appeal, implicitly recognizing that the amount was subject to change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On June 18, 2013, ESTC and Chicago Title filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment and a motion to stay enforcement, seeking a clarification that the damages would be reduced by any recovery made by the Ochses in the Henry litigation. ESTC and Chicago Title attached the Henrys' motion to record satisfaction of money judgment filed in the Henry litigation on June 13, 2013, documenting that the Henrys had paid $218,901.89 to the Ochses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 28, 2013, the trial court granted ESTC and Chicago Title's motion and reduced the judgment in the instant case against both ESTC and Chicago Title by the $215,710.60 paid by the Henrys in the Henry litigation. As a result, the judgment against ESTC was reduced to $0.00, and the judgment against Chicago Title\n   was reduced to $256,237.35.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court's order stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Assuming the motion is approved by the Circuit Court for Dorchester County in the Henry litigation, the judgments in the instant litigation will be reduced [or otherwise satisfied] against Chicago Title and ESTC by $215,710.65.

In their briefs and at oral argument, ESTC and the Ochses focused on the proximate cause element of the collateral litigation doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   ESTC asserts that the collateral litigation doctrine does not apply in this case because the Ochses did not present sufficient evidence to support the necessary elements for the collateral litigation doctrine, specifically that ESTC's negligence proximately caused the Henry litigation. The Ochses respond that the collateral litigation doctrine does apply, and permits attorney's fees to be used as a measure of damages. The Ochses contend that ESTC's professional negligence forced them into litigation with the Henrys to reform their property deed, which satisfies the proximate cause element of the collateral litigation doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The trial court found that ESTC was negligent in exercising its duty of care to the Ochses, which arose from the contractual relationship between Chicago Title, ESTC, and the Ochses.

The trial court found that the Ochses sufficiently demonstrated that the wrongful act of ESTC, the negligent title search, required the Henry litigation and that the attorney's fees were a natural and proximate consequence of ESTC's negligence. The trial court found that ESTC's title search was negligent because the Ochses' deed included a drafting error by including\n   the \"12-foot driveway\" that \"ESTC questioned but never resolved.\" The trial court found that \"ESTC never came up with the 1919 deed, even though they [twice] searched the title, the first such search of the chain of title went back to 1902. Internal memoranda of ESTC noted the concerns in December, 2005, but were not conveyed to the Ochses or their representatives.\" Additionally, the trial court found that ESTC incorrectly advised the Ochses that the driveway language related to \"utility easements,\" when \"the driveway was actually found to be part of the 30' public roadway.\" Consequently, the trial court found that the wrongful act of ESTC required the Henry litigation because eventually\n   there would have been an issue with the Ochses' title, \"particularly when the Ochses went to sell the property,\" and the county road \"greatly limited the Ochses' use, development, marketability, and merchantability of the property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Therefore, we hold that a remand on the issue of proximate cause is not necessary, because the trial court found that ESTC's negligence required the Henry litigation in which the attorney's fees were incurred.

Although the Contract of Sale did contain its own fee-shifting provision, the public policy underlying the use of the lodestar method in cases involving fee-shifting statutes is inapplicable to a fee-shifting provision contained within a real estate contract between private parties.

In the Henry litigation, the circuit court used the \"proportionate award\" approach to arrive at what it determined to be a reasonable fee, and entered judgment accordingly against the Henrys. Although the Ochses asked for a greater amount, the circuit court determined that those additional fees were not reasonable. In this collateral litigation action, the Ochses essentially attempt to relitigate this point-whether the fees awarded in the Henry litigation were reasonable. We decline to second guess the reasonableness of attorney's fees awarded in the Henry litigation when the Ochses have already argued this issue in their second appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and we denied a request to grant a petition for certiorari from that appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ochse 2\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001695\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/216/439/\">\n    216 Md.App. at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4159564,4001695\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/88/773/\">\n    88 A.3d 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    cert. denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=439%20Md.%20331\">\n    439 Md. 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20A.3d%20146\">\n    96 A.3d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).

The trial court reduced the Ochses' damages by the amount satisfied by the Henrys in the Henry litigation. If the collateral source rule applies, then the trial court was not permitted to consider the Henrys' satisfaction of the attorney's fees in its award of damages to the Ochses. But if the collateral source rule does not apply, and the trial court was permitted to consider the Henrys' satisfaction, then the Ochses would be unable to establish one of the elements of the collateral litigation doctrine-namely, that their litigation expenses were \"incurred necessarily\"-and thus the Ochses would be unable to recover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Ochses assert that the trial court was not permitted to consider the Henrys' satisfaction because the Henrys are a collateral source and the collateral source rule precluded ESTC from presenting evidence of the Henrys' satisfaction to offset ESTC's liability in the instant case. As a result, the Ochses contend that the trial court erred by reducing the\n   Ochses' damages by the amount of attorney's fees satisfied by the Henrys in the Henry litigation. ESTC responds that the collateral source rule does not apply because the Restatement (Second) of Torts limits collateral sources to four types of benefits received by a plaintiff-insurance policies, employment benefits, gratuities, and social legislation benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 920A, cmt. c.

Additionally, the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 920A(c) limits the collateral source rule to four types of benefits:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   The rule that collateral benefits are not subtracted from the plaintiff's recovery applies to the following types of benefits:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   (1) Insurance policies, whether maintained by the plaintiff or a third party. Sometimes, as in fire insurance or collision automobile insurance, the insurance company is subrogated to the rights of the third party. This additional reason for keeping the tortfeasor's liability alive is not necessary, however, as the rule applies to insurance not involving subrogation, such as life or health policies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   (2) Employment benefits. These may be gratuitous, as in the case in which the employer, although not legally required to do so, continues to pay the employee's wages during his incapacity. They may also be benefits arising out of the employment contract or a union contract. They may be benefits arising by statute, as in worker's compensation acts or the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Statutes may subrogate the employer to the right of the employee, or create a cause of action other than by subrogation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   (3) Gratuities. This applies to cash gratuities and to the rendering of services. Thus the fact that the doctor did not charge for his services or the plaintiff was treated in a veterans['] hospital does not prevent his recovery for the reasonable value of the services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   (4) Social legislation benefits. Social security benefits, welfare payments, pensions under special retirement acts, all are subject to the collateral-source rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Ochses contend that the collateral source rule should apply to this case. However, they do not cite any authority for\n   the proposition that a fee-shifting provision in a real estate sales contract is analogous to the collateral benefits listed in the Restatement. Furthermore, the circumstances of this case are distinct from the insurance context, where application of the collateral source rule normally prevents a defendant from receiving the benefit of a plaintiff's insurance for which the plaintiff paid consideration through premiums. In this case, application of the collateral source rule would be inappropriate because the Ochses did not pay separate consideration for the fee-shifting provision in their Contract of Sale with the Henrys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Therefore, we decline to extend the collateral source rule, which would preclude the consideration of the Henrys' satisfaction of the same damages that the Ochses sought to recover in the instant case from ESTC. The collateral litigation doctrine only permits the recovery of attorney's fees actually incurred. Thus, the trial court did not err by considering the satisfaction of the attorney's fees by the Henrys pursuant to the fee-shifting provision in the Contract of Sale. If the Henrys had not satisfied the attorney's fees pursuant to the fee-shifting provision in the Contract of Sale, then the Ochses' theory of damages would have sufficed. But, the Ochses cannot take advantage of the fee-shifting provision in the Contract of Sale and of the collateral litigation doctrine to recover the\n   same attorney's fees. \"The object of tort law is to, so far as possible with money, place the injured party in the position he would have been if no tort had been committed. It is to provide full recompense but nothing more.\"\n   <em>\n    Paducah Area Pub. Library v.

In this case, the Ochses would be in a much better position than they were prior to ESTC's negligent title search if they were permitted to recover the attorney's fees that have already been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   We hold that the trial court properly declined to apply the collateral source rule in this case, and did not err by reducing the damages awarded to the Ochses by the amount previously satisfied by the Henrys. The Henrys' satisfaction of the attorney's fees from the Henry litigation eliminated the\n   Ochses' injury, because the fees were not \"incurred necessarily.\" Accordingly, the Ochses are unable to establish one of the basic elements of a negligence cause of action: \"that the plaintiff suffered actual injury or loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Kirson\n   </em>\n   , 439 Md. at 523-24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173636\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/501/#p523\">\n    96 A.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669784\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/207/121/#p148\">\n    207 Md.App. at 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669784\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/207/121/#p148\">\n    51 A.3d 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Ochses would have been permitted to recover the attorney's fees as damages in this collateral litigation action against ESTC but for the fee-shifting provision in the Contract of Sale and the Henrys' satisfaction of the attorney's fees pursuant to that provision. In other words, if the Henrys had not satisfied the judgment for attorney's fees in the Henry litigation, ESTC would have remained liable, under the collateral litigation doctrine, for the fees awarded in that litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, we hold that a party may recover attorney's fees actually incurred, as damages, pursuant to the collateral litigation doctrine, when the expenses were the proximate result of the complained-of injury, incurred necessarily and in good faith, and the amount is reasonable. However, the plaintiff has the burden in any negligence action to demonstrate actual injury. If a plaintiff seeks to recover attorney's fees as damages pursuant to the collateral litigation doctrine, then the plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she actually incurred the attorney's fees. In this case, the Ochses did not incur the attorney's fees because the Henrys satisfied the attorney's fees pursuant to the fee-shifting provision in the Maryland Residential Contract of Sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and reinstate the trial court's order with respect to the judgment concerning ESTC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
