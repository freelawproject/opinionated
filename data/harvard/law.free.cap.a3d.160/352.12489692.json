The defendants in this breach of contract action, Ann Futterleib and her husband Alfred Futterleib, appeal from the trial court's judgment partially in favor of the plaintiff, Connecticut Home Health Services, LLC, awarding $21,320.94 for caregiver services rendered by the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants claim, inter alia, that the court: (1) erred in finding that they had acted in bad faith, and, therefore, that the plaintiff's failure to comply with statutory requirements regarding home companion-care agencies was excused; and (2) erred in rendering judgment on an oral contract because chapter 400o of the General Statutes, entitled \"Homemaker-Companion Agencies\" (Homemaker-Companion Agencies Act), specifically, General Statutes (Rev. to 2010) \u00a7 20-679,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   requires that this type of contract be in writing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. The plaintiff, doing business as Right at Home, is a homemaker-companion agency that provides in-home care and assistance to elderly and/or disabled people. Caregivers provide a variety of services for clients, including cooking, light housekeeping, and medication assistance. In January or February, 2010, Robert Hendrickson, the defendants' power of attorney, sought out the plaintiff to provide care for the defendants, his mother and step-father, both of whom were suffering from physical ailments. On February 13, 2010, representatives of the plaintiff company, Hendrickson, and the defendants met at the defendants' home to discuss the defendants' needs for live-in, twenty-four hour care at the cost of $230 per live-in shift. The parties did not create or execute any contract or written understanding of agreement at that meeting. The defendants' live-in caregiver, an employee of the plaintiff, started work that afternoon at the defendants' home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff's general business practice is to prepare a client service agreement after an assessment meeting and then to send it to the client, or their representative,\n   to sign and return. Sometime around March 23, 2010, Hendrickson received at his home address a client Services Agreement that had been signed by the plaintiff's president on March 20, 2010 (service agreement). Hendrickson did not sign the agreement, and he did not send it back to the plaintiff. The plaintiff, through the live-in caregiver, continued to provide care to the defendants, and Hendrickson paid for the services on a periodic basis. After some time, the payments for the defendants' care became delinquent and the business relationship ended on January 27, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hendrickson\n   made three payments toward the balance owed after the relationship ended. The plaintiff filed this action on March 13, 2013, and at that time, the balance allegedly owed by the defendants was $21,320.94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In its original four count complaint, the plaintiff alleged two counts of breach of a written contract on the basis of the service agreement, with one count based specifically on Hendrickson's actions, unjust enrichment, and tortious interference with a business relationship. In this complaint, the plaintiff cited Hendrickson as a defendant along with Ann Futterleib and Alfred Futterleib, and sought to recover the balance owed by the defendants as well as additional damages. On March 25, 2014, the plaintiff filed a motion to amend its complaint to remove Hendrickson as a defendant and remove any mention of the service agreement in its breach of contract count. The court granted this motion on April 3, 2014. In its three count amended complaint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiff alleged: (1) breach of an oral contract; (2) unjust enrichment; and (3) tortious interference with employment relations. The defendants filed an amended answer on April 10, 2014, and alleged as special defenses that: (1) the plaintiff committed an unfair or deceptive practice by failing to meet statutory requirements to register its trade name; (2) the plaintiff's claims were barred by the doctrine of unclean hands because it failed to register its trade name and also because the plaintiff intentionally forged Hendrickson's signature onto the purported service agreement;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   3) the plaintiff's claims premised on an oral contract and unjust enrichment were barred by \u00a7 20-679 and General Statutes \u00a7 42-135a, a section of the Home Solicitation Sales Act; and (4) the plaintiff's claim based on oral contract was barred by General Statutes \u00a7 52-550, the statute of frauds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The four day trial to the court took place between April 3 and April 8, 2014. In its December 31, 2014 memorandum of decision, the court,\n   <em>\n    Wiese, J.\n   </em>\n   , found that the parties had entered into an oral contract on February 13, 2010, because they \"verbally agreed to the daily rate of the caregiver and ... a Client Services Agreement would be prepared and mailed to the defendants for their approval and signature.\" The court found for the defendants on the plaintiff's tortious interference claim and, because the court found in favor of the plaintiff on its oral contract claim, it did not address the unjust enrichment claim. As for the defendants' special defense that the plaintiff's claims were barred by \u00a7\u00a7 20-679 and 42-135a, the court found that the service agreement \"was intentionally not returned to [the plaintiff]. It was left in an envelope by Mr. Hendrickson and he declined to take any action with regards to it. Through inadvertence, [the plaintiff] did not become aware of this fact at the time that services were provided to [the defendants].\" The court further found that Hendrickson's intentional failure to sign and return the service agreement constituted bad faith, which excused the plaintiff's noncompliance with the statutory requirement that the contract of service be in writing. As noted, the court rendered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $21,320.94. This appeal followed. Additional\n   facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We first set forth the legal principles relevant to the claims at issue. At the time of the conduct in question, \u00a7 20-679, which governs contracts between homemaker-companion agencies and clients, provided in relevant part: \"Not later than seven calendar days after the date on which a homemaker-companion agency commences providing homemaker services or companion services, such agency shall provide the person who receives the services, or the authorized representative of such person, with a written contract or service plan that prescribes the anticipated scope, type, frequency, duration and cost of the services provided by the agency ....\" General Statutes (Rev. to 2010) \u00a7 20-679. In addition, the statute required that the contract or service plan provide notice to the person receiving services: \"(1) of the person's right to request changes to, or review of the contract or service plan, (2) of the employees of such agency who, pursuant to section 20-678 are required to submit to a comprehensive background check, and (3) that such agency's records are available for inspection or audit by the Department of Consumer Protection....\" General Statutes (Rev. to 2010) \u00a7 20-679. The statute further provided that \"[n]o contract or service plan for the provision of homemaker or companion services shall be valid against the person who receives the services or the authorized representative of such person, unless the contract or service plan has been signed by a duly authorized representative of the homemaker-companion agency and the person who receives the services or the authorized representative of such person....\" General Statutes (Rev. to 2010) \u00a7 20-679.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With these legal principles in mind, we turn now to our assessment of the defendants' claims on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendants first claim that the court erred in finding that Hendrickson acted in bad faith by not signing and returning the service agreement, and, therefore, that the plaintiff's noncompliance with \u00a7 20-679 was excused.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We assume, without deciding, that the court correctly incorporated a bad faith exception into the Homemaker-Companion Agencies Act because, even if the trial court was correct in its bad faith imputation, the record does not support a finding that Hendrickson acted in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. As noted, the defendants, Hendrickson, and representatives of the plaintiff company met at the defendants' home on February 13, 2010, to discuss the defendants' care needs, and later that day, the plaintiff's employee, a\n   live-in caregiver, began working at the defendants' home. More than one month later, sometime between March 23 and March 25, 2010, Hendrickson received in the mail a one page service agreement from the plaintiff. That agreement provided information about the cost of services ($230 per day), holiday procedures, mileage reimbursement, scheduling, billing, indemnity, and insurance. The agreement also provided a damages clause dealing with the consequences that would ensue in the event that a client directly hires the plaintiff's caregiver, as well as an authorization to release the client's medical information to specific entities for insurance, accreditation, and/or medical purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hendrickson did not sign or return the service agreement to the plaintiff. When asked at trial what he did with the document, he testified that he \"actually forgot all about it\" and that he \"left it in the envelope\" and \"never really dug it out again.\" He further testified that he was not contacted by the plaintiff about the service agreement after that. The vice president of the plaintiff company, Robert Scandura, who was present at the initial February 13, 2010 meeting, testified that \"\n   <em>\n    some families\n   </em>\n   who try to be deceitful ... don't send [the service agreement] back.\" (Emphasis added.) He also testified that Hendrickson \"withheld [the service agreement] intentionally,\" and that \"[Hendrickson's family] chose not to sign [the service agreement] ....\" No evidence was presented in support of Scandura's testimony regarding Hendrickson's allegedly nefarious motive. For the first time in our jurisdiction, the court imputed onto the Homemaker-Companion Agencies Act a bad faith exception to statutory compliance, borrowed from the Home Improvement Act, General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   With that imputation in mind, the court then found that Hendrickson had acted in bad faith by intentionally failing to sign and return\n   the service agreement, and, therefore, the plaintiff's noncompliance with \u00a7 20-679 was excused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Whether a party has acted in bad faith is a question of fact, subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review.\"\n   <em>\n    Harley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Indian Spring Land Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4302286\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/123/800/#p837\">\n    123 Conn.App. 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 837,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20A.3d%20992\">\n    3 A.3d 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statutory language of the Home Improvement Act does not provide a bad faith exception to compliance with the act, but our courts have incorporated such an exception into the statute.

In the complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant's conduct violated the Home Improvement Act because the contract was not signed, it did not contain the whole agreement between the parties, and it did not contain a notice of the plaintiff's right to cancel the contract.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of New London, Docket No. CV-075002674,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204515937\">\n    2008 WL 4515937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *9 and n.13 (September 24, 2008). The trial court found that the defendant failed to comply with the Home Improvement Act. Id., *11. On appeal, the defendant, relying on\n   <em>\n    Habetz,\n   </em>\n   argued that the plaintiff had acted in bad faith by claiming noncompliance with the Home Improvement Act, because he had not signed the contract.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 125-26,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=994%20A.2d%20330\">\n    994 A.2d 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In disagreeing with the defendant, and distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Habetz\n   </em>\n   , a panel of this court stated: \"[T]he defendant's noncompliance with the act was not merely the failure to have a signed contract. In this case, the defendant did not comply with several other portions of [the Home Improvement Act]. Also, there is no evidence that he ever asked the plaintiff about signing the contract after he gave it to him initially.... The fact that the plaintiff did not sign the contract is not a sufficient basis for us to conclude that the court improperly failed to find that the plaintiff claimed [noncompliance with] the act in bad faith.\" Id., at 127,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=994%20A.2d%20330\">\n    994 A.2d 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the present case, assuming, without deciding, that the court was correct in grafting the Home Improvement Act's bad faith exception onto the Homemaker-Companion Agencies Act, we must determine whether the court erred in determining that Hendrickson had acted in bad faith by not signing and returning the service agreement to the plaintiff. The defendants argue that the court erred in making that determination. We agree. There was no direct evidence in the record to support a finding that Hendrickson's failure to sign the\n   contract was done in bad faith, and the plaintiff's claim to the contrary, without corroboration, does not constitute sufficient evidence. Therefore, we do not believe the evidentiary record supports the conclusion that the plaintiff's noncompliance with \u00a7 20-679 should be excused, and the court's finding to the contrary was a clear error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Hendrickson testified at trial that he simply put the agreement aside and forgot about it. The court heard no evidence that Hendrickson intentionally had not signed the agreement except for Scandura's testimony that \"\n   <em>\n    some families\n   </em>\n   who try to be deceitful ... don't send [the service agreement] back,\" and his unsupported claim that Hendrickson \"withheld [the service agreement] intentionally ....\" (Emphasis added.) Although testimony, at times, may be sufficient to uphold a factual determination, this testimony about Hendrickson's state of mind is nothing more than unsupported speculation. Therefore, the evidence does not support the court's finding that Hendrickson acted fraudulently, with \"a design to mislead or deceive\" the plaintiff, with an \"interested or sinister motive,\" or with a \"dishonest purpose.\" (Internal quotation\n   marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Habetz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Condon\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"549792\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/224/231/#p238\">\n    224 Conn. at 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=618%20A.2d%20501\">\n    618 A.2d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It failed to conform to most of the requirements set forth in \u00a7 20-679. The service agreement was silent as to the scope, type, frequency, or duration of the services that were to be provided to the defendants, the inclusion\n   of which is required under \u00a7 20-679. The service agreement also did not provide notice of the client's \"right to request changes to, or review of the contract or service plan,\" or that the plaintiff's employees \"are required to submit to a comprehensive background check,\" or that the plaintiff's \"records are available for inspection or audit by the Department of Consumer Protection,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the inclusion of which is also required under General Statutes (Rev. to 2010) \u00a7 20-679. The service agreement complied only with the requirement that it provide the cost of service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the statute requires that the service agreement be provided to the client within seven days of the commencement of service. The defendants' live-in caregiver started on February 13, 2010, and Hendrickson did not receive the agreement until March 23, 2010, at the earliest, which is far beyond the seven day statutory requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, even if this purported agreement had been signed by the parties, it would have been of doubtful enforceability in light of its many omissions and shortcomings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On the basis of our holding in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   that a consumer's failure to sign a contract, by itself, does not constitute bad faith when the contract failed to comply with\n   other provisions of the Home Improvement Act, we conclude that the plaintiff's failure to comply with \u00a7 20-679 here cannot be excused by the defendants' failure to sign the service agreement. See\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186160\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/121/105/#p127\">\n    121 Conn.App. at 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=994%20A.2d%20330\">\n    994 A.2d 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the court's finding that Hendrickson had acted in bad faith, and as a result, that the plaintiff's noncompliance with the Homemaker-Companion Agencies Act was excused, is clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Having determined that the service agreement, executed by the plaintiff\n   but not the defendants, for the provision of home care services to the defendants by the plaintiff was unenforceable, we next turn to the court's determination that the parties had entered into an enforceable oral contract. The defendants argue that the court erred in rendering judgment upon an oral contract because the Homemaker-Companion Agencies Act, specifically, \u00a7 20-679, requires that a contract of this type be in writing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff argues that the trial court correctly found that the parties entered into an oral contract, and that the defendants were liable for the unpaid balance of the services rendered by the plaintiff. This issue of whether \u00a7 20-679 requires that contracts between homemaker-companion agencies and its clients be in writing, and, therefore, whether oral contracts of this type are unenforceable as a matter of law, has yet to be decided in our jurisdiction, and after a thorough inquiry, we agree with the defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   As noted, the court, in its memorandum of decision, found that the parties had entered into an oral agreement and stated: \"[T]he plaintiff and the defendants met [on February 13, 2010] to discuss establishing home care to the defendants. Both parties verbally agreed to the daily rate of the caregiver and the client service plan was prepared as a result of the meeting. It was also agreed that a client Services Agreement would be prepared and mailed to the defendants for their approval and signature. The court finds that, at this point, the parties had an established ... oral agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We first set forth our standard of review and the relevant legal principles that guide our analysis of this aspect of the appeal.

The purpose and clear intent of \u00a7 20-679 would be thwarted by permitting a homemaker agency to bring an action against a client for services rendered based solely on an oral agreement and in the absence of a written contract including the statutorily mandated notices and protections.

The plaintiff alleged in its amended complaint that the defendants tortiously interfered with the employment agreement by hiring away the caregiver from its employ.
