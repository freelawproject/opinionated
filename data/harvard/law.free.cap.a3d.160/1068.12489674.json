We also conclude that the petitioner's second claim must fail as a matter of law because, although it is common practice in Connecticut and perhaps advisable to do so, the law does not require a court to determine whether a defendant's faculties are impaired by any medications prior to accepting guilty pleas. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ocasio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"545379\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/253/375/#p378\">\n    253 Conn. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 378-79,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=751%20A.2d%20825\">\n    751 A.2d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts underlie the criminal conviction from which the present habeas petition arises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 19, 2008, Stamford police were dispatched to a bar on Selleck Street in Stamford known as Harry O's. Their investigation revealed that the petitioner had engaged in an altercation with Jonathan Payano, whom the petitioner had accused of attempted pickpocketing. This altercation culminated with the petitioner confronting Payano and his companions outside of the bar. In the course of this confrontation, the petitioner brandished a firearm and proceeded to shoot Payano and two of his companions, Michael Garrabito and Harvey Castro, from very close range. Payano and Garrabito each were shot in the leg, and Castro was shot in the hip and in the hand while attempting to push Garrabito out of the line of fire. A witness told police that the wounded\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   men quickly escaped into the bar while the petitioner discarded the firearm and fled the scene. Payano, his companions, and employees of the bar all identified the petitioner as the shooter and subsequently identified the petitioner in photographic arrays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The petitioner was arrested on August 1, 2008, approximately two weeks after the shooting. During the subsequent criminal proceedings, the petitioner was represented by attorney Wayne Keeney. Keeney attempted to negotiate with the state's attorney, offering guilty pleas in exchange for a reduced sentence. Ultimately, those negotiations failed to produce an offer that the petitioner considered acceptable, and so, on April 21, 2009, pursuant to Keeney's advice, the petitioner pleaded guilty to three counts of assault in the first degree by means of the discharge of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59(a)(5), with no sentence agreement from the state, hoping that Keeney could argue for a shorter sentence. He was subsequently sentenced to twenty years of incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 6, 2015, the petitioner filed the operative petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that Keeney had rendered\n   ineffective assistance in failing to provide adequate advice to the petitioner regarding his guilty pleas, and that the trial court's failure to inquire whether the petitioner was under the influence of any medications that might impair his judgment rendered his pleas not knowing and voluntary. On March 26, 2015, a trial was conducted on the petitioner's claims, at which the only witnesses were Keeney and the petitioner. The habeas court made the following findings that are relevant to the petitioner's claims on appeal. From the outset of his representation of the petitioner, Keeney believed that the state had a very strong case against the petitioner and that, based on his lengthy criminal exposure, it was in the petitioner's best interests to seek a plea deal. During plea negotiations, the state\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   offered the petitioner a sentence of twenty or twenty-five years of incarceration in exchange for pleading guilty, which the petitioner rejected on Keeney's advice. Later, when the state offered the petitioner a sentence of twenty years, suspended after fifteen years, to be followed by a likely term of either probation or conditional discharge, in exchange for pleading guilty, the petitioner rejected this offer as well on Keeney's advice. Keeney recommended that the petitioner reject each of these plea offers because he considered the proposed sentences disproportionately high, given the nonfatal injuries suffered by the victims. The state never made any other offers, contrary to the petitioner's claim that the state made an offer of fifteen years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the state's second offer, Keeney decided, based on his experience in prior dealings with the prosecutors in the Hartford judicial district, that it would be advantageous to continue the plea negotiation process. He sought approval from the petitioner to make a counteroffer to the state, in which the petitioner would serve seven to eight years in exchange for pleading guilty. The petitioner rejected this proposal, stating that the eight year upper limit was \"a year too much.\" Finally, with trial approaching, Keeney advised the petitioner that, due to the strength of the state's case, it would\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   be unwise to proceed to trial where he likely would be convicted and the sentence likely would be twenty-five years of imprisonment. Rather, based on previous in-chambers conversations, Keeney advised the petitioner that the judges did not appear to believe that the case warranted a long sentence and that Keeney felt confident he could argue the sentence down to ten to twelve years if the defendant entered \"open pleas\" of guilty. The petitioner ultimately followed this advice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 21, 2009, pursuant to Keeney's advice, the petitioner entered \"open pleas,\" which meant there was no agreement with the state regarding the sentence to be imposed, and thus he faced up to the maximum statutory sentence of three consecutive terms of twenty years imprisonment,\n   for a total of sixty years imprisonment. Before accepting the petitioner's pleas, the court,\n   <em>\n    Nigro, J.\n   </em>\n   , canvassed the petitioner regarding his understanding of the implications of the pleas, but did not inquire whether the petitioner was in any way impaired by medication. The court was satisfied with the petitioner's answers and found that the pleas were entered knowingly and voluntarily with the effective assistance of counsel. Thereafter, the pleas were accepted and the petitioner was sentenced to twenty years of incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 13, 2015, after making the aforementioned findings of fact, the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Oliver, J.\n   </em>\n   , denied the petition. The court concluded that the petitioner had failed to establish prejudice on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because he did not establish that there was a reasonable probability that he would have accepted the second plea offer if not for counsel's allegedly deficient performance. The court also rejected the petitioner's claims that his pleas were not knowing and voluntary because there was no credible evidence that the petitioner was under the influence of any substance that negatively impacted his ability to enter knowing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   and voluntary pleas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 27, 2015, the habeas court granted certification to appeal the denial of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The petitioner first argues that the habeas court incorrectly concluded that he was not denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. He argues that Keeney deficiently advised him regarding the favorability of particular plea offers from the state and regarding his chances of obtaining a better sentence through open pleas. If not for this advice, the petitioner argues that he would have accepted a plea offer of twenty years incarceration, with execution suspended after fifteen years, and would not have been sentenced to twenty years after entering the open pleas recommended by Keeney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"It is well settled that in reviewing the denial of a habeas petition alleging the ineffective assistance of counsel, this court cannot disturb the underlying facts found by the habeas court unless they are clearly erroneous, but our review of whether the facts as found by the habeas court constituted a violation of the petitioner's constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel is plenary.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Gerald W.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488139\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/729/#p465\">\n    169 Conn.App. 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 465,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488139\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/729/#p465\">\n    150 A.3d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488809,12488810,12488811\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/324/908/\">\n    324 Conn. 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488810,12488811,12488812,12488813\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/152/1246/\">\n    152 A.3d 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"We begin our analysis with the legal principles that govern our review of the petitioner's claim.

Rather, it denied the habeas petition on the basis of its determination that the petitioner failed to meet his burden under the prejudice prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test, as modified by\n   <em>\n    Ebron\n   </em>\n   . Even if the petitioner had shown that Keeney's advice was deficient, the habeas court concluded that he had nonetheless failed to show that, but for this allegedly deficient performance, he would have accepted the state's earlier plea offer of twenty years with execution suspended after fifteen years and followed by either a likely term of probation or, in the alternative, conditional discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To satisfy the prejudice prong, the petitioner had the burden of showing that without Keeney's allegedly deficient advice, he would have accepted the state's plea offer. See\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra, 169 Conn.App. at 826,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489066\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/8/#p825\">\n    153 A.3d 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The heart of the petitioner's argument is that the prejudice caused is evident in the fact that the state had made a plea offer of fifteen years,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   which the petitioner rejected on Keeney's advice, and that the petitioner was ultimately sentenced to twenty years by entering the open pleas, as recommended by Keeney. The habeas court expressly concluded that there was no reasonable probability that the petitioner would have accepted the state's offer of twenty years with execution suspended after fifteen years. This conclusion is proper because it is supported by testimony from both Keeney and the petitioner. Both testified that Keeney had sought approval from the petitioner to make a counteroffer to the state of seven to eight years incarceration and that the petitioner had rejected this proposed offer. The habeas court found it significant that the petitioner refused the proposed counteroffer because he viewed the proposed upper limit of eight years to be \"a year too much.\" Based on this testimony, the habeas court understandably determined that the petitioner's claim that he would have accepted an earlier plea offer-whether of fifteen or twenty years-lacked credibility in light of his refusal to authorize a counteroffer of seven to eight years because he thought the proposed sentence was too long.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In sum, we are convinced that the habeas court properly determined that the petitioner failed to meet his burden of establishing prejudice under the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard, as modified by\n   <em>\n    Ebron\n   </em>\n   .

As with \u00a7 39-19, the binding precedent of our Supreme Court holds that substantial compliance with \u00a7 39-20 satisfies its requirements, and the trial court is not required to venture beyond its commands.

Our review of the plea canvass leads us to the same conclusion as the habeas court, namely, that the canvass substantially complied with \u00a7\u00a7 39-19 and 39-20. We agree with the\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, that the primary authority the petitioner relies on in support of his position is readily distinguishable and is not controlling as to our application of \u00a7\u00a7 39-19 and 39-20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   We\n   conclude, based on the existing precedent and facts of this case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the habeas court did not err in denying the petitioner's due process claim that his pleas were not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made due to an alleged defect in the court's plea canvass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The habeas court granted certification to appeal from the judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    These facts are as stated by the state's attorney and agreed to by the petitioner when he pleaded guilty.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Although it is unclear, we presume the petitioner is simply referring to the total effective sentence of fifteen years implied by the state's second offer of twenty years, suspended after fifteen years and followed by either a likely term of probation or alternatively conditional discharge. We note, however, that a total sentence of fifteen years, with no period suspended, is not the same as a twenty year sentence, suspended after fifteen years with a term of probation or conditional discharge. Under the latter sentence, the petitioner would have still faced exposure to serving the remainder of the twenty year sentence if he violated the terms of his release under either a term of probation or conditional discharge, as provided by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32. This distinction is significant given that the habeas court's findings show the petitioner was particularly sensitive to the length of proposed sentences and it is reasonable to presume he would have been more resistant to longer sentences.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The petitioner has claimed that at the time he entered his pleas, he was using a medication called Acyclovir and that he was suffering from certain side effects that impact a small number of users, including confusion, decreased consciousness, delirium, and agitation. The habeas court also found that four days after entering the pleas at issue in this appeal, the petitioner entered a guilty plea in an unrelated matter. During this subsequent plea, that court's plea canvass included a question about medication, to which the petitioner stated that he was taking Acyclovir and that the drug did not prevent him from fully understanding the proceedings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The habeas court in the present appeal correctly employed this standard from\n    <em>\n     Ebron\n    </em>\n    . However, in doing so, the habeas court erroneously imposed an additional element that our Supreme Court expressly rejected in\n    <em>\n     Ebron\n    </em>\n    , namely, that the petitioner must also show that there was no intervening circumstance that would have caused the court or the prosecution to withdraw consent to the plea agreement. This additional element arises from the decision of the United States Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Missouri\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Frye\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188490\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/134/#p140\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188490\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/134/#p140\">\n     566 U.S. at 148\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188490\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/134/#p140\">\n     132 S.Ct. 1399\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , which informed our Supreme Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Ebron\n    </em>\n    . The court in\n    <em>\n     Ebron\n    </em>\n    rejected this additional element because it creates the potential for a factual paradox at the prejudice and remedy stages of a habeas proceeding. The paradox may arise in that the habeas court could determine at the prejudice stage, in finding prejudice, that no intervening circumstance would have prompted the plea agreement to be revoked, and then at the remedy stage conclude that some intervening circumstance now renders the sentence attached to the plea agreement to be insufficient. See\n    <em>\n     Ebron\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Commissioner of Correction\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Conn.%20342\">\n     307 Conn. at 355-57\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20A.3d%20983\">\n     53 A.3d 983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Nevertheless, we conclude that this error by the habeas court was harmless because the court decided the issue exclusively on the first part of the\n    <em>\n     Ebron\n    </em>\n    standard, that the petitioner failed to establish a reasonable probability that he would have accepted the plea offer.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    As noted previously, the habeas court expressly found that the state never made an offer of fifteen years incarceration.

He argues that, due to the similarity of this federal rule and our Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 39-19 and 39-20, that we should be guided by this decision of the Second Circuit. First, it must be noted that while these rules are similar in spirit and, to some extent, content, these rules are\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    the same. Rule 11(b)(1) provides in relevant part that, before accepting a guilty plea, the court must address the defendant in open court to inform the defendant of and determine the defendant's understanding of certain enumerated rights that are the hallmark of due process in a criminal proceeding and which the defendant will be waiving, and provide information about the nature of the crimes charged and the associated penalties. Subdivision (2) of rule 11(b) provides that the court \"must address the defendant personally in open court and determine that the plea is voluntary and did not result from force, threats, or promises (other than promises in a plea agreement).\" Although the selected requirements of rule 11(b) referenced here are similar to those of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 39-19 and 39-20, the petitioner's reliance is misplaced.\n    <em>\n     Rossillo\n    </em>\n    is clear that the court's obligation is predicated on first being informed that the defendant is using medication.
