We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n   The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. The plaintiffs own real property located at 50 Pearl Street in the Mystic River Historic District within the town of Groton (town). The applicants own abutting real property located at 52 Pearl Street. On May 1, 2012, the applicants sought a certificate of appropriateness from the commission that would allow them to remove nine feet, seven inches from the southern end of a historic barn located on their property, which would eliminate their need to obtain a variance from the town's lot coverage regulations in connection with plans to build an addition to their house. At a public hearing on May 15, 2012, the commission voted to grant that application for a certificate of appropriateness, despite the fact that the plaintiffs appeared and objected to the application. On May 25, 2012, the plaintiffs appealed from the commission's decision granting the certificate of appropriateness to the trial court pursuant to \u00a7 7-147i (first appeal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   While the first appeal was pending before the trial court, on September 1, 2012, the applicants requested a second certificate of appropriateness from the commission to: (1) modify the barn by removing a portion not in public view, in accordance with an accompanying architectural drawing; and (2) \"modify and expand [the] existing rear addition\" to the house. Specifically, the applicants sought the commission's approval of a proposal to reduce the overall footprint of the barn while leaving several of its facades intact, in order to make additional room for the contemplated addition. The commission held a public hearing on the second application on September 18, 2012. The commission then continued the hearing to a second session, held on October 16, 2012. At that hearing, the applicants withdrew the portion of the application seeking a certificate of appropriateness with respect to alterations to the main house. After some discussion, the commission\n   found that it lacked jurisdiction over the remainder of the matter because \"the portion of the [barn at issue did] not meet the definition of an exterior architectural feature that is open to view from a public street, way or place.\" On October 29, 2012, the plaintiffs appealed from the commission's finding of no jurisdiction to the trial court pursuant to \u00a7 7-147i (second appeal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court held a hearing on both appeals on July 22, 2014. Following testimony by the plaintiffs to establish their aggrievement in each appeal, the defendants moved to dismiss both appeals for lack of statutory or classical aggrievement. The trial court subsequently issued separate memoranda of decision granting the motions of the defendants to dismiss the two appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its memoranda of decision, the trial court first agreed with the defendants' claim that statutory aggrievement under \u00a7 8-8(a) does not apply to historic district commission appeals brought pursuant to \u00a7 7-147i. Rejecting the contrary analysis in\n   <em>\n    Peeling\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Historic District Commission\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk, Docket No CV-06-4009772-S (November 1, 2006) (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20284\">\n    42 Conn.

The legislature could have but did not provide expressly, or incorporate the per se aggrievement provision in \u00a7 8-8(a)(1)....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court then turned to classical aggrievement. With respect to the first appeal, the trial court acknowledged that the plaintiffs had pleaded that they were aggrieved. The trial court nevertheless concluded that the plaintiffs had \"rested their case on aggrievement without presenting any evidence of such aggrievement or citing any evidence in the record, let alone any specific testimony or exhibit in the record, from which the\n   court could find aggrievement as a matter of fact.\" The court further rejected the plaintiffs' reliance on the administrative record pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State Library\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Freedom of Information Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1613429\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/240/824/#p832\">\n    240 Conn. 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 832-33,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=694%20A.2d%201235\">\n    694 A.2d 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997), noting the plaintiffs' failure to cite specific references to the administrative record during their case-in-chief, and stating that even if it were to search the record, the plaintiffs had failed to establish \"the possibility ... that [they] have a specific personal and legal interest in the subject of the [commission's] decision which [had] been specially and injuriously affected ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the court rendered judgment dismissing the first appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   With respect to the second appeal, the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs failed to plead that they were classically aggrieved by the commission's decision. The court also emphasized that the commission's decision to permit the applicants to remove a portion of the barn did not directly harm the plaintiffs, observing that they could not see that portion of the barn from their property, and there was no \"claim, let alone credible evidence,\" that the removal of that portion of the barn \"harmed the value [of the plaintiffs' property].\" The trial court reiterated that the possibility that the applicants might use the space to build an addition did\n   not render the plaintiffs aggrieved. See footnote 5 of this opinion. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment dismissing the second appeal. These appeals followed. See footnote 3 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded, with respect to both appeals, that: (1) the statutory aggrievement provided by \u00a7 8-8(a) does not apply to historic district commission appeals brought pursuant to \u00a7 7-147i ; and (2) they were not classically aggrieved. We address each of these claims in turn. Additional relevant facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Before we address the merits of the parties' claims, we briefly set forth the law governing aggrievement .... [P]leading and proof of aggrievement are prerequisites to the trial court's jurisdiction over\n   the subject matter of a plaintiff's appeal. ... [I]n order to have standing to bring an administrative appeal, a person must be aggrieved. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Standing ... is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court; nor is it a test of substantive rights.

Classical aggrievement requires a two part showing.

Second, the party must also show that the agency's decision has specially and injuriously affected that specific personal or legal interest. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Aggrievement does not demand certainty, only the possibility of an adverse effect on a legally protected interest. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Statutory aggrievement exists by legislative fiat, not by judicial analysis of the particular facts of the case.

The plaintiffs contend that the language of \u00a7 7-147i, which provides that \"[p]rocedure upon such appeal shall be the same as that defined in section 8-8,\" is plain and unambiguous and, as such, affording them the statutory aggrievement provided by \u00a7 8-8(a) is consistent with the purpose of that statute, because they are \"distinct from other property owners due to [their] obvious interest as 'the property next door.' \" The plaintiffs argue that the legislature has, for more than ten years, acquiesced in the Superior Court's construction of \u00a7\u00a7 7-147i and 8-8(a) in\n   <em>\n    Peeling\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Historic District Commission\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20284\">\n    42 Conn. L. Rptr. 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which held that statutory aggrievement applies in historic district commission appeals. The plaintiffs further argue that the \" '[e]xcept as provided' \" by \u00a7 7-147i language in \u00a7 8-8\"applies only to the various time periods for appeals in the listed legal proceedings\" set forth in \u00a7 8-8(b), and \"does not exclude statutory aggrievement in \u00a7 7-147i.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In response, the commission contends that the trial court properly determined that statutory aggrievement does not apply in appeals from historic district commissions pursuant to \u00a7 7-147i. The commission argues that, even if \u00a7 7-147i is deemed to incorporate all of \u00a7 8-8(a), the plain language of \u00a7 8-8(a) confers statutory aggrievement only on persons aggrieved by decisions of planning commissions, zoning commissions, zoning boards of appeal, or combined planning and zoning commissions. Citing a Connecticut land use treatise; see T. Tondro, Connecticut Land Use Regulation (2d Ed. 1992), pp. 547-48; the commission contends that this limited provision of statutory aggrievement in \u00a7 8-8(a) plainly and unambiguously\n   provides that parties appealing from decisions of other types of land use agencies must prove classical aggrievement. Accordingly, the commission argues that the Superior Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Peeling\n   </em>\n   is both dictum and wrongly decided. We agree with the commission and conclude that \u00a7 8-8(a) does not afford statutory aggrievement in historic district commission appeals brought pursuant to \u00a7 7-147i.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Whether \u00a7\u00a7 7-147i and 8-8(a) combine to provide statutory aggrievement in historic district commission appeals presents a question of statutory construction over which we exercise plenary review.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    O &amp; G Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485369\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/950/#p302\">\n    322 Conn. 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 302,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485369\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/950/#p302\">\n    140 A.3d 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). \"When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes.

When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter ....

Section 7-147i provides in relevant part that: \"\n   <em>\n    Any person or persons severally or jointly aggrieved\n   </em>\n   by any decision of the historic district commission or of any officer thereof may, within fifteen days from the date when such decision was rendered, take an appeal to the superior court for\n   the judicial district in which such municipality is located ....\n   <em>\n    Procedure upon such appeal shall be the same as that defined in section 8-8\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section 8-8(a)(1), in turn, defines \" '[a]ggrieved person' \" as \"a person aggrieved by a decision of a board,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating further that \"[i]n the case of a decision by\n   <em>\n    a zoning commission, planning commission, combined planning and zoning commission or zoning board of appeals\n   </em>\n   , 'aggrieved person' includes any person owning land in this state that abuts or is within a radius of one\n   hundred feet of any portion of the land involved in the decision of the board.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Moving beyond the definitions, \u00a7 8-8(b) then provides in relevant part: \"Except as provided in subsections (c), (d) and (r) of this section\n   <em>\n    and sections 7-147 and 7-147i\n   </em>\n   , any person aggrieved by any decision of a board, including a decision to approve or deny a site plan pursuant to subsection (g) of section 8-3 or a special permit or special exception pursuant to section 8-3c, may take an appeal to the superior court for the judicial district in which the municipality is located ....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Read together, we conclude that \u00a7\u00a7 7-147i and 8-8 do not provide for statutory aggrievement in historic district commission appeals. Even if we assume that the reference to \"procedure\" in \u00a7 7-147i incorporates by reference the aggrievement provisions of \u00a7 8-8(a), the plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7 8-8(a)(1) only confers statutory aggrievement with respect to decisions of a limited array of land use agencies, namely, \"a zoning commission, planning commission, combined planning and zoning commission or zoning board of appeals ....\" Reading this enumeration of land use agencies to include historic district commissions would contravene the \"doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius-the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another-[under which] we presume that when the legislature expresses items as part of a group or series, an item that was not included was deliberately excluded.\"\n   <em>\n    DeNunzio\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeNunzio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20178\">\n    320 Conn. 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 194,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20901\">\n    128 A.3d 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).

This presumption is particularly apt in this case, given that \u00a7 7-147i, first enacted in 1961; see Public Acts 1961, No. 430, \u00a7 11; predated the statutory aggrievement provisions in \u00a7 8-8, which were first enacted in 1967, broadened in 1977, and reorganized in 1989. See Public Acts 1989, No. 89-356, \u00a7 1; Public Acts 1977, No. 77-470; Public Acts 1967, No. 712. The legislature's awareness of the historic district commission legislation is more than presumptive in this context, given that \u00a7 8-8(b) expressly refers to \u00a7 7-147i in carving out certain exceptions to the land use appeals procedure, in particular the appeal period and service of process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Indeed, looking beyond \u00a7 8-8(a)(1), related statutes affecting land use appeals demonstrate that, if the legislature wanted to create statutory aggrievement in historic district cases, \"it could have done so expressly.\"\n   <em>\n    Dept. of Public Safety\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State Board of Labor Relations\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086302\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/296/594/#p605\">\n    296 Conn. at 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=996%20A.2d%20729\">\n    996 A.2d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As indicated previously, the \"fundamental test for determining [classical] aggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: [F]irst, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific, personal and legal interest in [the challenged action], as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the [challenged action]. ...

The plaintiffs also claim that they were aggrieved by \"gross procedural defects\" during the proceedings before the commission, such as defective notice of hearings and the commission's failure to follow its own procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In response, the commission argues, inter alia, that there was no evidence of classical aggrievement because the record established only the mere proximity of the plaintiffs' home to the applicants' property, which is insufficient as a matter of law.

The commission also argues that the plaintiffs' claims of damage to their property value are founded only on the hearsay statements of unnamed professionals, cited in Robert Mayer's statements before the commission.

Finally, the commission contends that the plaintiffs' allegations of procedural defects, including defective notice of the public hearing, do not establish classical aggrievement.

First, the plaintiffs alleged that, during the September 18, 2012 hearing before the commission, the applicants presented material with respect\n   to the modification to the barn, and two proposals for the rear addition; the commission then advised the applicants that it \"could not approve multiple requests for the same application.\"\n   The plaintiffs then alleged that the commission heard objections and received evidence with respect to the new application, including that: (1) the applicants violated the commission's procedural rules by submitting a third application within the same year with respect to the same building \"already acted on by the [c]ommission without a significant change in circumstances\"; (2) the applicants had failed to provide adequate supporting materials for the application; and (3) \"any argument that [the commission] did not have jurisdiction regarding the [ninety year old] historic barn was invalid since at least one side of the building was admitted to be in the view of the public.\" The plaintiffs also alleged that the commission improperly handled the second part of the application, concerning the addition itself, which the applicants then withdrew on the advice of the commission. The plaintiffs then claimed that, after the hearing was continued to October 16, 2012, the commission improperly disregarded evidence supporting its jurisdiction over the barn and the violation of its own procedures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs also claimed that these procedural errors constituted a due process violation. Ultimately, the plaintiffs claimed that the commission acted illegally and abused its discretion when it improperly determined that the applicants' proposed \" '[p]otemkin-style' \" facade \"met the spirit of [its] design criteria and that [it] had 'no jurisdiction' regarding the proposed alteration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Having reviewed the facts pleaded in relation to the second appeal, there is no allegation that the alteration of the barn to create a new facade harmed any legal interest of the plaintiffs. Although the plaintiffs allege\n   that the alteration of the barn would facilitate the construction of an addition that is beyond the historic character of the district, they do not in any way claim that this alteration would harm the plaintiffs' interest in their property. Moreover, to the extent that the plaintiffs rely on the procedural irregularities and public notice issues caused by the deficient allegations, there is no factual allegation demonstrating how those procedural deficiencies adversely affected the plaintiffs. In the absence of a basis for statutory aggrievement, such public notice deficiencies, as noted previously, even if they cause the loss of an opportunity to be heard, do not by themselves confer a basis for classical aggrievement.

After arguing that the \"[nine] foot reduction in the existing barn which is currently an [eighteen] foot by [thirteen] foot building ... does not appear to meet the spirit of a barn renovation,\" Robert Mayer emphasized his admiration for the barn, and argued that its alteration would be \"totally against what the [Mystic River] [h]istoric [d]istrict stands for ....\" Robert Mayer argued that the alterations to the barn were proposed by the applicants \"to get around the appeal that we are going to be making to Superior Court\" from the zoning commission's separate decision to grant a variance with respect to the lot area, the lack of which would have required the applicants to reduce the size of the planned addition. Robert Mayer then asked the commission to condition any reduction in the size of the historic barn on \"the understanding that it cannot be merely to reduce the size of the barn for the purpose of gaining additional [floor area ratio].

What's happening with the barn is going to block our view from the dining room so that pretty much finishes all of our unobstructed views in our home.
