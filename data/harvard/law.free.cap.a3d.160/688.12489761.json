We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The relevant facts follow. Regina Willeke is the maternal great-grandmother of the child. Eric Willeke is the child's maternal step-great-grandfather. The Willekes' petition alleges that the child lived with the petitioners for most of her life. They were her guardians until November 12, 2015, and they sought great-grandparent visitation rights on September 22, 2015. Tyler Wyman, the child's father, responded to the petition, arguing that New Hampshire law does not confer upon great-grandparents standing to seek visitation. The trial court construed the answer as a motion to dismiss, to which the petitioners objected. In their objection, the petitioners argued that they have a common-law right to seek visitation with the child and, alternatively, that RSA 461-A:13 (Supp. 2016) should be interpreted as conferring upon great-grandparents standing to petition for visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, concluding \"that the words of [RSA 461-A:13 ] are not ambiguous and are intended to afford rights to grandparents only.\" The trial court did not address the petitioners' common-law claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, the petitioners do not argue that the trial court erred in interpreting RSA 461-A:13. Instead, they argue only that they have common-law standing, independent of RSA 461-A:13, to request that the trial court exercise its\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   power to grant them visitation with the child. In the petitioners' view, the common-law right to seek visitation survived the 1991 amendment of RSA 458:17, VI (1983 &amp; Supp. 1991) (amended 2003) (repealed 2005) and the enactment of RSA 458:17-d (1992) (amended 1993, 2004) (repealed 2005), which were succeeded by RSA 461-A:6, V (Supp. 2016) and RSA 461-A:13 respectively,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Laws 2005, 273:1, :20. Thus, the petitioners conclude that the trial court's failure to \"consider the availability\" of its\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   power to order great-grandparent visitation was error. They also argue that the principles of\n   <em>\n    Troxel v.

The statutes altered the common law in four respects. First, the legislature circumscribed the class of people who could petition for visitation. When it amended RSA 458:17, VI in 1991, the legislature permitted only grandparents and stepparents to seek visitation. Laws 1991, 93:1. By contrast, the common law conferred standing to seek visitation upon anyone with whom a child had formed a close extra-parental relationship.\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4408169\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/126/388/#p390\">\n    126 N.H. at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=493%20A.2d%20478\">\n    493 A.2d 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, RSA 458:17-d changed the manner in which courts decide whether to grant grandparent visitation. The statute required courts to consider the factors that, in\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   , we only suggested, but did not require, that they consider.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RSA 458:17-d, II (listing factors suggested in\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   );\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4408169\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/126/388/#p390\">\n    126 N.H. at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=493%20A.2d%20478\">\n    493 A.2d 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It also added two factors that courts must consider.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RSA 458:17-d, II (requiring courts to also address a guardian ad litem's recommendation and whether visitation would interfere with parent's authority over child or with parent-child relationship);\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4408169\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/126/388/#p390\">\n    126 N.H. at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=493%20A.2d%20478\">\n    493 A.2d 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, RSA 458:17-d added the significant caveat that no visitation would be permitted if the grandparent's access to the child had been \"restricted for any reason\" prior to the triggering condition. RSA 458:17-d, I. Finally, the statute dictated where the petition should be filed and allocated the costs of the petition. RSA 458:17-d, III, VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Accordingly, we now hold that the common-law right to petition for visitation was superseded by the enactment of RSA 458:17, VI, as amended in 1991, and RSA 458:17-d because the legislature revised the entire subject of visitation, and the statutes were clearly designed as substitutes for the common law. The legislature preserved that statutory scheme when it enacted RSA 461-A:6, V and RSA 461-A:13. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not err when it did not consider its\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   power as a basis to order great-grandparent visitation. Thus, we affirm the trial court's dismissal of the great-grandparents' petition for visitation for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, any issues raised in the notice of appeal, but not briefed, are deemed waived.\n   <em>\n    See Town of Barrington v.
