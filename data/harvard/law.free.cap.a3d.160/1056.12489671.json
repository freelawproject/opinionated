The petitioner, the Commissioner of Children and Families, asserts that the department was not required to continue providing reunification efforts to the respondent because the trial court granted custody and guardianship to the father. We affirm the judgment\n   of the Appellate Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following facts and procedural history that are relevant to this appeal. \"In the neglect petition, the petitioner alleged, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 (6), that Natalie was being denied proper care and attention,\n   physically, educationally, emotionally, or morally, and was being permitted to live under conditions, circumstances or associations injurious to her well-being. ... [The neglect petition, identified the father] as John Doe [and indicated that his] whereabouts were unknown. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"[Thereafter, the father] appeared. He identified himself ... was appointed counsel, advised, and a pro forma plea was entered. [On the basis of results from] paternity tests ordered by the court, [the father] was adjudicated [to be Natalie's biological father] on July 14, 2015, and a judgment of paternity entered. On August 17, 2015, he moved the court to vacate [a previous order of temporary custody] and transfer guardianship and custody of Natalie to him. The motion was continued and consolidated with the neglect trial. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[At the neglect trial, the petitioner and the respondent presented witnesses and exhibits.] The father introduced one exhibit and testified.\" (Footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re Natalie S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485150\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/824/#p607\">\n    165 Conn.App. 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 607-609,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485150\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/824/#p607\">\n    139 A.3d 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). \"[The trial court subsequently determined that the respondent had] failed to demonstrate that she is now or [could] in the reasonably foreseeable future be a consistent, stable, sober caregiver to Natalie, able to meet her daily and emergency needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The father was noncustodial at the time of Natalie's removal by [the department]. [The respondent] purposefully concealed and kept her and Natalie's whereabouts from being made known to him. At a ... meeting with [the department on] or about April 28, 2015, [the respondent] identified the father for the first time as the putative father of Natalie. After being noticed, the father appeared in [Connecticut] on or prior to May 27, 2015. Prior to May 2015, he had not seen Natalie since she was a few months old. His absence\n   in her life is due solely to [the respondent's] efforts to keep Natalie's whereabouts unknown to him. She knew he was Natalie's father. He was prevented from coming forward earlier and providing support for Natalie and presenting himself as a resource for her. He approached [the department] contending he was Natalie's biological father. He provided [the department] with a copy of the results of a paternity test done on July 1, 2013 in [North Carolina]. He has been fully cooperative with [the department] in every respect since then. No specific steps were issued for the father. [The department] did not recommend any services for him. [The department] could not identify any areas for services which he [needs]. He has been very responsive and fully cooperative with all requests made of him by [the department].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The father recognizes the need and desires to keep [the respondent] involved in Natalie's life.

He continues to reside in [North Carolina] with his [parents]. [A social worker from the department, Rodney Moore] flew to [North Carolina] on October 15, 2015, to interview [the father's] parents and inspect their home. His parents are his support system. They are\n   committed to helping him care for Natalie. A records check by [the department] into the background of the paternal grandparents revealed no concerns. Their home is a big single-family house situated on a large property. It is childproofed, there is a bedroom fully furnished with a bed already set up for Natalie's sole use, lots of toys, clothing, and pictures. It is a safe, nurturing, and appropriate residence for Natalie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The father served ... as a parachute rigger in the 82nd Airborne Division [of the United States Army] and was honorably discharged. A background check by [the\n   department] disclosed no criminal or domestic violence history for the father. Substance abuse test results for the father were all negative. [The respondent's] unsubstantiated allegation that he abused illegal and prescription drugs is given no weight by this court. He previously worked as a commercial scuba diver and with the Boy Scouts of America. He currently works with youth groups within his church. He is employed full-time as a horse farm manager. He earns about $20,000 a year. He has ... health insurance. It is available for Natalie should she be in his care. Since May 2015, he has travelled regularly on weekends from [North Carolina] to [Connecticut] to visit Natalie. He has driven to [Connecticut] at his expense.

The [father] was noncustodial at the time of the neglect. He was without knowledge or information as to the existence of the neglect and was [wilfully] prevented by [the respondent] from acquiring such knowledge. [The department] made reasonable efforts to reunite Natalie with both [the respondent and the father]. It is not in [Natalie's] best interest to be committed to the care and custody of [the department]. [A] [c]ause for [the] commitment of Natalie ... to [the department] has not been proven to exist. The [father] is a worthy, suitable and appropriate person to be granted custody and guardianship of Natalie .... It is in [Natalie's] best interest for the [father] to be granted temporary custody and guardianship of her.\" As a result, the\n   trial court adjudicated Natalie neglected, vacated the order of temporary custody to the department, and granted \"temporary/nonpermanent custody and guardianship\" to the father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Thereafter, the respondent appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court. In that appeal, the respondent claimed that: (1) the department was required to continue efforts to reunify Natalie with her, and that the trial court incorrectly failed to order final specific steps or that the department make such additional reunification efforts; and (2) the trial court incorrectly failed to require the department to conduct further investigation into the father's fitness before granting custody and guardianship of Natalie to him and in permitting him to remove her to North Carolina.\n   <em>\n    In re Natalie S.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485150\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/824/#p607\">\n    165 Conn.App. at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485150\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/824/#p607\">\n    139 A.3d 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court concluded that the trial court did not incorrectly fail to order the department to make additional reunification efforts because \"[t]he court's disposition in the present case awarding custody and guardianship to the father deprived it of continuing jurisdiction over the respondent's possible future reunification with Natalie and thus required the cessation of\n   such reunification efforts.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485150\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/824/#p607\">\n    Id., at 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485150\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/824/#p607\">\n    139 A.3d 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the Appellate Court also concluded that \"[o]n the basis of the [trial court's factual findings regarding the father's fitness], which the respondent does not claim were clearly erroneous, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred in declining to enter orders placing conditions on Natalie's placement with the father pursuant to its authority ....\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485150\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/824/#p607\">\n    Id., at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485150\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/824/#p607\">\n    139 A.3d 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thereafter, the respondent filed a petition for certification to appeal, which this court granted, limited to the following issue: \"Did the Appellate Court correctly determine that continuing reunification efforts for the respondent ... were not required because temporary guardianship had been placed with the father?\"\n   <em>\n    In re Natalie S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484948,12484949\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/321/928/\">\n    321 Conn. 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484946,12484947,12484948,12484949\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/287/\">\n    138 A.3d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court was required to order the department to continue reunification efforts despite awarding custody and guardianship to the father.

This case presents a question of statutory construction, an issue of law over which we exercise plenary review.\n   <em>\n    Cales\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Office of Victim Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%20697\">\n    319 Conn. 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 701,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20A.3d%20154\">\n    127 A.3d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). In determining the meaning of a statute, we look first to the text of the statute and its relationship to other statutes. General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z. If the text of the statute is not plain and unambiguous, we may consider extra-textual sources of information such as the statute's \"legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and [common-law] principles governing the same general subject matter ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Boy Scouts of America Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487766\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/104/#p332\">\n    323 Conn. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487766\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/104/#p332\">\n    147 A.3d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Our fundamental objective is to ascertain the legislature's intent.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487766\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/104/#p332\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Chestnut Point Realty, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    East Windsor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489035\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/636/#p533\">\n    324 Conn. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 533,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489035\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/636/#p533\">\n    153 A.3d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We begin by examining the statutory text. Section 17a-111b (a) provides as follows: \"The Commissioner\n   of Children and Families shall make reasonable efforts to reunify a parent with a child unless the court (1) determines that such efforts are not required pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or subsection (j) of section 17a-112, or (2) has approved a permanency plan other than reunification pursuant to subsection (k) of section 46b-129.\" The respondent asserts that the plain language of the statute required that the department provide reunification efforts with her because the trial court neither determined that such efforts were not required pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 nor had it approved a permanency plan pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (k). The department counters that the plain language of \u00a7 17a-111b (a), when considered in light of the other relevant statutes, does not require reunification efforts with the respondent in the present case because custody and guardianship was awarded to the other parent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plain language of \u00a7 17a-111b (a) provides that the department is required to make reasonable efforts to reunify the child with one parent. Specifically, \u00a7 17a-111b (a) provides that the department \"shall make reasonable efforts to reunify\n   <em>\n    a parent\n   </em>\n   with a child\" unless certain conditions are met. (Emphasis added.) By employing this language, the legislature demonstrated that the department is required to make efforts to reunify a child with one of his or her parents. The fact that the legislature chose to use the singular form indicates that it intended reunification efforts toward one parent would satisfy the requirements of the statute and that, if reunification was accomplished with one parent, further reunification efforts would not be required. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    McCullough\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Swan Engraving, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20299\">\n    320 Conn. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 308,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20231\">\n    130 A.3d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (\"[t]he fact that the legislature chose to use the singular form of notice of claim in this provision indicates\n   that it intended that a singular notice of [a worker's compensation]\n   claim would satisfy the requirements of the statute and that further claims would not require additional notice\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Furthermore, \u00a7 17a-111b (a) must be read consistently with the statutory scheme of which it is a part. \"It is axiomatic that, when interpreting the terms of one statute, we are guided by the principle that the legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law .... Legislation never is written on a clean slate, nor is it ever read in isolation or applied in a vacuum. Every new act takes its place as a component of an extensive and elaborate system of written laws. ... Construing statutes by reference to others advances [the values of harmony and consistency within the law]. In fact, courts have been said to be under a duty to construe statutes harmoniously where that can reasonably be done. ... Moreover, statutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Agron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487868\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1052/#p638\">\n    323 Conn. 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 638,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487868\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1052/#p638\">\n    148 A.3d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As this court has repeatedly recognized, \"[a] neglect petition and concomitant request for an order of commitment are not a typical civil action. A neglect petition is sui generis and, unlike a complaint and answer in the usual civil case, does not lead to a judgment for or against the parties named. ... In such proceedings, the petitioner acts not to vindicate her personal rights but, acting for the state as parens patriae, to ensure, first and foremost, the child's safety and, second, a permanent placement of the child as expeditiously as possible. ... The petitioner does not seek the monetary or equitable relief of a typical civil action, but, rather, actions by the court that will further the dual goals of safety and permanency.\" (Citations omitted;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re Allison G.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3991137\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/276/146/#p158\">\n    276 Conn. 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158-59,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=883%20A.2d%201226\">\n    883 A.2d 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This court has also explained that \"[t]he adjudication and findings also have significance in that,\n   <em>\n    if they result in an order of commitment\n   </em>\n   , they also trigger a requirement that the court issue specific steps for reunification. ... Although the specific steps provide a benchmark by which the court measures whether either reunification or termination of parental rights is appropriate, the court necessarily will consider the underlying adjudication and the attendant findings.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis added.)

Specifically, \u00a7 46b-129 (j) (2) provides in relevant part that \"[u]pon finding and adjudging that any child or youth is uncared for, neglected or abused the court may ... (B) vest such child's or youth's legal guardianship ... with any other person or persons found to be suitable and worthy of such responsibility by the court, including, but not limited to, any relative of such child or youth by blood or marriage ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute does\n   not provide for continuing\n   involvement by the department when guardianship is placed with a third party. Indeed, it is important to note that in \u00a7 46b-129 (j) (2) (D), the legislature clearly provided that the court can order continued involvement by the department in some situations. Specifically, \u00a7 46b-129 (j) (2) provides \"[u]pon finding and adjudging that any child or youth is uncared for, neglected or abused the court may ... (D) place the child or youth in the custody of the parent or guardian with protective supervision by the Commissioner of Children and Families subject to conditions established by the court.\" The fact that the legislature did not include such language in the provision regarding legal guardianship further supports our understanding that the department's involvement ends when legal guardianship is placed with a third party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the present case, it is undisputed that the court issued temporary specific steps to the respondent pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 (c) at the initial hearing, and that the department provided reunification services to her through the hearing on the neglect petition.\n   <em>\n    In re Natalie S.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485150\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/824/#p607\">\n    165 Conn.App. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   619 n.12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485150\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/824/#p607\">\n    139 A.3d 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the hearing, the respondent did not seek either custody or guardianship of Natalie, presumably because she recognized that she was not then, and might not ever become, a suitable candidate for those responsibilities.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485150\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/824/#p607\">\n    Id., at 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485150\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/824/#p607\">\n    139 A.3d 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n.13.

Although the trial court used the phrase \"temporary/nonpermanent custody and guardianship,\" we conclude that the trial court's decision not to order continuing supervision is controlling and demonstrates the trial court's recognition that the state's involvement in Natalie's life would cease. Accordingly, we conclude that the petitioner's involvement with Natalie has ceased, the case was closed, and the department was not required to continue providing reunification efforts to the respondent once guardianship was transferred to the father.
