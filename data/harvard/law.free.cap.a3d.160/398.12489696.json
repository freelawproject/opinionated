Because the court should have dismissed the untimely petition, rather than having denied it, we reverse the judgment of the trial court only as to the form of the judgment and remand with direction to dismiss the petition for new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history.

petitioner filed the underlying petition for a new trial pursuant to \u00a7 52-270. On December 30, 2013, the petitioner\n   amended his petition. The amended petition asserted that the state had engaged in \"sham negotiations or a false promise of compromise\" that was \"intended to induce the petitioner to surrender his right to a hearing on his motion to suppress the in and out of court identification of the petitioner as the perpetrator ....\" The petitioner also alleged that the state had solicited and offered \"perjured, false or misleading testimony\" from its principal identification witness and that, but for those actions, he would have prevailed on his motion to suppress, and the results of his criminal trial would have been different, including a possible dismissal of all charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The respondent, the State of Connecticut, answered the petition for new trial, asserting by special defense that the petitioner was not entitled to relief because the petition had been filed more than three years after judgment was rendered and, thus, was barred by \u00a7 52-582(a), the applicable statute of limitations. In response, the petitioner asserted that although the governing statute of limitations admittedly had expired, the court was not bound to apply the statute of limitations, and could exercise its equitable powers to consider and ultimately grant his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court held a hearing on the petition for new trial on January 8, 2014. At that time, the court,\n   <em>\n    Mullarkey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , indicated to the parties that it was concerned that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain an untimely petition. The respondent took the position that the petitioner's failure to file his petition within the applicable limitations period did not implicate the court's jurisdiction,\n   but only provided the respondent with an affirmative defense, which it had pleaded. The court indicated that it would need to decide the jurisdictional issue first.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court nevertheless proceeded to hear evidence on the merits of the petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties later submitted posttrial briefs. The petitioner's posttrial brief addressed the court's jurisdictional concern in a footnote, in which he again acknowledged that the governing statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 52-582(a) had expired prior to his filing the petition, but argued that the court nevertheless had jurisdiction to consider its merits. According to the petitioner, \"[i]n an equitable proceeding, a court may provide a remedy even though\n   the governing statute of limitations has expired, just as it has discretion to dismiss for laches an action initiated within the period of\n   the statute.\n   <em>\n    Dunham\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dunham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"501648\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/204/303/#p326\">\n    204 Conn. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 326-27, [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=528%20A.2d%201123\">\n    528 A.2d 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] (1987).\" In its posttrial brief, the respondent maintained its position that the petition was time barred, and argued that the petitioner had failed to establish that the limitations period should be tolled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 14, 2014, the court rendered a judgment denying the petition for new trial on statute of limitations grounds. The court determined that, for purposes of \u00a7 52-582, \"the rendition of the judgment\" had occurred on October 10, 1997, when the petitioner was sentenced in the underlying criminal matter. See\n   <em>\n    Holliday\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060109\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/111/656/#p663\">\n    111 Conn.App. 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 663,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=960%20A.2d%201101\">\n    960 A.2d 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5763944,5763684,5764775\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/902/\">\n    291 Conn. 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=967%20A.2d%20112\">\n    967 A.2d 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). The court also found that the petitioner did not file his petition for new trial until August, 2012, nearly fifteen years after sentencing and, thus, well beyond the three year limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rather than disposing of the petition for new trial solely on the basis of the uncontested fact that the petitioner had not filed it within the three year statute of limitations, the trial court indicated as part of its rationale for denying the petition that the petitioner had failed to provide the court with any explanation that would have justified a late petition. The court stated that even if it had equitable authority to consider a late petition, it lacked any evidentiary basis to do so in this case. The court suggested that it was the petitioner's burden to show that some injustice had prevented the petitioner from filing the petition before the statute of limitations had run. The court concluded that, taking into account the nature of the petitioner's claim, it could find \"nothing that would have prevented the petitioner from pursuing it within the limitation period.\" As previously noted, the court explicitly stated that the petitioner was \"not alleging fraudulent concealment, or any other impropriety, that would have caused him any delay in raising the claim.\" The court denied the petition for new trial and, subsequently, granted the petitioner certification to file an appeal in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 54-95(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The petitioner's sole claim on appeal is that the court abused its discretion in determining that his petition for new trial was barred by the relevant statute of limitations, arguing that, in the interest of justice, a trial court in equitable proceedings is not obligated to adhere to a statute of limitations. Inherent in the petitioner's claim is a presumption that the limitations period set forth in \u00a7 52-582 was not jurisdictional in nature and that the court had the authority to consider and apply principles\n   of equitable tolling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The respondent counters that the trial court lacked any discretion regarding whether to apply the statute of limitations and argues in the alternative that, even if it had such discretion, it properly declined to exercise it in this case. We agree with the respondent that the trial court lacked discretion to consider a petition that was filed outside the limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Our Supreme Court has made clear that a court lacks the authority to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling or otherwise exercise discretionary authority to extend a limitations period if the applicable statute of limitations constitutes a limit on the court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"963525\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/257/258/#p269\">\n    257 Conn. 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=777%20A.2d%20645\">\n    777 A.2d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). No appellate court explicitly has determined whether a failure to comply with the three year limitations period in \u00a7 52-582 may be excused or whether strict compliance with the limitations period is necessary to invoke the court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the limitations period in \u00a7 52-582 was intended by the legislature as an outright limit on the court's jurisdiction to entertain a late petition for new trial, the petitioner's admission that he failed to comply with the\n   statutory time requirement would be determinative of his appellate claim because, in such a situation, the trial court would have lacked\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   discretion to consider the merits of the petition. Because the respondent has advanced this argument on appeal, we must address it before we can turn to the petitioner's abuse of discretion claim.

In this situation, the court may properly raise the statute of limitations issue on its own motion because it is considered substantive or jurisdictional, and not subject to waiver.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Orticelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"695367\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/197/9/#p15\">\n    197 Conn. 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=495%20A.2d%201023\">\n    495 A.2d 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although, in the present case, the limitations period for a petition for new trial is not contained in \u00a7 52-270, the statute creating that right of action, we are unconvinced that this is a decisive factor in deciding the issue before us. Whether the statute creating the cause of action also contains the limitation period is but one factor to be considered in divining the legislative intent. Our Supreme Court recently has suggested that in ascertaining whether the legislature intended a limitation period to be jurisdictional, it is more instructive to observe whether the limitation period is a condition imposed on a statutorily created right of action or, conversely, an action that existed under the common law. \"The former generally is deemed to be jurisdictional, whereas the latter is not.\"\n   <em>\n    Neighborhood Assn., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Limberger\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=321%20Conn.%2029\">\n    321 Conn. at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%20581\">\n    136 A.3d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the limitation period is a condition precedent to filing a petition for new trial, a statutorily created action. Although that limitation period is not contained in the statute creating the right of action, that factor is simply insufficient to sway our overall analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Having considered the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes, we are convinced that the legislature intended the three year limitations period set forth in \u00a7 52-582 to be a jurisdictional bar. The petitioner concedes that the underlying petition was filed more than three years after he was sentenced in the underlying criminal action. Because the petition was not timely, and the statutory exception for newly discovered DNA evidence was inapplicable, the court was without subject matter jurisdiction to consider the merits of the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Having determined that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the petition for new trial, we conclude that the court should have dismissed rather than denied the petition.

At approximately 11 p.m. that night, Darius Powell, Kendrick Hampton, Lewis and Woods were together in front of Lewis' house. Blanchard Baisden, also known as 'Weedy,' Armando Colon, also known as 'Mondo,' and Lillian Williams also were standing nearby at that time. [The petitioner] and [his brother] Charles Turner drove down the street in a tan Oldsmobile. Shortly thereafter, Charles Turner, now alone in the car, drove back up Homestead Avenue. Charles Turner parked the car at the corner of Homestead Avenue and Edgewood Street, across the street from where Woods and his friends were standing. He then exited the car and began 'dancing around.' As Powell, Hampton and Woods watched Charles Turner, [the petitioner], wearing a mask and dark clothing, approached the group and shot at Woods with a handgun. The first two shots hit Woods in the leg, and three of the following six shots struck him in the hip. During the attack, Woods shouted 'Boku shot me. Boku did it.' 'Boku' is [the petitioner's] street name. Powell and Hampton, who were familiar with [the petitioner] from the neighborhood, recognized him as the assailant. After the shooting, [the petitioner] escaped through the yards behind the apartment building. Charles Turner, who had jumped back into the tan Oldsmobile when the shooting began, drove down Homestead Avenue and picked up [the petitioner] four houses away. Woods later died at the hospital from the gunshot wounds.\"\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Turner\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546616\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/252/714/\">\n     252 Conn. 714\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 717-18,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=751%20A.2d%20372\">\n     751 A.2d 372\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2000).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The relevant colloquy was as follows:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    \"The Court: Now, do we have any other motions from the state as far as the court's jurisdiction in this matter?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    \"[The Respondent]: No, Your Honor.

The court acknowledged this in its memorandum denying the petition.
