The petitioner claims that the court (1) abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal and (2) improperly concluded that his trial counsel did not provide ineffective assistance and that his claim of prosecutorial impropriety was procedurally defaulted. Because the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal, we dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following factual and procedural history is relevant to this appeal. In March, 2001, the petitioner, a crack cocaine addict, lived with his girlfriend, Sherry Krick, in her apartment in a condominium complex in Middletown. Richmond L. Perry, a crack cocaine dealer, lived in the same condominium complex. The petitioner\n   knew Perry and often acted as a \"runner,\" or intermediary, for him in his drug dealing business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the afternoon of March 28, 2001, at approximately 2 p.m., the petitioner asked his neighbor, Charles Smith, if he could borrow money, promising to pay the money back after he went on \"a mission.\" Later that evening, at about 8 p.m., the petitioner and Perry drove to Mike's Package Store in Middlefield. While in the store, an argument ensued between the petitioner, Perry, and the owner of the store, Edmund Caruso. As the argument escalated, Perry drew a nine millimeter firearm. In response, Caruso grabbed his tear gas canister and sprayed it at Perry and the petitioner. Perry then shot Caruso several times, and Caruso subsequently died as a result of his wounds. Following the shooting, the petitioner and Perry fled from the scene with the package store's cash register.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When they returned to their condominium complex, Perry first went home to change his clothing, which was covered in tear gas, and to shower. After showering, the petitioner and Perry wrapped the register in the petitioner's blanket and carried it into his and Krick's apartment, where the petitioner used a screwdriver to open it. The petitioner and Perry divided the proceeds from the register and then hid it behind the bedroom dresser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   That same evening, the petitioner and Perry offered to sell Smith the firearm that they used in the robbery, but he declined to purchase it. The petitioner subsequently arranged to sell the firearm to Juan Cruz, another crack cocaine dealer with whom he was associated. On March 31, 2001, the petitioner and Perry met with Cruz and sold him the firearm, assuring him that it was \"clean,\" i.e., not associated with any crimes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the days following the robbery, the petitioner spoke to Smith about the result of his \"mission.\" Two or three days after the robbery, Smith visited Krick's apartment. The petitioner showed Smith the register behind the bedroom dresser and told him that \"it was from his mission, but he had to get rid of it.\" Sometime thereafter, Smith saw the petitioner throw the register into the dumpster outside the condominium complex. The petitioner later told Smith that \"things went bad when he went to do that mission. Things went bad. The old man got killed. No one meant for the old man to get killed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the course of the investigation of the robbery, the petitioner made several written and oral statements to the police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner admitted to knowing\n   details about the robbery, but he insisted that Perry committed the robbery and murder and told him about it afterward. Nevertheless, the petitioner acknowledged that Perry came to Krick's apartment with the register after the robbery. He also admitted that he (1) broke open the register with his screwdriver, (2) shared the cash proceeds from the register with Perry, (3) hid the register behind the dresser in his and Krick's bedroom, (4) disposed of the register in a dumpster outside of his and Krick's apartment, and (5) facilitated and participated in the sale to Cruz of the firearm used during the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, the petitioner was charged with felony murder, murder, robbery in the first degree, larceny in the fifth degree, and conspiracy to commit robbery in\n   the first degree. While incarcerated and awaiting trial, the petitioner made statements to two inmates in which he admitted to participating in the robbery with Perry and described what happened during and after the robbery. To one of these inmates, who was the petitioner's friend and former roommate, the petitioner further expressed his concern that his alibi witnesses, Krick and a \"married guy,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   were not corroborating his story about being home the evening of the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After a trial, the jury found the petitioner guilty of felony murder, larceny in the fifth degree, and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree. The jury found him not guilty, however, of murder and robbery in the first degree, which were the only counts in which the petitioner was charged with personally possessing the firearm or shooting the victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arroyo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145506\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/558/#p561\">\n    292 Conn. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 561-62,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=973%20A.2d%201254\">\n    973 A.2d 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=559%20U.S.%20911\">\n    559 U.S. 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20S.%20Ct.%201296\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=175%20L.%20Ed.%202d%201086\">\n    175 L.Ed.2d 1086\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). The court thereafter rendered judgment accordingly and sentenced the petitioner to a total effective term of sixty years imprisonment. The petitioner's conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. Id., at 561,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=973%20A.2d%201254\">\n    973 A.2d 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The petitioner initiated this habeas action on April 8, 2010. On March 13, 2013, the petitioner filed a six count amended petition. Relevant to this appeal, the petitioner claimed that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not (1) offering Perry's plea hearing transcript as an exhibit; (2) presenting the testimony of an expert witness; and (3) offering \"a depiction of the floor plan and/or physical layout\" of Krick's apartment. Additionally, the petitioner claimed that the prosecutor committed certain improprieties during her case-in-chief and closing argument by soliciting and utilizing Perry's false trial testimony concerning his plea agreement with the state. After a two day trial, the habeas court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus and the petition for certification to appeal. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The petitioner claims that the habeas court abused its discretion by denying his petition for certification to appeal and erred by denying his claims of ineffective\n   assistance of trial counsel and prosecutorial impropriety. We conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion by denying the petition for certification to appeal.\n   \"We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review and procedural hurdles that the petitioner must surmount to obtain appellate review of the merits of a habeas court's denial of the habeas petition following denial of certification to appeal.

Having set forth the standard of review, we will consider the merits of the claims raised by the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We begin by addressing the petitioner's two claims relating to Perry's plea agreement with the state. First, the petitioner claims that the habeas court erroneously concluded that trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance when he failed to offer Perry's plea hearing transcript as an exhibit. Second, the petitioner claims that the habeas court erroneously concluded that his prosecutorial impropriety claim was procedurally defaulted. That second claim was based on the prosecutor's alleged solicitation and use during the state's case-in-chief and closing argument of Perry's false testimony concerning his plea agreement. The petitioner contends that the procedural default was cured by good cause, namely, ineffective assistance of trial counsel in failing to raise a claim of prosecutorial impropriety at trial and\n   sentencing and in failing to preserve this issue for direct appeal. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to both of these claims. On January\n   21, 2003, Perry pleaded guilty to felony murder and robbery in the first degree. During her recitation of the factual basis for the guilty pleas, the prosecutor, who was also prosecuting the petitioner's case, did not indicate which of the two defendants the state believed committed the shooting; instead, she stated that \"Mr. Caruso was shot and killed by one of the participants in the robbery ... who was Mr. Perry or Mr. Arroyo.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After setting forth the factual basis for the pleas, the prosecutor explained that she had agreed to recommend a sentence of \"forty-five years to serve.\" She emphasized that \"our offer of forty-five years is predicated and based on [Perry's] agreement to testify in a truthful manner only regarding Mr. Arroyo's participation in the robbery ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During the court's canvass, Perry repeatedly confirmed that he understood that the recommended sentence of forty-five years was contingent on his truthful testimony at the petitioner's criminal trial. After the court accepted Perry's guilty pleas, Perry's counsel asked the prosecutor to clarify what the state's definition of truthful was, and the court asked the prosecutor whether Perry's last statement\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"was essentially the truth.\" The prosecutor agreed that the last statement\n   was \"essentially the truth,\" and then she further clarified: \"The state's understanding of the truth is that Mr. Perry participated in the robbery, which led to the death of Mr. Caruso, in conjunction of Mr. Arroyo.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On December 1 and 2, 2004, Perry testified at the petitioner's criminal trial. During direct examination, Perry confirmed that the prosecutor was also prosecuting him for his involvement in the robbery and that although he had pleaded guilty to two offenses, he had not been sentenced. Perry also confirmed that he was going to receive a forty-five year sentence, that there was no chance that the state would recommend less than forty-five years, and that a condition of him receiving \"the forty-five year offer\" was not that he identify the petitioner as the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Trial counsel began his cross-examination by highlighting that although Perry pleaded guilty to felony murder and robbery in the first degree, he still had four pending charges against him-murder, conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, larceny in the fifth degree, and violation of probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trial counsel discussed with Perry the fact that his sentencing had been postponed until after his testimony in the petitioner's trial and that, unless he testified \"in a manner satisfactory to the state,\" he will not receive a forty-five year sentence. Perry disagreed with trial counsel's assertion that receiving a forty-five year sentence was contingent on his having testified at the petitioner's trial and insisted that forty-five years was \"going to be on the table no matter what.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Thereafter, trial counsel thoroughly and systematically reviewed with Perry the maximum term of imprisonment authorized\n   for each of the five crimes with which he was charged in connection with his involvement in the robbery. Trial counsel emphasized at the\n   beginning and end of this lengthy analysis that Perry's maximum sentencing exposure for all of these crimes was 185 years imprisonment. Trial counsel further observed that \"forty-five years would be only about a quarter of 185.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Beginning with this early exchange, a theme emerged over the course of trial counsel's lengthy cross-examination. Perry consistently maintained that there was no \"deal\" and that a forty-five year sentence was always \"on the table,\" and trial counsel repeatedly highlighted for the jury Perry's actual maximum sentencing exposure, the number of serious charges pending against him, and the fact that a sentence of forty-five years was contingent on Perry's testimony for the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   When, toward the end of trial counsel's cross-examination, Perry continued to\n   deny that he was receiving a \"deal,\" trial counsel observed that \"there was a discussion right out here in the public record, in the open court, about what you would have to do to get this sentence.\" Trial counsel then discussed with Perry the prosecutor's statements about his plea agreement at his guilty plea hearing while presenting Perry with and reading aloud from Perry's guilty plea hearing transcript.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trial counsel did not identify for the jury, however, the document he was showing Perry as Perry's\n   guilty plea hearing transcript, nor did trial counsel offer it as an exhibit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On redirect examination, the prosecutor asked Perry: \"Defense attorney asked you if you were getting forty-five years for your truthful cooperation,\" and Perry agreed. The prosecutor then asked Perry to confirm that the sentence was forty-five years and that there was \"[n]ot a possibility ... that I'm going to recommend any less of that sentence ... ?\" Perry agreed with the prosecutor's statements and then said: \"Forty-five years always been on the table. I could of seen if you came with forty-four years, I would have thought that was a deal. Common sense will tell you that forty-five, forty-five years has been on the table the whole time. That's not a deal.\" The prosecutor did not correct Perry's false assertion that there was no deal; she stated that she had no further questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   During summation, trial counsel and the prosecutor commented on Perry's plea agreement with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Trial counsel utilized Perry's staunch refusal \"to acknowledge he was getting any benefit at all\" or the extent of his participation in the robbery to demonstrate Perry's lack of credibility. In particular, trial counsel referred to how, when he presented Perry with the transcript from his plea hearing, in which the prosecutor indicated that he would be sentenced to forty-five years imprisonment for testifying truthfully against the petitioner, Perry continued to refuse to acknowledge the benefit he was receiving.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   During her rebuttal argument, the\n   prosecutor responded that an agreement to a sentence of forty-five years imprisonment was not much of a benefit in light of Perry's young age and the fact that he will have to spend the next forty-five years in prison with fellow inmates knowing that he testified against his codefendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   During its final charge to the jury, the court included a special credibility instruction concerning Perry's testimony. In relevant part, the court admonished the jury that it should \"carefully scrutinize the testimony of Richmond Perry\" and \"keep in mind that he may, in his own mind, be looking for or hoping for some favorable treatment in the sentence or disposition of his own case. And that therefore he may have such an interest in the outcome of this case that his testimony may have been colored by that fact. Therefore, then, you must look with particular care at the testimony of an accomplice and scrutinize it very carefully before you accept it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In his habeas petition, the petitioner alleged that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance when he failed to offer Perry's plea hearing transcript as an exhibit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Additionally, the petitioner claimed that the prosecutor committed certain improprieties during her case-in-chief and closing argument by soliciting and utilizing Perry's false testimony concerning the nature and existence of his plea agreement. In his return, the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, pleaded that the petitioner's claim of prosecutorial impropriety was procedurally defaulted because it was not raised before the trial court or on appeal. In his reply, the petitioner argued that \"[a]ny alleged procedural default is cured by good cause and prejudice,\" namely, ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At the habeas trial, the petitioner called his trial counsel as a witness. Trial counsel recalled that \"Perry insisted that forty-five [years] was on the table and that's always been on the table,\" and he agreed that Perry's testimony in that respect was inaccurate. Trial counsel further acknowledged that during cross-examination he used Perry's plea hearing transcript to refresh Perry's recollection but he did not offer it as an exhibit, even though he could have offered it as impeachment evidence or substantively as a\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   statement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trial counsel explained, however, that because he cross-examined Perry extensively on his truthfulness and Perry repeatedly admitted that he lied to the police in his written statements, \"[i]t got to the point where it was becoming tedious ... for the jury to even hear it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the habeas court rejected the petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance\n   of counsel and determined that his claim of prosecutorial impropriety was procedurally defaulted.

The petitioner admitted to the police that he (1) broke open the register with his screwdriver, (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   shared the cash proceeds from the register with Perry, (3) hid the register behind the dresser in his and Krick's bedroom, (4) disposed of the register in a\n   dumpster outside of his and Krick's apartment, and (5) facilitated and participated in the sale of the firearm used during the robbery to shoot the victim. Although the petitioner maintained in his statements to the police that he did not participate in the robbery, the petitioner admitted to Smith and two fellow inmates to being involved in the robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the state presented evidence that a jacket seized from the petitioner and Krick's apartment, which matched the description of the jacket the petitioner admitted to wearing on March 28, 2001, was contaminated with the active ingredient in the tear gas used by the victim to fight off his attackers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Perry, as an admitted participant in the robbery, was an important witness. Trial counsel's thorough and surgical cross-examination of Perry, however, made the jury abundantly aware of Perry's motive to lie and to implicate the petitioner in the robbery. Throughout the course of cross-examination, trial counsel reminded the jury of Perry's original charges, of the charges that remained pending against Perry, of Perry's maximum sentencing exposure for each of those charges as well as his total maximum sentencing exposure, and of the fact that Perry's sentencing had been postponed until after he testified against the petitioner. Trial counsel also reviewed Perry's prior inconsistent statements with him in detail, and Perry admitted on numerous occasions that he had lied to the police in all of his\n   written statements. Trial counsel further demonstrated that Perry's lies in his written statements were often designed either to establish that he was not present for the robbery or, when he became aware that physical evidence placed him in the midst of the robbery, to mitigate his role in the robbery by suggesting that he was present for the robbery by happenstance, not as an active participant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The petitioner argues that \"simply because [trial counsel] cross-examined Perry extensively regarding the plea deal does not mean that he was effective in showing that Perry was untruthful.\" We disagree. It is clear from the jury's verdict that the jury did not credit all of Perry's testimony. Perry insisted at trial that the petitioner shot the victim. Nevertheless, the jury found the petitioner not guilty of robbery in the first degree and murder, the only counts in which the petitioner was charged with either personally possessing the firearm used in the robbery or shooting the victim. See footnote 4 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Therefore, we conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the petitioner's petition for certification to appeal as to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that was based on trial counsel's failure to offer Perry's plea hearing transcript as an exhibit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The petitioner's second claim concerning Perry's plea agreement with the state is that the prosecutor committed certain improprieties when she (1) solicited false testimony from Perry on direct examination, (2) permitted Perry's false testimony to stand on cross-examination, and (3) \"made statements and suggested inferences to the jury that were false and in\n   which she emphasized Perry's false testimony.\" The petitioner claims that the habeas court erred when it concluded\n   that this claim was procedurally defaulted. The petitioner contends that he satisfied the cause and prejudice standard by proving that \"trial counsel's failure to raise the issue of prosecutorial [impropriety] at trial or at sentencing, and particularly by failing to mark Perry's plea hearing transcript as either a full trial exhibit or an exhibit for [identification] constituted ineffective assistance of counsel ....\" The respondent argues that because the habeas court rejected the petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the habeas court properly found that the petitioner failed to satisfy the cause and prejudice standard.

Hubball tested the chemical makeup of those droplets and determined that they contained traces of a chemical compound known as CS, which was the active ingredient in the tear gas canister found near the victim's body. Hubball testified that he believed that the droplets were the result of the chemical compound being sprayed directly onto the jacket and were not the result of a secondary transfer from another object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   At the habeas trial, the petitioner called Kamran Loghman, an expert on tear gas, and trial counsel as witnesses. Loghman did not dispute Hubball's finding that there was CS on the petitioner's jacket and agreed that CS was an active ingredient in the brand of tear gas found near the victim's body. Instead, Loghman opined that because of the physical and chemical properties of CS, it would not \"cause any kind of shape on any article of clothing\" and \"[i]t doesn't discolor fabrics.\" As a result, Loghman concluded that \"something else that got saturated and contaminated came into contact with this pullover [jacket] and passed on the tear gas.\" He acknowledged, however, that he could not determine when that secondary transfer occurred and that\n   the transfer could have happened inside the package store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Trial counsel testified that it was important to the defense to neutralize the tear gas evidence because it was the only physical evidence that placed the petitioner in the package store.

As a result, trial counsel made a reasonable tactical decision not to retain an expert witness for trial. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the habeas court erred in denying the petitioner's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The petitioner nevertheless contends that \"[t]he habeas court's findings regarding [trial counsel's] efforts were clearly erroneous\" because \"[trial counsel] never asked the critical question about secondary transfer\" when speaking to potential expert witnesses. Instead, the petitioner states that trial counsel erroneously \"focused on whether the marks were 'droplets or smears,' \" which Loghman testified was irrelevant because CS does not \"cause any kind of shape on any article of clothing\" and \"[i]t doesn't discolor fabrics.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As previously stated, however, trial counsel testified at the habeas trial that when speaking with experts on tear gas he asked the experts\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   whether the CS on the jacket was a smear or a droplet\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   \"what opinion we might get as to getting a contact transfer from a cash register.\" Although the petitioner's expert witness might contend that the issue of whether the stains were smears or droplets is a red herring, the critical aspect of trial counsel's testimony was that he asked experts about the secondary transfer theory. None of these experts was willing to give him a favorable opinion on that theory. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the habeas court's finding that trial counsel made diligent\n   efforts to locate an expert on the secondary transfer issue was clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Therefore, we conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petitioner's petition for certification to appeal as to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that was based on trial counsel's failure to call a tear gas expert at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The petitioner's final claim is that the habeas court erroneously concluded that trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance when he \"failed to introduce photographs or other evidence of the physical layout of [Krick's] apartment\" because they would have \"buttress[ed] the credibility of the petitioner's alibi witness,\" Marcel Bartelle. The respondent argues that the habeas court properly rejected the petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel made a reasonable tactical decision not to introduce those photographs and potentially weaken the alibi witness' testimony. We agree with the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. In his first and second written statements to the police, the petitioner stated that he was home with Krick on the evening of March 28, 2001, the night of the robbery. He admitted in both statements, however, that Perry came to Krick's apartment at one point that night with a black man, identified at the habeas trial as Darcel Moody, and the register, which he helped Perry carry into Krick's apartment, open with a screwdriver, and hide behind the dresser. In his third written statement, the petitioner claimed to have been home the entire evening of March 28, 2001, with Krick\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Bartelle. The petitioner continued to acknowledge that Perry came by his apartment with Moody and the register after the robbery and that he helped Perry carry in, open, and hide the register.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   At the petitioner's criminal trial, Bartelle testified that he went to the petitioner and Krick's apartment after work, between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. Bartelle testified that when he arrived the petitioner was alone and that they remained alone until approximately 9:30 p.m. when Perry arrived. The reason Perry came over, Bartelle explained, was that he wanted to purchase some crack cocaine. Bartelle testified that Perry remained briefly at the apartment to find out what Bartelle wanted to purchase and to pick it up. Bartelle stated that on the two brief occasions Perry was at Krick's apartment, Perry was alone, and that he never saw Perry carry anything into the apartment, aside from the crack cocaine. Bartelle stated that Krick returned home at approximately 11 p.m. and asked him to leave, which he did. Bartelle maintained that between the time he arrived at the apartment and the time he left the apartment the petitioner never left his presence in the kitchen for more than two or three minutes. Bartelle testified that, as a result, if the petitioner had been prying open a register while he was at the apartment, he would have been aware of it, but he did not see or hear the petitioner carry in or pry open a register.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   At the habeas trial, the petitioner asked trial counsel why he did not introduce photographs of Krick's apartment for the purpose of explaining why Bartelle might not have seen Perry come to the apartment with Moody if Moody had remained standing at the front door to the apartment. Trial counsel responded that he did not recall why he did not introduce photographs for that particular purpose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The habeas court concluded that trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance by not introducing evidence of the physical layout of Krick's apartment to explain why Bartelle did not see anyone with Perry. The habeas court reasoned that \"even an\n   innocuous error by Bartelle as to who arrived at Krick's condominium when, and with whom, could reflect badly on Bartelle as a witness. Rather than appear to concede the likelihood that Perry had a companion when he came to Krick's place, [trial counsel] elected to present the alibi defense contained in Bartelle's version of these events unsullied by inconsistency or mistake.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We agree with the habeas court that the petitioner failed to establish that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not introducing evidence of the physical layout of Krick's apartment to explain why Bartelle did not see Moody. We have recognized repeatedly that because of the difficulties inherent in evaluating an attorney's performance in hindsight, \"a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the [petitioner] must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.... [C]ounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4044027\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/104/557/#p572\">\n    104 Conn.App. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 572,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=935%20A.2d%20162\">\n    935 A.2d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3958000,3958643\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/285/911/\">\n    285 Conn. 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=943%20A.2d%20470\">\n    943 A.2d 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). The petitioner failed to overcome this presumption in the present case. Bartelle's testimony was inconsistent with the petitioner's statements in several respects. We agree with the habeas court that it was a reasonable tactical decision for trial counsel\n   not to emphasize further the inconsistency concerning Moody's presence at Krick's apartment on March 28, 2001 by introducing evidence of the apartment's layout in an attempt to explain why Bartelle might not have seen Moody.\n   Therefore, we conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petitioner's petition for certification to appeal as to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that was based on trial counsel's failure to introduce evidence of the layout of Krick's apartment to explain why Bartelle might not have seen Moody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Police officers, with the assistance of the petitioner, subsequently recovered the firearm from Cruz.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    In his first two written statements to the police, the petitioner used an alias, Juan Roman.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The petitioner's alibi witness at trial, Marcel Bartelle, is married.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    With respect to the charge of murder, the state alleged that \"Reynaldo Arroyo with intent to cause the death of another person did cause the death of such person, namely, Edmund Caruso, by use of a firearm ....\" With respect to the charge of robbery in the first degree, the state alleged that the petitioner \"did commit a robbery of Edmund Caruso, and in the course of the commission of the robbery, Reynaldo Arroyo was armed with a deadly weapon, to wit: a nine millimeter pistol ....\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Conversely, with respect to the charge of felony murder, the state alleged that \"Reynaldo Arroyo and Richmond Perry did commit a robbery [of Mike's Package Store] [a]nd in the course of and in furtherance of such crime, Reynaldo Arroyo or another participant, to wit, Richmond Perry, did cause the death of a person other than one of the participants, namely, Edmund Caruso ....\" With respect to the charge of conspiracy to commit robbery, the state alleged that \"Reynaldo Arroyo with intent that conduct constituting [robbery in the first degree] be performed ... did agree with another person, namely, Richard Perry, to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct ....

Whether the court erred in denying the petition based on its finding that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to call a tear gas expert?\" The language in this fifth ground for appeal is insufficient to raise distinctly, and thereby preserve, the petitioner's evidentiary claim.

The petitioner claims that \"[t]he habeas court committed clear error when it concluded that [trial counsel] had consulted with Loghman 'although Loghman forgot about the consultation.' \" We disagree with the petitioner to the extent that he argues that the habeas court's finding that trial counsel consulted with Loghman was clearly erroneous because trial counsel testified that he consulted with Loghman.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    We agree with the petitioner, however, that the habeas court's finding that \"Loghman forgot about the consultation\" was clearly erroneous. At the habeas trial, the petitioner first called Loghman to testify. After Loghman's testimony, the petitioner called trial counsel, who unexpectedly testified that Loghman was one of the experts he consulted. The next day, the petitioner sought to recall Loghman telephonically as a witness, even though he had been released as a witness and left the state. Habeas counsel represented that Loghman \"had no recollection of talking to [trial counsel]\" and that Loghman's firm had a strict policy about not having \"casual conversations without being retained.\" The habeas court did not permit habeas counsel, however, to recall Loghman. See footnote 15 of this opinion. Accordingly, the habeas court's finding that Loghman forgot about his conversation with trial counsel is not supported by any evidence in the record.
