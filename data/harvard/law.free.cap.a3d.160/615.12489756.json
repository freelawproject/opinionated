(Mr. Parker's son, who, by that time was five years old), filed survival and wrongful death actions against Appellee William Stevens Hamilton, arising out of the death of Craig Junior Parker. The wrongful death claims were dismissed by the circuit court as time-barred under Maryland Code, \u00a7 3-904 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\"Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether the claims were timely depends on the applicability of two provisions-Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provides that the time period for bringing a wrongful death action that accrues in favor of a minor plaintiff is tolled during the period of minority, and Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-203, which reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   If the knowledge of a cause of action is kept from a party by the fraud of an adverse party, the cause of action shall be deemed to accrue at the time when the party discovered, or by the exercise of ordinary diligence should have discovered the fraud.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We shall hold that both provisions apply. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 operates to toll a minor plaintiff's wrongful death claims during the period of his or her minority. Thus, the circuit court erred in dismissing the minor Appellant's wrongful death claims as untimely. Furthermore, the circuit court\n   erred in failing to consider that the time limitation to file a wrongful death action is tolled when the defendant engages in fraudulent conduct that prevents the plaintiffs from bringing a wrongful death action within three years from the date of death, pursuant to Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-203. Appellants' amended complaint sufficiently pled fraud in order to invoke Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-203.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are alleged in Appellants' Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On or about August 22, 2009, Mr. Hamilton shot and killed Mr. Parker. At the time, Mr. Parker was thirty-eight years old, and worked as a farmhand for Mr. Hamilton. Mr. Parker was survived by his mother, Cassandra Parker and his son, Z., born on November 17, 2009-Appellants in this matter. Appellants allege that Mr.\n   Hamilton buried Mr. Parker's remains in order to conceal his wrongdoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 9, 2015, Cassandra Parker (acting individually and as the Personal Representative of the Estate of her son, Mr. Parker) and her minor grandchild, Z. (Mr. Parker's son), filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Dorchester County against Mr. Hamilton arising out of the wrongful death of Mr. Parker. Appellants thereafter filed an amended complaint in which they added William Vogel, Jr.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a defendant. The amended complaint included counts of: (1) wrongful death based on negligence, (2) a survival action based on negligence, (3) wrongful death based on gross negligence, (4) a survival action based on gross negligence, (5) wrongful death based on battery, (6) a survival action based on battery, and (7) fraudulent conveyance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Hamilton filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice, or in the alternative, motion for summary judgment. The circuit court held a motions hearing, after which it issued a written opinion granting the motion to dismiss as to the wrongful death claims, and denying the motion as to the survival claims of Mr. Parker's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellants filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied without a hearing. Appellants filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. This Court granted certiorari before the Court of Special Appeals' consideration of the direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    Parker v. Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488156,12488157,12178542,12178519\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/450/664/\">\n    450 Md. 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488156,12178573,12178542,12178519,12488154,12488155,12178556,12488157\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/819/\">\n    150 A.3d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Appellants' brief\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   presents three questions for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I. Did the trial court improperly ignore Md. Code, Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 when it determined that the wrongful death claims of the minor plaintiff were not tolled until the age of majority?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   II. Does the trial court's decision that the minor plaintiff's wrongful death claims were not tolled during his minority violate Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   III. Did the trial court err when it determined that the defendant's fraudulent concealment of a murder failed to toll the plaintiffs' wrongful death claims under Md. Code, Cts. &amp; Jud. [Proc.] \u00a7 5-203 ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The parties contest the appropriate standard of review. Mr. Hamilton argues that the circuit court granted a motion to\n   dismiss, not a motion for summary judgment-and therefore, this Court should not consider evidence outside of the pleadings. In response, Appellants argue that while the circuit court's order was not clear as to whether it granted a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment, the circuit court referred throughout\n   the opinion to evidence and testimony received at the motions hearing, which was beyond the four corners of the complaint. Appellants assert that by considering evidence outside of the scope of the pleadings in rendering its ruling, the motion to dismiss was converted to one for summary judgment pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-322(c). During oral argument before this Court, counsel for Mr. Hamilton contended that the circuit court conducted a discrete review of the wrongful death actions, as a motion to dismiss, and only considered evidence outside of the pleadings as it pertained to the remaining causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the section of the circuit court's opinion entitled \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Wrongful Death Claims-Condition Precedent\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   [,]\" the circuit court concluded, \"Because the Complaint was not filed until June 9, 2014, long after the three-year time deadline of August 22, 2012, the wrongful death claims, Counts 1, 3, and 5, must be dismissed.\" The dismissal of the wrongful death claims was grounded in (1) the application of the time limitation in the wrongful death statute as a condition precedent and (2) the rejection of Appellants' argument regarding the retroactivity of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(g), which creates an exception to the condition for wrongful death actions based on criminal homicides. Based on these grounds for dismissal, we determine the review of the wrongful death causes of action was limited to the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We have outlined the applicable standard of review pertaining to dismissals for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   In considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-322(b)(2), a trial court must assume the truth of all well-pleaded relevant and material facts in the complaint, as well as all inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Stone v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Appellants argue that Cts. &amp; Jud.

Proc. \u00a7 5-201 clearly provides for tolling in a wrongful death case during the period of minority. Appellants further aver that not allowing the action to be tolled until the age of majority would violate Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, as held by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Piselli v. 75th St. Med.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1126322\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/371/188/\">\n    371 Md. 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1126322\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/371/188/\">\n    808 A.2d 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Lastly, Appellants argue that they properly invoked Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-203, which tolls the time limit for bringing a wrongful death action when the defendant fraudulently conceals his or her wrongful conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In response, Mr. Hamilton argues that the circuit court properly construed Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 as inapplicable\n   to wrongful death claims. Mr. Hamilton relies on our ruling in\n   <em>\n    Waddell v. Kirkpatrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2019386\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/331/52/\">\n    331 Md. 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2019386\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/331/52/\">\n    626 A.2d 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993), where we determined the time limit contained in Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-904(g) was a condition precedent to maintaining an action, as opposed to a statute of limitations. Mr. Hamilton opposes Appellants' proffered interpretation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights as applied to the minor plaintiff. Lastly, Mr. Hamilton proposes that the Appellants did not specifically plead fraud within their complaint, and thus, their wrongful death claims could not be tolled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

Conversely, we looked to our jurisprudence analyzing the effect of a time requirement then prescribed within the wrongful death statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The [statute] create[s] a new legal liability, with the right to suit for its enforcement, provided the suit is brought within twelve months, and not otherwise. The time within which the suit must be brought operates as a limitation of the liability itself as created, and not of the remedy alone. It is a condition attached to the right to sue at all.... Time has\n   been made of the essence of the right and the right is lost if the time is disregarded. The liability and the remedy are created by the same statutes, and the limitations of the remedy are, therefore, to be treated as limitations of the right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 59,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2019386\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/331/52/\">\n    626 A.2d at 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Proc. \u00a7 5-201 in response to\n   <em>\n    Waddell\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Following this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Waddell\n   </em>\n   , in 1997, the General Assembly added language to Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 that specifically referenced its application to wrongful death actions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (a) When a cause of action subject to a limitation under Subtitle 1 of this title\n   <strong>\n    OR TITLE 3, SUBTITLE 9 OF THIS ARTICLE\n   </strong>\n   accrues in favor of a minor or mental incompetent, that person shall file his action within the lesser of three years or the applicable period of limitations after the date the disability is removed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   1997 Md. Laws Ch. 318 (emphasis added). By specifically referencing the wrongful death statute within the new version of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201, the General Assembly amended the statute to provide that the time period to file a wrongful death cause of action is tolled during a plaintiff's minority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   This intent is supported by the legislative history contained in the bill file. The Bill Analysis generated by the General Assembly for the Bill states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Additionally, the bill establishes that when the time period to file wrongful death action accrues in favor of a minor or mental incompetent, that person must file the action within the lesser of three years or the applicable period of limitations after the date the disability is removed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [C]urrent law provides that when a cause of action subject to a statute of limitations accrues in favor of a minor or mental incompetent, that person has three years after the disability is removed to file the action.\n   <strong>\n    Courts have interpreted the time period to file a wrongful death action as a condition precedent and not a statute of limitations. The bill provides the same extension of time to wrongful death actions that is currently provided to other actions with a statute of limitations.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Bill Analysis of H.B. 770 (1997) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The legislative history of the General Assembly's 1997 amendment to Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 demonstrates that the amendment was intended to address our determination in\n   <em>\n    Waddell\n   </em>\n   that there was no tolling for minor plaintiffs in wrongful death actions. Thus, we hold that Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 in its current form provides for tolling during the period of minority. Accordingly, under the version of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 in effect here, the minor plaintiff Z.'s wrongful death claims were tolled during the period of his minority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Appellants further argue that not allowing for tolling until the age of majority would violate Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, as held by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Piselli v. 75th St. Med.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1126322\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/371/188/\">\n    371 Md. 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1126322\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/371/188/\">\n    808 A.2d 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). Because we determined that the plain language of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 in its current form provides for tolling of a wrongful death claim during a period of minority, it is not necessary for us to reach the constitutional issue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mercy Hospital v.

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Appellants aver that our decision in\n   <em>\n    Geisz v. Greater Balt. Med.

In the amended complaint, Appellants pled that (1) on or about August 22, 2009, Mr. Hamilton shot and killed Mr. Parker and (2) Mr. Hamilton buried Mr. Parker's remains in order to conceal his wrongdoing. We determine that these allegations were sufficient to\n   reflect Mr. Hamilton's fraudulent conduct, and facts from which Mr. Hamilton's fraud can necessarily be implied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Antigua Condo.
