As Officer Taylor was checking Michael W.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>license, he det\u00e9cted the odor of alcohol on Michael W.\u2019s breath. After conducting some field sobriety tests, the officer took Michael W. to the police station where an intoximeter test revealed that Michael W.\u2019s blood alcohol content was 0.09. As a result of the breath test, Officer Taylor issued a citation to Michael W., under \u00a7 16 \u2014 113(b)(1) and (h) of the Transportation Article, for violating a restriction on his license to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">On August 24, 1999, Michael W. pled guilty in the District .Court of Maryland to the charge of violating \u00a7 16 \u2014 113(b)(1) and (h), and he paid a fine of $50. Shortly thereafter, on September 13, 1999, the State filed in the Circuit Court for Howard County a \u201cPetition For Delinquency,\u201d charging that, on July 13, 1999, Michael W. drove \u201cwhile intoxicated\u201d or \u201cunder the influence of alcohol\u201d in violation of \u00a7 21-902, that he drove \u201cin violation of a restricted license\u201d in violation of \u00a7 16-113, and that he failed \u201cto obey a traffic control device\u201d in violation of \u00a7 21-201 of the Transportation Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Michael W. filed a motion to dismiss the delinquency petition, arguing that, because of his earlier District Court conviction under \u00a7 16-113 for violating the restriction on his license, the first two charges in the delinquency petition constituted a successive prosecution for the same offense and were, therefore, barred by the prohibition against double jeopardy. With regard to the third charge of failing to obey a traffic control device in violation of \u00a7 21-201, Michael argued that, if the first two charges were dismissed, the Circuit Court would have no jurisdiction over the \u00a7 21-201 charge. <em>See </em>Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-804(e)(2) and (f) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">After a hearing, the Circuit Court granted Michael W.\u2019s motion and dismissed the petition. The State appealed, arguing that the double jeopardy prohibition did not prohibit the delinquency proceeding on the charge of driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol. While conceding that the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal was correct with respect to the second charge of driving in violation of a restricted license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>under \u00a7 16-113, the State asserted that the dismissal of the first and third charges should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The Court of Special Appeals held that the charge of driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol was not precluded by double jeopardy principles but that the charge of driving in violation of a restricted license was precluded. The intermediate appellate court vacated the dismissal of the first and third charges and upheld the dismissal of the second charge of driving in violation of a license restriction. <em>In re Michael W., </em>134 Md.App. 144, 759 A.2d 322 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Michael W. filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, presenting a single question as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">\u201cIs the State barred by the prohibition against double jeopardy from initiating proceedings before the [Circuit] Court for driving while intoxicated and under the influence of alcohol after having previously convicted the juvenile driver in the District Court for operating a vehicle in violation of an alcohol related license restriction?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">This Court granted the petition, <em>In re Michael W., </em>362 Md. 187, 763 A.2d 734 (2000), and we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">The double jeopardy prohibition protects a \u201cdefendant from successive prosecution as well as cumulative punishment for the same offense. It is applicable to criminal prosecutions in this State by virtue of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Maryland common law.\u201d <em>Farrell v. State, </em>364 Md. 499, 504, 774 A.2d 387, 390 (2001), and cases there cited. Moreover, for purposes of the double jeopardy prohibition, a juvenile delinquency proceeding is treated as a criminal prosecution. <em>Breed v. Jones, </em>421 U.S. 519, 95 S.Ct. 1779, 44 L.Ed.2d 346 (1975); <em>In re Mark R., </em>294 Md. 244, 254-261, 449 A.2d 393, 399-403 (1982); <em>Parojinog v. State, </em>282 Md. 256, 384 A.2d 86 (1978). <em>See also In re John P., </em>311 Md. 700, 707-710, 537 A.2d 263, 266-268 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>In the present case, both the parties and the courts below agree that whether double jeopardy principles bar the juvenile delinquency proceeding in the Circuit Court depends upon the relationship between the offense of driving in violation of an alcohol restriction on a driver\u2019s license prohibited by \u00a7 16 \u2014 113(b)(1) and (h), and driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol prohibited by \u00a7 21 \u2014 902(a)(1) and (b). If both offenses, when based on the same act of driving, are deemed the same offense for double jeopardy purposes, then Michael W.\u2019s earlier District Court conviction of the \u00a7 16-113 offense would bar the later Circuit Court proceeding based on the alleged commission of the \u00a7 21-902 offense. <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977); <em>Gianiny v. State, </em>320 Md. 337, 577 A.2d 795 (1990); <em>Middleton v. State, </em>318 Md. 749, 758-760, 569 A.2d 1276, 1280-1281 (1990); <em>Parojinog v. State, supra, </em>282 Md. 256, 384 A.2d 86; <em>Thomas v. State, </em>277 Md. 257, 353 A.2d 240 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The normal test for determining whether different statutory or common law offenses should be deemed the same offense for double jeopardy purposes has been described by various names, including the \u201crequired evidence test,\u201d the \u201celements test,\u201d the \u201csame elements test,\u201d the \u201csame evidence test,\u201d and the <em>\u201cBlockburger </em>test.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This test focuses upon the elements of each offense. We have on numerous occasions repeated the explanation of the test set forth in <em>Thomas v. State, supra, </em>277 Md. at 267, 353 A.2d at 246-247:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">\u201cThe required evidence is that which is minimally necessary to secure a conviction for each ... offense. If each offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, or in other words, if each offense contains an element which the other does not, the offenses are not the same for double jeopardy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>purposes even though arising from the same conduct or episode. But, where only one offense requires proof of an additional fact, so that all elements of one offense are present in the other, the offenses are deemed to be the same for double jeopardy purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Furthermore, \u201c[w]hen applying the required evidence test to multi-purpose offenses, <em>i.e., </em>offenses having alternative elements, a court must \u2018examin[e] the alternative elements relevant to the case at issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Lancaster, </em>332 Md. 385, 392, 631 A.2d 453, 457 (1993), quoting <em>Snowden v. State, </em>321 Md. 612, 618, 583 A.2d 1056, 1059 (1991). <em>See Thomas v. State, supra, </em>277 Md. at 268-269, 353 A.2d at 247-248. <em>See also United States v. Dixon, </em>509 U.S. 688, 698, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 2857, 125 L.Ed.2d 556, 559 (1993); <em>Harris v. Oklahoma, </em>433 U.S. 682, 97 S.Ct. 2912, 53 L.Ed.2d 1054 (1977); <em>State v. Ferrell, </em>313 Md. 291, 298, 545 A.2d 653, 656 (1988); <em>Nightingale v. State, </em>312 Md. 699, 705-706, 542 A.2d 373, 375-376 (1988); <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 268-273, 373 A.2d 262, 266-269 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In the case at bar, it is clear that driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol has a distinct element which is not present in the restrictive license driving offense under \u00a7 16-113(b)(1) and (h). Section 21 \u2014 902(a)(1) and (b) required that the State establish that the defendant was either intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol. Neither intoxication nor driving while under the influence of alcohol was an element of the \u00a7 16 \u2014 113(b)(1) and (h) offense in 1999 or today. While the \u00a7 16 \u2014 113(b)(1) and (h) offense in 1999 required proof of a blood alcohol concentration of 0.02, such concentration does not establish either intoxication or being under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The State argues that the offense under \u00a7 16-113(b)(1) and (h) had three elements not contained in the offense proscribed by \u00a7 21-902(a)(1) and (b), namely a specific blood alcohol percentage, the age of the defendant, and the requirement that the defendant violate a restriction on a driver\u2019s license issued by the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration. Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>though we do not decide whether the first two of these are distinct elements for double jeopardy purposes, we agree with the State and the Court of Special Appeals that the third is a distinct element. We fully concur with the following explanation by Judge Moylan for the Court of Special Appeals <em>(In re Michael W., supra, </em>134 Md.App. at 151, 759 A.2d at 326):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARm\">\u201cThe State argues that the unique element is the age limitation, for a \u00a7 16-113(h) violation, that the violator be under 21 years of age. We hesitate to rest our analysis exclusively on that factor, for it could be argued that the status of being under 21 years of age simply establishes the class of persons to whom \u00a7 16-113(h) could apply and does not represent an actual element of the unlawful behavior proscribed. It is a philosophical problem that we need not resolve, however, because we find another unique element in \u00a7 16-113(h) that clearly qualifies as an \u2018element.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">\u201cTo be guilty of a violation of that section, it is required that one be issued a driver\u2019s license with the aforesaid restriction. Even if under 21 years of age and even if driving with a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.02 or above, one could not violate \u00a7 16-113(h) if he were driving unlawfully without any license at all. If one were driving in Maryland with a driver\u2019s license for another state which contained no such restriction, one could not violate \u00a7 16-113(h). The State must prove, as a necessary element of the violation, that the driver possessed a Maryland license with the restriction in question. The very gravamen of the offense is the violation of the restriction on the license. Section 21-902, by contrast, contains no such requirement that one be operating under a restricted license or, indeed, under any license at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Consequently, under the required evidence test, the \u00a7 16-113(b)(1) and (h) offense should not be deemed the same offense as the \u00a7 21-902(a)(1) and (b) offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The petitioner Michael W. alternatively argues that even if the two offenses are not the same under the required evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>test, successive prosecutions for each offense should not be permitted as a matter of Maryland law. Michael W. points out that, while the required evidence test is the \u201cnormal\u201d test for determining whether two offenses should be deemed the same for double jeopardy purposes, it is not the exclusive test, and that Maryland common law recognizes that other considerations or \u201ctests\u201d are sometimes applicable. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. State, 357 </em>Md. 141, 158-167, 742 A.2d 493, 502-507 (1999); <em>McGrath v. State, </em>356 Md. 20, 24-25, 736 A.2d 1067, 1069 (1999); <em>Miles v. State, </em>349 Md. 215, 220 221, 707 A.2d 841, 844 (1998); <em>Cousins v. State, </em>277 Md. 383, 397, 354 A.2d 825, 833, <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1027, 97 S.Ct. 652, 50 L.Ed.2d 631 (1976) (a successive prosecution case in which \u201c[w]e recognizefd] ... that there may be situations where the required evidence test, coupled with the principle of collateral estoppel, might not be adequate to afford the protection against undue harassment embodied in the purpose of the prohibition against double jeopardy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Michael W. makes two arguments as to why the juvenile delinquency prosecution for driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol should be barred because of the earlier conviction under \u00a7 16-113(b)(1) and (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><em>First, </em>he contends that the General Assembly intended that all motor vehicle offenses by a juvenile, based on the same incident, be tried together. Michael W., however, cites no statutory provision or legislative history expressly supporting this proposition. His argument is based entirely on \u00a7 3-804(e)(2) and (f) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which provides that a circuit court, exercising juvenile jurisdiction, has no jurisdiction over traffic offenses which carry no penalty of incarceration, committed by a child at least 16 years old, unless such offenses are charged along with a traffic offense within the court\u2019s jurisdiction and both are based on the same incident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These provisions relate entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>to the authority of a court exercising juvenile jurisdiction and not to the matter of successive prosecutions. Moreover, \u00a7 3-804(f) expressly applies when the alleged violations are charged together. This is an implicit acknowledgment that the traffic violations may be charged separately, and, if they are, \u00a7 3 \u2014 804(f) would have no application. Finally, as we held in <em>Cousins v. State, supra, </em>277 Md. at 394-395, 354 A.2d at 832,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">\u201cin the absence of any common law right or rule of procedure existing in Maryland requiring compulsory joinder or all offenses arising from the same act, conduct or criminal episode, there would be no basis for adopting the same transaction test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">\u201cMaryland has never recognized a common law right to have joined at one trial all offenses arising from the same transaction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">While statutory provisions or rules of procedure might, in specific instances, provide for compulsory joinder of offenses arising from one transaction, \u00a7 3-804(e)(2) and (f) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article does not so provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\"><em>Second, </em>Michael W. contends that, as a matter of Maryland common law, we should follow the \u201cmore expansive\u201d test for determining the same offense which was set forth in <em>Grady v. Corbin, </em>495 U.S. 508, 110 S.Ct. 2084, 109 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990). <em>Grady v. Corbin </em>was strictly a holding under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and it was express<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ly overruled by <em>United States v. Dixon, supra, </em>509 U.S. 688, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 125 L.Ed.2d 556. Moreover, we indicated in different opinions in <em>Whittlesey v. State, </em>326 Md. 502, 523, 540, 606 A.2d 225, 235, 243, <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 894, 113 S.Ct. 269, 121 L.Ed.2d 198 (1992), that \u201c[w]e make no attempt to pinpoint the holdings of <em>Corbin \u201d </em>and that \u201c[t]he scope of the <em>Grady v. Corbin </em>holding is not entirely clear.\u201d We decline to adopt the confused and discredited <em>Grady v. Corbin </em>holding as part of Maryland common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Neither the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment nor Maryland law barred the juvenile proceedings on the charge of driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
