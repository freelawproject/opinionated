We hold that the putative father cannot be legally obligated for child support arrearages that result from a now-vacated paternity judgment. The trial court is without discretion in this matter because, as a matter of law, the inherently dependent child support orders are invalid upon the vacatur of the paternity declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">On August 13, 1993, the appellee, Michele Gunter, filed a Complaint to Establish Paternity in which she claimed that Nicholas Todd Walter was the father of her child. Walter consented to a judgment of paternity on September 30, 1993, based on Gunter\u2019s representations that she had not had sexual relations with any other man during the period of conception. Pursuant to the court\u2019s paternity judgment, Walter was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $43.00 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">During the following years, periodic civil contempt proceedings were brought against Walter to enforce the child support obligation. Walter\u2019s financial stresses stemmed, at least to some degree, from an injury sustained in a work related accident in 1996 that was exacerbated by a subsequent motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>vehicle accident making him unable to work in his prior job.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For these reasons, on March 30, 2000, Walter filed a petition to modify child support. Walter contemporaneously filed a motion for genetic testing. Walter asserted that Gunter\u2019s family members had told Walter repeatedly that he was not the child\u2019s father and that he wanted a paternity test to prove that the child was indeed his. The genetic testing, however, <em>excluded Walter conclusively </em>as the father of the child. As a result, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, on September 28, 2000, terminated Walter\u2019s prospective child support obligation, subject to further argument on retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">On October 19, 2000, a hearing before a Master was conducted to determine whether Walter would remain responsible for paying the arrearages and whether he could recoup the child support payments already made. The Master recommended that the circuit court set aside the paternity judgment, deny Walter\u2019s request for recoupment of child support previously paid, deny Walter\u2019s request that he not be responsible for arrearage, and order Walter accountable for the accrued arrearage as of March 30, 2000, the date on which he filed his motion for genetic testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Walter filed exceptions to the Master\u2019s recommendations based solely on the arrearage issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A hearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>exceptions was held on March 9, 2001 before the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, and the exceptions were overruled. The circuit court, accepting the Master\u2019s recommendations, set aside the paternity judgment and ordered that Walter was responsible for the arrearage in existence as of March 30, 2000, totaling $11,228 (of which $4,153.33 was owed to the State Department of Social Services).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Mr. Walter appealed to the Court of Special Appeals and filed in this Court a petition for certiorari before judgment and a petition for expedited review. We granted certiorari to determine whether the appellant, Nicholas Todd Walter, remains liable for child support arrearages when the paternity judgment, from which the child support order emanates, was vacated, and whether, in the event that we hold Walter liable for the arrearages, he may be subject to contempt proceedings or imprisonment for failure to make payments on the arrear-age. <em>Walter v. Gunter, </em>364 Md. 534, 774 A.2d 408 (2001). Because we hold that Walter cannot be legally obligated for child support arrearages that result from a now-vacated paternity judgment, we do not reach the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Review by this Court involves interpreting whether the circuit court\u2019s order was legally correct. While child support orders are generally within the sound discretion of the trial court, <em>see Beckman v. Boggs, </em>337 Md. 688, 703, 655 A.2d 901, 908 (1995)(discussing the circuit court\u2019s discretion in family matters, with specific reference to visitation orders); <em>Giffin v. Crane, </em>351 Md. 133, 144, 716 A.2d 1029, 1035 (1998)(reviewing the lower court\u2019s determination of custody); <em>Early v. Early, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>338 Md. 639, 654, 659 A.2d 1334, 1341 (1995)(reviewing the circuit court\u2019s child support order), not to be disturbed unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion, where the order involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are \u201clegally correct\u201d under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. <em>See In re Mark M., </em>362 Md. 623, 766 A.2d 147 (2001)(reviewing a trial court\u2019s visitation order <em>de novo </em>when the issue involved whether the order itself constituted an improper delegation of judicial authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The issue we decide today \u2014 whether a child support order, terminated<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by the circuit court prospectively after the vacatur of the paternity declaration, may still oblige the father to satisfy arrearage-is a novel question of law. As is often the case with novel legal questions, a comprehensive understanding of the issue necessitates consideration of several facets of the pertinent law. The matters we consider today are tailored by the arguments proffered by the parties and the law on which the Master and the circuit court relied in declaring Walter responsible for the arrearage. The parties argue that specific provisions of the Family Law Article, namely Section 12-104<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Section 5 \u2014 1038(b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> either prohibit or require this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Court to find in their favor. The parties, as well as the Master and the circuit court, also rely extensively on dicta in this Court\u2019s recent decision, <em>Langston v. Riffle, </em>359 Md. 396, 754 A.2d 389 (2000), to support their respective arguments. We will briefly address the proper application of each of these statutory sections in the Family Law Article and the application of our decision in <em>Langston, supra, </em>as such review will not only provide guidance for future proceedings of this nature, but will help to narrow the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">First, the facts of this case do not present a situation encompassed by Section 12-104 of the Family Law Article, which confines a court\u2019s ability to modify a child support order subsequent to the date of the filing of a motion for modification. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>this Court must consider the <em>viability </em>of a child support order <em>after the very paternity declaration, from which the child support order originates, has been vacated, </em>not the modification of a child support order requested as a result of some material change of circumstance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>of one of the parties before the court. Therefore, Section 12-104 does not limit our review of the issue presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Second, the facts of this case do not permit consideration of the discretionary authority afforded courts by Section 5-1038(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">Except for a declaration of paternity, the court may modify or set aside any order or part of an order under this subtitle as the court considers just and proper in light of the circumstances and in the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Md.Code, \u00a7 5-1038(b) of the Family Law Article. We have clearly stated, on several occasions, that Section 5-1038(b) operates to ensure continuing jurisdiction for paternity orders (with the exception of paternity declarations) for purposes of modifying or vacating those orders as may be \u201cjust and proper in light of the circumstances and in the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Id.; See also, Jessica G. v. Hector M., </em>337 Md. 388, 401, 653 A.2d 922, 928-29 (1995); <em>Adams v. Mallory, </em>308 Md. 453, 463, 520 A.2d 371, 376 (1987). Yet, the orders subject to this provision are those articulated throughout the paternity proceeding subtitle, and therefore, <em>necessarily stem from a paternity </em>declaration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Md.Code, \u00a7 5-1038(b)(explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>encompassing \u201cany order or part of order under this subtitle\u201d \u2014 \u201cthis subtitle\u201d refers to subtitle 10 which consists of paternity proceedings provisions). In the absence of a paternity declaration, these orders have no foundation and the aforementioned \u201ccontinuing jurisdiction\u201d is meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">This case presents a factually unique circumstance: the circuit court terminated ongoing child support, yet ruled that the arrearage, which resulted from the very same child support order, still obligated the now non-paternal \u201cfather.\u201d Ostensibly, the circuit court used its discretionary authority to \u201cmodify\u201d a child support order as is \u201cjust and proper in light of the circumstances.\u201d Md.Code, \u00a7 5-1308(b). Contrary to the parties\u2019 assertions, this is not a situation that can be readily discharged under Section 5-1038(b). In fact, Section 5-1038(b) is inapplicable. Section 5 \u2014 1038(b) deals strictly with paternity orders, i.e. orders relating to or arising from paternity declarations, or more specifically, orders relating to <em>valid and enforceable </em>paternity declarations. The absence of a paternity declaration, as becomes its status upon vacatur,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> demands the abrogation of a court\u2019s <em>discretion </em>to \u201cmodify or set aside\u201d a child support order relating to that paternity declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The utility of Section 5-1038(b) is that it grants courts discretionary authority to modify paternity orders when a <em>valid </em>paternity declaration is in place. A court has no discretion, however, to \u201cmodify\u201d a child support order which is based on a vacated paternity judgment because the order itself is inextricably linked to the paternity declaration, its viability, absolutely dependent on the viability of the paternity declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>That the child support order is contingent upon an initial paternity declaration is evidenced by Section 5-1032 of the Family Law Article, which provides that upon a finding that the alleged father is the paternal father, the court must issue an <em>order which both declares paternity and provides for support of the child. See </em>Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-1032(a) of the Family Law Article. Furthermore, the very basis for child support, and an articulated purpose of the paternity proceedings article, is <em>\u201cto impose on the mothers and fathers of children </em>born out of wedlock the basic obligations and responsibilities of parenthood.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code, (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 5-1002(b)(2) of the Family Law Article (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u201c[Pjarenthood is both a biological and a legal status, that by nature and law it confers rights and imposes duties, and that one of the duties it casts upon parents is the duty to support their children____\u201d <em>Thrower v. State ex. rel. Bureau of Support Enforcement, </em>358 Md. 146, 159, 747 A.2d 634, 641 (2000) (discussing <em>Carroll County v. Edelmann, </em>320 Md. 150, 577 A.2d 14 (1990)). Without question, the biological and legal status of \u201cparenthood\u201d in Walter\u2019s situation is now extinct; the genetic test extinguishes the prior, and the vacatur of the paternity declaration extinguishes the latter. In the absence of \u201cparenthood\u201d status, the duty that is normally cast upon parents, e.g. the duty of child support, can no longer exist.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To conclude otherwise would erroneously permit courts to financially obligate a person to a judgment while completely lacking the statutory (or equitable) authority to so obligate.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Without paternity, there is no legal duty; without a legal duty, there can be no financial obligation. <em>See Bledsoe v. Bledsoe, </em>294 Md. 183, 193, 448 A.2d 353, 358 (1982)(stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>that \u201cthe legal obligation to support children arises out of parenthood\u201d); <em>Brown v. Brown, 287 </em>Md. 273, 284, 412 A.2d 396, 402 (1980)(defining a \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d of specific individuals as \u201cimmediate offspring\u201d)(quoting <em>Billingsley v. Bradley, </em>166 Md. 412, 419, 171 A. 351, 354 (1934)). Nowhere in the Family Law Article does it state that a man, conclusively found not to be the paternal father, retains the same responsibilities of a man declared to be the paternal father;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>see Knill v. Knill, </em>306 Md. 527, 531, 510 A.2d 546, 548 (1986) (describing Maryland\u2019s long history of \u201cplacing] the responsibility of child support squarely upon the shoulders of the <em>natural </em>parents\u201d)(emphasis added); <em>Brown, </em>287 Md. at 284, 412 A.2d at 402 (stating that \u201cthe duty of parents to provide for the maintenance of their children, is a principle of natural law; an obligation laid on them not only by nature herself, but by their own proper act, in bringing them into the world\u201d)(quoting 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 447 (1854)); nor does there seem to be any situation in law, contract, tort, or otherwise, that would require a continuing financial obligation on a contract subsequently ruled invalid or a tort judgment subsequently vacated, even if, during the period for which the contract or judgment remained valid, the person so obligated accrued debt or ar-rearages. We refuse to create that situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The Consent Order embodying the paternity proceedings for this case is emblematic of the dependency of a child support order on the paternity declaration. The Consent Order provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">Upon the consent of the parties, it is hereby ORDERED this 3rd day of September, 1993:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>A. That the Defendant [Walter] is the father of the minor child(ren), Taylor Alexandria Gunter, bom, 9/3/92.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">B. That the Defendant [Walter] is charged with support of the minor child(ren) named above until such child(ren) shall become 18 years of age, die, marry, or become self-supporting, whichever event first occurs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">C. That the Defendant [Walter] shall pay the sum of $43.00 Dollars per week, pursuant to the Maryland Child Support Guidelines, accounting from the 5th day of October, 1993, for the temporary support and maintenance of the minor child(ren).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">*******</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">As is indicated by the Consent Order, and as is required by Section 5-1032, the circuit court first declared Walter to be the father of the child <em>and then </em>assigned Walter a duty of financial support. Conceptually, it is difficult to reconcile the argument that the portion of the Consent Order on which all other portions rely could be vacated, while the order to pay child support remains in effect, at least to the extent that Walter has been ordered to pay the arrearage. By vacating a child support order, it is not simply prospective relief that is realized; rather, at least any and every outstanding inchoate legal obligation is also invalidated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">This Court historically has recognized a distinction between a standard debt and a legal duty in domestic circumstances, specifically with respect to child support, and subscribes to the theory that child support is a duty not a debt. <em>See Middleton v. Middleton, </em>329 Md. 627, 629-33, 620 A.2d 1363, 1364-66 (1993)(discussing the development of the debt/duty distinction with respect to domestic financial support obligations). Child support is a \u201clegal duty arising from or imposed by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633, 620 A.2d at 1366 (citations and quotations omitted). The duty/debt distinction, however, does not alter the effect of a vacated paternity judgment. To the contrary, a vacated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>paternity judgment effectively extinguishes that \u201clegal duty arising from or imposed by law,\u201d and as that duty is extinguished, so too is the financial obligation attached to that duty. When non-parents are forced to bear the financial burden of erroneous paternity declarations, the State risks losing credibility when seeking to enforce the true and authentic parental duty and its related financial obligations on behalf of the children of this State.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We cannot dispense this ruling without a brief discussion of our decision in <em>Langston v. Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 754 A.2d 389 (2000), as it is the primary case on which the Master and the circuit court rely and to which the parties have looked for guidance in presenting their arguments before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The issues in <em>Langston </em>were whether Section 5-1038, which allows courts to set aside paternity judgments upon discovery by blood or genetic testing that the adjudged father is excluded as the actual biological father, could be retroactively applied to paternity declarations issued prior to the October 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>1995, the effective date of the law, and whether and to what extent the trial court must consider the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d prior to ruling on the reconsideration of paternity. <em>Id. </em>at 403, 754 A.2d at 392. Upon review of the legislative history of Section 5-1038, we held that Section 5-1038(a) applied to paternity declarations issued prior to October 1, 1995 and that the best interests of the child, pursuant to Section 5-1038(b), had no bearing on the paternity declaration itself. <em>Id. </em>at 403, 427-28, 754 A.2d at 392, 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">As we noted in <em>Langston, </em>the Legislature altered Section 5-1038(a) to overturn the effect of our decision in <em>Tandra S. v. Tyrone W., </em>336 Md. 303, 648 A.2d 439 (1994), which precluded putative fathers from requesting vacatur of paternity judgments in the absence of evidence of \u201cfraud, mistake, or-irregularity.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Langston, </em>359 Md. at 405, 754 A.2d at 393. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>The principle extended in <em>Langston </em>was that genetic testing, under Section 5-1038(a), was available to any putative father who sought to challenge a paternity declaration entered against him without the benefit of blood or genetic test evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 427-28, 754 A.2d at 406. Simply put, the <em>Langston </em>holding applied only to paternity proceedings under Section 5-1038(a); it did not consider whether orders other than paternity declarations, such as child support orders, which are borne from an original paternity declaration, could be set aside pursuant to Section 5-1038(b) upon the vacatur of the original paternity declaration. <em>Id. </em>at 437, 754 A.2d at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The Master, the circuit court, and the parties to this case have focused almost exclusively on two portions of the <em>Lang-ston </em>opinion in support of their respective arguments and/or conclusions. We provide the first portion below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">Our holding does not apply to the support already paid by putative fathers and to the arrears they owe in support. Those property rights are already accrued. It would clearly raise problems, particularly in the areas of takings and due process, for this Court to interpret the statute to extend the retroactive application of Chapter 248 so far that a child must pay back support already claimed, adjudicated, received, and expended through a paternity-related child support, or other compensatory order, during the period it was legally in effect. Likewise, this reasoning applies to any debt owed by a putative father through the prior support or compensatory order, which is enforceable at least until the putative father initiates proceedings to attack the paternity declaration to which the order relates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 423, 754 A.2d at 403. Too much weight, albeit understandably, has been placed on this portion of the opinion. Notwithstanding that this language was clearly dicta, its sole utility was to limit our holding in the specific case to paternity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>declarations under Section 5-1038(a). We did not wish to convey that our retroactive application of Section 5-1038(a) could be interpreted to include, solely by virtue of our decision in <em>Langston, </em>orders that were normally subject to Section 5-1038(b), particularly in view of the delicate nature of retrospective application of a statute. <em>See Rawlings v. Rawlings, </em>362 Md. 535, 555-56, 766 A.2d 98, 109 (2001); <em>Roth v. Dimensions Health Corp. </em>332 Md. 627, 636, 632 A.2d 1170, 1174 (1993); <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Riverdale Heights Fire Co., </em>308 Md. 556, 568, 520 A.2d 1319, 1325 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Our intention in this regard also was articulated by the second portion of <em>Langston </em>on which the Master, circuit court and parties heavily rely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\"><em>Our holding today applies only to proceedings to modify or set aside a paternity declaration; </em>an attempt to modify or set aside any other order resulting from an original paternity declaration is governed by section 5-1038(b). In addition, the holding of this Court does not necessarily affect any child support already paid or in arrears as of the date of the filing of these respective proceedings at the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A55\"><em>Id. </em>at 437, 754 A.2d at 411 (emphasis added). Again, the function of this language was to limit our holding to paternity challenges under part(a) of Section 5-1038. Our reference to Section 5-1038(b) iterated the constraints of our holding by explaining that other orders resulting from paternity declarations were not impacted by our retroactive application of Section 5-1038(a) with respect to disputed paternity declarations. As our holding today clarifies, however, once a paternity declaration supporting arrearage is vacated, the child support order resulting from the paternity declaration is also invalid, and cannot be subject to the discretionary power of the courts pursuant to Section 5-1038(b). We reiterate that the outcome at which we arrive today is not the result of a retroactive application of the statute,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but rather, a nullifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>tion of the child support order. As such, the <em>Langston </em>decision, while pertaining to closely related paternity matters, is distinct from the issues presented today.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In conclusion, we hold that upon vacating a paternity declaration, the putative father cannot be legally obligated for arrearages emanating from child support orders resulting from the now-vacated paternity declaration. The trial court is without discretion in this matter because, as a matter of law, the dependent paternity orders are invalid once the paternity declaration is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY REVERSED.

It appears that Walter was employed by four different employers throughout his \"paternal\u201d years, but that his occupation involved operating motor vehicles, i.e. tow- trucks or cabs. At the time Walter petitioned to modify child support he indicated that he could no longer work as a cab driver due to the severity of his injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">. Walter filed his exceptions and requested a hearing on December 14, 2000. The circuit court proceeded without a hearing and issued its order on December 20, 2000. As a result, Walter filed a Motion to Strike the Order and requested, again, a hearing on the exceptions. The motion was granted, the Order stricken, and the hearing scheduled for March 9, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">We note that Walter did not file an exception to the Master's recommendation regarding the issue of recoupment of the child support already paid. The Master stated that Walter had no automatic right to recoupment, but instead, that recoupment was within the sound discretion of the court upon consideration of the best interests of the child. Therefore, believing that recoupment would be detrimental to the best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>interests of the child, the Master recommended that the circuit court deny Walter's request for recoupment. Walter did not except to this recommendation and the circuit court ultimately adopted the Master\u2019s recommendation and denied Walter's claim for recoupment. The re-coupment issue is not presently before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b551-9\">. Walter was in arrears of $12,303 as of the date that the paternity judgment was set aside.

We pause to comment on the concerns articulated by Judge Wilner in his dissent. Certainly a father who waits 7 years to contest paternity is no shining example of how we would wish the paternity decisions in this State to be made. As troubling as the lapse of time may be, this Court cannot judicially \"correct\u201d these outcomes by holding a man who is not the father of the child liable for a child support order which was both entered erroneously and subsequently vacated. Judge Wilner's concerns would be better addressed by mandates from our Legislature which, for example, might establish either: (a) a statute of limitations for contesting paternity; (b) a statute limiting the effect of vacated paternity judgments, i.e. requiring fathers to pay to the date of vacatur; or (c) state-provided paternity testing prior to entry of a paternity declaration. It is legislative action, not judicial decree, which would properly ease Judge Wilner's concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Judge Wilner further likens our decision to an \"assault ... on the efforts to assure the decent support of children.\u201d Again, we note that the very basis for child support, and an articulated purpose of the paternity proceedings article, is \"to <em>impose on the mothers and fathers of children </em>born out of wedlock the basic obligations and responsibilities of parenthood.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code, (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 5 \u2014 1002(b)(2) of the Family Law Article (emphasis added). Our Legislature never stated that the \u201cdecent support of children\u201d should be imposed upon those who are found, conclusively, <em>not </em>to be the child\u2019s parent; and should they so intend, such obligation must be explicitly enacted by our representatives in the Legislature, not created by judicial edict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b560-6\">.

A determination of the best interests of the child in ordering the requested testing, or in the consideration of paternity, whether original or revised, is inappropriate.

I was one of the dissenters, registering my views \u201cas forcefully as possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 754 A.2d at 423. Today, we hold, and again it is a sharply divided Court, again a four-three margin, that a man who consented to a judgment of paternity, without taking a blood test, is not liable as a matter of law, for the child support arrearages accrued on that judgment once a blood test, obtained in accordance with the <em>Riffe </em>interpretation of \u00a7 5-1038(a), excluded him as the father of the child whose paternity he had admitted and, as a result of which, that judgment has been vacated. In this case, I join the majority and, indeed, provide the margin. Because the result in this case is a consequence of the decision in <em>Riffe, </em>in which I was so vociferous in my disagreement with the majority in that case, I write separately to explain my vote and its consistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Although a four to three decision on the bottom line, there were six judges who subscribed to the interpretation of \u00a7 5-1038(a)(2) set out in the majority opinion in <em>Riffe. </em>Two of the dissenters took the position that the section simply applied prospectively only. <em>See </em>359 Md. at 460, 754 A.2d at 423 (Wilner, J. dissenting). Five judges, including me, <em>see </em>359 Md. at 438, n. 1, 754 A.2d at 412 n. 1 (Bell, C.J. dissenting), believed that the intent of the Legislature was to have the statutory amendment, whether interpreted as I suggested or as the eventual majority espoused, apply retrospectively, not just to future cases. Although the majority engaged in a detailed and painstaking analysis of the retrospectivity issue, I did not join that debate, noting simply and concisely what I believed, and still believe, motivated the Legislature\u2019s action and, thus, informed its intent with respect to others similarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>situated: \u201cI agree that the Legislature intended the amendment to be retroactive. Having acted with the dispatch that it did, it is inconceivable that it would intend that any meritorious case would be left without a remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Like the majority, I was convinced by the circumstances and the reasons given for the legislation that the Legislature was intent on avoiding a repetition of the situation that was presented in, or the perception that was generated by, <em>Tandra S. v. Tyrone W., </em>336 Md. 303, 648 A.2d 439 (1994), the case that the legislation was designed to, and did, overrule.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In <em>Tandra S., </em>we held that the rule of finality was sacrosanct, prevailing over a blood test that excluded the putative father and the mother\u2019s admission that the putative father was not the child\u2019s father by changing the child\u2019s name shortly after the paternity decree had been issued to that of a man, whom she identified as the child\u2019s father, 336 Md. at 322-23, 648 A.2d at 448, and without regard to whether the adjudicated fathers acted in good faith or with ordinary diligence. Thus, the petitioners, who were excluded as fathers were not entitled to modification of the paternity judgments because the blood test results, however accurate scientifically,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the admission of the mother<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not establish fraud, mistake or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>irregularity. It was to this rigidity, characterized as lacking common sense, and perceived unfairness to which the dissenters, initially, <em>see </em>336 Md. at 329-31, 648 A.2d at 451-52 (Eldridge, J. dissenting), and the Legislature, later, reacted and which resulted in the amendment of \u00a7 5-1038(a) to its present form.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In their opinion, the dissenters castigated the majority for the rigidity of its analysis and the construction it gave \u00a7 5-1038, as well as for the unfairness that generated, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiBr\">\u201cIn light of the basic differences between paternity judgments and the judgments in other types of lawsuits, the majority\u2019s holding today, in the words of the Court of Special Appeals, \u2018defies common sense.\u2019 Undoubtedly society interests must yield to the limitations on a court\u2019s revisory powers. Nevertheless, a completely rigid adherence to the shibboleth that \u2018in today\u2019s highly litigious society, there must be some point in time when a judgment becomes final,\u2019 in the face of irrefutable scientific evidence that a particular individual did not father a given child, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>all of the attendant ramifications of such decree, is absurd. Under the majority\u2019s view, presumably if the Provincial Court of Maryland in the 1600\u2019s had issued a decree that the earth was flat, the absence of \u2018fraud, mistake or irregularity,\u2019 as narrowly defined by this Court, would make that Provincial Court decree sacrosanct. Or, if Rule 2-535(b) were to be given extra-territorial effect, presumably the March 5, 1616, decree by a tribunal in Rome, aimed at Galileo Galilei, and declaring that Copernicanism is erroneous and that the planet earth is the center of the universe, would be given conclusive effect. Like the courts below, I do not believe that all common sense must be abandoned in the name of Rule 2-535(b).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 330-31, 648 A.2d at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Judging from the presence of the above quoted portion of the dissenting opinion in the bill file, <em>see </em>359 Md. at 412, 754 A.2d at 397, and the General Assembly\u2019s emphasis on \u201ca fairness issue at stake here,\u201d described by one of the sponsors of the legislation as \u201cthe inequality exhibited in the recent publicized cases of 2 men who accepted paternity and child support only to discover they were not the biological father, yet had to continue support payments,\u201d testimony of Senator Paula Hollinger before the House Judiciary Committee,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>same focus apparently guided the General Assembly to overrule our decision in <em>Tandra S. See </em>359 Md. at 412, 754 A.2d at 397. Clearly, the amendment of \u00a7 5-1038(a) was meant to overturn the result in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"Afh\">Noting the likelihood that \u201cthe Legislature agreed with the various criticisms of <em>Tandra S. </em>in the media and with Judge Eldridge\u2019s and Judge Raker\u2019s claim that the decision defied \u2018common sense,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 412-13, 754 A.2d at 397-98, the <em>Riffe </em>majority concluded that \u201cit would equally abandon common sense to deny, once again, a putative father the ability to challenge a paternity declaration simply because he has the misfortune of having the declaration entered against him prior to October 1, 1995.\u201d <em>Id. </em>With that analysis, I agreed, and still do agree. \u201cClearly,\u201d as the <em>Riffe </em>majority stated, \u201cthe perceived injustices to putative fathers in situations similar to the putative fathers in the <em>Tandra S. </em>case could not be remedied by legislation with a strictly prospective effect.\u201d 359 Md. at 412, 754 A.2d at 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Although accurately characterizing the issue to be decided in that case, i.e. \u201cwhether the changes implemented by Chapter 248 extend to paternity declarations entered prior to the effective date of the statute,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 406, 754 A.2d at 394, the majority in <em>Riffe </em>proceeded to hold: \u201cgiven the legislative history behind Chapter 248, ... the Legislature intended for blood or genetic tests to be made available, upon a motion, to any putative father seeking to challenge a paternity declaration previously entered against him in which such blood or genetic test evidence was not introduced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427-28, 754 A.2d at 406. It, consequently, gave the amendment quite a broad interpretation. By that interpretation, putative fathers were relieved from the effects of <em>Tandra S. </em>because the Legislature expanded the procedure for remedying the perceived problem by expanding the equitable grounds available for challenging a paternity judgment, by \u201cproviding putative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>fathers with an additional procedure or remedy to challenge prior paternity declarations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417-18, 754 A.2d at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">That is where the <em>Riffe </em>majority and I parted company. I would have given the subject amendment a narrow construction, only broad enough to answer the fairness, common sense and rigidity issues generated by <em>Tandra S. See </em>359 Md. at 439-59, 754 A.2d at 412-23 (Bell, C.J. dissenting). Thus, to be entitled to modification under \u00a7 5-1038(a), I would have required the production, by the moving party, of the reliable evidence prescribed in that section, that the paternity judgment was in error, naming the wrong person as the father of the child who is its subject. I would not have expanded the equitable grounds for challenging paternity or assisted the moving party to gather the evidence necessary to challenge the judgment. Neither, in my view, was mandated by the amendment of \u00a7 5-1038(a). That section requires, I submitted, <em>id. </em>at 446, 754 A.2d at 416 (Bell, C.J. dissenting), as a prerequisite to the modification or setting aside of a paternity decree, reliable evidence sufficient to set aside other orders or decrees of an equity court, subsection (a)(2)(i)(l), or a blood or genetic test, \u201cdone in accordance with \u00a7 5-1029,\u201d that excludes the person named in the order as the father. Subsection (a)(2)(i)(2). So interpreted, the amendment provides a mechanism, which, if properly applied, avoids the harsh result in <em>Tandra S.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201cMost assuredly, the amendment does not deal with entitlement of a person named in a paternity decree to a blood or genetic test under \u00a7 5-1029 or provide any support for the notion ... that blood or genetic tests may now be ordered on demand, in aid of a requested modification of a paternity order, for any, or no, reason, other than the uncertainty that the man may now have concerning his paternity of a child as to whom the court entered the paternity order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 446, 754 A.2d at 416 (Bell, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">That was my view then and it is my view now.

If, because of fairness and equity concerns, they are permitted, on whim, to look behind that agreement then, once it is determined that they are not the parents, the same, no, an even greater inequity or unfairness, results. The Legislature has decided, <em>Riffe </em>instructs, that the law is that post paternity decree blood tests may be had on demand by \u201cfathers,\u201d who have admitted to paternity and consented to a paternity decree. Otherwise, that case instructs, non-biological \u201cfathers\u201d would be required \u201cto continue support payments,\u201d with the resulting unfairness and assault on common sense. Neither equity nor common sense is furthered by a prospective only application of the \u00a7 5-1038(a) amendment. If it is inequitable, and defies common sense, for a non-biological \u201cfather\u201d \u201cto continue support payments\u201d after his non-paternity has been determined conclusively, it is even more inequitable and downright unseemly to require that non-biological \u201cfather\u201d to pay any arrearages that may have accrued under a decree that assumed he was the father and which, because of his exclusion, has been vacated. In addition to being as much continuing support payments as if the payments were required to be made currently \u2014 these payments were for the child\u2019s support, after all \u2014 such a bifurcation would accentuate the unfairness and run contrary to not only common sense, but the law. Permitting a putative father to shed the title of father because the evidence proves that he is not, is simply a meaningless gesture if he must continue to discharge, or can be required to discharge, the responsibilities flowing from that title. Rather than overruling, and thus correcting, the <em>Tandra S. </em>decision, this perpetuates the worst of it without retaining the fiction which, at least, provided a basis for the obligation imposed and its discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">The bottom line is, whether the narrow interpretation I advocate is followed or the more expansive one that the Court adopted in <em>Riffe, </em>a result that requires a man whose paternity has been vacated because of scientific evidence proving that he did not father a child to continue to pay support for that child, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>albeit by way of arrearages accrued while the paternity decree was in effect, is even more inequitable and devoid of common sense than the decision that prompted the legislative action that is the basis for these proceedings. Aware of the Legislature\u2019s concern for fairness and logic, I simply cannot, in conscience, embrace a result that does not even pay lip service to those concerns. That the system suffers by a logical and consistent application of the law, and children too, is a factor that I must assume the Legislature considered, especially after our decision in <em>Riffe, </em>and resolved, as it has not enacted legislation in response to <em>Riffe.

Rule 2-535(b) provides a circuit court with very limited revisory powers. The results of the blood test did not change the unambiguous mandate that exists in the revisory rule. Therefore, the circuit court erred when it vacated the 1990 paternity judgment and left the child fatherless because, as the circuit court itself recognized, neither fraud, mistake, nor irregularity had occurred. The majority of decisions from other jurisdictions similarly reject attempts to reopen paternity judgments based on post-judgment blood tests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\"><em>Tandra S. </em>v. <em>Tyrone </em>W., 336 Md. 303, 320, 648 A.2d 439, 447 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\">.

Even if it was the mother\u2019s intent to terminate John\u2019s child support payments by changing her child's name, the result would be no different. In <em>Stambaugh v. Child Support Enforcement Admin., </em>323 Md. 106, 591 A.2d 501 (1991), we made clear that one parent may not waive his or her child\u2019s right to support from the other parent.

Therefore, the mother could not unilaterally release John from his support obligations by merely changing her child\u2019s name. If the courts below concluded that the name change provided a basis for vacating the 1986 paternity judgment, we disagree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATt\">\"Moreover, if we were to uphold the lower court\u2019s decision in this case, the ramifications could be potentially disastrous.

The highest court in Maryland ruled that a man who agreed to pay child support but later found he was not the biological father must continue paying child support.

Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 754 A.2d 389 (2000), to avoid the sorry result reached by the Court today, that result, unfortunately, was predictable, as, I fear, is the result in the next assault likely to be made on efforts to assure the decent support of children \u2014 the right of disavowing fathers to recover back from their children the meager support they actually may have paid. The decision today not only demonstrates how wrong the Court was in <em>Langston, </em>but egregiously compounds the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The Court says that it is not deciding the issue in this case, but, absent some additional legerdemain, on what basis will it hold that, with parenthood extinguished, the once-self-confessed father is retroactively relieved of all responsibility for court-ordered child support he <em>failed </em>to pay but cannot recover the same court-ordered child support that, through a newly asserted theory of fraud or mistake of fact, he <em>did </em>pay? If the Court, being intellectually honest, found no distinction, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>would be faced with the unattractive prospect of forcing mothers and children to repay support already duly paid and spent. If the Court, to avoid that tarpit, conceived some basis for drawing a distinction, it would have the equally pernicious effect of rewarding such fathers who fail to pay court-ordered child support. New of these men will read this opinion, of course, but the message will quickly spread: in paternity cases, you are a fool if you actually pay the child support. If there is even the slightest doubt in your mind regarding your paternity, consent to paternity, consent to pay child support, but don\u2019t actually pay it. In the name of protecting the rights of men who father children and then walk away from them, the Court of Appeals has so dismantled the system for enforcing child support collection that, unless you are expecting a tax refund, are looking to win the lottery, or are truly concerned about driving on a suspended license, there will be no effective sanction, and, if the time ever comes, years later, when you may be held to account, ask for a blood test. If you are lucky, you will escape all responsibility and may, when the next case is decided, actually be able to force your child to return anything you were ever forced to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The Legislature drew a balance when it enacted ch. 248 in 1995, permitting men to challenge paternity and support orders after their enrollment and, if excluded by blood or genetic test results, to avoid <em>further </em>responsibility for child support. That is a permissible legislative call. It is this Court that has made a mess of it, first by giving the statute a retroactive application and now by providing a powerful new incentive for men to ignore both the responsibility they voluntarily assumed and their obligation to obey court orders. No one forced Nicholas Todd Walter to admit that he was the father of Taylor Gunter. He obviously believed that he was the father and, if he had any doubt about the matter, as he now claims he did, he could have forced the mother to prove his paternity in court. Based solely on his own admission, that issue was never adjudicated, and he was ordered to pay $43/week for the support of the child, an amount he neither contested nor paid. The gross arrearage of $12,303, deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>mined as of September, 2000, indicates that he was about 286 weeks-five-and-a-half years \u2014 in arrears. And today, the Court rewards him for that defiance. Respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b574-5\">HARRELL, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Adk0\">dissenting, joined by RAKER, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">I dissent. Judge Battaglia, who had not yet joined the Court when it decided <em>Langston v. Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 754 A.2d 389 (2000), has performed, in the Majority Opinion\u2019s discussion of <em>Langston </em>(Maj. op. at 399-403), as capably as possible in explaining away the damning dicta<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from <em>Lang-ston. </em>I, on the other hand, hobbled by having joined the Majority in <em>Langston, </em>am unable to subscribe to her rationale. I know what it meant to me when I subscribed to Judge Cathell\u2019s thoughtfully considered and essential-to-the-outcome reasoning when he explained why \u00a7 5-1038 of the Family Law Article (Chp. 248, Laws 1995) could be given retrospective effect in those combined cases because no vested or substantive rights would be interfered with:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">A most natural definition of the term \u201cvested\u201d is \u201caccrued\u201d or, as dictionaries put it, \u201ccompleted and consummated.\u201d But in that sense, any claim or interest which has become into being and been perfected as \u201ca right\u201d would have to be said to be vested....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">... Justice Holmes once remarked with reference to the problem of retroactivity that \u201cperhaps the reasoning of the cases has not always been as sound as the instinct which directed the decisions,\u201d and suggested that the criteria which really governed decisions are \u201cthe prevailing views of justice.\u201d The problem is to comprehend what real considerations influence judgment in application of \u201cthe prevailing views of injustice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>... It is impossible to discover the precise meaning of the term through which all of the decisions can be consistently explained. Most of the numerous attempts at definition are essentially circuitous in nature, as in the pronouncement that \u201ca vested right, as that term is used in relation to constitutional guarantees, implies an interest which it is proper for the state to recognize and protect, and of which the individual may not be deprived arbitrarily without injustice.\u201d Thus \u201cvested right\u201d means simply a right which under particular circumstances will be protected from legislative interference.

Likewise, this reasoning applies to any debt owed by a putative father through the prior support or compensatory order, which is enforceable at least until the putative father initiates proceedings to attack the paternity declaration to which the order relates. <em>See </em>2 <em>id. </em>\u00a7 41.06, at 380 (\u201cA vested, right has been equated with \u2018property in order to qualify it for protection from arbitrary interference.\u201d); <em>cf.
