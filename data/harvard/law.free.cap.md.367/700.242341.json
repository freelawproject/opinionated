The Court of Special Appeals held that the bail bond agents in the case <em>sub judice </em>were, in fact, acting as state actors for purposes of the Fourth Amendment due to the extent of the participation by the police officer who accompanied them as part of a \u201cservice to stand by\u201d procedure that apparently exists in Washington County.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">On March 21, 2000, respondent was convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and simple possession after a bench trial in the Circuit Court for Washington County. The Circuit Court sentenced respondent to five years imprisonment, all suspended, with three years probation, on the possession of marijuana with intent to distribute conviction. The Circuit Court imposed a concurrent one-year term, with concurrent probation, on the possession of marijuana conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">On March 22, 2000, respondent noted an appeal from the ruling of the Circuit Court to the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals reversed the Circuit Court and remanded the case for reconsideration of the motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">On August 16, 2001, we granted the State\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari to review the holding of the Court of Special Appeals. Petitioner presents one question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahr\">\u201cDid the Court of Special Appeals err in finding that two bail bonds agents, who entered an apartment to look for their defaulting principal, were agents of the State for the purpose of the Fourth Amendment because an accompanying police officer initially knocked on the apartment door, was denied entry and remained outside of the apartment?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_-\">We affirm the intermediate court\u2019s holding that the participation, beyond mere presence, of the accompanying police officer in this case conferred the status of state action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>purposes of the Fourth Amendment to the actions taken by the two bail bond agents toward respondent. While bail bond agents are generally not state actors for Fourth Amendment suppression purposes, in this case, because of the extent of participation by the police officer, they were acting as agents of the State and respondent is entitled to a further suppression hearing and a ruling on excluding the evidence gained initially and following the alleged illegal entry by the two agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">In <em>Collins v. State, </em>138 Md.App. 300, 771 A.2d 478 (2001), as to the questions at issue here, the Court of Special Appeals adopted the evidence proffered at the suppression hearing as the facts of this case. The facts, as set forth in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-7\">\u201cAt the hearing on the motion to suppress, Officer Carl Hook [of the Hagerstown Police Department] was the only witness. He testified that he was advised by another officer [Officer David Long] to meet with two persons in the business of arranging bail bonds, Tanya Baer and Donna Morris. They advised him that they wanted to apprehend a ^wanted subject,\u2019 Dale Michael Estep, and that he had been seen going into 126 East Avenue in Hagerstown. Officer Hook accompanied the bail bond agents to that residence. He explained that he was performing a \u2018service to stand by,\u2019 which meant that he was not to intervene unless there was a criminal matter that took place. He testified that such service was routinely provided under the circumstances present here.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] Officer Hook had no information other than that supplied to him by the bail bond agents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>\u201cThe residence at 126 East Avenue was an apartment house containing four apartments. There was a porch on the front of the residence with an entrance from the porch to the apartment in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-5\">\u201cAfter Officer Hook and the two agents arrived at the entrance to the apartment, Officer Hook knocked on the door. The door was opened by appellant, who came out and closed the door behind him. Officer Hook stated that they were there for a \u2018wanted subject\u2019 and asked for permission to come in to check the residence. Appellant advised that Estep was not there, that he had not seen him for two weeks, and refused entry into the residence. Ms. Baer stated that she was going to enter the residence whether appellant liked it or not. Appellant again refused but called another person, who came outside to the porch. Officer Hook testified that Ms. Baer spoke to that person and knew him as \u2018Jimmy.\u2019[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] \u2018Jimmy\u2019 stated that Ms. Baer could go inside and check the residence. Ms. Baer and Ms. Morris went inside. Although appellant was standing at the door, he did not object; nor did he try to stop them. Officer Hook stood near the door, which was still open. The officer said that he detected an odor of burnt marijuana coming out of the residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-6\">\u201cWhen Ms. Baer and Ms. Morris exited the apartment [the record reflects they exited a few minutes later], Ms. Baer stated that she had seen approximately fifteen marijuana plants inside, ranging in size from \u2018beginning plants\u2019 to three feet in height [and that Mr. Estep was not in the apartment and it was at this time that respondent went back into the apartment]. Officer Hook testified that he called for backup and three officers responded [Officers Gilbert, Long, and Miller]. Officer Hook explained that he called for backup because of the odor of marijuana. After the other officers arrived, Ms. Baer advised Officer Hook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>that she had just seen appellant running in the alley at the rear of the apartment.' Officer Hook then noticed appellant [respondent] running with a black plastic garbage bag. Officer Hook pursued appellant on foot. Appellant dropped the bag, [went approximately ten more feet] and the police took him into custody. In the bag, although not visible prior to searching it, the police found \u2018pot[s] of marijuana plants, high intensity lamp, electric scales, a multi-colored bag that contained marijuana seeds, and a pipe with marijuana residue.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-5\">\u201cA search warrant[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] was obtained for the apartment, and additional evidence was seized. Appellant moved to suppress the items seized from his person and the apartment, arguing that they were the fruits of the poisonous tree because his arrest was illegal and the warrant was based on information obtained during the bail bond agents\u2019 prior illegal entry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-6\">\u201cThe suppression court ruled that (1) Officer Hook was credible; (2) the bail bonds agents were not State actors; and (3) Officer Hook had probable cause to arrest appellant and search the bag, based upon (A) the smell of marijuana emanating from the apartment, and (B) Ms. Baer\u2019s statement that marijuana plants were inside the apartment. Consequently, according to the suppression court, the subsequent search of the apartment pursuant to a warrant was also legal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 303-05, 771 A.2d at 480-81 (some alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"ACW\">a. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">Our review of a Circuit Court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence under the Fourth Amendment is limited, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>ordinarily, to information contained in the record of the suppression hearing and not the record of the trial. <em>See Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 368, 735 A.2d 491, 497 (1999); <em>In re Tariq A-R-Y, </em>347 Md. 484, 488, 701 A.2d 691, 693 (1997); <em>Simpler v. State, </em>318 Md. 311, 312, 568 A.2d 22, 22 (1990); <em>Trusty v. State, </em>308 Md. 658, 670, 521 A.2d 749, 755 (1987). When there is a denial of a motion to suppress, we are further limited to considering facts in the light most favorable to the State as the prevailing party on the motion. <em>Riddick v. State, </em>319 Md. 180, 183, 571 A.2d 1239, 1240 (1990); <em>Simpler, </em>318 Md. at 312, 568 A.2d at 22. In considering the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, we extend great deference to the fact-finding of the suppression hearing judge with respect to the weighing and determining first-level facts. <em>Lancaster v. State, </em>86 Md.App. 74, 95, 585 A.2d 274, 284 (1991); <em>Perkins v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 341, 346, 574 A.2d 356, 358 (1990). When conflicting evidence is presented, we accept the facts as found by the hearing judge unless it is shown that his findings are clearly erroneous. <em>McMillian v. State, </em>325 Md. 272, 281-82, 600 A.2d 430, 435 (1992); <em>Riddick, </em>319 Md. at 183, 571 A.2d at 1240. Even so, as to the ultimate conclusion of whether an action taken was proper, we must make our own independent constitutional appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case. <em>Riddick, </em>319 Md. at 183, 571 A.2d at 1240; <em>Munafo v. State, </em>105 Md.App. 662, 669, 660 A.2d 1068, 1071 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">b. Fourth Amendment Guarantee</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures by government, not private individuals. <em>See United States v. Jacobsen, </em>466 U.S. 109, 113, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 1656, 80 L.Ed.2d 85, 94 (1984); <em>Waters v. State, </em>320 Md. 52, 60, 575 A.2d 1244, 1247-48 (1990). The protections of the Fourth Amendment are applicable to the State of Maryland through the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. <em>See Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1691, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081, 1090 (1961); <em>Owens v. State, </em>322 Md. 616, 622, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>589 A.2d 59, 61 (1991). \u201cThe Fourth Amendment is not, of course, a guarantee against <em>all </em>searches and seizures, but only against <em>unreasonable </em>searches and seizures.\u201d <em>United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 682, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 1573, 84 L.Ed.2d 605, 613 (1985); <em>see In re Tariq A-R-Y, </em>347 Md. at 490, 701 A.2d at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In addition, even where the police have some connection to a search and seizure by a private party, the Fourth Amendment has been held not to apply where the police do not attempt to coerce, dominate or direct the private party. <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 489-90, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2049-50, 29 L.Ed.2d 564, 596 (1971). So, generally, when a private party acts for his or her own purpose without police instigation or participation, and subsequently gives seized items to the police, there is no State action. <em>Coolidge, </em>403 U.S. at 486-90, 91 S.Ct. at 2048-50, 29 L.Ed.2d at 594-96. This general rule of non-agency, however, does not mean that private actors cannot become state actors based on the facts of a particular case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the burden rests upon respondent to establish government involvement and to thereby be entitled to suppress evidence that was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, as \u201cthe burden of establishing government involvement in a private search rests on the party objecting to the admissibility of the evidence.\u201d <em>Waters, </em>320 Md. at 60, 575 A.2d at 1247-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Finally, when determining if a search or seizure by a private individual invokes the Fourth Amendment, the question is \u201cif the private individual whose actions are in question, \u2018in light of all the circumstances of the case, must be regarded as having acted as an \u201cinstrument\u201d or agent of the state.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57, 575 A.2d at 1246 (quoting <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 487, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2049, 29 L.Ed.2d 564, 595 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>c. Bail Bond Agents</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">In Maryland, the bail bond system is governed by statute and Rule. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2001), Title 5 <em>Release, </em>Subtitle 2 <em>Pretrial Release </em>of the Criminal Procedure Article; Md. Rules 4-216 and 4-217. Further, bail bond agents are subject to strict regulations and licensing requirements by various other provisions of the Maryland Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Shifflett v. State, </em>319 Md. 275, 572 A.2d 167 (1990), we affirmed the Court of Special Appeals and held that bail bond agents have broad common law powers to arrest principals, much greater than the powers normally possessed by private citizens. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-6\">\u201cThe jury convicted the petitioner, and she was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment on the resisting arrest and battery convictions. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments. <em>Shifflett v. State, </em>80 Md.App. 151, 560 A.2d 587 (1989). It held that the bail bondsmen\u2019s authority under the common law to arrest the principal was broader than that of a private citizen to arrest. It quoted at length from <em>Taylor v. Taintor, </em>83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 366, 371-72, 21 L.Ed. 287 (1872), as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-7\">\u2018When bail is given, the principal is regarded as delivered to the custody of his sureties. Their dominion is a continuance of the original imprisonment. Whenever they choose to do so, they may seize him and deliver him up in their discharge, and if that cannot be done at once, they may imprison him until it can be done. They may exercise their rights in person or by agent. They may pursue him into another State, may arrest him on the Sabbath, and if necessary, may break and enter his house for that purpose. The seizure is not made by virtue of new process. None is needed. It is likened to the rearrest by the sheriff of an escaping prisoner____ In [Anonymous,] 6 Modern [231], it is said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>\u201cThe bail have their principal on a string, and may pull the string whenever they please and render him in their discharge.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-5\"><em>Shifflett v. State, </em>319 Md. 275, 277, 572 A.2d 167, 168 (1990) (alteration in original).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">We have held that the fact that a private person must be licensed by the State to engage in their employment does not make that person a \u201cState agent\u201d for Fourth Amendment search and seizure purposes. In <em>Waters v. State, </em>320 Md. 52, 575 A.2d 1244 (1990), Waters argued that the cocaine taken out of his pocket by a security guard, Paul Madden, was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and seizures because the security guard was acting as a State agent. Specifically, Waters contended that because private detective agencies were regulated and licensed by the State, private security guards that work for private detective agencies are similar to special police officers \u201cwho are commissioned by the Governor and exercise general police powers in the protection of their employer\u2019s property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55, 575 A.2d at 1245. Therefore, Waters alleged that Madden\u2019s seizure of the cocaine from his pocket involved state action and should not be admissible at trial because it was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">We held that the mere licensing and regulation of the security guards, without being vested with arrest or other police powers, was not enough to qualify the security guards as State agents. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-8\">\u201cAs employees of detective agencies engaged to guard the property of their employer\u2019s clients, security guards have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>not been granted police powers by statute and therefore are not state agents in any traditional sense for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. Without governmental powers, security guards are acting as private citizens when protecting property, and their private status is not altered because their interest in protecting property coincides with the public\u2019s interest in preventing crime generally---Moreover, mere state licensing of a private individual\u2019s occupation, without more, does not constitute sufficient state control to make the individual a state agent. Nor does extensive state regulation of itself convert the actions of those regulated into state action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-7\">\u201cThe only evidence in the case'was that Madden was a licensed security guard at the time he seized the plastic bags, and the trial judge so held. Water\u2019s argument that Madden was a state agent is wholly unconvincing. Consequently, Judge Goudy correctly determined that the seized cocaine was admissible in evidence, there being no showing (or even an allegation) that Madden was working in collusion with the police at the time of the search, or otherwise acted as an instrument of the State in the performance of his duties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 59-60, 575 A.2d at 1247-48 (citations omitted). Bail bond agents, who are licensed and regulated by the State, do not have police powers by statute and are not, generally, State agents. Therefore, bail bond agents are generally not State actors for Fourth Amendment suppression purposes. In the case <em>sub judiee, </em>however, the facts demonstrate that due to the extensive participation by the officer in leading the attempt to effect entry into the apartment, the bail bond agents were working in substantial collusion with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">d. \u201cState Action\u201d Status and Our Case</p>\n<p id=\"AcX\">i. State Action Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">As we have stated, <em>supra, </em>when a private party acts for his or her own purpose without police instigation or participation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>and obtains evidence, if the party later gives the seized evidence to the police, there is no State action. <em>See Bowers v. State, </em>298 Md. 115, 138-40, 468 A.2d 101, 113-14 (1983) (holding that the search of a hotel room by the hotel\u2019s accounting supervisor did not amount to State action even though the motel had a State business license and did not necessitate suppression of evidence), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, Doering v. State, </em>313 Md. 384, 545 A.2d 1281 (1988); <em>Knight v. State, </em>59 Md.App. 129, 134-35, 474 A.2d 947, 949-50 (1984) (trespassing roofer who reported information to police not a State actor); <em>Ward v. State, </em>30 Md.App. 113, 116-17, 351 A.2d 452, 454-55 (1976) (search and seizure by member of family not State action); <em>Herbert v. State, </em>10 Md.App. 279, 290-91, 269 A.2d 430, 435-36 (1970) (private parties, who acted as \u201ccriminal informers\u201d for the police, who seized evidence at a party and turned it over to police, are not state actors).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">In the federal circuits and some other states, there are even cases involving police \u201cstand by\u201d type services, the type of service involved in the case at bar, where various courts have declined to find \u201cState action.\u201d <em>See generally United States v. Dahlstrom, </em>180 F.3d 677 (5th Cir.1999) (stating that third party search in a police officer\u2019s presence was not State action where officer was present on a peacekeeping duty), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1036, 120 S.Ct. 1530, 146 L.Ed.2d 345 (2000); <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>628 F.2d 961 (6th Cir.1980) (holding that police accompaniment to a residence while third party effectuated repossession of vehicle, and third party gives evidence found in repossessed vehicle to police not to be State action); <em>State v. Patch, </em>142 N.H. 453, 456-58, 702 A.2d 1278, 1280-82 (1997) (concluding no state action where officer who served restraining order on third party, waited for the third party to gather belongings, which belongings included evidence of defendant\u2019s criminal activity which was later given to the police by the third party).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">There, however, appears to be no bright-line test that determines government from private conduct in these types of situations. The Court of Special Appeals, while holding, generally, that bail bond agents are not State actors, recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>the authority outside of Maryland representing the proposition that bail bond agents may sometimes be State actors for certain purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">The Court of Special Appeals, in its opinion in this case, mentioned the Fourth Circuit case of <em>Jackson v. Pantazes, </em>810 F.2d 426, 430 (4th Cir.1987), wherein the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals stated, in <em>dicta, </em>that in Maryland the bail system co-exists in a symbiotic relationship, making the bail bond agents vulnerable to civil liability under 42 U.S.C. section 1983. In the next sentence, however, the intermediate appellate court noted a line of federal cases, involving bail bond agents and state actor issues from the Fifth, Eight and Ninth circuits that have rejected the theory of symbiotic relation rendering bail bond agents <em>per se </em>State actors in the context of section 1983 actions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">These federal circuit cases did not involve motions to suppress under the Fourth Amendment, the issue presented in the case <em>sub judice, </em>and we do not accept as persuasive those federal circuit cases finding <em>per se </em>state action from the simple fact that bail bond persons are involved. We believe the better view involves a case by case analysis, where the presence of \u201cState action\u201d depends upon the acts of the parties and the circumstances involved in the particular case. In <em>In re Albert S., </em>106 Md.App. 376, 386, 664 A.2d 476, 481 (1995), the Court of Special Appeals stated that State action \u201cis not measured by the primary occupation of the actor, but by the <em>capacity </em>in which he [or she] acts at the time in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Our case of <em>Waters, supra </em>(although we failed to find state action), at least to a degree, recognized the test set forth in <em>In re Albert S. </em>While we held that <em>per se </em>\u201cState action\u201d status was not created by mere licensing of security guards, we left room for \u201cState actor\u201d status for private individuals depending upon the context of the actions undertaken. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>\u201cMoreover, <em>mere </em>state licensing of a private individual\u2019s occupation, <em>without more, </em>does not constitute sufficient state control to make the individual a state agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-5\">\u201cThe burden was upon Waters, as the proponent of the motion to suppress, <em>to establish </em>that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the challenged search and seizure. In the same vein, the burden of establishing government involvement in a private search rests on the party objecting to the admissibility of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-6\"><em>Waters v. State, </em>320 Md. 52, 59-60, 575 A.2d 1244, 1247-48 (1990) (citations omitted) (emphasis added). While we held that Waters had failed to meet the burden, we implicitly acknowledged that if the burden were met, private action could be transformed into State action for Fourth Amendment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">As we have indicated, other courts had addressed when conduct involving private actors becomes government conduct. In <em>United States v. Miller, </em>688 F.2d 652 (9th Cir.1982), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit addressed the \u201cGovernment Private Search Distinction.\u201d In <em>Miller, </em>a victim of a theft contacted a federal agent and a sheriff and told them he was going to retrieve his stolen property. The federal agent and the sheriff went to the scene, but remained out of sight and took no part in the \u201cvictim\u2019s\u201d actions to recover his stolen property. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of Miller\u2019s motion to suppress, agreeing that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibitions against unreasonable searches had not been violated. The court in <em>Miller </em>examined the distinction between a search by a person acting as a private party versus as an agent for the state. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-8\">\u201cIn the proceedings below, Miller moved to suppress the evidence derived from Szombathy\u2019s visits to Miller\u2019s property. He correctly noted that, although a search or seizure conducted by a private party does not violate the Fourth Amendment, if that individual acts as an instrument or agent of the state in conducting the search, Fourth Amendment interests are implicated. <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>408 U.S. 443, 487, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971). The district court rejected Miller\u2019s contention that Szombathy acted as an instrument of the government when visiting Miller\u2019s property. It reasoned that Szombathy\u2019s prior contacts with Agent Nelson and Sheriff Boyce were not such that they made him a government agent, and that he therefore acted in a private capacity. We agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-5\">\u201cOur analysis starts with <em>United States v. Walther, </em>652 F.2d 788 (9th Cir.1981). There we noted that there is no bright line that distinguishes instances of \u2018government\u2019 conduct from instances of \u2018private\u2019 conduct, and that we should refer to certain general principles when analyzing cases in the \u2018gray area.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 791. We discussed those general principles:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-6\">While a certain degree of governmental participation is necessary before a private citizen is transformed into an agent of the state, <em>de minimis </em>or incidental contacts between the citizen and law enforcement agents prior to or during the course of a search or seizure will not subject the search to fourth amendment scrutiny. The government must be involved either directly as a participant or indirectly as an encourager of the private citizen\u2019s actions before we deem the citizen to be an instrument of the state....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-7\"><em>Id. </em>From our review of earlier cases, we discerned that two critical factors in the \u2018instrument or agent\u2019 analysis are: (1) whether the government knew of and acquiesced in the intrusive conduct, and (2) whether the party performing the search intended to assist law enforcement efforts or to further his own ends. <em>Id. </em>at 791-92.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 656-57 (footnotes omitted). In the case at bar, the Court of Special Appeals relied on <em>Miller </em>in its analysis of whether state action occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-9\"><em>\u201cMiller </em>is instructive because it discerned from the case law the following test to determine state action: did the police officer (1) instigate, (2) participate, or (3) knowingly acquiesce in the private party\u2019s search in conjunction with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>an intent by the private party to further the private party\u2019s own ends, as opposed to an intent to assist law enforcement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-5\"><em>Collins, </em>138 Md.App. at 309, 771 A.2d at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The test set forth in <em>Miller </em>has been applied by several other circuits, the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The United States District Court for Maryland, in <em>Hooper v. Sachs, </em>618 F.Supp. 963, 968 (D.Md.1985), has addressed the issue. The District Court stated that, \u201cCourts which have considered the agency question in the context of Fourth Amendment violations focus on two issues: 1) the extent of the involvement of the government, and 2) the purpose or purposes of the private citizen in conducting the search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">ii. Our Case</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">We commence our instant analysis by first considering what overt actions, if any, the .police officer took to assist the bail bond persons and the implications of that action. We then consider whether the evidence supports that the bail bond persons\u2019 purpose at the inception, and throughout the search for the principal, was limited solely to the private purposes of the bond persons.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the actions of Officer Hook in relation to the bail bond agents and respondent was more akin to non-incidental and impliedly supportive conduct, as opposed to mere standby protection services. In conjunction with the inherent nature of the bail bond process, the extra actions of the officer under the specific circumstances here present, transformed the actions of the bail bond persons into \u201cState action\u201d subjecting the search to Fourth Amendment analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">In the particular jurisdiction and police agency here involved, there existed an arrangement for \u201cstand by\u201d service for bail bond persons where the police agency would regularly furnish officers to accompany bail bond agents attempting to \u201cretake\u201d principals. The record does not reflect that this practice only existed in circumstances where the principal was a fugitive.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">On the day in question, Officer Hook was contacted by another officer, and directed to a particular location to meet one of the bail bond persons. Upon his arrival at the location, the two bail bond persons were present and informed him that they wanted him to accompany them as they sought to retake a Michael Estep. Estep was described to the officer, but as far as we can discern from the record the officer was not aware of why \u201cretake\u201d was desired. As far as the officer knew no warrant was outstanding for Estep. The bail bond persons had no copies of any warrant in their possession. Officer Hook went with them to the residence where they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>been informed that Estep might be present. It was not known to be Estep\u2019s residence, and in fact, was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Upon arriving at the residence, Officer Hook became more than \u201cstand by\u201d security. It was Officer Hook, and not the bail bond persons who knocked on the door. It was Officer Hook, not the bail bond persons, who was immediately at the door when Collins responded to the knock. At that point, any reasonable person would have believed that Officer Hook, and the persons with him, were involved in \u201cState action.\u201d When Collins opened the door, it was Officer Hook, not the bail bond persons, who \u201cAsked [Collins] if <em>we </em>[the officer and the bail bond persons] could check the residence for a wanted sub-ject____\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The record does not reflect that Officer Hook at that time informed Collins that the persons with the officer were not police officers but instead were private citizens, nor does the record reflect that the officer informed Collins that he was not present on State business but was, in effect, merely assisting private persons by \u201cstanding by\u201d for security purposes. The officer also did not advise Collins in respect to the bail bond persons\u2019 private rights, if any, to force entry into the residence of one other than the person they were seeking to retake. Neither does the record reflect that the bail bond persons advised Collins that they were there on private, not State, business. At this point, a reasonable person would have perceived that \u201cState action\u201d was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Collins responded to the officer\u2019s question by denying entry to the apartment, and telling the officer that the person being sought was not in the apartment (Estep was not in the apartment). At that point, the bail bond persons, without, as far as we can discern from the record, informing Collins that they were not \u201cState actors,\u201d told Collins that they were going into the apartment in spite of his refusal to consent to their entry. Collins still declined to consent to their entry. At this point, a reasonable person, with a police officer present assist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>ing the speaker, would likely believe that \u201cstate agents\u201d were informing Collins they were going to force entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">One of the bail bond persons then asked Collins if anyone else was within the premises. Collins then called into the apartment and another subject came out. It was not Estep. That person then told one of the bail bond persons she could enter the apartment to look for Estep. Whether Collins, at this time, agreed to her entry is not clear from the record. The record does not reflect that, even at this point, the officer informed the occupants of the apartment that it was private, not \u201cState action\u201d that was in process.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Collins, Officer Hook, and apparently the other bail bond person remained outside the opened door as the other occupant and a bail bond person went into the apartment. At this point, the officer testified that he smelled the odor of burnt marijuana. According to the officer, the odor became stronger the longer the door stayed open. Still, at this time the officer took no action and did not call for backup.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">When the bail bond person came out of the apartment, she informed Officer Hook, in Collins\u2019s presence, that she had seen approximately fifteen marijuana plants of various sizes growing inside the apartment. At this point, Collins reentered the apartment telling his dog to watch the officer and the two bail bond persons. Collins then closed the door leaving the officer and his companions on the porch with the dog. Even at this late time in the process, Collins was not informed that what had occurred was private action.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">At this point, while watched by the dog, Officer Hook radioed for other officers to join him, the bail bond persons, and the dog. After two other officers arrived, one of the bail bond persons informed Officer Hook that she was observing Collins running down an alley with a black plastic bag over his shoulder. At this point, the bail bond persons had utilized the services of the officer to knock on the door, and to inform Collins that they desired to enter to search for a \u201cwanted\u201d person; yet neither the officer nor the bail bond persons had informed Collins of the private nature of the request and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>officer included the bail bond person in his generic use of the word \u201cwe\u201d when seeking entry. A bail bond person had then entered and when she exited had informed the officer of the collateral things she had observed in the apartment. At that point, the officer claimed to have smelled marijuana while standing near the door that had been opened upon his knocking. The bail bond persons had also informed the officer that Collins was running down the alley.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Upon receiving this last information, Officer Hook, through his own observations, saw Collins running down the alley. The group on the porch then proceeded down the alley. The group included the dog, who expanded the services he was performing for his master beyond merely watching the officers, to impeding their progress down the alley. We are not informed of the physical characteristics of the dog. We make the inference that, regardless of his size and disposition, he (or, perhaps, she) was aiding and assisting its master, as is the wont of \u201cman\u2019s best friend.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Ultimately, the police officers convinced Collins to relieve the dog of his most recently conferred duties. Collins then tied the dog\u2019s leash to the bumper of a car, and Collins was arrested. The contraband in the bag formed the basis for the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">It is clear to this Court, as it was to the Court of Special Appeals, that the actions of the officer and the bail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>bond persons in the present case were, from the beginning and almost to the point of arrest, so intertwined with each other, that the entire action from its inception took on the characteristics of \u201cState action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">In sum, what occurred was, under the circumstances of this case \u201cState action\u201d and should have undergone a complete Fourth Amendment analysis, including a determination as to whether there was a valid consent to search. We need not, in this opinion, go into the case law pertaining to Fourth Amendment exceptions or if consent by \u201cJimmy,\u201d the second person in the apartment, constituted a valid exception. The question presented to this Court on appeal covers only the bail bond agents and their role as State actors. As held by the Court of Special Appeals, it remains up to the Circuit Court on remand to determine the validity of the consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-8\">. Officer Hook testified generally that a \"service to stand by\u201d is a service, for the protection of bail bond persons, police routinely perform by accompanying the bond person to the residence.
