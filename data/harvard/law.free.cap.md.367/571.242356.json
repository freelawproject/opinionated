In the same proceeding, Petitioner was convicted of premeditated murder of, and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony against Lawrence Bradshaw, his alleged accomplice in the crimes against Ms. Johnson. The same jury sentenced Petitioner to death for the murder of Ms. Johnson.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Petitioner received life without possibility of parole for the murder of Lawrence Bradshaw.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In the initial direct appeal, this Court reversed the burglary conviction, affirmed the murder and other convictions, and vacated the death sentence, finding with regard to the latter that the trial court committed reversible error in admitting a portion of the pre-sentence investigation report referring to Petitioner\u2019s prior juvenile charges that had not resulted in a finding of delinquency. <em>See Conyers v. State, </em>345 Md. 525, 575, 693 A.2d 781, 805 (1997) <em>(\u201cConyers </em>I\u201d). The case was remanded to the Circuit Court for Wicomico County for a new sentencing proceeding relating solely to the murder of Ms. Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">In January 1998, a new capital sentencing proceeding was conducted before a jury in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Petitioner, represented by different trial counsel, was sentenced again to death for the murder of Wanda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Johnson.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the second direct appeal, this Court affirmed. <em>See Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 200, 729 A.2d 910, 946, <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 910, 120 S.Ct. 258, 145 L.Ed.2d 216 (1999) <em>(\u201cConyers II\u201d). </em>The U.S. Supreme Court denied further review. <em>See Conyers v. Maryland, </em>528 U.S. 910, 120 S.Ct. 258, 145 L.Ed.2d 216 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">On 7 March 2000, pursuant with the provisions of Maryland\u2019s Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act, Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 645 A-J and Md. Rules 4-401 through 4-408, and 8-306, Petitioner, through yet different trial counsel, filed a petition for post conviction relief<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, alleging, among other things, due process violations, ineffective assistance of counsel, and various trial court errors. After an evidentiary hearing, the Circuit Court<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> denied Petitioner post conviction relief by an Order dated 30 January 2001. The court found Petitioner\u2019s allegations of due process violations unsupported by the evidence. As to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the court concluded Petitioner\u2019s assertions were without merit. The court dismissed Petitioner\u2019s contentions of trial and sentencing court errors, finding the actions to be proper. Finally, the court rejected Petitioner\u2019s challenges to Maryland\u2019s death penalty procedure and method of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>On 28 February 2001, pursuant to the provisions of Md. Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 645-1 and Md. Rule 8-306, Petitioner filed with this Court an application for leave to appeal denial of post conviction relief. The application was granted on 11 May 2001. We shall reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s petition for post conviction relief and remand this case to the Circuit Court for Wicomico County for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Prior to the recitation of the issues presented for our consideration here, we set out the underlying facts regarding Petitioner\u2019s convictions, as recounted by the post conviction hearing judge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">At approximately 9:35 p.m., on Friday, October 21, 1994, Petitioner\u2019s estranged girlfriend, Monica Wilson, went to visit her mother, Wanda Johnson, at the home Ms. Johnson shared with her husband, Elwood Johnson. Ms. Wilson had just spoken with her mother at 9:00 p.m. that evening, and her mother had agreed to babysit for Ms. Wilson\u2019s son. Arriving with Ms.. Wilson at the Johnson home was her cousin, Carla Clinton.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">As the two women approached the Johnson home, they saw someone looking outside through a second floor bedroom window. The women knocked on the door, and, as they waited for someone to open it, they saw through a window a man walking down the stairs. The women saw this man turn off the lights inside the house and duck down as if to avoid being seen. The two women walked to a back door and knocked on it. The women heard sounds of a struggle, described as a \u201ccommotion,\u201d \u201ctussling\u201d and \u201cfighting,\u201d coming from inside the house. Then Ms. Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>began to scream, and a window on the second floor broke over the women\u2019s heads.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">The two women fled to the home of a relative who lived nearby and called the police. On the way to the relative\u2019s house, Ms. Wilson noticed a car parked across the street from her mother\u2019s house. The car resembled one that Petitioner sometimes borrowed from his former girlfriend and mother of his child, Debra Meyers. Upon returning to the Johnson home, Ms. Wilson was informed by the police that her mother was dead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">There were no signs of forced entry into the Johnson home. Wanda Johnson\u2019s body was found in the master bedroom. She had been shot three times in the head, once in the back, and once in the arm. It was Ms. Johnson\u2019s custom to keep a small amount of money in her wallet. Furthermore, when Ms. Wilson spoke to Ms. Johnson earlier that evening, at approximately 9:00 p.m., Ms. Johnson said that she had twenty dollars. Ms. Johnson\u2019s open wallet was found atop her dresser in the master bedroom; there was no money in the wallet. In the den, a door to a closet had been forced open, revealing a safe. The closet door had a hasp and a lock on it for security, but the hasp and lock had been pried out of the door jamb to gain access to the closet. Pulling the hasp out of the door jamb had caused splinters to fall on the floor around the closet. The safe inside the closet was closed. Mr. Johnson opened the safe the day after his wife\u2019s murder; it contained fifteen dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">The next day, Ms. Clinton worked with a police artist on a sketch of the man she had seen on the staircase inside the Johnson home the evening before. Ms. Wilson was asked to look at the sketch that had been made based on Ms. Clinton\u2019s description. Petitioner, who had come to the police station to keep Ms. Wilson company, took the sketch away before Ms. Wilson had a chance to see it, telling the police that the sketch would upset her. When Ms. Wilson finally had a chance to see the police sketch, she did not immediately identify Lawrence Bradshaw as the man depicted in the sketch. She made a photo identification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>another man, who was arrested and incarcerated for a brief time as a result. Ms. Wilson later agreed, however, that the police sketch looked like Lawrence Bradshaw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">Shortly after 1:00 a.m. on October 23,1994, approximately 27 hours after the murder of Ms. Johnson, Lawrence Bradshaw was shot in the 4300 block of McDowell Lane. This street is located in the Lansdowne area, near Debra Meyers\u2019s home. Mr. Bradshaw had been shot three times in the head, once in the back, once in the arm, and once in the finger. Mr. Bradshaw was taken to Shock Trauma, where he died the following day. <em>Conyers I, </em>345 Md. at 534-36, 693 A.2d at 785-86.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">As to Johnson, Petitioner was convicted of premeditated murder, felony murder, first-degree burglary, robbery with a deadly weapon, attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, robbery, attempted robbery, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and sentenced to death. With respect to Bradshaw, Petitioner was found guilty of premeditated murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and sentenced to life without parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals found the evidence was insufficient to sustain Petitioner\u2019s conviction for the burglary of Johnson\u2019s home, but sustained the remaining convictions. Regarding sentencing, the Court of Appeals held that certain portions of Petitioner\u2019s juvenile record that were contained in the pre-sentence investigation (PSI) report should not have been presented to the jury because the material was considered \u201cinflammatory and highly prejudicial.\u201d <em>Conyers I, </em>345 Md. at 563, 693 A.2d at 799. Consequently, Petitioner was granted a new sentencing hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">At the second capital sentencing hearing,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> during the State\u2019s case, Charles Johnson (no relation to the victim, Wanda Johnson, or her husband) testified that while he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s cellmate<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> at the Baltimore County Detention Center in October-November of 1994, Petitioner discussed the robbery at [Wanda] Johnson\u2019s home. Charles Johnson stated Petitioner told him that he and a person named \u201cMolek\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> went to Wanda Johnson\u2019s house and Petitioner went upstairs to rob a safe. Charles Johnson testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">\u201cDuring the robbery, someone came to the door. At that point, Ms. Johnson yelled out ... her daughter\u2019s name or something of that nature. And Clarence panicked, because, I guess, they would recognize him is what he said, and as a result, he wound up shooting Ms. Johnson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">Charles Johnson went on to state that Petitioner told him that while both he and \u201cMolek\u201d were upstairs at first, when they heard noise, \u201cMolek\u201d ran downstairs. After [Wanda] Johnson was shot, \u201cMolek\u201d ran but Petitioner waited until no one was outside before he left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">Wanda Johnson\u2019s husband, Elwood Johnson, testified that Petitioner was a frequent visitor to their home. He also described the layout of the home, providing specific details about a spare bedroom that contained a safe in a closet. The safe, which contained personal papers and petty cash, had a combination lock and the closet was secured with a lock and hasp. Mr. [Elwood] Johnson stated that earlier in the day, the safe and closet were in normal condition but when he returned after the shooting the closet had been forced open and the hasp was broken. Furthermore, his wife\u2019s wallet was lying open on a dresser in their bedroom, which normally would have been inside her purse and placed in a cabinet or dresser drawer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Wilson, the victim\u2019s daughter, basically recapped her trial testimony, describing her past relationship with Petitioner, her arrival at her mother\u2019s home with her cousin and son, hearing noise and her mother\u2019s screams, fleeing the scene and going for help down the street, and finally being informed of her mother\u2019s murder. Wilson also testified to Petitioner\u2019s efforts to prevent her from seeing the composite sketch of Bradshaw that her cousin helped develop and to keep her from reading or viewing any news related to the murder. Wilson stated Petitioner knew about the safe in her parents\u2019 spare bedroom and that he was aware her mother was not normally home on Friday evenings. Wilson knew that Petitioner owned a .38 caliber pistol, the type of weapon used to kill her mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">Carla Clinton, Wilson\u2019s cousin who was with her at the crime scene, also repeated her trial testimony as to going to the Johnson house, seeing someone downstairs, hearing noise and her aunt\u2019s screams from inside the house, and finally assisting the police in the development of a composite sketch of the person she saw in the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">Also during the State\u2019s case, a stipulation was presented to the jury regarding the recovered cartridges and the fact that they were all fired from a .38 caliber handgun. In addition, Victoria Gibson, the victim\u2019s sister, testified as a victim impact witness, describing her sister\u2019s nature and personality and the warm relationship she had with her entire family. Furthermore, Petitioner\u2019s PSI report, which was redacted to the satisfaction of both the State and defense, was introduced into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">During the defense\u2019s case, Arthur Rogers testified that he was incarcerated with Charles Johnson during October 1994 and at one point he discovered Johnson \u201crifling through my charging documents.\u201d Ventura McLee testified that he was incarcerated in October 1994 with Petitioner and Charles Johnson. During this period, Charles Johnson showed McLee indictment papers, police reports, and photographs relating to Petitioner\u2019s case. Timothy Wren testified that while he was incarcerated with Charles Johnson during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>August and October 1994, Charles Johnson told him that he had seen Petitioner\u2019s charge papers, that he had heard Petitioner talk about the case in his sleep, and that Petitioner had confessed his guilt. Eric Spencer, who resided in the cell next to Charles Johnson and Petitioner in October 1994, testified that he never heard Petitioner discussing his case with Charles Johnson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">Testifying as mitigation witnesses were Petitioner\u2019s parents, Clarence Conyers, Sr., and Eleanor Conyers, as well as Reverend William Felder. Petitioner exercised his right of allocution, stating that he \u201chad no involvement in this crime whatsoever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Additional facts will be provided as relevant to the respective issues we shall consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">\n<em>Petitioner\u2019s Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Petitioner asserts two instances of prosecutorial misconduct based upon the State\u2019s failure to disclose material impeachment evidence, that he was entitled to receive, concerning an important State\u2019s witness,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Charles Johnson (no relation to the victim, Wanda Johnson). First, Petitioner contends that the State failed to disclose, at trial or sentencing, evidence that Johnson sought a benefit relative to a pending charge when he met with police on 23 November 1994,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> at which meeting he provided incriminating information on Petitioner. Moreover, Petitioner asserts, the State persisted in its deception regarding the complete circumstances surrounding Charles Johnson\u2019s coming forward by presenting at sentencing, without correction, the false testimony of Johnson, and corroborating testimony of Detective Phillip Marll, regarding the absence of such solicitation by Johnson, and then misled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the jury in its closing arguments concerning Johnson\u2019s unselfish motives in coming forward and his credibility as a witness. Second, Petitioner contends that the State failed to provide documentation contained in its files of unsuccessful efforts by the police to verify the accuracy of a number of statements Johnson provided the police during the 23 November 1994 meeting, and instead offered Detective Marll\u2019s false testimony at sentencing that the police had verified \u201ceach and every\u201d statement made by Johnson.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Petitioner argues that the lack of disclosure, aggravated by the presentation of false testimony, in each instance, was a violation of Petitioner\u2019s due process rights under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) and its progeny.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Petitioner also asserts an ineffective assistance of counsel claim citing numerous instances of deficiencies of trial and sentencing counsel, trial court error, and additional claims of error. Petitioner presents a total of nineteen (19) questions for our review.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We have consolidated them into fourteen (14) questions, grouped according to whether they pertain to the guilt/innocence phase, the sentencing proceeding, or the post conviction hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Guilt/innocence Phase Errors</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\">I Did the post conviction court err in finding that the State did not deny Petitioner due process in the guilt/innocence phase of trial by withholding certain material, impeachment evidence pertaining to the testimony of its key witness, Charles Johnson, in conjunction with the presentation of false testimony by and about Charles Johnson relative to such evidence, along with the State\u2019s misleading closing arguments commending Mr. Johnson\u2019s credibility, in violation of <em>Brady?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">II Did the post conviction court err in concluding that Petitioner was not denied the effective assistance of counsel at the guilt/innocence phase of trial with respect to the testimony of Charles Johnson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">III Did the post conviction court err in concluding Petitioner was in no other respect deprived of the effective assistance of counsel at the guilt/innocence phase of trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">IV Did the post conviction court err in finding that Petitioner suffered no prejudice from the omission of certain jury instructions at the guilt/innocence phase of trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">V Did the post conviction court err in finding that cumulative ineffective assistance of counsel error does not require a new trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">VI Did the Circuit Court properly deny Petitioner\u2019s claim that the State\u2019s summations at the guilt/innocence phase of trial violated due process where the State implied in the trial summation that the jurors should be afraid of Petitioner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">VII Should this Court consider three claims denied by the post conviction court, which were included solely to preserve the record for future federal review?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Sentencing Errors</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">VIII Did the post conviction court err in finding that the State did not deny Petitioner due process at sentencing by withholding certain material, impeachment evidence pertaining to the testimony of its key witness, Charles Johnson, in conjunction with the presentation of false testimony by and about Charles Johnson relative to such evidence, along with the State\u2019s misleading closing arguments commending Mr. Johnson\u2019s credibility, in violation of <em>Brady ?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">IX Did the post conviction court err in concluding that Petitioner was not denied the effective assistance of counsel at sentencing with respect to the testimony of Charles Johnson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">X Did the post conviction court err in concluding Petitioner was in no other respect deprived of the effective assistance' of counsel at sentencing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">XI Did the post conviction court err in finding that the sentencing form properly consolidated the jury\u2019s finding regarding the robbery and attempted robbery aggravators into one item where the evidence of the robbery predicate was legally sufficient to find the defendant guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">XII Did the post conviction court err in finding that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), had no applicability to the present case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-10\">XIII Did the post conviction court err in finding that cumulative ineffective assistance of counsel error does not require a new sentencing?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">Post Conviction Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-12\">XIV Did the post conviction court improperly quash Petitioner\u2019s subpoena to the Department of Corrections to obtain testimony and documents pertaining to methods of execution where such subpoena was essential to proving that Maryland\u2019s lethal injection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>method of execution is cruel and unusual punishment violative of the Eighth Amendment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">\n<em>The State\u2019s Waiver Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">As a preliminary matter, the State asserts that, pursuant to the provisions of Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 645A(c)(2),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claims (I and VIII) were waived, having been raised for the first time in the post conviction proceeding. Petitioner counters that, in fact, it is the State\u2019s waiver argument that has been waived in accordance with Md. Rule 8-131 (a),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> as it was not presented to the Circuit Court during the post conviction proceedings, and, accordingly, was not addressed by the hearing judge in his opinion of 30 January 2001. Moreover, Petitioner asserts the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>State\u2019s waiver claim fails on its merits, as the factual predicate for the State\u2019s violations did not become apparent until Detective Marll\u2019s testimony during the evidentiary hearing on the post conviction petition, at which point Petitioner filed a timely supplement to his amended petition for post conviction relief to include the newly discovered <em>Brady </em>claims.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We agree with Petitioner\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Petitioner\u2019s claims of <em>Brady </em>violations relate to the examination of Charles Johnson, and related corroboration testimony of Detective Marll, stemming from Johnson\u2019s meeting with Detectives Marll and Tincher on 23 November 1994. During that meeting, Johnson provided the detectives with non-public information concerning the murders of Ms. Johnson and Bradshaw that allegedly only the murderer would know. Johnson\u2019s statement indicated that he had not been promised any favors in exchange for the information in his statement. The statement was silent as to whether he asked for any favors.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">On 14 December 1994, Petitioner\u2019s then trial counsel asked the State to provide all <em>Brady </em>material.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The State complied on 9 February 1995 by making available to Petitioner its file containing allegedly all relevant documents,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> stating that \u201c[a]t the present time, there is no information known to the State which is exculpatory, in any manner to the Defendant.\u201d Like<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>wise, in the State\u2019s 11 December 1995 response to Petitioner\u2019s motion to compel the State to comply with Md. Rule 4-263(a)(1),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the State reiterated its open file policy, explaining that \u201c[t]he State has not put itself even in the position of determining what could be exculpatory,\u201d and furthermore claiming that its actions taken in this regard were <em>\u201cwell </em>beyond the discovery requirements of Maryland Rule 4-263.\u201d None of the documents in the State\u2019s files indicated that Johnson at any time sought a personal benefit for his cooperation, nor was there documentation indicating that there had been any unsuccessful attempts by the police to verify the information Johnson provided them at the 23 November 1994 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Charles Johnson first testified on 18 January 1996 at a suppression hearing regarding Petitioner\u2019s alleged jailhouse confession to Johnson. Johnson stated that his intention in contacting the police initially was to speak with them on Petitioner\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> When asked if he requested a deal for the information, Johnson responded that he \u201cdidn\u2019t right out ask for a deal.... [He] didn\u2019t feel as though [the police] could offer [him] a deal.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s counsel nonetheless challenged Johnson\u2019s motive in contacting the police, relying on his known 13 January 1995 plea agreement with the State on a pending robbery charge. Johnson responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">[T]he only thing they have done is, well, I was found guilty on the charge that I was charged with, and as far as I know, I haven\u2019t been sentenced to anything, but I believe that my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>armed robbery charge was reduced to a robbery, because I wasn\u2019t involved in the robbery.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Similarly, at trial, Johnson testified that his sole motivation in contacting the police was to \u201cspeak on [Petitioner\u2019s] behalf that [Petitioner] didn\u2019t intentionally go in there with the intent or premeditation to kill Miss Johnson, that it happened because he panicked____\u201d At the sentencing proceeding, Johnson denied Petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s accusation that he intended, from the outset, to lie about Petitioner\u2019s alleged confession in order to seek a deal on his pending charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Detective Marll denied at trial that any inducements had been offered to Johnson in exchange for the information. On direct examination, the prosecutor pointedly asked Detective Marll about any agreement between Johnson and the police:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">[State:] Had you or Detective Tincher made any promises to Mr. Johnson concerning any information that he would provide you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-9\">[Detective Marll:] No, sir, we did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">During Petitioner\u2019s sentencing hearing on 27 January 1998, Detective Marll was questioned on direct examination by the State about his interview with Johnson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-11\">[State:] [D]uring the course of your conversations with [Charles Johnson] and then obtaining a written statement from Mr. Johnson, did he at any time ever ask you for any promises or favors in return for the information he was giving you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-12\">[Detective Marll:] No, sir, he did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-13\">Detective Marll also testified that the police had verified \u201ceach and every\u201d non-public statement that Johnson had provided them at the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>In its initial closing argument at trial, the State argued Johnson\u2019s credibility as a witness to the jury and his altruistic motives in contacting the police:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">Mr. Johnson told us the truth .... he came in here and told the truth because it was the right thing to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">In the State\u2019s rebuttal closing, the prosecutor again emphasized Johnson\u2019s credibility as a witness, and reinforced the fact that he had no deal when he provided the police with his statement. The prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">[Charles Johnson] walked in here and said the truth, he complied with his plea agreement .... he\u2019s telling you the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">[I]t\u2019s untrue that anyone went to Charles Johnson and said, hey, let\u2019s cut you a deal so you can tell us some info. No, Charles Johnson went to the police and gave them information about Clarence Conyers. And there was no deal when he told the police, November the 23rd of 1994 he gave them a seven-page statement about what he knew and what Clarence Conyers had told him. No deals at that time. He told them what he knew.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">In the sentencing phase, the State commented again on Johnson\u2019s credibility as a witness, noting that Johnson\u2019s statements were \u201call true .... all accurate,\u201d and that he \u201ccame in [to court] and told [the jurors] the truth.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">Petitioner\u2019s counsel nonetheless argued, at both trial and sentencing, that Johnson was simply a lying jailhouse snitch, motivated by self-interest in obtaining his subsequent plea agreement with the State regarding his robbery charges. Petitioner underscored the benefit Johnson received from the State, which allowed him to reduce a potential, maximum jail term of 244 years on the nineteen count indictment for robbery, to a recommended sentence of one to six years, for, <em>inter alia, </em>his guilty plea to a one count misdemeanor charge of conspiracy to commit robbery, and his agreement to testify \u201ctruthfully\u201d at Petitioner\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>While Johnson\u2019s testimony was addressed by this Court in other contexts in the two prior direct appeals,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Petitioner never raised there a claim relative to the State\u2019s failure to disclose potential impeachment evidence concerning Johnson or the State\u2019s use of assertedly not fully accurate testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">On 2 October 2000, Detective Marll again testified at the post conviction hearing about his 23 November 1994 meeting with Johnson. On this occasion, however, Detective Marll indicated that indeed Johnson had queried the detectives about a possible deal. When Detective Marll informed Johnson that the police did not have the authority to commit to a deal, but would refer his inquiry to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office, Johnson declined to sign his written statement, electing instead merely to initial the pages. Detective Marll also revealed, for the first time, that several statements Johnson provided the police during the 1994 meeting either were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>disproved subsequently by the police or were found by them to be unverifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">On 26 October 2000, Petitioner filed a timely supplement to the amended petition for post conviction relief raising, for the first time, the claim that the State denied Petitioner due process, and specifically, that (a) the State failed to disclose that Johnson had requested a benefit, that he refused to sign his statement absent a commitment to receive a benefit, and that Detective Marll agreed to pass along Johnson\u2019s request to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office; (b) the State failed to correct Johnson\u2019s and Detective Marll\u2019s prior testimony denying that Johnson initiated an inquiry regarding receipt of a benefit for his cooperation at both the trial and sentencing proceedings; (c) the State failed to provide to the defense documentation in its possession indicating that there had been any unsuccessful attempts by the police to verify the non-public information Johnson provided in his 1994 meeting with police; and, (d) the State failed to correct Detective Marll\u2019s sentencing testimony that he had verified \u201ceach and every\u201d non-public statement made by Charles Johnson during the 1994 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Petitioner\u2019s claims of <em>Brady </em>violations were addressed and argued on the merits in Petitioner\u2019s Memorandum of Law Supporting Post Conviction Relief, filed 4 December 2000, and the State\u2019s responsive Memorandum of Law Opposing Post Conviction Relief, dated 21 December 2000. The State did not argue waiver of the <em>Brady </em>claims during the post conviction proceedings, and, accordingly, the hearing judge did not address waiver in his opinion of 30 January 2001. The State first raised the waiver claim in its Response in Opposition to Application for Leave to Appeal from Denial of Post Conviction Relief in a Capital Case, filed with this Court on 19 April 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">B.

Appellate review under these exceptional circumstances is discretionary, not mandatory. <em>See Bell, </em>334 Md. at 188, 638 A.2d at 113. <em>See also, e.g., </em>Md.

State, </em>254 Md. 655, 661, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>255 A.2d 28, 31 (1969) (alteration in original) (citation omitted)). The State had an opportunity to raise its waiver claim during the post conviction proceedings, but instead chose to argue Petitioner\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claims on the merits. As a result, the post conviction court did not address waiver in connection with these arguments. While this Court may decide, in its discretion and under exceptional circumstances, matters not raised in the proceedings below, the State\u2019s contention does not merit exceptional treatment here. Nor has the State referred us to any legal authority that would support exempting the State from any of the general waiver rules in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Moreover, the State\u2019s assertion that Petitioner\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claims were waived pursuant to Art. 27, \u00a7 645A(c)(2), is misguided. In pertinent part, \u00a7 645A(c)(2), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">When an allegation of error <em>could </em>have been made by a petitioner before trial, at trial, on direct appeal (whether or not said petitioner actually took such an appeal), ... in a prior petition under this subtitle, or in any other proceeding actually instituted by said petitioner, but was not in fact so made, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that said petitioner intelligently and knowingly failed to make such allegation. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The fundamental question the State advances here is whether Petitioner\u2019s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct relating to the testimony of Charles Johnson have been waived by his failure to challenge the violations at trial or in the direct appeals. Petitioner argues that it is axiomatic that you \u201ccannot waive what [you] could not reasonably know.\u201d We agree with Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Inherent in the language of \u00a7 645A(c)(2) is the presupposition that an opportunity to raise the challenge existed at the time of the lower court proceeding. <em>See, e.g., Hunt v. State, </em>345 Md. 122, 142, 691 A.2d 1255, 1265 (1997) (noting that \u201cdefense counsel\u2019s acceptance of the jury panel was sufficient to bar any subsequent objection thereto\u201d); <em>Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 271, 681 A.2d 30, 37 (1996) (recognizing that Oken\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>counsel\u2019s decision not to raise the adequacy of the voir dire on appeal was a deliberate one); <em>Walker v. State, </em>343 Md. 629, 647, 684 A.2d 429, 437-38 (1996) (noting that petitioner\u2019s post conviction challenge to a jury instruction was waived by his failure to raise it when it was given). <em>See also, e.g., Wyche v. State, </em>53 Md.App. 403, 407, 454 A.2d 378, 380 (1983) (noting that if a right alleged to have been violated is a non-fundamental right, \u201cwaiver will be found if it is determined that the <em>possibility </em>existed for the petitioner to have raised the allegation in a prior proceeding, but he did not do so\u201d). (Emphasis added). In each of these instances the factual basis for the defendant\u2019s claim was available to the defendant, but was not properly preserved. That is not the circumstance in the case <em>subjudice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Petitioner\u2019s trial and sentencing counsels, surmising from the known fact of the plea bargain, argued inferentially that Johnson\u2019s testimonial motivation, rather than the truth for its own sake, was entirely self-interest. The discrepancies between Johnson\u2019s testimony denying he requested a favor (when he did) and Detective Marll\u2019s corroborating testimony, however, were not revealed until Detective Marll\u2019s post conviction testimony. Similarly, there was no apparent discrepancy concerning police verification, <em>vel non, </em>of Johnson\u2019s 1994 statements regarding non-public information regarding the crimes until Detective Marll\u2019s post conviction testimony revealed otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The State cannot frustrate trial counsel\u2019s access to the factual basis for making a <em>Brady </em>claim, then cry foul when Petitioner does not raise such a challenge on direct appeal. This Court is satisfied from review of the relevant portions of the record that the factual predicate underlying Petitioner\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claims relating to the testimony and examination of Charles Johnson did not arise until the post conviction eviden-tiary hearing, at which point Petitioner properly raised these issues. Indeed, the State provides no evidentiary support for its bald allegation that Petitioner waived his claim under the waiver provision of \u00a7 645A(c)(2). Accordingly, we shall review Petitioner\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claims on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>\n<em>The Brady Issues (I and VIII)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">A. <em>Brady </em>Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">As indicated above, Petitioner\u2019s flagship contentions are that he was prejudiced by the State\u2019s violations of its constitutional obligations to Petitioner under <em>Brady. </em>We begin our analysis by identifying the essential elements Petitioner must establish to succeed on a <em>Brady </em>challenge. As we recently explained in <em>Wilson v. State, </em>363 Md. 333, 345-47, 768 A.2d 675, 681-83 (2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">The Supreme Court made clear in <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>[Brady, </em>373 U.S.] at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196-97, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. In order to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, Petitioner must establish \u201c(1) that the prosecutor suppressed or withheld evidence that is (2) favorable to the defense \u2014 either because it is exculpatory, provides a basis for mitigation of sentence, or because it provides grounds for impeaching a witness \u2014 and (3) that the suppressed evidence is material.\u201d Evidence that is obviously favorable must be disclosed even absent a specific request by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">Impeachment evidence, as well as exculpatory evidence, is \u201cevidence favorable to an accused.\u201d <em>[C]f. Napue v. People of Ill., </em>360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 1177, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959) (holding that the prohibition against the use of false testimony applies even when the evidence goes only to the credibility of the witness because the jury\u2019s assessment of credibility can be determinative of guilt or innocence).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">The failure to disclose evidence relating to any understanding or agreement with a key witness as to a future prosecution, in particular, violates due process, because such evidence is relevant to witness\u2019s credibility. The Supreme Court explained in <em>Giglio [v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 154-55, 92 S.Ct. 763, 766, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972) ] that, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the government depends almost entirely on the testimony of a key witness to establish its prima facie case and the witness\u2019s credibility, therefore, is an important issue, \u201cevidence of <em>any </em>understanding or agreement as to a future prosecution would be relevant to his credibility....\u201d <em>See id. </em>(emphasis added). This Court underscored the same point in <em>Ware [v. State, </em>348 Md. 19, 702 A.2d 699 (1997) ] when we concluded that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s duty to disclose applies to <em>any </em>understanding or agreement between the witness and the State.\u201d <em>Ware, </em>348 Md. at 41, 702 A.2d at 710. (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">The standard for measuring the materiality of the undisclosed evidence is strictest if it \u201cdemonstrates that the prpsecution\u2019s case includes perjured testimony and that the prosecution knew, or should have known, of the perjury.\u201d In <em>[United States v.] Agurs, </em>[427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2397, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976) ] the Supreme Court explained that \u201ca conviction obtained by the knowing use of perjured testimony is fundamentally unfair, and must be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d In cases where there is no false testimony but the prosecution nonetheless fails to disclose favorable evidence, the standard for materiality, in the language of the Supreme Court, is whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>[SJee ... Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Materiality is assessed by considering all of the suppressed evidence collectively. The question, therefore, \u201cis not whether the State would have had a case to go to the jury if it had disclosed the favorable evidence, but whether we can be confident that the jury\u2019s verdict would have been the same,\u201d which is determined in reference to the sum of the evidence and its significance for the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>(Some citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Applying the above analysis in Conyers\u2019s case, we must determine whether (1) the State suppressed or withheld evidence that was (2) favorable to the Petitioner and (3) whether the suppressed evidence was material.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">B. Charles Johnson\u2019s Request for a Benefit</p>\n<p id=\"AyM\">\n<em>1. State Suppression</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">The State argues that the post conviction hearing judge correctly found that Charles Johnson did not seek a benefit in exchange for the <em>information </em>he provided the police on 23 November 1994; accordingly, so the argument goes, the State could not have suppressed evidence of such a request. For that same reason, the State contends the hearing judge correctly concluded that Johnson and Detective Marll testified accurately and truthfully in the lower court proceedings when they denied that Johnson requested a benefit in exchange for the incriminating information against Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Moreover, the State asserts Johnson\u2019s receipt of a benefit, i.e., the plea agreement relative to the robbery charges, in exchange for his later <em>testimony, </em>was known by Petitioner.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The State invites this Court to accept the post conviction judge\u2019s rationale that reconciled Detective Marll\u2019s post conviction testimony with his prior testimony by drawing a meaningful distinction between Johnson\u2019s willingness to provide the police with the incriminating information in 1994, <em>gratis, </em>and his subsequent successful negotiation with the State for a benefit in exchange for his 1996 and 1998 testimony against Petitioner. We decline the invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>It is well settled that this Court will not disturb the factual findings of the post conviction court unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>See Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 348, 768 A.2d at 683; <em>Oken, </em>343 Md. at 299, 681 A.2d at 51; <em>Gilliam v. State, </em>331 Md. 651, 672, 629 A.2d 685, 696 (1993). Finding that Charles Johnson did not seek a benefit in the course of his 1994 meeting with police, the post conviction hearing judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXT\">Charles Johnson willingly provided information to the police with no prearranged agreement or deal. He apparently elected not to sign the written statement he willingly provided in the hope that he could arrange an agreement with the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office in exchange for his <em>testimony at trial. </em>Charles Johnson was telling the truth when he said that \u201che didn\u2019t right out ask for a deal [of the police].\u201d He correctly didn\u2019t feel the police could offer a deal. Detective Marll was telling the truth that Charles Johnson didn\u2019t ask \u201cfor any promises or favors in return for the information\u201d he gave to the police. This is verified by the fact that he did give the information to the police with no agreement or deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">Charles Johnson did want an agreement in exchange for his \u201ctestimony.\u201d He knew and/or was told that the police could not accomplish that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">The only evidence which could refute the initial motivation is his subsequent act of securing an agreement to testify for the State in exchange for a benefit for him. This information was provided by the State to all counsel for the Petitioner and was the primary subject of cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Having reviewed the entire record regarding the alleged <em>Brady </em>suppression of Johnson\u2019s full negotiations for a benefit, we find the post conviction court\u2019s factual findings are not supported by the record, and we disagree with its conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">The State\u2019s duty to disclose exculpatory evidence as enunciated in <em>Brady </em>is to ensure that a defendant receives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>a fair trial. <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1197, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (noting that \u201c[s]ociety wins not only when the guilty are convicted but when criminal trials are fair.\u201d). <em>See also United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 675, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3380, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985) (stating that \u201c[t]he <em>Brady </em>rule is based on the requirement of due process____[T]he prosecutor is ... to disclose evidence favorable to the accused that, if suppressed, would deprive the defendant of a fair trial.... \u201d). Evidence will be deemed to be suppressed within the meaning of <em>Brady </em>if it is \u201c \u2018information which had been known to the prosecution but unknown to the defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spicer v. Roxbury Corr. Inst., </em>194 F.3d 547, 557 (4th Cir.1999) (noting the prosecutor acknowledged withholding evidence pertaining to inconsistent statements of its key identification witness to defendant\u2019s counsel) (quoting <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. at 103, 96 S.Ct. at 2397, 49 L.Ed.2d 342); <em>Ware, </em>348 Md. at 39, 702 A.2d at 709 (stating that the necessary inquiry is \u201cwhether the defendant knew or should have known facts that would have allowed him to access the undisclosed evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">There is no question that the State knew that Johnson was seeking a benefit when he met with police in 1994. Detective Marll\u2019s post conviction testimony revealed that Johnson asked what could be done for him, albeit <em>subsequent </em>to his providing the police with a written, but unsigned, statement of Petitioner\u2019s alleged confession to him. The following exchange took place between Petitioner\u2019s counsel and Detective Marll at the post conviction hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">[Counsel:] Did Mr. Johnson ask you or mention anything in any way in the first hour and a half of his interrogation about his pending charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">[Detective Marll:] I don\u2019t recall____ It seems to me that once the written statement was done, obviously, because there was a question about Mr. Johnson not signing the bottom of the form that he brought up that basically he wanted something done in his behalf by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, and that\u2019s why he initialed the form in our presence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>We have no doubt that Detective Marll understood the implications of Johnson\u2019s request, as Johnson refused to sign his statement without a commitment for a benefit, choosing instead only to initial the pages. In that regard, Detective Marll testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">At that time, I asked if he would sign the bottom of the statement form, and he said he didn\u2019t want to, he didn\u2019t feel comfortable signing it, but he said he would put his initials there, and he did, he wrote them on each page in front of us and placed his initials on each line next to the signature block area, and at that time, we were done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">It is equally clear that Detective Marll ostensibly offered to act as an intermediary between Johnson and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office. Detective Marll testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">After these seven pages were done, what I asked Mr. Johnson to do was to review and sign each one of them, and that\u2019s when the question came up about his \u2014 he would have had \u2014 whatever charge it was that he had that he wanted to know what can be done for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">And at the time, we said we don\u2019t make any deals, we can\u2019t make any promises. The only thing we can do is take the statement to the State\u2019s Attorney Office, and they can get in touch with your attorney and anything along that line can be done by them. We stay entirely out of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Facts known to the police will be imputed to the State for <em>Brady </em>purposes. <em>See Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 280-81, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 1948, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999) (noting the <em>Brady </em>rule \u201cencompasses evidence \u2018known only to police investigators and not to the prosecutor\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 438, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 1568, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995)); <em>Boone v. Paderick, </em>541 F.2d 447, 451 (4th Cir.1976) (attributing the knowledge of the police to the Government, the Court noted, \u201c \u2018[t]he police are also part of the prosecution, and the taint on the trial is no less if they, rather than the State\u2019s Attorney, were guilty of the nondisclosure.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Barbee v. Warden, </em>331 F.2d 842, 846 (4th Cir.1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">It is undisputed that the substance of Detective Marll\u2019s testimony concerning the commencement and course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>of Johnson\u2019s negotiations for a benefit was withheld from Petitioner until the post conviction hearing. Petitioner\u2019s pretrial requests for disclosure of <em>Brady </em>material, discussed <em>supra, </em>failed to elicit any documentation concerning Johnson\u2019s negotiations for a deal. Petitioner reasonably relied upon the State\u2019s open file policy as fulfilling the prosecution\u2019s duty to disclose the evidence he requested. <em>See Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 283 n. 23, 119 S.Ct. at 1949 n. 23, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (stating that \u201cif a prosecutor asserts that he complies with <em>Brady </em>through an open file policy, defense counsel may reasonably rely on that file to contain all materials the State is constitutionally obligated to disclose under <em>Brady\u201d). </em>The reasonableness of Petitioner\u2019s reliance was confirmed by the State\u2019s statement that it had <em>\u201cwell\u201d </em>exceeded the requirements of <em>Brady </em>by providing Petitioner with all pertinent portions of its files.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">We shall not entertain the State\u2019s hair-splitting in honoring form over substance. The record demonstrates that Petitioner\u2019s counsel attempted, based on the plea bargain alone, to persuade the jury that Johnson sought a favor for his allegedly fabricated testimony regarding Petitioner\u2019s alleged confession.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s various counsel were understandably unsuccessful in uncovering on their own the full circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>precipitating the ultimate plea bargain. The sole basis offered by the State, and accepted by the post conviction judge, for resisting disclosure of the full extent of the negotiations was the State\u2019s arbitrary and circumscribed interpretation of Petitioner\u2019s cross-examinations of Johnson and Detective Marll concerning the matter. Indeed, Johnson and Detective Marll nimbly sidestepped complete and accurate responses by interpreting the questions posed to them in terms of \u201cpromises or favors\u201d in exchange for Johnson\u2019s 1994 \u201cinformation,\u201d rather than for his later testimony. In effect, these witnesses intellectually bifurcated the pertinent course of events in order to make the nice distinctions offered at the post conviction hearing as explanations for why their earlier testimony was not incomplete or perhaps simply false.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The State\u2019s lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>candor was never more apparent as when, at sentencing, the State pointedly asked Detective Marll if Johnson had \u201cat any time\u201d during the course of their conversations ever asked him for \u201cany promises in return for the <em>information\u201d </em>that he provided, eliciting Detective Marll\u2019s categorical response, \u201cNo sir, he did not.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">It is clear to us that the State\u2019s and the witnesses\u2019 deceptive approach was intended to evade the thrust of Petitioner\u2019s questioning. We find the commencement of Johnson\u2019s negotiations leading up to the plea agreement for his testimony against Petitioner, and the fact that he declined to sign the written statement because no immediate commitment for a benefit was forthcoming, to be inseparable conceptually from his initially apprising the police of the incriminating information. After all, Johnson\u2019s unsigned, written statement would be of limited or no value to the State without his consistent in-court testimony.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> We find that the evidence concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Johnson\u2019s initial request for a benefit and his refusal to sign the written statement when such a benefit was not immediately forthcoming was within the exclusive control of the State, and the State\u2019s failure to disclose this evidence upon request consequently constituted a \u201csuppression\u201d within the meaning of <em>Brady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">\n<em>2. Evidence Favorable to the Petitioner</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A5C\">To succeed on a <em>Brady </em>claim, Petitioner also must establish that the suppressed evidence was favorable to his defense. As indicated above, favorable evidence encompasses not only exculpatory evidence, but also evidence that may be used to impeach the credibility of a witness. <em>See Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 345-46, 768 A.2d at 681-82. The Court has recognized the importance of impeachment evidence, noting that \u201c \u2018if disclosed and used effectively, [impeachment evidence] may make the difference between conviction and acquittal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spicer, </em>194 F.3d at 556 (quoting <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 676, 105 S.Ct. at 3380, 87 L.Ed.2d 481). <em>See also Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 282 n. 21, 119 S.Ct. at 1949 n. 21, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (recognizing that <em>Brady\u2019s </em>disclosure requirements \u201cextend to materials that, whatever their other characteristics, may be used to impeach a witness\u201d). <em>Cf. Napue, </em>360 U.S. at 269, 79 S.Ct. at 1177, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (\u201cThe jury\u2019s estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence, and it is upon such subtle factors as the possible interest of the witness in testifying falsely that a defendant\u2019s life or liberty may depend.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>It is well established that the State\u2019s failure to disclose the existence of a plea agreement with a key witness violates <em>Brady </em>standards, because the terms of the agreement might provide evidence regarding the witness\u2019s motivation to testify. <em>See Giglio, </em>405 U.S. at 154-55, 92 S.Ct. at 766, 31 L.Ed.2d 104; <em>Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 348, 768 A.2d at 683; <em>Ware, </em>348 Md. at 50, 702 A.2d at 714 (recognizing that evidence of a plea agreement between the State and a witness is \u201cpowerful impeachment evidence\u201d that \u201cenables a defendant to attack the motive or bias of a witness .... \u201d and must be disclosed to the accused); <em>Marshall v. State, </em>346 Md. 186, 198, 695 A.2d 184, 190 (1997) (recognizing that a jury is entitled to know the terms of a plea agreement between a State and its witness so that it may assess whether the witness\u2019s testimony \u201chas been influenced by bias or motive to testify falsely\u201d); <em>cf. Napue, </em>360 U.S. at 270, 79 S.Ct. at 1177, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (holding that the failure of the prosecutor to correct the false testimony of a witness relating to the absence of an inducement by the State for his testimony was prejudicial for impeachment purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Recently, under the dictates of <em>Brady, </em>this Court, in <em>Wilson v. State, </em>363 Md. 333, 768 A.2d 675 (2001), reversed a petitioner\u2019s conviction where the State failed to disclose the specific terms of its written plea agreements with two key codefendant witnesses, even where the jury had been apprised of the existence of the agreements through the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses. <em>Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 356, 768 A.2d at 687. We rejected the State\u2019s argument that its disclosure was sufficient, determining that the specific terms of the written plea agreements were favorable to Wilson\u2019s impeachment strategy and should have been disclosed. <em>Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 349, 768 A.2d at 683-84. This was particularly true, the Court noted, where the witnesses\u2019 testimony concerning the terms of the agreements were inaccurate, and were then further mis-characterized by the State in closing arguments. <em>Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 356, 768 A.2d at 687. <em>Wilson </em>is instructive in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Here, while Petitioner and the jury were aware of the existence of Johnson\u2019s plea agreement in return for his testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>mony, the State withheld arguably related circumstances leading up to its consummation, namely, that Johnson, indeed, requested a favor, and that he refused to sign his written statement absent such a commitment. This was evidence that disputed Johnson\u2019s later testimony (and the State\u2019s trial arguments), which information would have strengthened Petitioner\u2019s assertion that Johnson had fabricated Petitioner\u2019s alleged confession in an effort to gamer a benefit on outstanding charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The State argues that Johnson\u2019s self-interest was \u201cmore than adequately\u201d presented to the jurors, and that they were presented with a \u201cfull picture\u201d of Johnson through his testimony. We disagree. Defense counsel was entitled to explore and argue from all of the pertinent evidence as to Johnson\u2019s bias and credibility. Suppression of this evidence deprived the jurors of a full opportunity to evaluate the credibility of Johnson\u2019s testimony, and Detective Marll\u2019s corroborating testimony, and deprived Petitioner of potentially valuable impeachment evidence. The difference in potential impeachment value of this information increased during the sentencing phase, as we discuss further <em>infra, </em>because of Johnson\u2019s position as the key witness to Petitioner\u2019s principalship in the murder of Wanda Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Similar to <em>Wilson, </em>the value of the suppressed information as impeachment evidence was confirmed by the State\u2019s efforts to conceal it from Petitioner. The State offered, without correction, Johnson\u2019s testimony asserting his altruistic motives in contacting the police and repeated denials of his solicitation of a <em>quid pro quo </em>for the information. The State persisted in this tact by placing a police detective on the witness stand to bolster indirectly Johnson\u2019s testimony, both as to motive in giving it and in substance. The State\u2019s conduct continued in its closing arguments, at trial and sentencing, in which it extolled Johnson\u2019s credibility as a witness, knowing its own sins of omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">While it is true that Petitioner vigorously cross-examined Johnson in an attempt to discredit his testimony, and argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>by inference a link between Johnson\u2019s motive in coming forward and the plea agreement, that does not necessarily vitiate any error caused by the State\u2019s failure to disclose this impeachment evidence. <em>See Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 351, 768 A.2d at 684 (stating that cross-examination of a witness regarding inducement \u201cto testify does not substitute for adequate disclosure\u201d); <em>Boone, </em>541 F.2d at 451 (noting that \u201c[n]o matter how good defense counsel\u2019s argument may have been, it was apparent to the jury that it rested upon conjecture \u2014 a conjecture which the prosecutor disputed.\u201d). <em>See also Martin v. State, </em>-So.2d-,-, 2001 WL 1520631, 2001 Ala.Crim.App. Lexis 298, 21 (Ala.Crim.App. 2001) (likening defendant to a \u201cfighter with one hand tied behind his back \u2014 the fact that he was able to land a few punches in cross-examination with one fist did not make the match a fair one\u201d). Under the facts of this case, the State\u2019s failure to disclose the impeachment evidence violates <em>Brady </em>principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">\n<em>S. Material Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Petitioner\u2019s final obstacle in establishing a <em>Brady </em>violation is materiality. As this Court explained in <em>Wilson, </em>discussed <em>supra, </em>there are two different materiality standards<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>may be applied to the analysis of suppressed exculpatory evidence. The strictest, and more defendant-friendly, <em>Na-pue/Agurs </em>standard applies in those cases where \u201c \u2018the prosecution\u2019s case includes perjured testimony and ... the prosecution knew, or should have known, of the perjury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 346-47, 768 A.2d at 682 (quoting <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. at 103, 96 S.Ct. at 2397, 49 L.Ed.2d 342). The Supreme Court explained in <em>Agurs </em>that \u201c \u2018a conviction obtained by the knowing use of perjured testimony is fundamentally unfair,\u2019 \u201d accordingly, it \u201c \u2018must be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. at 103, 96 S.Ct. at 2397, 49 L.Ed.2d 342). <em>See Napue, </em>360 U.S. at 272, 79 S.Ct. at 1179, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">A different standard of materiality applies in those cases where there is no perjured testimony, but there is prosecutorial failure to disclose exculpatory evidence. Under the <em>Brady/Bagley </em>materiality standard, evidence will be deemed material if \u201c \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>proceeding would have been different. A \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\u2019 \u201d of the case. <em>Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 347, 768 A.2d at 682 (quoting <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. at 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (opinion of Blackmun, J.)). <em>See also Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 433-34, 115 S.Ct. at 1565, 131 L.Ed.2d 490. This Court has interpreted the <em>Strickland </em>\u201creasonable probability\u201d standard to mean a \u201c \u2018substantial possibility that ... the result of [the] trial would have been any different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 347 n. 3, 768 A.2d at 683 n. 3 (quoting <em>State v. Thomas, </em>325 Md. 160, 190, 599 A.2d 1171, 1185 (1992)). <em>See also Thomas, </em>325 Md. at 190 n. 8, 599 A.2d at 1185 n. 8; <em>Bowers v. State, </em>320 Md. 416, 426-27, 578 A.2d 734, 739 (1990). This standard applies to \u201cthe \u2018no request,\u2019 \u2018general request,\u2019 and \u2018specific request\u2019 cases of prosecutorial failure to disclose evidence favorable to the accused.\u201d <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. at 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (opinion of Blackmun, J.).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <em>See Ware, </em>348 Md. at 48, 702 A.2d at 713 (noting that under <em>Bagley, </em>the Court \u201cno longer distinguishes] for purposes of determining the standard of materiality among cases in which the defense made a specific request as opposed to a general request or no request at all\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Petitioner asserts that the stricter standard of materiality enunciated in <em>Napue </em>applies under the facts of this case, arguing that the State affirmatively presented perjured testimony. Accordingly, Petitioner contends, a new trial, or at least a new sentencing, is required because there was a \u201creasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 347, 768 A.2d at 682 (citation omitted). Petitioner alternatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>argues that he is entitled to a new trial or sentencing because he meets the <em>Brady/Bagley </em>standard of materiality, as there was a \u201csubstantial possibility\u201d that the outcome of the trial or sentencing would have been different had the withheld information been disclosed. <em>See Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 347 n. 3, 768 A.2d at 683 n. 3. (citations omitted). While the <em>Napue </em>standard of materiality is not indicated in the present case, <em>supra </em>note 32, we are satisfied that Petitioner has met the stricter standard of showing materiality under <em>Brady/Bagley. </em>The record supports our conclusion that, had the evidence relating to Johnson\u2019s complete negotiations for a benefit been disclosed, there was a substantial possibility that the outcome would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">We base our conclusion on several factors this Court has used to assess materiality for purposes of suppressed impeachment evidence. <em>See Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 352-55, 768 A.2d at 685-87.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> First, Johnson was a key State\u2019s witness as to Petitioner\u2019s principalship in Wanda Johnson\u2019s murder. Principalship directly governs Petitioner\u2019s eligibility for the death penalty. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1998 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 413(e)(1) (restricting the death penalty only to persons convicted of first degree murder as a principal in the first degree). A principal in the first degree is \u201c \u2018one who actually commits a crime, either by his own hand, or by [an] inanimate agency, or by an innocent human agent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gary v. State, </em>341 Md. 513, 520, 671 A.2d 495, 498 (1996) (quoting <em>Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 510, 495 A.2d 1, 12 (1985) (alteration in original) (citation omitted)). Johnson\u2019s testimony concerning Petitioner\u2019s alleged confession affirmatively and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>directly cast Petitioner, rather than his alleged accomplice (Bradshaw), as the actual perpetrator of her murder.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Second, a determination of the relative significance of the suppressed evidence requires an understanding of the evidence that was presented at trial and sentencing. <em>See Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 353, 768 A.2d at 685 (noting that the testimony of a codefendant witness provided the \u201conly direct link between Petitioner and the crime\u201d). The State disputes that Johnson\u2019s testimony at trial and sentencing was the only evidence of Petitioner\u2019s involvement or, as to Ms. Johnson\u2019s death, his principalship, respectively, in the murders. While that may be so, the other evidence to which the State refers is circumstantial. As indicated <em>supra, </em>the sentencing testimony, other than Johnson\u2019s, placed only Lawrence Bradshaw in the victim\u2019s home at the time of her murder. While there was circumstantial evidence adduced during the guilt/innocence portion of the trial that would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that Petitioner was a participant in her murder, it is less apparent that, absent belief of Johnson\u2019s testimony, the evidence would have been sufficient to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, Petitioner was the principal. If Johnson\u2019s testimony is to be believed, there are no inferences that need be drawn from the circumstantial evidence, either at trial or sentencing, in order to conclude that Petitioner was involved, or the shooter, in both murders. We should not be understood to hold, however, that the circumstantial evidence at trial and sentencing, exclusive of Johnson\u2019s testimony, necessarily was constitutionally insufficient for a reasonable jury to convict or render a sentence of death. We hold only that the taint of the <em>Brady </em>suppression matters on this record so undermines our confidence in the murder convictions and death sentence that a new trial is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>We reject the State\u2019s argument that the jury was provided with a \u201cfull picture\u201d of Johnson through the testimony at both trial and the sentencings, referring to vigorous efforts by Petitioner\u2019s lawyers to portray Johnson as a jailhouse snitch out to get a deal. For the reasons discussed <em>supra, </em>we cannot say that if the jury was informed of the totality of the circumstances leading up to Johnson\u2019s ultimate plea agreement, there would not be a substantial possibility that the outcome would have been different had the withheld information been disclosed. <em>See Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 353, 768 A.2d at 686 (noting that Wilson\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s attempt to cross-examine the State\u2019s key witnesses \u201cwas far less effective than it would have been\u201d had he possessed the written agreements that specified the terms).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Finally, the State was an active participant in the \u2018smoke and mirrors\u2019 effort to mislead the Petitioner and jury as to the full circumstances preceding and precipitating Johnson\u2019s plea agreement. As previously noted <em>supra, </em>the prosecutor at sentencing expressly asked Detective Marll if Johnson had \u201cat any time ever ask[ed][him] for any promises or favors in return for the information he was giving [him],\u201d deliberately eliciting Detective Marll\u2019s denial. In closing argument at trial, the prosecutor trumpeted Johnson\u2019s version of why he contacted police by claiming Johnson told the truth \u201cbecause it was the right thing to do.\u201d In both proceedings, the State emphasized Johnson\u2019s credibility as a witness. The importance of Johnson\u2019s credibility was evidenced by the State\u2019s efforts to argue his credibility in its last words to the jury. <em>See Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 355, 768 A.2d at 687 (recognizing that \u201cthe \u2018likely damage\u2019 of the State\u2019s suppression of evidence in this case \u2018is best understood by taking the word of the prosecutor ... during closing argument.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Ware, </em>348 Md. at 53, 702 A.2d at 715 (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Applying the final test of materiality pertinent to these facts, we conclude that the State suppressed material impeachment evidence of Johnson\u2019s negotiations for a benefit. Accordingly, we reverse, based on the <em>Brady </em>claims, the lower court\u2019s judgment denying Petitioner post conviction relief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>We remand this case to the Circuit Court for Wicomico County for a new trial.

Agurs, </em>[427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976)], where we identified three situations arguably within the ambit of <em>Brady </em>and said that in the first, involving knowing use of perjured testimony, reversal was required if there was \"any reasonable likelihood\u201d that the false testimony had affected the verdict. <em>Agurs, </em>[427 U.S.] at 103, 96 S.Ct. at 2397 (citing <em>Giglio v.

In <em>Agurs, </em>we thought a less demanding standard appropriate when the prosecution fails to turn over materials in the absence of a specific request.

The majority\u2019s reversal is based not upon the law but upon its interpretation of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>What is clear is that the purpose of the whole line of <em>Brady </em>cases is to insure that the trier of fact has before it any material impeachment (in this case) evidence. The impeachment evidence in this case was that Johnson, the witness at issue, received benefits for his testimony by way of a favorable plea bargain in respect to unrelated charges he was facing.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">\u201cHere, while Petitioner and the jury were aware of the existence of Johnson\u2019s plea agreement in return for his testimony, the State withheld arguably related circumstances leading up to its consummation, namely, that Johnson, indeed, requested a favor, and that he refused to sign his written statement absent such a commitment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The favor Johnson requested was the plea agreement he received from the State and that plea agreement was made known to the jury. It is almost, I would suggest, universally understood that plea bargaining constitutes favors. Additionally, the very use of the general term \u201cbargain\u201d implies a give and take procedure where things are withheld and other things offered; some are accepted, some are rejected. When the jury was informed of the plea agreement, it, impliedly, was informed that a give and take process for Johnson\u2019s testimony had been undertaken and been consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Additionally, the majority\u2019s reasoning is, in my view, sophistic in nature. Parsed of extraneous material, the majority is holding that because the detective\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s testimony about their prior communications was the <em>type </em>of testimony that could tend to obscure the existence of a beneficial plea bargain for Johnson on his unrelated charges, the case must be reversed under <em>Brady, </em>even though the beneficial plea bargain was, in fact, fully disclosed to the jury. The jury was fully apprised of the possible motive of Johnson to fabricate his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">The purpose of the <em>Brady </em>holding (as applied in the impeachment context) is to insure that the jury is made aware of the motive for fabrication on the part of the witness, not to mandate that every nuance of the process from which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>motive to fabricate originates be remembered and/or disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Had Johnson\u2019s plea bargain not been disclosed to the jury, the dictates of the <em>Brady </em>line of cases would not have been met and I would join the majority. In my view, however, the requirements of <em>Brady </em>were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The majority does not address the other issues. Nonetheless, were I writing for the majority of the Court, I would affirm on all issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Judge WILNER has authorized me to state that he joins in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-14\">. <em>Brady v.
