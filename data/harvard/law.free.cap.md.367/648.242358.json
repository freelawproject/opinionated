After completing their shopping, Mrs. Tyson and her grandchildren left the mall and entered the parking lot where Mrs. Tyson had parked her red Buick. When they arrived at the car, Carly sat in the rear seat and, as Adam was preparing to enter the front passenger seat and Mrs. Tyson was preparing to enter the driver\u2019s seat, a man ran up to Mrs. Tyson and shot her in the head. Adam heard his grandmother scream and he saw the man shoot her. Adam then saw the man run to a blue truck and enter on the left side.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mrs. Tyson died at the scene from the gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">On the evening of June 6, 1991, at approximately 8:30 p.m., Scott Faust was traveling behind the Westview Mall on the way to visit his father who lived directly behind the mall. As Mr. Faust was driving, he noticed a blue Chevrolet Blazer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>truck and a red Buick parked side by side in the mall parking lot. Mr. Faust watched as two men jumped into the Blazer and sped away. Mr. Faust then noticed that a person was lying on the ground next to the open driver\u2019s side door of the Buick. Mr. Faust drove closer to the Buick at which time he saw that the person laying on the ground was a woman and that she was bloody. He watched as a little girl ran around the front of the Buick from the passenger\u2019s side and screamed, \u201cMom Mom\u2019s shot.\u201d Mr. Faust saw a woman run over and take care of the children, therefore, Mr. Faust decided to pursue the Blazer.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">Mr. Faust caught up to the Blazer after several blocks and as he was sitting behind the Blazer at a stop light, he wrote down the license plate number of the Blazer on a tissue box. Mr. Faust then headed back to the crime scene at which time he gave the police the tissue box with the license plate number on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The information provided by Mr. Faust was relayed to the Baltimore County Police Department. Two officers of the Baltimore County Police Department then saw the Blazer pass them at which time the officers pursued the vehicle. When the Blazer\u2019s path was blocked, the two passengers of the Blazer fled on foot. The officers immediately apprehended Gregory Lawrence, the driver of the Blazer, who gave them the description of the passenger in the Blazer. A Baltimore County Police Officer then apprehended Wesley Baker nearby. When Baker was apprehended, the police officer observed blood on Baker\u2019s right leg, including his pant leg, sock, and shoe. After a visual inspection, no blood was seen on Lawrence\u2019s clothing. Baker was identified as the passenger in the Blazer by the police officer who saw him flee the Blazer and by Mr. Faust, who had witnessed him riding in the passenger seat of the Blazer.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Mrs. Tyson\u2019s MOST card was found on the floor of the passenger\u2019s side of the Blazer. The handgun that shot and killed Mrs. Tyson was found between the front seats of the Blazer. Mrs. Tyson\u2019s purse and wallet were found on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>same path as that used by Baker when he fled. Baker\u2019s palm print and fingerprints were found on the exterior of the Blazer\u2019s passenger side and Baker\u2019s fingerprints were found on the driver\u2019s side door and window of the victim\u2019s Buick.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Baker was charged by indictment that was filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on June 24, 1991. The indictment, in compliance with Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Article 27 section 616,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9ID\">\u201cSTATE OF MARYLAND, BALTIMORE COUNTY,- TO WIT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-6\">The Jurors of the State of Maryland, for the body of Baltimore County, do on their oath present that WESLEY EUGENE BAKER AND GREGORY LAWRENCE late of Baltimore County aforesaid, on the 6th day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-one at Baltimore County, aforesaid, feloniously, willfully and of deliberately premeditated malice aforethought did kill and murder one Jane Frances Tyson; contrary to the form of the Act of Assembly in such case made and provided, and against the peace, government and dignity of the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Baker and Lawrence were also charged in the indictment with robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, two handgun violations, and possession of a revolver by persons convicted of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">On August 8, 1991, in compliance with Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol., 1991 Cum.Supp.), Article 27 section 412(b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>State notified Baker of its intention to seek the death penalty and of the aggravating circumstance upon which the State intended to rely. The notice sent to Baker stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">\u201cNOTICE OF INTENTION TO SEEK</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1C\">SENTENCE OF DEATH</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">Now comes the State of Maryland by and through Sandra A. O\u2019Connor, State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore County, and S. Ann Brobst, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney lor Baltimore County, and says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-7\">Pursuant to Maryland Annotated Code, Article 27, Section 412(b)(1), the State of Maryland is hereby notifying you the Defendant in the above Indictment which charges you with the Murder of Jane Frances Tyson, Robbery with a Dangerous and Deadly Weapon of Jane Frances Tyson and other lesser offenses under Indictment Number 91CR2536, of its intention to seek the sentence of death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-8\">Pursuant to Maryland Annotated Code, Article 27, Section 412(b)(1), the State of Maryland also notifies you that it intends to rely on the following Aggravating Circumstance under Maryland Annotated Code, Article 27, Section 413(d)(10).[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>1. The Defendant committed the Murder of Jane Frances Tyson in the First Degree while committing or attempting to commit a robbery of Jane Frances Tyson on June 6, 1991, as charged in Indictment Number 91CR2536.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">On his motion, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-254,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Baker\u2019s trial was moved from Baltimore County to Harford County. On October 26, 1992, after a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Harford County, Baker was found guilty of the first degree murder of Mrs. Tyson, the robbery of Mrs. Tyson with a deadly weapon, and the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. Based on a request by Baker, the jury considered whether Baker was a principal in the first degree and found that he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">On October 27, 1992, the sentencing hearing commenced, at which time Baker had to make a determination as to whether he wanted to be sentenced by the Circuit Court or by a jury. The following exchange occurred prior to the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. We would propose at this point to advise Mr. Baker of his right to be sentenced by either a Court or a jury, and get that election made. Defendant ready to proceed on that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-5\">MR. GALVIN: [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] We are, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">THE COURT: Had adequate time to review this question with the Defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-7\">MR. GALVIN: I believe we have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-8\">THE COURT: Mr. Baker, do you feel you have had adequate time to review with counsel the issue of the election of either Court or jury to impose the sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-9\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-10\">THE COURT: We have now concluded the guilt phase of the trial, and you have been convicted, Mr. Baker, of Murder in the First Degree both as to Premeditated Murder and as to Felony Murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-11\">In addition, the jury has found beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty that you were a principal in the first degree. That is, that you committed the murder with your own hands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-12\">That second part normally can be left to the sentencing phase. Here it was your request that that be included as a part of the guilt/innoeence phase. The State did not object to that. So we submitted that question to the jury, that a jury has made that determination, and that is now a binding determination. So, that issue is behind us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-13\">The next phase of the trial is the actual sentencing phase. It will be decided whether the sentence to be imposed on the Murder conviction should be death, life without parole, or life imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-14\">Your trial was conducted above before a jury. You are not obligated to maintain that same election for sentencing. However, because you were tried by a jury, if you elect to be sentenced by a jury, you will be sentenced by the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>jury to consider guilt or innocence. So, if you have a jury, the same twelve people will be that unless we have had to excuse one, in which case one of the alternates would be used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-5\">A jury is comprised of twelve citizens selected from the voter rolls of this jurisdiction. You and your attorneys have participated in the voir dire process where the potential jurors were examined and we selected the twelve jurors and the alternates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-6\">If any juror held a belief or any potential juror held a belief either for or against capital punishment, which would prevent or substantially impair that juror from being impartial, that juror has not been allowed to serve as a juror in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-7\">In order to secure a death sentence, it is the obligation of the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you were a principal in the first degree to the murder. So, that\u2019s been submitted and that\u2019s been determined, and that determination is binding at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-8\">The State also has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravated circumstances listed in the Notice of Intent to Seek a Death Penalty exist. The same burden of proof standard will prove beyond a reasonable doubt exists regardless of whether you elect to be sentenced by the Court or by a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-9\">If you elect to be sentenced by a jury, each of these threshold determinations must be unanimous, and I am telling you that you have had the unanimous determination and that you were a principal in the first degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-10\">So, the next determination is whether or not the aggravated circumstances exist and that must be unanimous, and it must be beyond a reasonable doubt. If the sentencer, whether it be the court or jury, finds the State has satisfied its burden, the sentencer will go on to consider whether any mitigating circumstances exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Mitigating circumstances are any circumstances relating either to yourself or this trial that would tend to make the sentence of death less appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">The statute lists seven circumstances that are considered to be mitigating. To be considered, there must be proof of the existence of any of these circumstances by preponderance of the evidence. This burden exists whether the sentencer is the Court or the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-6\">In addition to the seven listed mitigating circumstances, the sentencer may write down any other fact or circumstance it finds to be mitigating. That is, anything about you or the crime that would make death less appropriate. Again, mitigating circumstances must exist by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">Further, it is necessary to convince the sentencer that both the fact and the circumstance exists, and that it is mitigating. As with the listed mitigating circumstances, this is the same whether the sentencer is the Court or jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-8\">Unlike the matters on which the State bears the burden of proof, if you elect to be sentenced by a jury, the jury need not be unanimous with respect to whether a particular mitigating circumstance exists. This is true as to both the statutory or the mitigating circumstances, and the non-statutory mitigating circumstances. That\u2019s the non-statutory, whether or not, is mitigating in the mind of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-9\">If, after a period of deliberation, the sentencing jury cannot unanimously agree on the existence of a particular mitigating circumstance, those jurors finding the mitigating circumstance will be instructed to consider it in determining the appropriate sentence. Those jurors finding that the mitigating circumstances do not exist will not consider it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-10\">Only if the jury unanimously finds that no mitigating circumstance exists, the sentence of death [can] be entered without a balancing process. If at least one juror finds at least one mitigating circumstance, a balancing process will result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Similarly, if the Court is the sentencer, a sentence of death will be imposed without a balancing process only if no mitigating circumstance is found. So, as long as at least one mitigating circumstance is found, a balancing process will result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-5\">If the Court, sitting as the sentencer, finds both that an aggravating circumstance has been proven and that a mitigating circumstance exists, the Court will balance the mitigating circumstance or circumstances found to exist against the aggravating circumstance or circumstances proven beyond a reasonable doubt to determine whether the sentence would be death or not death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-6\">The same balancing process is undertaken by a jury sitting as the sentencer where the jury unanimously concludes that an aggravating circumstance has been proven, and at least one juror concludes that a mitigating circumstance exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-7\">Whether the sentencer is the Court or a jury, the State bears the ultimate burden to establish the propriety of a death sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-8\">If the sentencer, whether Court or jury, concludes that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances, the sentence shall not be death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-9\">If the mitigating circumstances and the aggravating circumstances are in even balance, the sentence shall not be death. Only if the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances is a sentence of death to be imposed. Where the sentencer is the jury, the outcome of the balance must be a unanimous conclusion of the jury. . That is, all twelve must agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-10\">The need for jury unanimity has been noted on several occasions. If, after a reasonable] period of deliberation, the jury is unable to reach agreement unanimously on any matter for which unanimity is required, including whether a sentence of death should be imposed, a sentence of death shall not be imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>If the sentencer determines that the sentence shall not be death, then the same sentencer shall proceed to determine whether the sentence should be life or life without parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-5\">If the sentencer is a jury and they are unable to reach a verdict on the issue of death within a reasonable time, the same jury shall, nevertheless, proceed to consider the question of life or life without parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-6\">If the sentencer is a jury, a sentence of life without parole must be a unanimous decision. If the jury cannot achieve unaniminity on the issue of life without possibility of parole after a reasonable period of deliberation, a sentence of life must be imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-7\">If you choose the Court as the sentencer, then I must consider whether life or life without parole is appropriate, if I determine that death is not the proper sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-8\">First, did I cover adequately \u2014 did I make any mistakes in reading it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-9\">MISS BROBST:[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] The State is satisfied, Your Honor. Thank you very much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-10\">THE COURT: Mr. Galvin, Mr. Warren, do you feel I have adequately covered the instructions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-11\">MR. GALVIN: We do, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-12\">THE COURT: Mr. Baker, do you have any questions concerning what I have said to you here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-13\">THE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-14\">THE COURT: Have you had an opportunity to discuss this election with your attorneys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-15\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-16\">THE COURT: Have you had sufficient opportunity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-17\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>THE COURT: Are there any questions that you have of them that they have been either unwilling or unable to answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-5\">THE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-6\">THE COURT: What is your age?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-7\">THE DEFENDANT: 34.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-8\">THE COURT: How far did you go in school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-9\">THE DEFENDANT: G.E.D.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-10\">THE COURT: How many years did you actually attend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-11\">\u25a0THE DEFENDANT: To the seventh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-12\">THE COURT: And G.E.D. after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-13\">THE DEFENDANT: Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-14\">THE COURT: Prior to coming here today, have you had any medication, or drugs, or alcohol that would affect your ability to understand my instructions, hear my questions, and answer my questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-15\">THE DEFENDANT: No, Your Honor!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-16\">THE COURT: Are you prepared to make an election to whether you wish to proceed with the sentencing by Court or jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-17\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-18\">THE COURT: What is your election?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-19\">THE DEFENDANT: Sentenced by the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-20\">THE COURT: Sentenced by the Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-21\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-22\">THE COURT: You understand the jury will be discharged and have no further participation in the matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-23\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-24\">THE COURT: Do you feel you have had adequate time on this? Are you satisfied to make this election now since it is final? Once you make it, and that jury is discharged, you can\u2019t change your mind. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-25\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-26\">THE COURT: Do you wish to have further time to discuss this in any way with your attorneys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-5\">THE COURT: Then I will accept the election for the sentencing process to be with the Court. We will discharge the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">On October 30, 1992, after the sentencing hearing, the Circuit Court sentenced Baker to death for his conviction for murder. The Circuit Court also sentenced Baker to twenty years incarceration for robbery with a deadly weapon and to a consecutive twenty years incarceration for the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. On January 28, 1993, Baker filed a Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence which was denied by the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">After receiving his death sentence, Baker filed an appeal. The appeal and an automatic review of his sentence by this Court in accordance with Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl. Vol.), Article 27 section 414, were consolidated. Baker\u2019s sentence and his conviction were affirmed by this Court. <em>Baker v. State, </em>332 Md. 542, 632 A.2d 783 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">On December 23, 1994, Baker filed a Petition for Post Conviction Relief in the Circuit Court for Harford County. In his petition, Baker alleged that he had: (1) been denied his constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury as the voir dire process resulted in a prosecution-prone jury; (2) he was denied his constitutional right to a trial by a jury selected from a fair cross-section of the community by the discriminating selection of the petit jury; and (3) he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel in violation of the sixth, eighth, and fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights. After a hearing was held on July 6 and July 7,1995, the Circuit Court for Harford County issued a Memorandum Opinion that denied Baker\u2019s Petition for Post Conviction Relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">On October 21, 1996, Baker, pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Article 27 section 645A(a)(2)(iii),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Motion to Reopen the Post Conviction Proceeding. This motion was denied by the Circuit Court for Harford County on December 19,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Baker then filed a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. This petition was denied and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">On March 9, 2001, Baker filed a Motion for New Sentencing in the Circuit Court for Harford County based on newly discovered evidence. On March 22,2001, Baker filed a Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence and/or for New Sentencing Based Upon Mistake and Irregularity in the Circuit Court for Har-ford County. Both motions were denied by the Circuit Court on April 2, 2001. Baker filed a Notice of Appeal to this Court after the judgments of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Baker has presented six questions for our review.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-8\">1. Whether Mr. Baker made an unknowing and unintelligent waiver of his right to sentencing by jury when the trial court improperly advised him of what he was waiving?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-9\">2. Whether Maryland\u2019s death penalty statute is now unconstitutional on its face because it allows a sentence of death to be imposed if the State proves only that the aggravating circumstances outweigh any mitigating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-10\">3. Whether the court was without jurisdiction to impose a sentence of death because the indictment failed to allege all of the elements of capital murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-11\">4. Whether the rights identified by the Supreme Court\u2019s Decision in <em>Apprendi </em>apply to Mr. Baker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-12\">5. Whether, as a matter of fundamental fairness, and pursuant to' Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Rights, this Court should now hold that no sentence of death in Maryland is permissible unless the finder of fact unanimously finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-4\">6. Whether the Circuit Court erred and abused its discretion in denying the motion for new sentencing based on newly discovered evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">We are going to first examine the Maryland capital sentencing scheme. We will then address questions two, four, and five, all of which are concerned with the United States Supreme Court case of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We will then individually address questions one, three,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and six.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">The Death Penalty</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2001 Cum.Supp.), Article 27 section 412(b) states that \u201ca person found guilty of murder in the first degree shall be sentenced to death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The sentence for first degree murder is impris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>onment for life unless \u201c(l)(i) the State notified the person in writing at least 30 days prior to trial that it intended to seek a sentence of death, and advised the person of each aggravating circumstance[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] upon which it intended to rely, and (ii) a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>sentence of death is imposed in accordance with \u00a7 413; or (2) the State notified the person in writing at least 30 days prior to trial that it intended to seek a sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole under \u00a7 412 or \u00a7 413 of this article.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2001 Cum.Supp.) Art. 27 \u00a7 412(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">If a person is found guilty of first degree murder and the State has given the required notice seeking a sentence of death, then the court moves on to a separate sentencing proceeding under Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2001 Cum.Supp.), Article 27 section 413.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under section 413(b), the sentencing proceeding can be conducted before the jury that determined the defendant\u2019s guilt, before a jury impaneled for the sentencing proceeding, or before the court. Section 413(d) states that the court or jury, in the case <em>sub judice </em>the court, shall first consider whether any aggravating factors that make the defendant death penalty eligible have been proven by the State beyond a reasonable doubt. If no aggravating factors are found to have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt then a sentence of death cannot be imposed.

New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Following our decision in <em>Borchardt v. State, </em>367 Md. 91, 786 A.2d 631 (2001), <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which had not been filed at the time that Baker submitted his briefs or made his oral arguments before this Court, we hold that the questions submitted by Baker that rely on <em>Apprendi </em>are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-14\"><em>Apprendi </em>was not a death penalty case. It involved a New Jersey separate \u201chate crime\u201d statute that permitted a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>court to add to or enhance a maximum statutory prison sentence for a specific offense if the trial judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that \u201c[t]he defendant in committing the crime acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, gender, handicap, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.\u201d N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:44-3(e) (2000). Mr. Apprendi fired several bullets into the home of an African-American family that had recently moved into his previously all-white neighborhood. Mr. Apprendi was arrested the same night and he admitted that he was the shooter. A plea agreement was reached between Mr. Apprendi and the State in which Apprendi pled guilty to two counts of second-degree possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose and one count of the third-degree offense of unlawful possession of an antipersonnel bomb. As part of the plea agreement, the State reserved the right to request that the trial court impose an enhanced sentence on one of the second-degree offenses (count 18) on the ground that the offense was committed to intimidate because of racial bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">At the plea hearing, the trial court found enough evidence to find Apprendi guilty of the three offenses for which pled. The trial court then held an evidentiary hearing to determine why Apprendi fired the gun at the house in count 18. After hearing evidence from the State and Apprendi, the trial court determined that by a preponderance of the evidence Apprendi had shot into the house for the purpose to intimidate because of racial bias and therefore qualified for an enhanced sentence under the separate hate crime statute. The trial court then sentenced Apprendi to a twelve-year term of imprisonment on count 18<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and to shorter concurrent sentences on the other two counts. Apprendi appealed, arguing that \u201cthe Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution requires that the finding of bias upon which his hate crime sentence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>based must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 471, 120 S.Ct. at 2352, 147 L.Ed.2d at 443. The Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey and the New Jersey Supreme Court denied Apprendi\u2019s due process claim and upheld the enhanced sentence imposed under the separate \u201chate\u201d crime statute by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The United States Supreme Court reversed the decision of the New Jersey appellate courts. The Supreme Court noted that the previous year in <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), the Supreme Court had expressed doubts \u201cconcerning the constitutionality of allowing penalty-enhancing findings to be determined by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Apprendi </em>at 472, 120 S.Ct. at 2353, 147 L.Ed.2d at 444. The Supreme Court then stated that the answer to the question of whether Ap-prendi was entitled to have a jury find racial bias on the basis of proof beyond a reasonable doubt was foreshadowed when the Court was interpreting a federal statute in <em>Jones. </em>The Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-8\">\u201cWe there noted that \u2018under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 The Fourteenth Amendment commands the same answer in this case involving a state statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 476, 120 S.Ct. at 2355, 147 L.Ed.2d at 446, quoting <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 243 n. 6, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 1224 n. 6, 143 L.Ed.2d 311, 326 n. 6 (1999) (citation omitted). The Court stated that it wanted to be clear that it is not impermissible for judges to exercise discretion, when the judges are imposing a sentence that is within the statutory limits. <em>Id. </em>at 481, 120 S.Ct. at 2358, 147 L.Ed.2d at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">The Court then looked at how a statute that removes the jury from a factual determination that would decide if the defendant could be sentenced to a term of imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>exceeding the statutory maximum is a novelty when compared to historical trial practices. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-5\">\u201cWe do not suggest that trial practices cannot change in the course of centuries and still remain true to the principles that emerged from the Framers\u2019 fears \u2018that the jury right could be lost not only by gross denial, but by erosion.\u2019 <em>Jones, </em>526 U.S. at 247-248, 119 S.Ct. 1215. But practice must at least adhere to the basic principles undergirding the requirements of trying to a jury all facts necessary to constitute a statutory offense, and proving those facts beyond reasonable doubt. As we made clear in <em>Winship[</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>the \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 requirement \u2018has a vital role in our criminal procedure for cogent reasons.\u2019 397 U.S. at 363, 90 S.Ct. 1068. Prosecution subjects the criminal defendant both to \u2018the possibility that he may lose his liberty upon conviction and ... the certainty that he would be stigmatized by the conviction.\u2019 <em>Ibid. </em>We thus require this, among other, procedural protections in order to \u2018provide concrete substance for the presumption of innocence,\u2019 and to reduce the risk of imposing such deprivations erroneously. <em>Ibid. </em>If a defendant faces punishment <em>beyond that provided by statute </em>when an offense is committed under certain circumstances but not others, it is obvious that both the loss of liberty and the stigma attaching to the offense are heightened; it necessarily follows that the defendant should not\u2014 at the moment the State is put to proof of those circumstances \u2014 be deprived of protections that have, until that point, unquestionably attached.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 483-484, 120 S.Ct. at 2359, 147 L.Ed.2d at 450-451 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). The Court then went on to hold that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">\u201cIn sum, our reexamination of our cases in this area, and of the history upon which they rely, confirms the opinion that we expressed in <em>Jones. </em>Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime <em>beyond the prescribed statutory maximum </em>must be submit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>ted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. With that exception, we endorse the statement of the rule set forth in the concurring opinions in that case: \u2018It is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed. It is equally clear that such facts must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 526 U.S. at 252-253, 119 S.Ct. 1215 (opinion of STEVENS, J.); see also 526 U.S. at 253, 119 S.Ct. 1215 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-2363, 147 L.Ed.2d at 455 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">At the end of its opinion, the Supreme Court addressed whether its holding in <em>Apprendi </em>would have an effect on state capital sentencing schemes. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\">\u201cFinally, this Court has previously considered and rejected the argument that the principles guiding our decision today render invalid state capital sentencing schemes requiring judges, after a jury verdict holding a defendant guilty of a capital crime, to find specific aggravating factors before imposing a sentence of death. <em>Walton v.

Baker\u2019s third argument is that \u201cas a matter of fundamental fairness, and pursuant to Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, this Court should hold that no sentence of death in Maryland is permissible unless the finder of fact unanimously finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances.\u201d We hold that all three of Baker\u2019s arguments are without merit because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to the Maryland capital sentencing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">We have held on numerous occasions that the Maryland death penalty statute is constitutional and more specifically we have held that section 413(h), which requires the aggravating circumstances to outweigh the mitigating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence, is constitutional. In <em>Collins v. State, </em>318 Md. 269, 296, 568 A.2d 1, 14 (1990), we answered Baker\u2019s third argument when we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-8\">\u201cCollins claims the use of the preponderance of the evidence standard in the Maryland death penalty statute is violative of the Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment clause and of the due process clause. Collins apparently refers to the final stage of the capital sentencing special verdict form where the jury is asked to determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether the aggrava<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>ting circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances. Art. 27, \u00a7 413(h).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-5\">We have previously reconsidered and reaffirmed the rule that a preponderance of the evidence test is proper in weighing aggravating and mitigating factors. <em>State v. Calhoun, </em>306 Md. 692, 739-40, 511 A.2d 461, 485 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>480 U.S. 910, 107 S.Ct. 1339, 94 L.Ed.2d 528 (1987); <em>Foster v.

Under Maryland\u2019s capital sentencing scheme, the sentencing authority may not even consider the appropriateness of a death sentence unless the State has established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that one or more statutory aggravating circumstances exist. Art. 27, \u00a7 413(d). Moreover, the state has the burden of showing that aggravating outweigh mitigating circumstances. <em>Scott v. State, </em>310 Md. 277, 284, 529 A.2d 340, 343 (1987) (This Court has consistently held that the state bears the burden of persuasion under Art. 27, \u00a7 413(h)); Md. Rule 4-343(e) (Section IV). Under the circumstances of this case, we find no basis for reevaluating the rule set forth in <em>Calhoun, Foster </em>and <em>Tichnell. </em>Again, we hold the preponderance of the evidence standard is constitutionally proper in the context of Art. 27, \u00a7 413(h).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-6\"><em>See Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 712-713, 759 A.2d 764, 797 (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1115, 121 S.Ct. 864, 148 L.Ed.2d 776 (2001); <em>Conyers v.

Therefore, as we stated in <em>Borchardt, </em>367 Md. 91, 121, 786 A.2d 631, 649 (2001), \u201c[t]he only question is whether <em>Apprendi sub silentio </em>overturns all of those rulings and requires a different result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>The easiest explanation as to why <em>Apprendi </em>would not apply to the Maryland death penalty statute is the straightforward language used by the Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi. </em>Judge Wilner, writing for the majority in Borchardt,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-5\">\u201cPerhaps the easiest answer lies in the unequivocal statement by the <em>Apprendi </em>majority that its decision did not render invalid State capital sentencing schemes, such as approved in Walton,[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>] that allowed the judge, not sitting as the trier of fact, to find and weigh specific aggravating factors. If it is permissible under <em>Apprendi </em>for the law to remove that fact-finding and fact-weighing process <em>entirely </em>from the jury and leave it to the judge as a legitimate sentencing factor, without specifying a reasonable doubt standard, it can hardly be impermissible for a jury that has found the prerequisite aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt to apply a preponderance standard in weighing them against any mitigating circumstances. The <em>Walton </em>scheme, in other words, is in far greater direct conflict with the underpinning of <em>Apprendi </em>than the Maryland approach. Thus, if the aggravating circumstances do not constitute elements of the offense or serve to increase the maximum punishment for the offense in the <em>Walton </em>context, they cannot reasonably be found to have that status under the Maryland law. <em>If Apprendi renders the Maryland law unconstitutional, then, perforce, it likely renders most of the capital punishment laws in the country unconstitutional. </em>We cannot conceive that the Supreme Court, especially in light of its contrary statement, intended such a dramatic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>result to flow from a case that did not even involve a capital punishment law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 121, 786 A.2d at 649 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Aside from the straightforward language used by the Supreme Court, the holding in <em>Apprendi </em>does not implicate Maryland\u2019s death penalty statute. As stated, <em>supra, </em>section 412(b) states that \u201ca person found guilty of murder in the first degree shall be sentenced to death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole.\u201d The statutory maximum penalty upon a conviction of the specific offense of first degree murder is a sentence of death, the sentence of death, thus, is not an enhanced penalty. The holding in <em>Apprendi </em>is that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d at 455. Upon the State proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, the elements of first degree murder, including any aggravating circumstances that make the defendant eligible for the death penalty, the statutory maximum penalty is death; this maximum statutory sentence of the death penalty cannot logically and possibly be enhanced, whether by a judge or jury. Death simply is not an enhancement of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">In order for the holding in <em>Apprendi </em>to control, there would need to be a penalty enhancement at the sentencing proceeding beyond the maximum sentence provided for by statute. For example, if Baker had been convicted of second degree murder, which allows for a person to be imprisoned for not more than the statutory maximum of thirty years,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and at a sentencing proceeding a judge or jury, by reason of a separate statute, was able to make a finding of aggravating factors by a preponderance of the evidence that increased the sentence for second degree murder to any of the sentences available for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>first degree murder, then the holding in <em>Apprendi </em>might apply. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Apprendi:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-5\">\u201cThe New Jersey statutory scheme that Apprendi asks us to invalidate allows a jury to convict a defendant of a second-degree offense based on its finding beyond a reasonable doubt that he unlawfully possessed a prohibited weapon; <em>after a subsequent and separate proceeding, </em>it then allows a judge to impose punishment identical to that New Jersey provides for crimes of the first degree, N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:43-6(a)(1) (West 1999), based upon the judge\u2019s finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant\u2019s \u2018purpose\u2019 for unlawfully possessing the weapon was \u2018to intimidate\u2019 his victim on the basis of a particular characteristic the victim possessed. In light of the constitutional rule explained above, and all of the cases supporting it, this practice cannot stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-6\"><em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 491-492, 120 S.Ct. at 2363, 147 L.Ed.2d at 455-456 (emphasis added). The Court went on to state that: \u201cIndeed, the effect of New Jersey\u2019s sentencing \u2018enhancement\u2019 here is unquestionably to turn a second-degree offense into a first-degree offense, under the State\u2019s own criminal code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 120 S.Ct. at 2365, 147 L.Ed.2d at 457. The Court also stated that, \u201c[w]hen a judge\u2019s finding based on a mere preponderance of the evidence authorizes an increase in the maximum punishment, it is appropriately characterized as \u2018a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495, 120 S.Ct. at 2365, 147 L.Ed.2d at 458, quoting <em>McMillan v. Pennsylvania, </em>477 U.S. 79, 88, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 2417, 91 L.Ed.2d 67, 77 (1986). Under Maryland\u2019s death penalty statute, once a defendant is convicted of a qualifing first degree murder, the maximum penalty is death. This penalty is not enhanced at a sentencing proceeding, the defendant is already eligible for this penalty upon conviction. The holding of <em>Apprendi </em>simply does not apply to Maryland\u2019s death penalty statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">As stated, <em>supra, </em>the Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi </em>specifically rejected the argument that \u201cthe principles guiding our decision today render invalid state capital sentencing schemes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>requiring judges, after a jury verdict holding a defendant guilty of a capital crime, to find specific aggravating factors before imposing a sentence of death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496, 120 S.Ct. at 2366, 147 L.Ed.2d at 459. In responding to the principal dissent in <em>Apprendi, </em>the majority pointed out the difference between aggravating factors and mitigating factors. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-5\">\u201cFinally, the principal dissent ignores the distinction the Court has often recognized between facts in aggravation of punishment and facts in mitigation. If facts found by a jury support a guilty verdict of murder, the judge is authorized by that jury verdict to sentence the defendant to the maximum sentence provided by the murder statute. If the defendant can escape the statutory maximum by showing, for example, that he is a war veteran, then a judge that finds the fact of veteran status is neither exposing the defendant to a deprivation of liberty greater than that authorized by the verdict according to statute, nor is the Judge imposing upon the defendant a greater stigma than that accompanying the jury verdict alone. Core concerns animating the jury and burden-of-proof requirements are thus absent from such a scheme.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 491 n. 16, 120 S.Ct. at 2363 n. 16, 147 L.Ed.2d at 455 n. 16 (citations omitted). The jury in this case found beyond a reasonable doubt that Baker was guilty of first degree murder and, upon Baker\u2019s specific request that it address the issue of principalship, found that there was an aggravating circumstance that made Baker eligible for the death penalty. Baker was not able to show any mitigating circumstances that outweighed the aggravating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence; therefore, the Circuit Court was authorized to sentence Baker to death \u2014 the maximum penalty provided for by the statute governing first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">As Judge Wilner examined in <em>Borchardt, </em>the courts of our sister states have not found the holding in <em>Apprendi </em>to be applicable to their capital sentencing schemes.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>See State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number><em>Hoskins, </em>199 Ariz. 127, 14 P.3d 997 (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 386, 151 L.Ed.2d 294 (2001) (the Arizona Supreme Court followed the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Walton </em>in denying a claim that the Arizona death penalty law was unconstitutional because it eliminated jury consideration in the sentencing process); <em>People v.

We do not agree with Baker that the rulings in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Jones </em>make it clear that the indictment was flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Baker\u2019s reliance on <em>Apprendi </em>fails for two reasons: (1) we have already held that the sentence in the Maryland capital sentencing scheme is not enhanced beyond what the statutory maximum allows so the indictment cannot reference a sentence enhancement as it could have in <em>Apprendi;</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and (2) the Fifth Amendment right to \u201cpresentment or indictment of a Grand Jury,\u201d in the first instance, has not been held to be applicable to the States through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We examined the application of the Fifth Amendment in <em>Bowers v. State, </em>298 Md. 115, 468 A.2d 101 (1983), when we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>\u201cBowers argues \u2018that his conviction for murder in the first degree must be reversed because he was denied his common law and constitutional right to be tried on an indictment in a capital case\u2019. He says that the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the \u2018United States expressly provides that \u201cno person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.\u201d \u2019 He argues that this is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment under <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969), pertaining to the double jeopardy clause, and <em>Gardner v. Broderick, </em>392 U.S. 273, 88 S.Ct. 1913, 20 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1968), pertaining to the privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">This Court pointed out in <em>Heath v. State, </em>198 Md. 455, 464, 85 A.2d 43 (1951), that there is no constitutional provision expressly guaranteeing a right to trial upon indictment in this State. The Supreme Court in <em>Hurtado v. California, </em>110 U.S. 516, 4 S.Ct. 111, 28 L.Ed. 232 (1884), held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not necessarily require a grand jury indictment in prosecution by a state for murder. What Judge Scanlan said for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Kable v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 16, 299 A.2d 493, <em>cert. denied, </em>268 Md. 750 (1973), is applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-6\">\u2018The appellant, however, would have us anticipate the Supreme Court of the United States. He argues that authority of <em>Hurtado v. California, </em>110 U.S. 516 [4 S.Ct. 111, 28 L.Ed. 232] (1884) has been eroded by more recent Supreme Court decisions. In <em>Hurtado, </em>the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not require that State criminal prosecutions be initiated by grand jury indictment. The Supreme Court has consistently adhered to <em>Hurtado. </em>The last clear expression of its continuing agreement with the rule of that case came in <em>Beck v. Washington, </em>369 U.S. 541, 545 [, 82 S.Ct. 955, 957 958, 8 L.Ed.2d 98] (1962).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-7\">\u2018The appellant, nevertheless, claims that the Supreme Court by its recent decision in <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>U.S. 784 [89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707] (1969) has given a signal suggesting that the Court ultimately will overturn <em>Hurtado </em>and extend the Fifth Amendment grand jury right to the States through application of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In <em>Benton, </em>the Court held that the double jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment represented a notion that was \u201cfundamental to the American scheme of justice,\u201d and that the prohibition was enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 796 [89 S.Ct. at 2063].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-5\">\u201cWe eschew speculation on our part as to whether a majority of the present members of the Supreme Court of the United States might hold, despite the precedent of <em>Hurtado, </em>that the Fifth Amendment grand jury indictment right is \u201cfundamental to the American scheme of justice\u201d and thus binding on the States through application of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We point out, however, that the grand jury was abolished in England in 1933 and that at the present time only half of the States use the grand jury as a regular adjunct of criminal prosecutions. We also observe that, unlike the prohibition against double jeopardy, the requirement of trial by jury and other procedural protections of the Bill of Rights which operate for the protection of a defendant in a criminal case, the grand jury often has been an instrument more for the benefit of the prosecution than of the defendant and, indeed, not infrequently has operated to a defendant\u2019s severe detriment.\u2019 17 Md.App. at 26-27, 299 A.2d 493.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">We have no indication from the Supreme Court that <em>Hurtado </em>does not continue to be good law. Accordingly, we reject this contention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 147-49, 468 A.2d at 118-19 (alteration in original) (footnotes omitted). In his brief to this Court, Baker makes a very similar argument. Baker states that he \u201crecognizes that the United States Supreme Court has not held that the grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>jury clause is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Nevertheless, at the end of the same paragraph, Baker states that \u201cit reasonably - appears that the Supreme Court may reassess <em>Hurtado </em>... and the incorporation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s grand jury clause to the states.\u201d Because we cannot predict when, if ever, the Supreme Court will overturn <em>Hurtado, </em>we are not willing to hold that the Fifth Amendment is applicable to the States through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Baker also states that Article 21 of the Declaration of Rights in the Maryland Constitution<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> supports Baker\u2019s contention that the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction to sentence him to death. Baker contends that Article 21 requires that the charging document, in this case an indictment, provide adequate notice to the defendant of the charge(s) he faces. As we will discuss, <em>infra, </em>we have held that the form of indictment does provide adequate notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">In an indictment for murder, the General Assembly has provided the State with guidance as to a constitutional form for an indictment. Maryland Code (1957, 1996 RepL.Vol.), Article 27 section 616 states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-7\">\u201c \u00a7 616. Indictment for murder or manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-8\">In any indictment for murder or manslaughter, or for being an accessory thereto, it shall not be necessary to set forth the manner or means of death. It shall be sufficient to use a formula substantially to the following effect: \u2018That A.B., on the ... day of ... nineteen hundred and,..., at the county aforesaid, feloniously (wilfully and of deliberately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>premeditated malice aforethought) did kill (and murder) C.D. against the peace, government and dignity of the State\u2019. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">We have held that this indictment can be used for any of the homicide offenses, <em>Dishman v. State, </em>352 Md. 279, 289-90, 721 A.2d 699, 704 (1998). We have also held that this indictment does not violate Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, <em>Neusbaum v. State, </em>156 Md. 149, 157-58, 143 A. 872, 876 (1928), and that this form of indictment is constitutional and provides fair notice to a defendant, <em>Ross v. State, </em>308 Md. 337, 342-46, 519 A.2d 735, 737-39 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">In <em>Ross, </em>the defendant was convicted of felony murder and armed robbery. The defendant argued on appeal that he was denied certain rights by the indictment. This Court examined the defendant\u2019s arguments and the indictment that was filed in accordance with section 616. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-7\">\u201cRoss argues that he was denied due process of law and the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him \u2014 rights guaranteed to him by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and by the Twenty-first article of the Maryland Declaration of Rights \u2014 because the charging document failed to inform him the State was proceeding on a felony murder theory. Moreover, he contends the error is one of commission as well as omission because the indictment specifically charges the premeditated species of murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-8\">We conclude that the statute is constitutional as applied in this case. The indictment against Ross, in addition to identifying the victim and the time and place of the offense, fully apprised Ross that he was charged with murder in the first degree. This information satisfies the constitutional requirements of notice. As we have pointed out, murder in the first degree may be proved in more than one way. There is no requirement, however, that a charging document must inform the accused of the specific theory on which the State will rely....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The first recorded challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 616 came in 1928, in <em>Neusbaum v. State, </em>156 Md. 149, 143 A. 872 (1928). The short form indictment was used to charge manslaughter, and our predecessors held that an allegation that Neusbaum, on a stated date in the City of Baltimore, \u2018feloniously ... did kill and slay William Powell\u2019 was sufficient without including an allegation of the manner or means by which the death was caused____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-5\">A defendant charged in the statutory language employed in this case is clearly apprised that he is being charged with the crime of murder and that he may be convicted of murder in either degree, or manslaughter. That defendant is also told when and where the homicide occurred, and the identity of the victim. He is not told whether the State will proceed upon one or another, or upon several theories concerning the particular malevolent state of mind alleged to have been present, but neither is he entitled to this information as a matter of constitutional due process____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-6\">This Court has looked with favor upon the general trend of relaxing the formal requirements of indictments to avoid the prolix and often overly technical rules of common law pleading in favor of the shorter and simpler forms. <em>State v. Chaney, </em>304 Md. 21, 497 A.2d 152 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>[474] U.S. [1067], 106 S.Ct. 824, 88 L.Ed.2d 796 (1986); <em>Jones, supra; Williams v. State, </em>302 Md. 787, 490 A.2d 1277 (1985); <em>State v. Williamson, </em>282 Md. 100, 382 A.2d 588 (1978); <em>Shelton v. State, </em>198 Md. 405, 84 A.2d 76 (1951); <em>State v. Wheatley, </em>192 Md. 44, 63 A.2d 644 (1949). At the same time we recognize that the basic right of a criminal defendant to fair notice must not be sacrificed on the altar of convenience or simplicity. In this case, where there can be no doubt that the accused was aware he was charged with murder in the first degree, and where it has been the clear and unchanged law of this State for more than 80 years that a charge of murder in this form may be made out by proof of premeditated murder or proof of felony murder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>it cannot be said that Ross was misled, or in any way deprived of his constitutional right to fair notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><em>Ross, </em>308 Md. at 342-47, 519 A.2d at 737-740 (footnotes omitted). In the present case, under the capital sentencing scheme, it was clear that Baker was well aware of the fact that the State, under the indictment, was seeking the death penalty and the basis for the State seeking it.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The indictment used by the State was \u201csubstantially\u201d to the same effect as section 616. The indictment stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-6\">\u201cThe Jurors of the State of Maryland, for the body of Baltimore County, do on their oath present that WESLEY EUGENE BAKER AND GREGORY LAWRENCE late of Baltimore County aforesaid, on the 6th day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-one at Baltimore County, aforesaid, feloniously, willfully and of deliberately premeditated malice aforethought did kill and murder one Jane Frances Tyson; contrary to the form of the Act of Assembly in such case made and provided, and against the peace, government and dignity of the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Baker contends that this form of indictment fails because it does not allege the commission of a capital murder in that it fails to list the aggravating circumstances the State sought to rely on in seeking the death penalty, and it fails to include any allegation that Baker was a principal in the first degree to murder. Section 616, and Maryland\u2019s capital sentencing statutes, provide for the furnishing of the information that Baker argues should be in the indictment. As stated, <em>supra, </em>section 412(b) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-8\">\u201c(b) <em>Penalty for first degree murder. </em>\u2014 Except as provided under subsection (g) of this section, a person found guilty of murder in the first degree shall be sentenced to death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole. The sentence shall be imprisonment for life unless: (l)(i) the State notified the person in writing at least 30 days prior to trial that it intended to seek a sentence of death, and advised the person of each aggravating circumstance upon which it intended to rely....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Under this section, Baker was notified well before trial that his case was a capital case and he was also notified of the aggravating circumstance upon which the State intended to rely. The information that Baker contends made the indictment invalid was provided to him through the notice required by section 412(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">We hold that the indictment did not fail and was a valid indictment for a capital case. As stated, <em>supra, </em>we have previously held that this form of indictment is constitutional and provides the proper notice to a defendant. Looking at the indictment, our prior holdings, and the requirements of section 412(b), the indictment was not defective. Furthermore, through the indictment and the notice required by section 412(b), Baker was substantially provided with the information that he claims was missing from and, thus, according to Baker, made the indictment defective. Accordingly, this claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Waiver of Jury Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Baker contends that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to be sentenced by a jury. Specifically, Baker contends that the trial court failed to mention the standard of proof applicable to the balancing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and the trial court erred in stating that the jury\u2019s finding at trial that Baker was a principal in the first degree was binding at sentencing. Baker also contends that the trial court did not properly advise him that the aggravating circumstances must outweigh the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt in compliance with <em>Appren-di. </em>We have already held that <em>Apprendi </em>is not applicable to our death penalty statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">Section 413(b) states that a sentencing proceeding shall be conducted before a jury unless the defendant waives the jury. A defendant\u2019s waiver of a jury must be knowingly and voluntarily made. <em>Trimble v. State, </em>321 Md. 248, 261, 582 A.2d 794, 800-01 (1990). When examining whether a defendant made a knowing and voluntary waiver, the court considers the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>After an examination of the waiver colloquy between the trial court and Baker, quoted at length <em>supra, </em>and considering the totality of the circumstances, we hold that Baker made a knowing and voluntary waiver. As we have stated, the trial court did not have to advise Baker of the <em>Apprendi </em>standard because we have held that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply. The record reflects that the trial court made a thorough and reasonable effort to explain the sentencing proceeding to Baker and to make sure that his waiver was knowing and voluntary. The trial court asked Baker and his counsel several times if they had been able to adequately discuss the question of whether to be sentenced by the court or a jury. Baker\u2019s attorneys were also asked if the court had adequately covered the advisements and they responded that the court had. Baker also stated that he did not have any questions, that he had a sufficient opportunity to discuss the election with his attorneys, and that he did not have any questions that his attorneys were unable to answer. Baker also responded that he was satisfied making his election at that time, that he understood that he could not change his mind, and that he did not need to have further time to discuss the election with his attorneys. While the trial court did state that the trial jury\u2019s finding that Baker was a principal in the first degree was binding at the sentencing proceeding, in the totality of the circumstances this error did not affect the fact that Baker\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Moreover, it was at Baker\u2019s specific request that the jury was asked to determine whether he was a principal in the first degree. This request was specifically addressed in such a fashion that the jury\u2019s determination was to encompass the \u201cqualifying\u201d nature of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Baker relies on the cases of <em>Trimble v. State, </em>321 Md. 248, 582 A.2d 794 (1990), and <em>Harris v. State, </em>295 Md. 329, 455 A.2d 979 (1983), to make the argument that Baker\u2019s \u201cwaiver of a jury sentencing was corrupted by errors similar to those in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number><em>Harris </em>and Trimble.\u201d In <em>Trimble, </em>the defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, Trimble argued that his \u201cdeath sentence should be vacated because the trial court did not properly advise him of his right to a jury sentencing.\u201d Trimble asserted that under Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum.Supp.), Article 27 section 413(k)(2),<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> if a sentencing jury was not able to agree whether to impose a death sentence, then the court may not impose a death sentence. When the trial court was advising Trimble of his rights to be sentenced by a jury prior to the sentencing proceeding,- the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-5\">\u201cAnd if you do use this jury, and I instruct them, and place them out for deliberation, and if, after reasonable time the jury is not able to agree as to a sentence, I have the authority to dismiss the jury, and impose a sentence for life imprisonment at that point if the jurors are not able to agree as to any sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-6\"><em>Trimble, </em>321 Md. at 260, 582 A.2d at 800 (emphasis deleted). Trimble asserted that the judge\u2019s instruction that he had the authority to dismiss the jury and impose a sentence of life imprisonment made it unclear that if the jury was unable to agree on a sentence, the judge was required to impose a life sentence. Trimble thought that the judge could also sentence him to death if the jury failed to. This Court agreed with Trimble and vacated his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">We relied on our previous holding in <em>Harris </em>to determine that Trimble\u2019s waiver was not knowing and voluntary because Trimble may have believed that he should just take his chances with the judge instead of chancing a jury and then chancing a judge if the jury was hung. We found that if Trimble had been properly instructed, he may have taken his chances with the jury in hopes that at least one of the jurors would not vote to sentence him to death. We quoted <em>Harris, </em>295 Md. at 339 340, 455 A.2d at 984, when we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>\u201cIt is one thing to be told that the jury would have to be unanimous before imposing death or life imprisonment, but quite another to not being made aware that if, after a reasonable time, the jury is unable to agree, the court shall dismiss the jury and impose a life sentence. It is not difficult to see how this additional information may very well be significant to one convicted of first degree murder and facing a possible sentence of death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-5\"><em>Trimble, </em>321 Md. at 263, 582 A.2d at 801. The information that was omitted in <em>Trimble </em>and <em>Harris </em>was specifically provided in the case at bar. Moreover, we do not think that the omission by the trial court, if any, in the case at bar, even if erroneous, rises to the level of the error in <em>Harris </em>and <em>Trimble.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Baker was advised that a jury had to be unanimous when balancing aggravating and mitigating circumstances and that the jury would weigh, balance, the two factors, but the court failed to further advise Baker that the balancing would be by a preponderance of the evidence standard. In the first instance, it can be reasonably argued that the trial court\u2019s instruction that the mitigating circumstances \u201coutweigh the aggravating\u201d circumstances, or \u201cthe sentence shall not be death,\u201d is the functional equivalent of a preponderance standard. \u201cOutweighing\u201d begins when a balance is \u201ctipped,\u201d however slightly. If the court had failed to advise Baker that the jury must be unanimous when balancing aggravating and mitigating circumstances, then the problem would be similar to the one encountered in <em>Harris </em>and <em>Trimble. </em>This Court found that the <em>Harris </em>and <em>Trimble </em>omissions constituted a failure by those trial courts to communicate a condition or standard that would dramatically increase the chance that a defendant would choose to be sentenced by the court rather than by a jury. The omission in the case <em>sub judice </em>simply does not rise to that level. Baker was told that if mitigating factors \u201coutweighed\u201d aggravating factors, the sentence could not be death.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The dialogue between the court and Baker also makes clear that Baker had plenty of time to discuss the sentencing proceedings with his attorneys and felt that he was ready to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>proceed. If <em>Apprendi </em>applied to the Maryland death penalty statutes, and the aggravating circumstances had to outweigh the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt standard, then the higher threshold of that standard might have made the omission one that would have adversely affected the waiver procedure. As we have held, however, <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to capital sentencing schemes.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Newly Discovered Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Baker contends that he has newly discovered evidence that generates a substantial or significant possibility that the jury, or the judge, would not unanimously have determined him to be a principal in the first degree, therefore the new evidence was sufficient to require a new sentencing proceeding. For the purpose of this argument, Baker admits that he was involved in the murder of Mrs. Tyson; however, he contends that the new evidence would go toward resolving whether a person, other than himself, was the principal in the first degree and, consequently, whether the other person, instead of himself, was eligible for the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The evidence submitted to the trial court was in the form of two affidavits. One affidavit is signed by Mary Consetta Spicer and it alleges that she saw a man running from the mall parking lot with a purse and that he got into a \u201cdark blue \u2018Bronco\u2019-type vehicle.\u201d As the \u201cBronco-type vehicle\u201d drove away from the scene, Ms. Spicer saw Scott Faust following the vehicle. The second affidavit is signed by Joseph G. Bathon and it alleges that on October 13,1978, Mr. Bathon was forced into the trunk of his car by a man with a gun. The man proceeded to drive around for seven and a half hours during which time the man robbed four stores. At one point when the car was stopped, Mr. Bathon tried to get out of the trunk, however, the man opened the trunk and put the barrel of the gun on Mr. Bathon\u2019s nose and warned him not to try and escape. The man who kidnapped and assaulted Mr. Bathon was Baker\u2019s co-defendant, Gregory Lawrence.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Maryland Rule 4-331 states the conditions for obtaining a new trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-5\">\u201cRule 4-331.

At the end of the hearing, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-8\">\u201cOne point that I had kind of wondered about and had not checked on when we had the description that Adam, of what he saw, and that was by way of a stipulation; the Defense decided they didn\u2019t really want that six year old to testify in front of a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-9\">And there was simply the statement that the man who shot his grandmother ran to the left side of the vehicle and until I was looking at the chart Defense counsel had there, I hadn\u2019t stopped to kind of think kind of like the President said; depends on what left means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-10\">You know, in the Navy they use port and starboard so everybody knows what we are talking about because left depends on which way you are facing and since these vehicles were in opposite directions, if Adam were meaning left to his left, that would be the passenger\u2019s side. If he meant the left as you are sitting in the vehicle, that means the driver\u2019s side and I was just curious how that statement had been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Looking at the affidavit of Miss Spicer \u2014 and I certainly, the question was raised in my mind as to whether or not this is newly discovered evidence when the Motion is filed in 2001 after the evidence was discovered in 1996, but assuming that that is not a problem \u2014 the question is whether or not that affidavit or that testimony would in any event, in all likelihood, <em>change the sentencing.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-5\">My findings had been that the State had proved beyond all of that that this passenger was a participant and they had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the principal in the first degree. I don\u2019t believe that Miss Spicer\u2019s affidavit would change that in any way and, in fact, tends to substantiate Mr. Faust putting Mr. Baker in the passenger\u2019s seat. Miss Spicer puts him in the passenger\u2019s seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-6\">Now, granted that Mr. Faust sees something slightly different in how \u2014 the approach to \u2014 the vehicle, he denies the vehicle being in motion when Mr. Baker got into the passenger\u2019s side. Miss Spicer says the vehicle was in motion but when witnesses come in to scenes such as this, we certainly look for the inconsistencies in evidence but if we see everybody with precisely the same story, we begin to have some concerns, too. So no one has identified other than two people being involved here. We haven\u2019t identified the third person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-7\">Mr. Faust clearly puts Mr. Baker in the passenger\u2019s side. Miss Spicer puts him in the passenger\u2019s side and the officer \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the name of the officer that was in pursuit when the vehicle was stopped and Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Baker jumped out and ran, but they each went their own separate ways \u2014 that officer saw Mr. Baker jump from the passenger\u2019s side of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-8\">So, in my mind, the Spicer affidavit raises no new issues and tends to confirm in my mind that Mr. Baker was the one who shot Mrs. Tyson and that he jumped into the passenger\u2019s side of that vehicle and that he had been\u2014 was \u2014 in the passenger\u2019s side when the vehicle was approached by the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>The affidavit of Mr. Bathon concerning his being carjacked, I, quite frankly, question whether it has any probative value. The first observation I made when I read that was that Mr. Lawrence didn\u2019t shoot his victim and I then, in reviewing the State\u2019s answer, believed they pointed out that one of the Federal Judges made the same observation. So that\u2019s, but as I say, so remote in time and I don\u2019t believe it has any probative value one way or the other. And so, in my mind, the so-called newly discovered evidence really, if anything, enhances the State\u2019s position. It certainly does not diminish it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-5\">So, having reviewed those affidavits, I am still convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Baker was the principal in the first degree and that there is no call for a new sentencing proceeding. So I will deny that Motion for a New Sentencing.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The trial court, for the purpose of its consideration, assumed that the affidavits were newly discovered evidence. The trial court then weighed the effect of the evidence and determined that the evidence would not have produced a different result in the sentencing. That determination was well within the court\u2019s proper exercise of discretion. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-7\">. Adam did not testify at trial but a stipulation between the State and Wesley Baker was agreed upon. The stipulation was read into the record. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-8\">\"It is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between the State of Maryland and Wesley Eugene Baker, the Defendant on trial under Case Number 92-C-0088, that if Adam Michael Sulewski, age seven, were called to the stand, he would testify that on June 6, 1991 he was six years old and the grandson of Mrs. Tyson, the victim in this offense. Adam would state that he was present with his grandmother when she was shot and that he, along with his grandmother and his four year old sister, Carly, were shopping at the Westview Mall. Adam would state that when they arrived at their grandmother\u2019s car, his sister got into the rear seat. He was standing on the passenger side, preparing to enter the right front passenger seat and his grandmother was getting in the vehicle through the driver's door when he observed a 'black man\u2019 run up to his grandmother. The next thing he remembered was hearing his grandmother screaming 'NO'. Adam would state, 'He shot her. I saw blood coming out of her mouth\u2019. Adam would continue to state that after the shooting, he saw who he thinks were 'two good guys\u2019 chasing after the man who did the shooting. He would state that the 'black man\u2019 ran to his truck, which he described as being blue in color with black windows. He would further state that once the subject entered his truck on the left side, he 'took off as fast as he could. The only other description Adam would give about the black male would be that he had short hair.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b814-9\">.

The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar64\">\"Apprendi has not here asserted a constitutional claim based on the omission of any reference to sentence enhancement or racial bias in the indictment. He relies entirely on the fact that the \u2018due process of law\u2019 that the Fourteenth Amendment requires the States to provide to persons accused of crime encompasses the right to a trial by jury, and tiie right to have every element of the offense proved beyond a reasonable doubt. That Amendment has not, however, been construed to include the Fifth Amendment right to 'presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury\u2019.... We thus do not address the indictment question seperately today.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-8\">Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 477 n. 3, 120 S.Ct. at 2356 n. 3, 147 L.Ed.2d at 447 n. 3 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b846-9\">.

We also fail to see the relevance of an instance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>where the gun was not fired and the victim not killed, to an instance thirteen years later where the gun was fired and the victim killed. Lawrence\u2019s criminal history was that he did not shoot his victims. The verdict in this case reflects that Lawrence did not shoot Ms. Tyson.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b858-8\">RAKER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-74\">concurring in result only, joined by BELL, C.J. and ELDRIDGE, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">I concur only in the judgment of the Court affirming appellant\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">As to the due process issue that appellant raises pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the majority affirms appellant\u2019s sentence based on this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Borchardt v. State, </em>367 Md. 91, 786 A.2d 631 (2001). Appellant\u2019s argument is that he was denied due process of law because Maryland Code (1978, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 413(h) provides that a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>tence of death may be imposed if the State proves that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances by a mere preponderance of the evidence. He argues that, based on <em>Apprendi, </em>due process and fundamental fairness require that the determination that aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances be made beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">I adhere to the views expressed in my dissent in <em>Borchardt </em>that <em>Apprendi </em>and fundamental fairness require that \u00a7 413(h) be interpreted to prescribe the reasonable doubt standard for the finding that aggravating factors outweigh mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Nonetheless, I concur in the mandate of the majority opinion affirming appellant\u2019s judgment of conviction because the <em>Apprendi </em>issue is not properly before the Court in this case. The trial judge, in sentencing appellant, found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstance that appellant had committed the murder while committing or attempting to commit robbery, arson, rape in the first degree, or sexual offense in the first degree. The trial judge also found that no mitigating circumstances existed by a preponderance of the evidence, that there was no need to conduct a weighing of the aggravating and mitigating factors, and that imposition of the death penalty was mandatory in appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">On its face, the weighing provision of \u00a7 413(h) applies only when the sentencing judge or a juror finds that one or more mitigating circumstances exist. <em>See </em>\u00a7 413(h)(1). Furthermore, Maryland Rule 4-343 instructs the sentencing authority that, if it determines that one or more aggravating circumstances has been proven and no mitigating circumstances exist, the sentence shall be death. In addition, the United States Supreme Court has held that it is not unconstitutional for a state to require the death penalty when the sentencer has found one or more aggravating circumstances and no mitigating factors. <em>See Blystone v. Pennsylvania, </em>494 U.S. 299, 110 S.Ct. 1078, 108 L.Ed.2d 255 (1990). Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>\u00a7 413(h) did not apply to appellant, and he cannot challenge its constitutionality in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Accordingly, I join the majority in affirming appellant\u2019s judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge ELDRIDGE have authorized me to state that they join in this concurring opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
