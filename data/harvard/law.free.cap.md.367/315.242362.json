Thompson, Esquire (Respondent). In the petition, Bar Counsel alleged violations only<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of Rules 8.4(b) and (c) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. This Court referred the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>matter to a judge of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Maryland Rules 16-709(b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 16-711(a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>. After an evidentiary hearing, the hearing judge was unable to find by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(b) or (c). Petitioner filed with this Court exceptions to the findings of fact and conclusions of law, and a recommendation for sanction. Respondent filed a brief reply to Petitioner\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">From the evidentiary record made below, the hearing judge made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">Respondent is a 47-year old male who is married and has two sons. He was admitted to the Maryland bar in November 1978 and has practiced law exclusively in the state of Maryland for over 21 years. Respondent\u2019s law practice consists primarily of estates and trusts, business law and elder law. He also devotes a substantial amount of time to <em>pro bono </em>representation of the elderly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">On March 24, 1998, Bar Counsel filed a Complaint' with Petitioner against Respondent based upon a charge brought against the Respondent on February 1, 1998 in the District Court of Maryland [sitting in] Montgomery County. On August 27, 1998, Respondent pled guilty to the offense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>stalking, in violation of section 32-20 of the Montgomery County Code, which provides in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">Sec. 32-20 Stalking, (a) In this section to stalk means to engage in a persistent pattern of conduct which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">(1) alarms, annoys, intimidates, frightens, or terrorizes a person; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">(2) causes the person to reasonably fear for his or her safety, or that of any third person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">Respondent was sentenced to six months incarceration with all time suspended, three years probation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, one hundred hours of community service and a[n] $1,000.00 fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">The stalking charge stemmed from Respondent\u2019s interactions with a 13-year old boy he met at a Montgomery County swim center in October 1997. Pursuant to one of their conversations approximately one month after their initial meeting, Respondent made an inappropriate sexual remark to the boy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequently, Respondent spoke to the boy at a shopping mall, called him on the telephone and on one occasion, appeared uninvited at the boy\u2019s home. Charges were then filed against Respondent. Respondent testified that it was only after being charged that he learned that the boy had been very upset as a result of Respondent\u2019s conduct with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">Although Respondent has no previous sanctions for professional misconduct, his testimony revealed that he was previously acquitted of charges arising out of his conduct with another teenage boy in 1995. Respondent acknowledged that he has been sexually attracted to pubescent boys since he was in his late teens. After being charged with the stalking offense, Respondent sought treatment from Dr. Fred S. Berlin, M.D., Ph.D.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, who diagnosed Respondent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>nonexclusive homosexual Ephebophilia<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>. Since his evaluation by Dr. Berlin, Respondent has enrolled in a treatment program, which includes therapy sessions and antiandrogenic medication (which has the effect of lowering Respondent\u2019s sex drive). Progress letters from Dr. Berlin indicate that Respondent has been highly motivated and diligent in his efforts to maximize the effect of his treatment. Furthermore, Dr. Berlin reports that Respondent is doing well thus far. Dr. Berlin further indicates that Respondent\u2019s prognosis for continued abstinence from improper sexual behavior \u201cwill remain good\u201d so long as he continues to maintain his high level of motivation and continues to adhere to his treatment regimen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">In August 1999, Respondent entered into a \u201cMonitor\u2019s Contract\u201d with Robert H. Metz, a prominent member of the Maryland Bar who agreed to monitor Respondent\u2019s activities as a practicing lawyer. Pursuant to the contract, Respondent agrees to limit his practice to estates and trusts, business law, elder law, real estate and other similar legal practice areas not involving issues pertaining to or involving contact with minor children. Mr. Metz agrees to act as Respondent\u2019s monitor conferring monthly with both Respondent and Dr. Berlin to confirm that Respondent is maintaining his treatment as well as adhering to all other protective stipulations in the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Based on these findings of fact, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent had <em>not </em>violated MRPC 8.4(b) or (c). Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>his interpretation of the requirements for a MRPC 8.4(b) violation, and relying in part on our decision in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Post, </em>350 Md. 85, 710 A.2d 935 (1998), the hearing judge concluded that Respondent\u2019s conduct did not \u201cevince a character trait relevant or critical to the practice of law\u201d and, therefore, did not \u201creflect[ ] adversely on his fitness as a lawyer.\u201d He also determined Respondent\u2019s conduct had not violated MRPC 8.4(c), as he found no evidence in the record suggesting Respondent \u201cengaged in any conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Petitioner filed with this Court exceptions challenging the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent had not violated MRPC 8.4(b)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, and recommended a sanction of indefinite suspension from the practice of law. Respondent, in proper person, filed a reply to Petitioner\u2019s exceptions arguing fundamentally that the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact \u201cshould serve as the basis for consideration of this matter.\u201d Respondent did not appear at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">I. <em>MRPC 8.4(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct <em>8.4(b) </em>\u2014 Miscon<em>duct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">(b) commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">The hearing judge, in his Conclusions of Law, opined that Respondent\u2019s misconduct in this case did not reflect \u201cadversely on his fitness as a lawyer\u201d and, therefore, did not violate MRPC 8.4(b). Petitioner excepts to this and maintains the hearing judge \u201cerred\u201d in concluding \u201cRespondent\u2019s stalking of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>[a] teenage boy was not conduct adversely reflecting on his fitness as an attorney.\u201d Petitioner contends that \u201c[w]here a lawyer\u2019s misconduct involves sexual misconduct with children, that misconduct reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s fitness.\u201d Respondent, in his Reply, urges us to adopt the reasoning of the hearing judge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">It is well settled that this Court has original jurisdiction over all attorney disciplinary proceedings. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Zdravkovich, </em>362 Md. 1, 20, 762 A.2d 950, 960 (2000) (citing <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 17, 741 A.2d 1143, 1152 (1999); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 470, 671 A.2d 463, 473 (1996)). The hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, which are <em>\u201cprima facie </em>correct,\u201d <em>Zdravkovich, </em>362 Md. at 21, 762 A.2d at 960 (quoting <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 470, 671 A.2d at 474), are unexcepted to in this case, as we noted earlier. As to his conclusions of law, however, \u201cour consideration is essentially <em>de novo,\u201d Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Briscoe, </em>357 Md. 554, 562, 745 A.2d 1037, 1041 (2000), as \u201c[t]he ultimate determination ... as to an attorney\u2019s alleged misconduct is reserved for this Court.\u201d <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 470, 671 A.2d at 474 (citing <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Bakas, </em>323 Md. 395, 402-03, 593 A.2d 1087, 1091 (1991)). After thoroughly reviewing the record and discovered case law, we sustain Petitioner\u2019s exceptions and overrule the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent\u2019s conviction of the crime of stalking, under section 32-20 of the Montgomery County Code, resulting from his actions involving a thirteen year old boy, does not reflect adversely on his trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer in other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The Comment to MRPC 8.4 provides that \u201c[m]any kinds of illegal conduct reflect adversely on [the] fitness to practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>law....\u201d As we explained in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Post, </em>350 Md. 85, 97, 710 A.2d 935, 941 (1998),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\">Rule 8.4(b) recognizes, by its reference to character traits, rather than enumerating specific crimes, that commission of some crimes evidence or demonstrate a character flaw that, were the person committing them applying for admission to the bar, would constitute a significant impediment, if not outright prohibition, to his or her admission or, having been admitted, could result in his or her disbarment. The rule identifies two such traits. In addition to those traits, however, it includes as a catchall object, \u201cfitness as a lawyer in other respects.\u201d Since the Rule is specific in the requirement that the criminal act reflect adversely on the character traits or fitness as a lawyer, it follows that what the Rule contemplates is that the criminal act evidence another character trait, which, like honesty and trustworthiness, is relevant or critical to the practice of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The hearing judge, purportedly applying this explanation, reasoned that Respondent\u2019s misconduct was not a violation of MRPC 8.4(b), \u201cat least so far as to the types of law which Respondent has practiced in the past and those which he has agreed to practice in the future.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">We acknowledge, as did the hearing judge, that Respondent\u2019s proffered areas of practice emphasis tend to minimize the potential for interactions with children directly as clients. Additionally, it must be conceded Respondent\u2019s misconduct did not involve or occur during the representation of a client. Under MRPC 8.4(b), however, an attorney\u2019s criminal misconduct need not involve the class of persons the attorney typically represents, nor occur within his or her practice of law, to be a violation of the rule. In fact, unlawful acts of violence, sex offenses, and drug and alcohol offenses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>wholly unrelated to an attorney\u2019s practice of law, have been recognized across the country as categories of criminal conduct violative of the provisions of the analogue to this or a similarly framed rule.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See ABA/BNA Lawyer\u2019s Manual on Professional Conduct, </em>at 101:303-101:304 (citing, for example, <em>In re Kearns, </em>991 P.2d 824 (Colo.1999) (censuring an attorney for conviction of vehicular assault and driving under the influence); <em>Florida v. Kandekore, </em>766 So.2d 1004 (Fla.2000) (disbarring an attorney for assaulting law enforcement officer); <em>In re Conn, </em>715 N.E.2d 379 (Ind.1999) (suspending an attorney for conviction of sexual exploitation of minors); <em>In re Sutton, </em>265 Kan. 251, 959 P.2d 904 (1998) (censuring an attorney following criminal and civil charges for his disobeying a stop sign at construction site, confronting' a construction worker, and throwing a soda bottle at him); <em>In re Robertson, </em>256 Kan. 505, 886 P.2d 806 (1994) (censuring an attorney for his admitted possession of cocaine); <em>In re McEnaney, </em>718 A.2d 920 (R.I.1998) (suspending an attorney following plea of <em>nolo contendr\u00e9 </em>to possession of cocaine and marijuana)). The crux of any MRPC 8.4(b) analysis is, as the language of the rule states, whether an attorney\u2019s criminal act \u201creflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.\u201d It does not depend on whether the misconduct occurred while representing a client or, as the hearing judge suggested, whether the misconduct involved an individual from the class of persons the attorney typically represented. We are not suggesting that such factors may never be considered in a MRPC 8.4(b) analysis; indeed, there are many instances in which we may consider their existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>or nonexistence to be important factors. In the present case, however, their nonexistence does not direct our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">According to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and Respondent\u2019s testimony in this case, Respondent had a \u201cnumber of conversations\u201d with the victim (a thirteen year old boy) at a local swim center. In one of those conversations, Respondent made an inappropriate sexual remark to him regarding premature ejaculation. Respondent also spoke to the child at a shopping mall, called him on the telephone once or twice, and, ultimately, appeared uninvited at the child\u2019s home. This conduct led to his being charged with, and pleading guilty to, the offense of stalking. As he acknowledged in his testimony before the hearing judge, Respondent\u2019s actions caused the child to be \u201cvery frightened\u201d and \u201cvery scared,\u201d feeling that Respondent \u201chad pursued him inappropriately.\u201d In our opinion, these actions, considered together, do not resemble, by any standard, those of a responsible, mature, and trustworthy adult, and clearly violated the unquestioned limits of appropriate adult-child interaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">It is well established in Maryland that children, by nature of their youth, require different levels of protection and care than most adults (excepting perhaps adults under disabilities). In many areas of the law, we have enumerated the inherent differences between children and adults which necessitate that protection. As we explained in <em>Stebbing v. State, </em>299 Md. 331, 473 A.2d 903 (1984),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">... youth is more than a chronological fact. It is a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage. Our history is replete with laws and judicial recognition that minors, especially in their earlier years, generally are less mature and responsible than adults. Particularly \u2018during the formative years of childhood and adolescence, minors often lack the experience, perspective, and judgment\u2019 expected of adults.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHU\"><em>Id. </em>at 368, 473 A.2d at 921 (quoting <em>Eddings v. Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 115-16, 102 S.Ct. 869, 877, 71 L.Ed.2d 1, 11-12 (1982)) (citation and footnotes omitted). <em>See also Johns Hop</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>kins Hosp. v. Pepper, </em>346 Md. 679, 692, 697 A.2d 1358, 1364 (1997) (explaining that there is a \u201cpresumption that unequal bargaining power always exists between the two, with the power, and therefore the potential for overreaching, inuring to the adult.\u201d). The General Assembly, presumably in recognition of those differences, has enacted a number of statutes placing the responsibility on adults to protect and promote the welfare of children.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We too have acknowledged similarly the importance of protecting children.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">It naturally follows, considering the inherent vulnerability of children, that interaction between children and adults be viewed with close scrutiny. Because of the disparities of power, intellect, maturity, and judgment between the two, children are often without the resources and capabilities, both mentally and physically, to protect themselves from harm. The burden, therefore, is on the adult to act responsibly in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>or her interactions with children to preserve their best interests, not to prey on their innocence. That implicit trust and duty is placed upon all adults, even those outside the home and school, including strangers coming into contact with a child in public. These are values we hold as a society, which are not novel to humanity generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">As stated earlier, Respondent\u2019s behavior in pursuing the child/victim in this case grossly overstepped the boundaries of appropriate adult-child relationships. In so doing, Respondent demonstrated, and even acknowledged to himself, that he may not be trusted around children in general.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although adult-child interactions are not related directly to Respondent\u2019s practice of law, the concept of trust is an inseparable element of any attorney\u2019s practice. It is inconceivable, therefore, how we presently may authorize and entrust Respondent with the enumerable confidential, fiduciary, and trust-based relationships that attorneys, by their profession, are required to maintain in their dealings with their clients or the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">We acknowledge Respondent\u2019s diagnosis and apparent affirmative response to his treatment regimen, but do not find that determinative here.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Regardless of his present \u201chigh level of motivation\u201d not to repeat the misconduct that led to the present charges, the fact remains that Respondent stalked a child, and that criminal act undermines our view of his present trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Many courts in other jurisdictions have found, as we do here, that sexually-motivated attorney misconduct involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>children can be within the purview of the type of misconduct encompassed by MRPC 8.4(b) or its analogue.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Respondent suggested in his Reply to Petitioner\u2019s Exceptions that such cases involving the sexual exploitation of a minor \u201cbear[ ] no factual resemblance\u201d to his case involving mere stalking of a child. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Admittedly, the offense of stalking contemplates different behavior than the offenses committed against minors in the many MRPC 8.4(b)-type cases enumerated in note 16, <em>supra. </em>The purpose of stalking laws, however, such as the one implicated in this case, is to protect the general public and to prevent harm, such as molestation, from occurring to the stalking victim.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, in determining whether a crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>nal act constitutes a MRPC 8.4(b) violation, it makes no difference that Respondent merely stalked a thirteen year old boy, without consummating an act of sexual abuse or other misdeed. Any such act violates the implicit trust the public and we expect from adults interacting with children. Respondent\u2019s failure to act-out even worse misconduct, under the circumstances, does not remove him from the scope of MRPC 8.4(b).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">II. <em>Sanctions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Having concluded that Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(b), we must now address the issue of the proper sanction. When considering sanctions, it is well settled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">[t]he purpose of disciplinary proceedings against an attorney is to protect the public rather than to punish the erring attorney. The public is protected when sanctions are imposed that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed. The severity of the sanction depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case before this Court. Imposing a sanction protects the public interest because it demonstrates to members of the legal profession the type of conduct which will not be tolerated. <em>Zdravkovich, </em>362 Md. at 31-2, 762 A.2d at 966 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-7\"><em>See also Attorney Griev.

Comm\u2019n v.

In Respondent\u2019s favor, he apparently has maintained a cooperative attitude throughout the proceedings, displayed remorse for his actions, and has no prior disciplinary record. Additionally, he finally made an effort to seek treatment for his disorder and to limit his contact with children.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> These considerations prevented disbarment. In aggravation, Respondent\u2019s victim, due to his age alone, was vulnerable to harm. As we noted earlier, childhood \u201cis a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage.\u201d <em>Stebbing, </em>299 Md. at 368, 473 A.2d at 921 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">After careful consideration of all of these factors, we conclude that indefinite suspension is the appropriate sanction. Even though Respondent has sought treatment for his disorder and has made efforts toward prevention of similar misconduct in the future, his misconduct in this case erodes our present level of confidence in his trustworthiness and fitness to be a lawyer.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We do not reject the possibility that, at some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>point in the future, Respondent may be able to demonstrate to us a track record sufficient to restore a level of trustworthiness and fitness to practice law, but, until that is shown to the Court\u2019s satisfaction, an indefinite suspension to commence thirty days from the date of the filing of this opinion is required to protect the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST GARY E.

We do not have a present mechanism to enforce a restriction on an attorney\u2019s areas of practice, whether volunteered or otherwise, and Respondent\u2019s and the Monitor's promises alone do not restore the confidence eroded by the misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b492-7\">BELL, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADj\">Dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The respondent, Gary E.

In its entirety, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">\u201c(a) violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through acts of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">\u201c(b) commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">\u201c(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\u201c(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">\u201c(e) state or imply an ability to influence improperly a government agency or official; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">. \u201c(f) knowingly assist a judge or judicial officer in conduct that is a violation of applicable rules of judicial conduct or other law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Subsections (a), (e) and (f) clearly are inapplicable to this case. While subsection (b) is the only one before the Court for interpretation, the petitioner not having excepted to the hearing court\u2019s conclusion that subsection (c) does not apply, the meaning of subsection (d) nevertheless is relevant to the meaning, and scope, of subsection (b) because an interpretation of subsection (b) may not render subsection (d) meaningless. This Court has considered the meaning and effect of both. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Com\u2019n of Maryland v.

The hearing court so concluded. 350 Md. at 88-89, 710 A.2d at 936. Despite acknowledging, and, indeed, finding, that the defaults were not related to, and did not adversely reflect on, the respondent\u2019s honesty or trustworthiness, but rather only on the respondent\u2019s \u201cendeavors .to operate his office in a business-like manner,\u201d 350 Md. at 94, 710 A.2d at 939, the court concluded that the respondent\u2019s conduct adversely reflected on his fitness as an attorney, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">\u201cOne of the most fundamental of a lawyer\u2019s functions is to give sound legal counsel to his or her clients, meaning that he or she must, when called upon to do so, advise the clients of their various lawful rights and duties, and concomitantly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>is bound to urge them to comply with those legal duties. An attorney, almost without regard to his reasons therefor, who does not \u2018practice\u2019 what he or she is required to \u2018preach\u2019 surely diminishes the stature and fitness of his role as a provider of legal counsel. Therefore, notwithstanding a degree of sympathy which Respondent\u2019s quandary may create, it cannot be doubted that his conduct reflected adversely on his fitness as a lawyer and, consequently, that he is in violation of Rule 8.4(b).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">350 Md. at 94, 710 A.2d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Addressing the issue, we construed Rule 8.4(b), giving meaning to the phrase, \u201cfitness to practice law in other respects,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">\u201cRule 8.4(b) recognizes, by its reference to character traits, rather than enumerating specific crimes, that commission of some crimes evidence or demonstrate a character flaw that, were the person committing them applying for admission to the bar, would constitute a significant impediment, if not outright prohibition, to his or her admission or, having been admitted, could result in his or her disbarment. The rule identifies two such traits. In addition to those traits, however, it includes as a catchall object, \u2018fitness as a lawyer in other respects.\u2019 Since the Rule is specific in the requirement that the criminal act reflect adversely on the character traits or fitness as a lawyer, it follows that what the Rule contemplates is that the-criminal act evidence another character trait, which, like honesty and trustworthiness, is relevant or critical to the practice of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">350 Md. at 97, 710 A.2d at 940-41. In so doing, we accepted the argument of the respondent in that case that, \u201cas used in the Rule, \u2018fitness\u2019 connote[d] \u2018something intrinsic to [his] conduct that implicated] his legal abilities,\u2019 \u201d that \u201cthat [wa]s the only appropriate construction of the term when one considers that the conduct on which the court relied fits quite comfortably within the reach of Rule 8.4(d),\u201d and that, for the rule to be applicable, there must be a connection between the conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>and the respondent\u2019s fitness as a lawyer in the subject case. <em>Id. </em>at 96, 710 A.2d at 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">We rejected the hearing court\u2019s conclusion that the respondent had violated Rule 8.4(b). Significantly, in so doing, we opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">\u201cThe only basis for the court\u2019s conclusion that it does reflect adversely on his fitness as a lawyer is that failure to practice what one preaches undermines one\u2019s credibility as a provider of legal counsel. But that is simply another way of saying that the administration of justice may be prejudiced. The court was specific in rejecting any suggestion that, by his actions, the respondent\u2019s honesty or trustworthiness was compromised, the conclusion that one could most logically be expected to draw. Moreover, the court also diagnosed the problem as one involving the respondent\u2019s office management skills rather than \u2018his performance or abilities as an attorney.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">350 Md. at 99, 710 A.2d at 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">In <em>Painter, </em>the respondent was charged with violating Rule 8.4(b) and (d) by committing criminal acts of assault and battery, transporting a handgun, as well as committing acts of domestic violence against his wife and children. 356 Md. at 300, 302, 739 A.2d at 28, 29. The hearing court found by clear and convincing evidence that he had committed the acts charged. <em>Id. </em>at 296, 739 A.2d at 26. Neither party took exceptions to the court\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. Thus, the only issue before this Court was the appropriate sanction to be imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 306, 739 A.2d at 29. Nevertheless, we commented on what a violation of both Rule 8.4(b) and Rule 8.4(d) required, noting as to the former what we said in <em>Post. </em>356 Md. at 306-07, 739 A.2d at 31. As to the latter, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">\u201c \u201c \u2018conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice,\u2019 delegates or confirms to the courts the power and duty to consider particular conduct of one who is an officer of the court, in relation to the privileges and duties of a public calling that specially invites complete trust and confidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>Rheb v.

Comm\u2019n v.

As we pointed out in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v.

Comm\u2019n v. Black, </em>362 Md. 574, 766 A.2d 119 (2001); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Gilbert, </em>356 Md. 249, 739 A.2d 1 (1999); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v.

Comm\u2019n v. Hamby, </em>322 Md. 606, 589 A.2d 53 (1991) (convictions for possession of cocaine and drug paraphernalia, resisting arrest, and assault and battery on a police officer).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">However, in none of these cases did the respondent in the case take exception to the conclusion that Rule 8.4(b) was applicable and, therefore, in none of them was there any analysis as to why, or how, the conduct reflected adversely on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the attorney\u2019s fitness. In <em>Gilbert </em>and <em>Black, </em>as in <em>Painter, </em>the respondent had been charged, and found to have violated, both Rule 8.4(b) and (d). Although we acknowledged that most courts sanctioning attorneys for the possession or use of drugs do so because of that conduct\u2019s adverse reflection on the attorney\u2019s fitness to practice, we felt no need to address the issue, particularly pointing out in <em>Gilbert </em>that, \u201c[o]f course, to the extent that conduct of a lawyer adversely affects that lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law, it necessarily prejudices the administration of justice.\u201d 356 Md. at 253, 739 A.2d at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Not only was there no exception taken in <em>Garland </em>to the finding or conclusion that Rule 8.4(b) was violated, but the hearing court\u2019s findings revealed a much greater concern than just the conviction in the case. Those findings were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">\u201cThe evidence presented at the Respondent\u2019s trial is both clear and convincing that on August 26, 1992 he operated a motor vehicle at night, erratically, while under the influence of alcohol. This was at least the Respondent\u2019s third alcohol related driving offense. The Respondent violated Judge Rushworth\u2019s probation by failing and refusing to enter into alcohol counseling, either through the D.W.I. facility or under the supervision of Mr. Vincent. Not only were the Respondent\u2019s actions criminal, but they likewise demonstrated conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. In a situation where an attorney refuses to obey the lawful order of a court, it shows obvious contempt for the very same court of which the Respondent is an officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">\u201cThe Respondent\u2019s contention that he did not receive the judge\u2019s order timely is totally void of any merit. The judge recited in open court at the time of sentencing his concerns about the Respondent\u2019s need for treatment for alcoholism. The judge directed the Respondent to report to the D.W.I. Facility in Prince George\u2019s County no later than 5:00 p.m. on October 8, 1993. Further, to ensure that the Respondent would comply with the Court\u2019s Order, the sentencing judge set an appeal bond of $25,000.00 with the direction that he wanted to keep the Respondent off the street, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>describing the Respondent as a \u2018loose cannon.\u2019 Instead of complying with the Court\u2019s Order, the Respondent flagrantly ignored the Order. Instead of reporting to the D.W.I. facility on October 8, 1993 or seeking counseling from the director of Lawyer Counseling for the Maryland State Bar, the Respondent went about his normal pursuits of practicing law in Baltimore County on the date he was required to seek treatment. His conduct was clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice and in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">345 Md. at 389-90, 692 A.2d at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In <em>Hamby, </em>curiously, the only exception taken by the respondent attorney was to his being charged with a Rule 8.4(d) violation. The attorney misconduct involving children that we have considered that comes closest, factually, to the misconduct in this case occurred in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Childress, </em>364 Md. 48, 770 A.2d 685 (2001). There, where the conduct involved pursuing a child on the internet, the respondent was only charged with a violation of Rule 8.4(d). Having sustained the violation, we imposed an indefinite suspension. In <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Mitchell, </em>308 Md. 653, 521 A.2d 746 (1987), the charged violations, which were sustained, were of DR 1-102(A)(1) and (3), proscribing the violation of a Disciplinary Rule and engaging in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude. The inappropriate conduct was performing fellatio on a thirteen year old boy. DR 1-102(A)(6) that prohibited engaging in conduct that reflects adversely on fitness to practice law was not charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In determining that the respondent\u2019s conviction of stalking constituted evidence that he violated Rule 8.4(b), the majority rejects the notion that whether there has been a violation depends on the action occurring during an attorney client relationship or involved a member of the class of clients the attorney usually represented. Noting the inherent vulnerability of children, requiring their interaction with adults to be viewed with close scrutiny, it states the rationale for its position and holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u201cRespondent\u2019s behavior in pursuing the child/victim in this case grossly overstepped the boundaries of appropriate adult-child relationships. In so doing, Respondent demonstrated, and even acknowledged to himself, that he may not be trusted around children in general.... Although adult-child interactions are not related directly to Respondent\u2019s practice of law, the concept of trust is an inseparable element of any attorney\u2019s practice. It is inconceivable, therefore, how we presently may authorize and entrust Respondent with the enumerable confidential, fiduciary, and trust-based relationships that attorneys, by their profession, are required to maintain in their dealings with their clients or the public.\u201d (Footnotes omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">367 Md. at 327, 786 A.2d at 770-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The majority relies on the Comment to Rule 8.4, which states that \u201c[m]any kinds of illegal conduct reflect adversely on [the] fitness to practice law ...,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the attitude in Maryland concerning the protection of children, 367 Md. at 325-26, 786 A.2d at 769-70, and cases from other States, <em>e.g., In re Christie, </em>574 A.2d 845 (Del.1990); <em>In re Conn, </em>715 N.E.2d 379 (Ind.1999); <em>In re Buker, </em>615 N.E.2d 436 (Ind.1993); <em>In re Kern, </em>551 N.E.2d 454 (Ind.1990); <em>In re Fierro, </em>254 Kan. 919, 869 P.2d 728 (1994); <em>In re Wilson, </em>251 Kan. 252, 832 P.2d 347 (1992); <em>State v.

I do not agree with its construction of Rule 8.4(b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>however. Such a construction renders Rule 8.4(d) surplusage and nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Trust, to be sure, is a critical part of the stock and trade of a lawyer. A client must be able, to be sure, to trust his or her lawyer, and, in particular, his or her competence, discretion and advocacy \u2014 his or her willingness and ability to do so \u2014 on his or her behalf. It is the lawyer and his or her technical competence that must be trusted and that extends to the entire universe of those who would seek, and use, his or her services. When, for reasons unrelated to his or her technical competence, or even his or her profession, a lawyer, an officer of the court, cannot be trusted with a segment of that universe, of the population, his or her conduct reflective of the reason that he or she cannot be trusted with that segment of the population, because it impacts adversely on the public\u2019s image of the courts and the legal profession, may be, and usually will be, prejudicial to the administration of justice. That is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">We have held that it is not necessary that there be a criminal conviction to establish a violation of Rule 8.4(b), <em>see Garland, </em>345 Md. at 390, 692 A.2d at 468-69; <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Deutsch, </em>294 Md. 353, 450 A.2d 1265 (1982), simply proof of the conduct. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Proctor, </em>309 Md. 412, 524 A.2d 773 (1987). If all that is required to establish a violation of Rule 8.4(b), to demonstrate that conduct reflects adversely on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice, is proof of aberrant behavior and a post hoc rationalization for why that conduct may reflect adversely on fitness, without tying the trait the conduct is indicative of to one that, like honesty and trustworthiness, is critical to the lawyer function, then there is no role for 8.4(d) to play; it has absolutely no independent basis for existence. That is what has occurred here: Rule 8.4(d) is rendered nugatory by the majority\u2019s interpretation. Moreover, the majority\u2019s is a strained construction that is reminiscent of the interpretation and rationalization this Court rejected in <em>Post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The cases on which the majority places heavy reliance are not helpful and, in fact, are inapposite.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In none of the cases was an exception taken to the finding and conclusion that the respondent in that case violated Rule 8.4(b) or that State\u2019s equivalent. For that reason, not unlike the majority\u2019s criticism of the Respondent\u2019s Reply to Petitioner\u2019s Exceptions, in none of the cases was there any \u201ceffort to analyze critically,\u201d 367 Md. at 322, 786 A.2d at 767, the rules\u2019s scheme or why the particular conviction adversely reflected on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law. I do not find any of the cases persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The hearing judge was eminently and patently correct. I would overrule the exceptions of Bar Counsel. That the conduct clearly prejudices the administration of justice, which, unfortunately and inadvertently, was not charged, and is serious cannot, and does not, in my view, justify the interpretation the majority gives Rule 8.4(b). But that is the only basis I can discern for it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-10\">.

I respectfully dissent from the sanction imposed by the Court because I believe respondent, Gary Thompson, should be disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Gary Thompson was convicted of the criminal offense of stalking a thirteen-year-old boy whom he met at a Montgomery County swim center. He made an inappropriate sexual remark to the young boy and then called him on the telephone and appeared uninvited at the boy\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Respondent pled guilty to stalking and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of six months, all suspended, three years probation, one hundred hours of community service and a fine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>of $1,000.00. Respondent has been diagnosed with \u201cnonexclusive homosexual Ephebophilia.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He acknowledged that he has been sexually attracted to pubescent boys since he was in his late teens.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">I am mindful that respondent has been punished under the criminal laws of Maryland for his criminal misconduct. Disciplinary sanctions, in contrast, are intended not to be punitive but to protect the public and maintain the integrity of the legal system, as well as the confidence of the public in the system. In light of these purposes, it is important to observe that respondent concedes that he poses a threat to the community, as evidenced by his explanation that he has \u201ctold basically all of our neighbors and our close friends about my condition and made sure that they understand <em>it\u2019s important for them to protect their sons and to take appropriate steps that they feel is necessary.\u201d </em>I do not believe that respondent\u2019s seeking treatment from Dr. Berlin is a mitigating circumstance that justifies the lesser sanction of indefinite suspension. Likewise, respondent\u2019s cooperative attitude during the proceedings, display of remorse, and lack of a prior disciplinary record are not sufficient mitigating circumstances to avoid disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In order to protect the public and maintain the integrity of the legal system, respondent should be disbarred. While his conduct was not connected with the practice of law, he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>been convicted of a serious crime, and this Court has found that he is unfit to practice law. Our observation in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Protokowicz, </em>329 Md. 252, 619 A.2d 100 (1993), is equally fitting in this case: \u201cThis is outrageous behavior, a world apart from what this Court, the profession, and the public is entitled to expect from- members of the bar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261-62, 619 A.2d at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">In not disbarring respondent and imposing an indefinite suspension, the majority says that \u201c[w]e do not reject the possibility that, at some point in the future, respondent may be able to demonstrate to us a track record sufficient to restore a level of trustworthiness and fitness to practice law..., \u201d 367 Md. at 331-32, 786 A.2d 773-74. It seems to me highly unlikely that respondent can demonstrate a sufficient \u201ctrack record\u201d to convince this Court that he is fit to practice law in the near future. Since there is no such thing as permanent disbarment in this State,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>but see Fellner v. Bar Ass\u2019n of Balt. City, </em>213 Md. 243, 247, 131 A.2d 729, 732 (1957) (ordering that respondent be permanently disbarred), respondent should be disbarred, with the heavy burden upon him to demonstrate that he is fit to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Other jurisdictions also view sexual offenses against children as most serious. For example, in <em>In re Kern, </em>551 N.E.2d 454 (Ind.1990), the Supreme Court of Indiana said that \u201c[t]he offense of child molesting, however, is not only a serious crime abhorred by our society and strictly proscribed by our criminal laws, but, by its very nature, it renders the perpetrator unfit to be an officer of the Court and warrants the strictest sanction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 456-57.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-6\">. Ephebophilia has been described as a sexual preference by adult men for the young male person, that is, the young person shortly after puberty. <em>See United States v.
