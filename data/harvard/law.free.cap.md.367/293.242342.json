Based on the commission of a homicide in the perpetration of that felony, Deese was also convicted of second degree felony murder. The court sentenced Deese to twenty years incarceration for the felony murder, merging the sentence for child abuse. Deese appealed, and, before the Court of Special Appeals heard the case, this Court issued a writ of certiorari on its own motion. 357 Md. 481, 745 A.2d 436 (2000). Deese\u2019s primary contention is that there is no offense of second degree felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In <em>Fisher v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 786 A.2d 706 (2001) [ filed immediately prior hereto], this Court held that felony murder in the second degree, predicated on child abuse, or on any other inherently dangerous felony not enumerated in the first degree murder statutes, is a cognizable offense under the common law of this State. Deese\u2019s remaining contentions on appeal concern whether the court erred in accepting a witness as an expert and whether the evidence was sufficient to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Beginning in August 1997, Deese lived with his girlfriend, Julie Faust (Faust), and her child, Kyle Faust (Kyle). Kyle was born on January 19, 1995, and died on February 8, 1998. The three initially lived with Deese\u2019s parents, but, at the time of the events relevant to this case, they resided in a separate apartment. While Faust was working, Kyle would go to day care; while she was not working, Faust, Deese\u2019s mother and, for short intervals, Deese himself, supervised Kyle. In January 1998, Kyle suffered a break of unknown origin in his leg. Later that month Deese\u2019s mother pointed out to Faust that Kyle had a \u201csoft spot\u201d in the middle of the back of his head. Faust consulted her pediatrician, Dr. John O\u2019Donovan, who diagnosed it as a subgaleal hematoma, or blood on the outside of the skull due to an injury such as a fall. He advised Faust that such an injury is not uncommon among children of Kyle\u2019s age and that it required no special care to heal.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Approximately one week later, on February 6, Faust again brought Kyle to see Dr. O\u2019Donovan because Kyle had a fever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>of 102 degrees. Dr. O\u2019Donovan diagnosed an ear infection, prescribed antibiotics, and noticed swelling on Kyle\u2019s left cheek which did not especially concern him. Faust testified that the next day, February 7, Kyle\u2019s fever spiked to 105 degrees and that she called Dr. O\u2019Donovan, who advised her to wait out the fever. The fever broke that same day. Because Faust had to work that day, Deese supervised Kyle between 9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">On February 8, according to Faust, Kyle\u2019s temperature was normal and he began to feel better. Faust testified that she fed and bathed Kyle in the morning and that, while bathing him, she noticed no marks or bruises anywhere on him. Faust then put Kyle to sleep in his bedroom and closed the door. Kyle\u2019s bedroom was adjacent to the living room. Deese, who was \u201cmiserable\u201d with a toothache, was resting in the living room. That morning Deese\u2019s mother came to the apartment to pick up some items. Around noon Faust went grocery shopping. She could not recall if Deese\u2019s mother was still in the apartment at that time. Faust returned two hours later to find Deese still resting in the living room and Kyle\u2019s bedroom door still closed. Deese told Faust that Kyle \u201chadn\u2019t stirred.\u201d Faust left Kyle undisturbed for a \u201ccouple hours,\u201d but then became concerned. She entered Kyle\u2019s room and found him \u201cstiff,\u201d immobile, and with his eyes open. She \u201cscreamed\u201d for Deese, who called emergency assistance and who relayed instructions to Faust on how to perform CPR. Faust moved Kyle\u2019s body from his bed to the floor so that she could perform CPR on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Samuel Snyder (Snyder), the district lieutenant for Emergency Medical Services, received a call at 4:14 p.m. on February 8 to Faust\u2019s apartment, where he and other technicians arrived within three minutes. Although Kyle already was dead by this time, Snyder and others attempted to resuscitate him. While trying to intubate Kyle, Snyder noticed that Kyle\u2019s jaw, one of the first joints to seize up in rigor mortis, was stiff, and Snyder concluded that \u201cmaybe this child had been down for quite some time.\u201d Once Kyle was transferred to the ambulance, Snyder removed Kyle\u2019s shirt and observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>\u201cfairly extensive\u201d bruises on his chest, on his shoulders, at the scalp line on his head, and his upper forearm. Snyder acknowledged that the bruise on the chest could have been a result of the CPR previously performed by Faust, but also stated that the other bruises were round, and possibly indicative of a thumb. These bruises were \u201cin a place where a person would grab a child.\u201d Snyder acknowledged that, because he could not remember the color of the bruises and because the color could not be conclusively determined from post-mortem photographs, he did not know whether the bruises were \u201crecent\u201d or \u201ca week old.\u201d Snyder also observed lividity, <em>i.e., </em>pooling of blood in the body after the heart stops pumping, which indicated that Kyle \u201ccould have been dead for hours\u201d by the time Snyder arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Kyle was taken to Franklin Square Hospital\u2019s Emergency Department where Dr. Albert Romanosky, the clinical director of that department and an emergency physician, pronounced Kyle dead on arrival. Dr. Romanosky testified that he observed \u201cmultiple bruises over [Kyle\u2019s] body,\u201d including \u201cseveral bruises around the head.\u201d Some bruises may have been \u201colder bruises, five to seven, five to ten days old,\u201d while others were \u201cmore recent.\u201d Dr. Romanosky also noticed two abrasions. Using photographs at trial, he identified bruises behind the right armpit and on the buttocks area, and a \u201cblack and blue area\u201d on the left side of Kyle\u2019s head that was consistent with a bruise and which had been soft to the touch.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">On February 9, Drs. Steven Robinson and Margarita A. Korell of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner performed an autopsy; on June 19, they reported their findings to the Baltimore County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office. This report identified the cause of death as \u201cblunt force injuries to head\u201d and the manner of death as \u201cundetermined,\u201d rather than as homicide. On September 9, 1998, Dr. Korell and Dr. John E. Smialek, the Chief Medical Examiner, submitted a supplemental report which identified the manner of death as homicide due to \u201cblunt force head injuries.\u201d At trial, the State did not call any physician from the medical examiner\u2019s office, but instead entered in evidence the autopsy and supplemental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>reports as a public record and pursuant to Maryland Code (1982, 1994 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-311(d)(2) of the Health-General Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Deese called Dr. Korell in his case in chief, questioning her about the changed opinion as to the manner of death. Dr. Korell admitted to having met with prosecutors and police before filing the supplemental report and that new medical tests did not account for' the change. On cross-examination by the State, Dr. Korell explained that she was \u201csuspicious from day one,\u201d but was waiting to receive an \u201calternate explanation\u201d as to how Kyle had been bruised; after no such explanation was forthcoming, she concluded that the manner of death was homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The State entered the autopsy and supplemental reports into evidence during the direct examination of Dr. Allan R. Walker. He is an assistant professor of pediatrics and director of pediatric emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins University, as well as the director of that hospital\u2019s \u201cchild protection team.\u201d The latter is \u201ca team which attempts to educate people around the University and the hospital about child abuse and neglect.\u201d Deese contends in this Court (see Part I, infra) that Dr. Walker was unqualified to opine because he was \u201cnot an expert in the field of forensic pathology-\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Dr. Walker read portions of the autopsy report describing \u201cevidence of injury\u201d and located the injuries on photographs of Kyle\u2019s body. This evidence included the following: \u201cbruising[ ] present over the left side of the head\u201d; \u201csoftening and swelling present over the left parieto-occipital cavity\u201d; \u201cfive separate contusions\u201d identified \u201con the left side of the forehead\u201d; \u201ca one-eighth inch abrasion present on the right side of the head just above the eyebrow\u201d; a \u201csubdural hemorrhage\u201d in the brain; swelling of the brain; other brain injuries, such as a contusion in the left hemisphere in the cerebellum; retinal hemorrhages, and other injuries. Dr. Walker ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>plained that the soft spot on the back of Kyle\u2019s head noticed by Deese\u2019s mother and Faust before Kyle\u2019s death does not cause death and typically \u201cresolve[s itself] without any problems.\u201d Dr. Walker concluded that \u201cthis child died of brain injury, as a result of trauma,\u201d and identified retinal hemorrhages as evidence of Kyle\u2019s having been shaken. He did not disagree with Dr. Korell\u2019s conclusion that blunt force trauma caused death, but explained on cross that \u201cthere was shaking plus impact.\u201d Describing the degree of force necessary to cause the observed injuries, Dr. Walker stated that \u201cthese ... are the sorts of injuries that we see in children who have been accidentally injured in motor vehicle crashes or in falls from heights from more than a couple of stories[.]\u201d The \u201calmost immediate[ ]\u201d effect of such injuries would be \u201ccoma, unconsciousness, or death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">On cross-examination, Dr. Walker acknowledged that the autopsy report described the brain contusions as \u201cup to 48 hours old,\u201d but that in his opinion the actual time since the infliction of the injuries was \u201cshorter than that\u201d and \u201cup to three or four hours.\u201d Dr. Walker admitted that he was unable to tell whether the abrasions that he identified were inflicted during Kyle\u2019s life or after death as part of resuscitative efforts, and that some of the bruises \u201cappeared to be relatively fresh and some appeared to be older.\u201d He quantified these terms respectively as \u201cone or two days\u201d and \u201cthree to seven days.\u201d Dr. Walker also acknowledged that infection is indicated by an elevated temperature and that infection can cause swelling of the brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In addition, the State called Detective Jay Landsman (Landsman), who responded to Faust\u2019s apartment on the day that Kyle died. Landsman also noticed bruising on the body. He testified that the apartment was \u201cclean,\u201d \u201ccarpeted,\u201d and contained \u201cno items that would obviously cause injury\u201d to a child. The only entry to Kyle\u2019s bedroom was through the living room, and there were no signs of forced entry. On cross-examination, Landsman acknowledged that Deese \u201c[f]or the most part\u201d cooperated with the investigation by agreeing to an interview and providing a written statement. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>questioned why Deese was not arrested during the period between the initial autopsy report and the supplemental autopsy report, Landsman explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">\u201c[LANDSMAN]: ... There was strong suspicion of what had occurred, that it was not an accidental death. We made every attempt to interview the, to find some other reason for this child\u2019s death. And it was obvious that the way that we placed the child in two people\u2019s custody during the time that this injury\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR DEESE]: Two people, you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4d\">\u201cLLANDSMAN]: Two people, meaning Miss Faust and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGD\">\u201c[COUNSEL FOR DEESE]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEP\">\u201c[LANDSMAN]: And there was, we narrowed it down to only one person [who] had an opportunity at this time where the injury occurred.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUxt\">Shortly later Landsman stated, \u201cIt was determined that this injury was caused within a 48 hour period. It\u2019s [the case that] during the 48 hour period the only person that was left alone with this child was this man here [Deese].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The defense, in addition to calling Dr. Korell, called the defendant\u2019s mother. She testified that when she arrived at Faust\u2019s apartment on February 8 only Deese and Kyle were present. Deese, who was resting in the living room with a toothache, did not act unusual or attempt to keep her from Kyle\u2019s bedroom. She testified that she had never seen Deese hit Kyle, yell at him, or lose patience with him. Deese elected not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">As noted, the jury found Deese guilty of child abuse and second degree felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Deese argues that the court erred in qualifying Dr. Walker as an expert, because he admitted that he was not a specialist and not board certified in pathology or forensic pathology; that he belonged to no medical societies or groups having to do with that discipline; that his preparation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>testify in this case consisted of reviewing the autopsy record, photographs of the corpse, and reports of Dr. O\u2019Donovan and of the Franklin Square emergency department; that, instead of personally examining the physical samples taken for the autopsy, he relied on Dr. Korell\u2019s reports; and that, if there were an error in Dr. Korell\u2019s autopsy report, then there \u201cmay be\u201d an error in his own opinion as well. Deese\u2019s submission is that Dr. Walker\u2019s expertise in pediatrics and pediatric emergency medicine was not relevant to opining on the cause of Kyle\u2019s death. Because the witness \u201chad no way of knowing whether the original [autopsy] results were accurate or reliable,\u201d Deese contends that Dr. Walker\u2019s \u201c \u2018interpretation\u2019 of these findings was meaningless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The witness has been the director of pediatric emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins for nine years. He has published in peer review journals and in textbooks on \u201cvarious topics in pediatric emergency medicine.\u201d His experience as director of the child protection team has familiarized him with \u201chead injuries and manifestation of abuse [and] shaken baby syndrome.\u201d On more than fifty occasions he has been recognized by various courts as an expert in \u201c[p]ediatrics, child abuse, and neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Maryland Rule 5-702 (\u201cTestimony by experts\u201d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ant\">\u201cExpert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">This Court has stated that \u201cit is within the sound discretion of the trial court to determine the admissibility of expert testimony,\u201d and that \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s ruling either admitting or excluding such testimony \u2018will seldom constitute a ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>for reversal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sippio v. State, </em>350 Md. 633, 648, 714 A.2d 864, 872 (1998) (quoting <em>Radman v. Harold, </em>279 Md. 167, 173, 367 A.2d 472, 476 (1977)). In <em>Sippio, </em>we explained that \u201c[i]n order to determine whether a proposed witness is qualified to testify as an expert, the trial court must examine whether the witness has sufficient knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education pertinent to the subject of the testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649, 714 A.2d at 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the most relevant field of expertise was forensic pathology, as distinct from pediatrics and pediatric emergency medicine, previous decisions have affirmed a trial court\u2019s admission of expert testimony when the expert, although not a specialist in the field having the most sharply focused relevancy to the issue at hand, nevertheless could assist the jury in light of the witness\u2019s \u201cformal education, professional training, personal observations, and actual experience.\u201d <em>Massie v. State, </em>349 Md. 834, 851, 709 A.2d 1316, 1324 (1998). In <em>Massie </em>itself, for example, the trial court admitted expert testimony as to time of death by a \u201cforensics employee of the investigating police department, who was not a doctor of medicine[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 835, 709 A.2d at 1316. That employee was a forensic chemist; had a Bachelor of Science degree in biology and a Master\u2019s degree in forensic science, had taken a forensic pathology course at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology at the Walter Reed Medical Center, and had extensive experience in crime-scene investigation. He observed the victim\u2019s body on the day of the homicide, checked it for signs of post-mortem lividity, and felt its limbs for rigor mortis. He testified as to the time of death of the victim, a time earlier than that listed in the autopsy report, and a \u201csubject which courts have long recognized as an appropriate one for expert testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 851, 709 A.2d at 1324. This Court affirmed the admission of this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><em>See also Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 660-61, 612 A.2d 258, 273-74 (1992) (affirming admission of expert testimony by FBI special agent on a \u201ctorn edge comparison\u201d involving rubber from shoe, despite fact that agent had made no such comparison with rubber previously, in light of his FBI training to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>perform torn edge comparisons and work in twelve previous cases involving different substances), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 931, 113 S.Ct. 1312, 122 L.Ed.2d 700 (1993); <em>Tu v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 486, 500-01, 631 A.2d 110, 116-17 (1993) (affirming admission of testimony by homicide detective with Master\u2019s degree in criminal justice, course work in forensic science, and extensive experience that pattern of blood splatters indicated a \u201cblowback,\u201d whereby blood and tissue spray out of a gunshot wound due to skin\u2019s elasticity), <em>aff'd, </em>336 Md. 406, 648 A.2d 993 (1994); <em>Oaks v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 1, 9, 573 A.2d 392, 396 (1990) (finding that trial court did not err in admitting testimony of State Prosecutor\u2019s accountant, despite latter\u2019s lack of qualification in more specific \u201carea of campaign financing,\u201d because his expertise in accounting sufficed to \u201cbe of assistance to the jury in tracking the \u2018paper trail\u2019 of campaign contributions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In the instant case, again assuming that forensic pathology is the most relevant field of expertise, Dr. Walker\u2019s training in pediatrics and pediatric emergency medicine, combined with his experience in dealing with victims of child abuse, constituted expertise significantly more closely related to the asserted relevant field than the relationship in <em>Massie </em>between forensic chemistry/crime-scene investigation and forensic pathology. Also, Dr. Walker\u2019s training and experience in pediatric emergency medicine go significantly deeper than the forensic chemist\u2019s training in pathology in <em>Massie. </em>As the trial court in <em>Massie </em>did not abuse its discretion in qualifying the forensic chemist in that case as an expert, <em>a fortiori </em>the trial court in the instant case did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Deese argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of second degree murder because \u201cthere simply was no evidence that ... [he] was the person responsible for the death of young Kyle Faust.\u201d In particular, Deese asserts that Kyle\u2019s manner of death initially was designated as undetermined; that the change from this status to homicide was not predicated on any new medical investigation, but instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>on the absence of an alternative explanation based on Dr. Korell\u2019s \u201cmere suspicion\u201d; that suspicion is insufficient to support the conviction; that Dr. Korell\u2019s opinion indicated that at least some injuries had been inflicted several weeks before Kyle\u2019s death; that Kyle\u2019s fever in the days preceding his death was not entirely ruled out as a precipitating factor in his death; and finally that, because \u201cit was never established that any event occurring that day caused [Kyle\u2019s] death,\u201d the \u201cfact that Deese was the person last with him is without significance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">In reviewing a contention of insufficient evidence, the standard that we apply \u201cis whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found [the] elements [of the offense] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Burch v. State, </em>346 Md. 253, 272, 696 A.2d 443, 453, <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1001, 118 S.Ct. 571, 139 L.Ed.2d 410 (1997). This Court also has characterized suffi cient evidence as \u201cevidence that either showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 479, 649 A.2d 336, 337 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In the instant case Deese was convicted of felony murder in the second degree based on child abuse. In <em>Fisher, </em>367 Md. 218, 786 A.2d 706, we held that physical child abuse is a felony that, under the particular circumstances of its commission, may be found to be dangerous to life and thus to qualify as a basis for second degree felony murder. The victim\u2019s death, of course, must be <em>\u201ccaused </em>during the commission of, or attempt to commit,\u201d the underlying felony. <em>Lindsay v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 100, 104-05 n. 6, 258 A.2d 760, 763 n. 6 (1969) (emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>257 Md. 734 (1970). The felony of child abuse can be committed in different ways. <em>See Cortez v. State, </em>104 Md.App. 358, 364, 656 A.2d 360, 362 (1995) (characterizing child abuse as \u201ca multi-purpose statutory offense that can be committed in any of several different ways\u201d). Here the relevant statutory elements include the following: (1) \u201cabuse,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>defined as the \u201csustaining of physical injury by a child as a result of cruel or inhumane treatment or as a result of a malicious act\u201d; (2) which is \u201ccause[d]\u201d; (3) by a \u201cperson who has ... temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child\u201d; and \u2014 because the felony is a predicate for second degree murder in this case \u2014 (4) the abuse must have resulted in the child\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Thus, the issue is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, any rational jury could have found each of these four elements beyond a reasonable doubt. Deese primarily contends that the evidence is insufficient as to abuse and as to cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">With respect to Kyle\u2019s fever, Dr. O\u2019Donovan testified that he examined Kyle on February 6, two days before Kyle\u2019s death, and that he attributed the fever to an ear infection and treated it with antibiotics. Faust testified that she administered these antibiotics to Kyle; that, while his fever spiked the next day, by February 8 the fever broke; and that Kyle was eating and \u201cfe[eling] better.\u201d The supplemental autopsy report listed the cause of death as \u201cblunt force head injuries,\u201d and Dr. Walker, agreeing with this determination, testified that such injuries may have been caused by shaking as well as impact. A rational jury could have accepted the supplemental autopsy report\u2019s determination of the cause of death as \u201cblunt force head injuries,\u201d and inferred that Kyle\u2019s fever did not additionally contribute to his death because Kyle\u2019s pediatrician did not find it sufficiently serious to warrant hospitalization and because the fever broke on February 7, the day before Kyle was killed. Also, there was no evidence presented that the fever did in fact contribute to Kyle\u2019s death. Thus, a rational jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the fever was not a precipitating cause of Kyle\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Deese\u2019s contention that Dr. Korell\u2019s designation of the manner of death as homicide in the supplemental autopsy report was \u201cbased on mere suspicion\u201d is itself unfounded. As noted above, Dr. Korell explained that she was \u201csuspicious from day one\u201d as to whether Kyle had been abused because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the nature and magnitude of his injuries. She also testified that, when no alternative explanation for his injuries was forthcoming, she concluded that the manner of Kyle\u2019s death was homicide. It does not follow that this conclusion was based on \u201csuspicion.\u201d Indeed, even if an alternative explanation is furnished, it does not result in the grant of a motion for judgment of acquittal. Even in such a case a rational jury may reject testimony regarding the alternative explanation and properly conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the death was a homicide. <em>See Rasnick v. State, </em>7 Md.App. 564, 567-68, 256 A.2d 543, 545 (1969) (holding that evidence was sufficient to sustain conviction when accused testified that victim had fallen down steps earlier in day, before accused beat victim, and when doctor testified that fatal injuries could have occurred earlier in day, because \u201cthere is no obligation on the trier of the facts to believe the testimony that there was an earlier fall\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>257 Md. 735, <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 835, 91 S.Ct. 70, 27 L.Ed.2d 67 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In the instant case, no alternative explanation was presented to Dr. Korell (or at trial) as to the cause of Kyle\u2019s injuries. Once Dr. Korell had ruled out alternatives, her conclusion that Kyle\u2019s death was a homicide was not based on mere suspicion, but on her medical expertise as a forensic pathologist trained to recognize the cause of fatal injuries. A rational jury could have accepted this conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, the jury also could have believed Dr. Walker\u2019s testimony that Kyle\u2019s death was caused by \u201cimpact\u201d or \u201cshaking plus impact\u201d and that the degree of force necessary to cause his injuries was equivalent to the force at work in a motor vehicle crash or a fall from a significant height. The jury could have drawn the rational inference that, absent an accident involving this degree of force, someone shook Kyle, beat him, or threw him down so as to cause his death. There was sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that a homicide was committed and that this homicide constituted child abuse within the statutory definition of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Deese\u2019s final contention as to the sufficiency of evidence concerns the element of causation. He points out that there was evidence that some of Kyle\u2019s injuries were inflicted prior to the day of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">It. is well settled that a conviction may be sustained on the basis of circumstantial evidence. <em>See Hebron v. State, </em>331 Md. 219, 228, 627 A.2d 1029, 1034 (1993). As this Court stated in <em>Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 573 A.2d 831 (1990),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">\u201c[a] conviction may rest on circumstantial evidence alone. To ensure that the trier of fact bases a finding of guilt on the appropriate degree of certainty, we have long held that a conviction upon circumstantial evidence <em>alone </em>is not to be sustained unless the circumstances, taken together, are inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 536-37, 573 A.2d at 834 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">In the instant case, the evidence most favorable to the State is that (1) Kyle was alive on the morning of February 8, (2) Kyle was under Deese\u2019s exclusive supervision for a period of time on that day, (3) Kyle was found dead a few hours after that period, (4) death was due to blunt force injuries to the head and possibly due to shaking, and (5) no one had contact with Kyle after the period described in (2) and before the event described in (3). From these circumstances, a rational jury could have inferred, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Deese inflicted the fatal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">In previous cases challenging the sufficiency of evidence, this Court has affirmed convictions based on circumstantial evidence where a defendant, during the crime\u2019s commission, has exercised exclusive control or custody over the premises where the crime occurred or where a defendant has been the only possible agent who could have committed the crime. Exclusive control or agency can be a factor in a set of circumstances that are, in <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>terms, \u201cinconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537, 573 A.2d at 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>This Court also has overturned convictions when exclusivity was lacking. In <em>Tucker v. State, </em>244 Md. 488, 224 A.2d 111 (1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 U.S. 1024, 87 S.Ct. 1381, 18 L.Ed.2d 463 (1967), Tucker was convicted of possessing heroin. He operated a tavern, and a former employee informed the police that Tucker stashed packets of the drug in a locked, interior storeroom of the tavern. The police executed a search warrant, asking Tucker for the key to this storeroom. Tucker said that there was only one key that was kept behind the bar. When no key was found there, Tucker gave an officer his car keys and said that in his car trunk there would be a key ring containing the key to the storeroom. The officer retrieved the key ring from Tucker\u2019s car trunk, used a key on it to open the storeroom, and discovered the packets of heroin. At trial, Tucker\u2019s only witness, who claimed that she was the manager of the tavern, testified that at least seven people had access to the storeroom. This Court held that the evidence was legally sufficient in light of Tucker\u2019s admission that he had the only key to the storeroom and that <em>\u201cthe </em>key\u201d was in his trunk. <em>Id. </em>at 501, 224 A.2d at 118-19.</p>\n<p id=\"A0R\">In <em>Pressley v. State, </em>295 Md. 143, 454 A.2d 347 (1983), the defendant was convicted of breaking into a basement office, from which property was taken. There were no witnesses, but the police discovered a broken window on the floor above, and on the opposite side of the building from, the basement office. The defendant\u2019s fingerprints were on broken glass from that window. On appeal the defendant challenged the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury that it was not \u201crequired to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to each link in a chain of circumstances necessary to establish defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 454 A.2d at 348. This Court determined that the instruction should not have been given, <em>id. </em>at 150, 454 A.2d at 350, but that the error was harmless in light of the instructions as a whole. While the Court\u2019s holding was couched in terms of jury instructions, <em>Pressley </em>also can stand for the proposition that the circumstantial evidence of a defendant\u2019s exclusive agency with respect to the criminal act or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>part thereof <em>(ie., </em>breaking the glass) can be legally sufficient to sustain a conviction (breaking into the basement office).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In <em>Warfield v. State, </em>315 Md. 474, 554 A.2d 1238 (1989), the defendant was convicted of storehouse breaking and misdemeanor theft. Warfield had been shoveling snow for an elderly woman, Mrs. Weller, who from time to time would observe Warfield as he worked. At one point Warfield disappeared for about half an hour, which did not concern Mrs. Weller at the time. Sometime later, she saw Warfield coming out of the side entrance to her garage. She left her house and confronted Warfield, who said that he had entered the garage in order to open the front garage door, so that he could clear snow in that area. When Mrs. Weller pointed out that this was not in fact necessary, Warfield said that he had entered the garage in order to rest. When Mrs. Weller examined her garage, she noticed that a can of coins was missing. At this time Warfield was wearing no jacket, and Mrs. Weller testified that the can was too big and heavy to be carried in a pocket. Warfield denied taking the coins. At trial Mrs. Weller testified that she had seen the coins the night before, although the Court characterized the overall evidence as indicating that \u201c[i]t was ... not certain just when Mrs. Weller had last seen the [missing] can.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480, 554 A.2d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">This Court overturned Warfield\u2019s theft conviction because \u201cthe evidence was not sufficient for a rational fact-finder to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Warfield stole the can of coins.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491, 554 A.2d at 1247. The Court noted that \u201cpresence, alone, at the place where a crime has.been committed is not sufficient to establish participation in the perpetration of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Johnson v. State, </em>227 Md. 159, 175 A.2d 580 (1961)). The Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\u201cIt is also true that Warfield had the opportunity to steal the property, but others had the same opportunity between the time Mrs. Weller last saw the can and the arrival of Warfield on the scene. There was no evidence as to whether or not there were footprints in the snow leading to the side entrance to the garage before Warfield cleaned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>walks. When Mrs. Weller saw Warfield leave the garage, the can was missing, but it did not appear to be in War-field\u2019s possession, nor is there even conjecture about how he may have disposed of it had he in fact taken it at that time. Although Mrs. Weller checked on Warfield from time to time from her window, she did not see him enter or leave the garage prior to the time which led to the confrontation, and there is no evidence that he did so. Of course, he could have been in the garage during the period Mrs. Weller did not see him working, but she did not ask him where he was during that time, and the record does not reveal his whereabouts. The mere fact that Mrs. Weller did not see him for half an hour is not enough to support a conclusion that he spent that time in the garage stealing the can of coins. A rational inference may be made from the amount of snow shoveled at the time Mrs. Weller next saw him, that he spent at least a good part of the time during his \u2018disappearance\u2019 shoveling snow out of the sight line of Mrs. Weller from her station at the window of her house.... The only possible support for the notion that Warfield was the thief was his presence at the scene of the crime coupled with the fact that he gave more than one reason for being there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak0\"><em>Id. </em>at 492, 554 A.2d at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\"><em>Warfield </em>indicates that establishing a defendant\u2019s presence at the scene differs from establishing his exclusive custody over an item needed to commit the crime, <em>e.g., </em>the storeroom key necessary to exercise dominion and control over the heroin possessed in <em>Tucker, </em>and differs from establishing his exclusive agency with respect to conduct that formed part of the crime\u2019s <em>actus reus, e.g., </em>the fingerprints on the broken glass in <em>Pressley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In <em>Wilson, </em>319 Md. 530, 573 A.2d 831, the Court considered whether there was sufficient evidence to support Wilson\u2019s conviction for theft. Wilson worked for a cleaning service, and on March 10, 1998, cleaned the residence of a woman who had recently died, and where other members of the family had \u2022been staying since her death. On that day residents of the household discovered that three rings, kept in a bag on top of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>a bureau in a closet in the upstairs master bedroom, were missing. The State\u2019s only evidence consisted of the testimony of the eighty-one year old mother of the deceased. The Court summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">\u201cThe substance of the circumstantial evidence adduced at the trial was that Wilson was present at the residence on March 10, that he cleaned upstairs on that day, and had access to the master bedroom closet where the rings were last seen. The evidence also disclosed that five other people \u2014 [namely, the mother \u2019of the deceased, the latter\u2019s two adult children, and two visitors, one of whom had gone upstairs] \u2014 were also present in the residence on March 10 and also had access to the rings in the master bedroom. Moreover, the evidence indicated that cleaning personnel, in addition to Wilson, might also have been in the residence on March 10. While a defendant\u2019s presence at the scene of a crime is \u2018a very important factor to be considered in determining guilt,\u2019 it is elementary that mere presence is not, <em>of itself, </em>sufficient to establish that that person was either a principal or accessory to the crime. This rule is especially applicable when, as here, the accused\u2019s presence at the crime scene was nonexclusive and was not only expected but authorized. <em>See Warfield v. State, </em>315 Md. 474, 554 A.2d 1238 (1989) (where others also had opportunity to steal object located in garage, and defendant had reasonable explanation for presence in garage, evidence was insufficient to sustain theft conviction).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 537-38, 573 A.2d at 834-35 (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Tasco v. State, </em>223 Md. 503, 509, 165 A.2d 456, 459 (1960)). Because the State did not present any evidence to negate the \u201creasonable hypothesis that someone in the house on March 10 other than Wilson took the rings,\u201d the Court reversed the conviction based on insufficient evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 573 A.2d at 835. Again, <em>Wilson </em>shows that mere presence, especially when nonexclusive, is by itself insufficient to establish an accused\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>In <em>Hebron v. State, </em>331 Md. 219, 627 A.2d 1029, the defendant appealed his conviction for breaking and entering an unoccupied dwelling house. The evidence was presented by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzJ\">\u201c \u2018two individuals who resided in the victim\u2019s develop-ment____Although neither witnessed the breaking of the victim\u2019s door frame, both identified the petitioner, in a lineup, as the driver of the car that was parked in the area just prior to the incident. One witness testified that she saw the petitioner park the car near the victim\u2019s home and, walking between two buildings, proceed in the direction of that home. She then heard a loud \u2018bash bang\u2019 noise. About twenty seconds later, she saw the petitioner emerge from between the two buildings, get into his car, and drive away. The second witness could only testify to seeing the driver; she did not see him approach the building.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 221-22, 627 A.2d at 1030. Splinters from the shattered door frame were found inside the house. <em>Id. </em>at 237-38, 627 A.2d at 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The Court held that this evidence supported the conviction for breaking and entering. The damaged condition of the victim\u2019s door proved a breaking, and this condition</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">\u201c \u2018coupled with the loud bang ... could lead a rational trier of fact reasonably to find that [the accused] used his body to batter the door with such force as to defeat the lock and open the door. From that, the trier of fact could further reasonably infer that, with the application of that kind of body pressure to the door, some part of [the accused\u2019s] body must necessarily have crossed the threshold when the door opened.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 238, 627 A.2d at 1039 (quoting <em>Hebron v. State, </em>92 Md.App. 508, 511-12, 608 A.2d 1291, 1293 (1992) (alterations added)). The Court did not address explicitly the defendant\u2019s <em>exclusive </em>presence at the crime scene. Presumably, the eyewitness evidence that the defendant was near the victim\u2019s door, that twenty seconds elapsed between the defendant\u2019s proceeding toward the door and the sound of the breaking, and that no one else left the scene, sufficed to establish this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>fact beyond a reasonable doubt. Most relevant to the instant case is the <em>Hebron </em>court\u2019s language that a jury could infer that \u201csome part of [the accused\u2019s] body <em>must necessarily </em>have crossed the threshold.\u201d The emphasized portion indicates that a rational jury may draw an inference of a cause (a body part crossing the threshold of the victim\u2019s dwelling) from the effect (the condition of the door), and that this inference can suffice to establish the defendant\u2019s <em>agency </em>in committing the crime, once his exclusive presence has been established. <em>See also Colvin-el v. State, </em>332 Md. 144, 154-55, 630 A.2d 725, 730 (1993) (evidence that defendant\u2019s fingerprints were found on pieces of glass from broken window of home and that defendant pawned jewelry stolen from home unanimously held sufficient to support conviction for felony murder of sole occupant of home), <em>cert. denied, </em>512 U.S. 1227, 114 S.Ct. 2725, 129 L.Ed.2d 849 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In the instant case, the evidence most favorable to the State is that Kyle was fine on February 8, that Deese had exclusive custody over Kyle for several hours on this day, that Faust found her son dead later that day, and that he died due to blunt force head injuries caused by force of a magnitude at work in car crashes and falls from significant heights. There was no direct evidence of how the force was applied. Unlike <em>Wilson, </em>in which other persons were present at the scene of the crime so that the accused\u2019s presence there was not exclusive, Deese was alone with Kyle after Faust and Deese\u2019s mother left the apartment where Deese and Kyle remained. In <em>Hebron, </em>once the defendant\u2019s exclusive presence was established, the Court found that a rational jury could draw the inference of cause (defendant\u2019s unobserved breaking) from effect (the visible condition of the door). Similarly, once Deese\u2019s exclusive presence was established, and in the absence of any alternative explanation, a rational jury could infer beyond a reasonable doubt that Deese inflicted the blunt force head injuries that caused Kyle\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.
