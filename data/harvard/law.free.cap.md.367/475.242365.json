The single question that he raises is whether the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury concerning mistake of fact as a defense. We shall answer that question in the affirmative, reverse the Court of Special Appeals, and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In the early morning hours of December, 11, 1997, the police recovered the body of Lynn Thompson from the shoulder of southbound 1-95, the Capital Beltway, in Prince George\u2019s County. Damian Ramon General, petitioner, had been driving the car that struck and killed Ms. Thompson, and he did not stop after he struck her. The next morning, petitioner gave a statement to the police, which the State introduced as evidence in its case-in-chief at trial. He told them the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">\u201cI was dropping my brother off at the ahm, at a hotel. I was going south, going to my Mother\u2019s house____ [S]he lives off St. Barnabas Road. Ahm and it, it will be a bag, something white was in the, in the far right hand lane and it was a three or a sixteen wheeler beside me on my left. Imagine as I got closer to it, I realized it probably was something, something big, so I tried to move over to my right, so when I moved over, I mean my left. I moved over to my left and I thought I had missed it; that\u2019s when I heard that it hit the side of the, the light. By it being dark I went off, I got off at St. Barnabas, Marlow Heights exit, I went and stopped at the gas station to look at the car and the yellow blinker light was gone, so then I went on home and told my mother. Told my mother that I wrecked Troy\u2019s car, I know he\u2019s going to get me for that, and then she told me don\u2019t worry about it, we\u2019ll see about it in the morning. I got up the next morning and looked at it again, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>I didn\u2019t see no, I didn\u2019t see nothing else but the light gone, the side fender was bent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Trooper First Class David Reinholt of the Maryland State Police testified at trial as an expert in the field of accident reconstruction. In his opinion, the impact of petitioner\u2019s car striking Ms. Thompson occurred on the right shoulder of the roadway, and petitioner\u2019s statement was not consistent with the physical evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Defense counsel requested the Maryland State Bar Association, Inc., Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction (MPJICr) 5:06, which addresses the mistake of fact defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court denied the request, stating that such an instruction was not applicable under the factual scenario of the case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>The court did, however, instruct the jury as to the requisite intent and knowledge of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The trial court instructed the jury as to proof of intent in accord with MCJI-Cr 3:31. The court told the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZc\">\u201cI instruct you that intent is a state of mind and ordinarily cannot be proven directly, because there is no way of looking into another person\u2019s mind. Therefore a defendant\u2019s intent may be shown by surrounding circumstances. In determining the defendant\u2019s intent, you may consider the defendant\u2019s acts and statements, as well as the surrounding circumstances. Further, you may but are not required to infer that a person ordinarily intends the natural and probable consequences of his acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The trial court instructed the jury as to the requisite knowledge of the defendant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">\u201cLadies and Gentlemen, the charges of failing to remain at the scene of an accident involving bodily injury or death, failing to return to the scene of an accident involving personal injury or death, and failing to render assistance to a person injured in an accident require the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had knowledge of both the accident and the underlying injury in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>for the defendant to be found guilty of each of the three charges.... Knowledge in the context of this case can be proven in one of two ways. The first way is actual knowledge. In other words did the State produce any evidence that the defendant actually saw or perceived the accident or injury? The second way in which knowledge is proven is by showing that the defendant should have known that an accident occurred or should have anticipated that ... the accident resulted in an injury to a person. The term should have known is an objective standard and not a subjective one. It means that given all the evidence that you believe you are to determine whether a reasonable person who possessed all of the information at the time of the collision should have known that a collision occurred and should have anticipated that an accident resulted in an injury to a person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Although the court refused to give the requested mistake of fact instruction, the court granted defense counsel\u2019s request to argue mistake of fact in closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Petitioner was convicted of all charges. He noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, that court affirmed the judgments. The court reasoned that \u201c[i]f the jury is adequately instructed as to the intent required for conviction, the mistake of fact instruction is superfluous.\u201d The court then determined that the critical inquiry is whether the instructions as given adequately defined the intent necessary to convict petitioner. Following an examination of the intent instruction, the intermediate appellate court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s charge instructed the jury to convict appellant only if it found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant <em>knew or should have known </em>that an accident occurred. Because the elements of the offense set forth in the trial court\u2019s charge forced the jury to consider appellant\u2019s alleged mistake of fact before conviction, the omission of a mistake of fact instruction did not cause appellant any actual harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The court held that the trial court\u2019s instructions \u201cfairly covered\u201d the mistake of fact instruction requested by petitioner, and, thus, no error occurred in the failure to give the instruction requested by petitioner. We granted certiorari to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">\u201cDoes a jury instruction on the requisite intent necessary to support a conviction on the charged offenses relieve the trial court of the obligation to instruct the jury on a \u2018mistake of fact\u2019 defense generated by the facts, and, specifically, was it error for the trial court in this case to fail to give the jury an instruction on \u2018mistake of fact\u2019 generated in this case?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Petitioner argues that he acted under a mistake of fact, and, as such, he is not criminally responsible for his act. He argues that he is not guilty of the charges because, at the time that his automobile struck Ms. Thompson, he actually and reasonably believed that he struck a trash bag and not a person. The trial court gave a proof of intent instruction, but refused to give defense counsel\u2019s requested instruction on mistake of fact. The State argues that the trial court\u2019s instruction on the mental state required for conviction of the offenses charged adequately covered the mistake of fact defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">As a general rule, mistake of fact is a recognized common law defense to certain crimes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Outmez-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>guine v. State, </em>335 Md. 20, 641 A.2d 870 (1994) (quoting <em>Garnett v. State, </em>332 Md. 571, 632 A.2d 797 (1993)) (Bell, J., dissenting) (stating that, when a defendant generates the issue of mistake of fact, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the act was committed without any mistake of fact); Clark &amp; Marshall Crimes, 323 (Marian Barnes ed., 7th ed.1967) (stating that ignorance or nonnegligent mistake of fact as a defense was well settled at common law). Mistake or ignorance of fact exists when the actor does not know what the actual facts are or believes them to be other than as they are. In essence, a mistake of fact is a defense when it negates the existence of the mental state essential to the crime charged. <em>See </em>Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr., Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 5.1 (2d ed.1986).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The issue posed by our grant of certiorari is whether a jury instruction on the requisite intent necessary to support a conviction on the charged offenses relieves the trial court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the obligation to instruct the jury on a mistake of fact defense generated by the evidence. We answer that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Generally, it is the duty of the trial judge to instruct the jury as to the applicable law of the case. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-325; <em>Roach v. State, </em>358 Md. 418, 749 A.2d 787 (2000). Rule 4-325 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201cThe court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding. The court may give its instructions orally or, with the consent of the parties, in writing instead of orally. The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Maryland Rule 4-325(c). Thus, it is clear that the trial judge is required to give a requested instruction that correctly states the applicable law and that has not been fairly covered in other instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">We have often said that the main purpose of jury instructions is to aid the jury in clearly understanding the case, to provide guidance for the jury\u2019s deliberations, and to help the jury arrive at a correct verdict. <em>See Chambers v. State, </em>337 Md. 44, 650 A.2d 727 (1994). Jury instructions direct the jury\u2019s attention to the legal principles that apply to the facts of the case. <em>See Robertson v. State, </em>112 Md.App. 366, 685 A.2d 805 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">The defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed on any theory of the defense that is fairly supported by the evidence. <em>See Sims v. State, </em>319 Md. 540, 573 A.2d 1317 (1990); <em>Goddard v. United States, </em>557 A.2d 1315 (D.C.1989); 4 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Procedure \u00a7 538 (Charles E. Torcia ed., 12th ed.1976) (stating that the accused has a right to have the jury instructed on the theory of the defense). Once the defendant properly has generated the defense of mistake of fact, he or she is entitled to have the jury understand that the State must still prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt and that the burden never shifts to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>defendant. The trial judge must convey to the jury that its \u201cdetermination that the affirmative defense has not been established is essential to finding that the [State] has met its burden.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Cottam, </em>420 Pa.Super. 311, 616 A.2d 988, 1000-01 (1992).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As in an alibi defense, \u201csuch an instruction is necessary due to the danger that the failure to prove the defense will be taken by the jury as a sign of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Pounds, </em>490 Pa. 621, 633-34, 417 A.2d 597 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">As Chief Justice Rehnquist stated in <em>Mathews v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 58, 63, 108 S.Ct. 883, 887, 99 L.Ed.2d 54 (1988) (citations omitted): \u201cAs a general proposition a defendant is entitled to an instruction as to any recognized defense for which there exists evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find in his favor. A parallel rule has been applied in the context of a lesser included offense instruction____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The rationale supporting a defendant\u2019s right to an alibi instruction is equally applicable to a defendant\u2019s right to an instruction on mistake of fact. In <em>Smith v. State, </em>302 Md. 175, 486 A.2d 196 (1985), this Court was confronted with the issue of whether a defendant is entitled to a specific instruction on alibi. We held that the trial court committed reversible error in refusing to instruct the jury on alibi, reasoning that, when the evidence in a criminal case has generated the issue of alibi, and when the defendant has requested an instruction addressed to the matter of alibi, the defendant is entitled to a specific alibi instruction, and the trial court\u2019s general instructions concerning the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof, etc., are not deemed fairly to cover the matter of alibi. <em>See id. </em>at 180, 486 A.2d at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Whether a particular instruction must be given depends upon whether there is any evidence in the case that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>supports the instruction; it the requested instruction has not been generated by the evidence, the trial court is not required to give it. <em>See Roach, </em>358 Md. at 428-29, 749 A.2d at 792-93; <em>Hof v. State, </em>337 Md. 581, 655 A.2d 370 (1995); <em>Binnie v. State, </em>321 Md. 572, 582, 583 A.2d 1037, 1041 (1991). Whether the evidence is sufficient to generate the requested instruction in the first instance is a question of law for the judge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Roach, </em>358 Md. at 428, 749 A.2d at 792; <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 221, 571 A.2d 1251, 1259 (1990). In evaluating whether competent evidence exists to generate the requested instruction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the accused. <em>See Stagner v. State, </em>842 P.2d 520, 522 (Wyo. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In reviewing the adequacy of jury instructions, we review the instructions as a whole. If the instructions given as a whole adequately cover the theory of the defense, the trial court does not need to give the specific requested instruction. <em>See Roach, </em>358 Md. at 427, 749 A.2d at 792; <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 592, 479 A.2d 1344, 1348 (1984). We emphasize, however, that, although we hold that a defendant is entitled to a theory of the defense instruction, a defendant is not entitled to a mirror-image instruction in other settings. A skilled advocate could take nearly any of the instructions typically given by a court and, with some imagination, create a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>negative mirror image of it. The principle articulated in Maryland Rule 4-325(c) still governs: \u201c[t]he court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In the instant case, petitioner\u2019s primary defense at trial was that he did not know that his vehicle had hit a person. The evidence before the jury was that, at night, petitioner, traveling in the far right travel lane, struck an object lying on the roadway in the right portion of his lane of travel. The object appeared to him to be \u201ca bag, something white.\u201d The morning after the incident, petitioner went to the police station and gave a statement to the police, offering his version of the event and admitting that he was driving the vehicle that apparently struck and killed Ms. Thompson. Petitioner did not testify at trial, but the State offered his pretrial statement into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">As we have noted, knowledge that the defendant struck a person is an element of the charged offenses of \u00a7\u00a7 20-102(a) and (b) and 20-104(a). If petitioner did not know that he struck a person and reasonably believed that he merely struck a white bag, then his mistake of fact was a defense to those crimes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Most other jurisdictions require a mistake of fact instruction even when the trial court instructs the jury as to the required mental element of the charged offense. For example, in <em>People v. Crane, </em>145 Ill.2d 520, 165 Ill.Dec. 703, 585 N.E.2d 99 (1991), the trial court instructed the jury on self-defense, but refused to instruct the jury on mistake of fact. The Illinois Supreme Court reversed, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">\u201cThe instruction, while significantly informing the jury of the mental state requirement, does not expressly draw to the jury\u2019s attention the concept of mistake of fact. Since Illinois recognizes the defense of mistake of fact, when this defense is supported by the evidence it is not sufficient to merely inform the jury of the mental state requirements, but it must also be informed of the validity of the mistake of fact defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Similarly, the Iowa Supreme Court rejected the State\u2019s argument that an intent instruction adequately covered a properly generated mistake of fact defense. In Iowa, mistake or ignorance of fact is a defense to a crime requiring intent if it was reasonable and not due to carelessness or negligence. <em>See State v. Freeman, </em>267 N.W.2d 69, 70 (Iowa 1978). In the context of a theft case, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">\u201cWe cannot agree the theory of mistake of fact was adequately explained to the jury by the uniform instruction on intent. It is true a mistake of fact would, under its definition, make it impossible for defendant to form a criminal intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">Mistake of fact nevertheless remains a separate and distinct issue notwithstanding its relation to the State\u2019s duty to prove a criminal intent. Mistake of fact was defendant\u2019s sole and only theory of defense. It did not vanish merely because it can be stated the mistake could not coexist with a criminal intent. We have said: \u2018Courts have the duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>instruct juries \"... on the law applicable to the facts as disclosed by the evidence, and must so instruct if there is evidence admitted which supports some involved issue.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 71. <em>See Adcock v. State, </em>260 Ga. 302, 392 S.E.2d 886 (1990) (holding that reversible error can occur from failure to give a mistake of fact instruction even if it is not the defendant\u2019s sole defense); <em>Crane, </em>165 Ill.Dec. 703, 585 N.E.2d at 102 (holding that \u201ca defendant is entitled to instruction on his theory of the case if there is some foundation for the instruction in the evidence\u201d); <em>Jewell v. Commonwealth, </em>549 S.W.2d 807, 812 (Ky.1977) (noting that the defense of mistake of fact, when raised, requires an instruction calling it to the jury\u2019s attention); <em>State v. Collin, </em>741 A.2d 1074 (Me.1999) (holding that, when a defendant raises an affirmative defense supported by competent evidence, the trial court must instruct the jury that the State needs to disprove the affirmative defense in order to convict); <em>Bang v. State, </em>815 S.W.2d 838, 842 (Tex.App.1991) (holding that \u201c[w]hen an accused creates an issue of mistaken belief as to the culpable mental element of the offense, he is entitled to a defensive instruction on \u2018mistake of fact\u2019 \u201d); <em>Stagner, </em>842 P.2d at 522 (holding that the theory of the case instruction, where appropriate evidence exists, is a basic tenant of criminal law and a procedural concomitant of due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The knowledge and intent instructions, while sufficiently informing the jury of the required mental element, did not expressly direct the jury\u2019s attention to the defense of mistake of fact. Were we to accept the State\u2019s argument that the instruction on intent and knowledge fairly covered the mistake of fact defense, there would never be an occasion to give the instruction. Petitioner was entitled to an instruction on the theory of his defense, as he requested. The trial court abused its discretion in declining to give the requested instruction, and a new trial is in order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

Inasmuch as the defense of mistake of fact goes to the mental state or <em>mens rea </em>of the offense charged, we look at the statute to determine the requisite mental elements.</p>\n<p id=\"AUL\">Sections 20-102 and 20-104 require knowledge that the accident resulted in injury or death to a person, or property damage, respectively. <em>See Comstock v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 744, 573 A.2d 117 (1990) (holding that, in order for a driver to be convicted of leaving the scene of a personal injury accident, the conditions must have been such that the driver knew, should have known, or reasonably should have anticipated that the accident and the resulting injury occurred). While the word \"accident\u201d is not defined specifically in the statute, when used in these sections, it relates solely to occurrences actually resulting in death, personal injury, or property damage. <em>See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. West, </em>149 F.Supp. 289 (D.Md.1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b643-8\">. In <em>Garnett v. State, </em>332 Md. 571, 632 A.2d 797 (1993), the Court discussed mistake of fact in the context of statutory rape. Chief Judge Murphy, writing for the Court, addressed the general requirement of the concurrence of <em>mens rea </em>and <em>actus reas </em>for criminal culpability. The Chief Judge noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">\"At common law, a crime occurred only upon the concurrence of an individual\u2019s act and his guilty state of mind.

The requirement that an accused have acted with a culpable mental state is an axiom of criminal jurisprudence.

When reviewing the propriety of the trial court\u2019s refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>give a requested jury instruction, our Court must examine whether the requested instruction was a correct statement of the law, whether that law was applicable in light of the facts of the case and the evidence before the jury, and finally, and most pertinent to the issue before us, whether the instruction actually given fairly covered the substance of the requested instruction. <em>See Patterson v.

As the trial court is only required to give a requested instruction if the instruction satisfies each of these conditions, appellate review is also so limited: \u201c[s]o long as the law is fairly covered by the jury instructions, reviewing courts should not disturb them.\u201d <em>See Tharp v.

This, I believe, is precisely the situation before us today: the substance of the requested jury instruction on the mistake of fact defense was embodied by the instructions pertaining to the knowledge and intent requirements for the crimes for which the defendant was on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">With respect to the intent requirement, and in accordance with Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 3:31, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">With regard to intent, you are instructed intent is a state of mind and ordinarily cannot be proved directly, because there is no way of looking into another person\u2019s mind. Therefore a defendant\u2019s intent may be shown by surrounding circumstances. In determining the defendant\u2019s intent, you may consider the defendant\u2019s acts and statements, as well as the surrounding circumstances. Further, you may but you are not required to infer that a person ordinarily inten[d]s the natural and probable consequences of his acts. When instructing the jury as to the requisite knowledge of</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9f\">the defendant, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">With regard to knowledge, and knowledge is required in the second [failure to remain at the scene of an accident involving bodily injury or death], third [failing to return to the scene of an accident involving personal injury or death], and fourth [failing to render assistance to a person injured in an accident], of the charged offenses, and I instruct you as follows. Knowledge, in the context of this case, can be proven in one of two ways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">The first way is actual knowledge. In other words, did the State produce any evidence that the defendant actually saw or perceived the accident or injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">The second way in which knowledge is proven is by showing that the defendant should have known that an accident occurred or should have anticipated that ... the accident resulted in an injury to a person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">The term \u2018should have known\u2019 is an objective standard and not a subjective one. It means that given all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>evidence that you believe, you are to determine whether a reasonable person who possessed all of the information at the time of the collision, should have known that a collision occurred and should have anticipated that [the] accident resulted in an injury to a person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The petitioner requested that the trial court provide the following instruction regarding the mistake of fact defense based on Maryland Pattern Jury Instruction 5:06:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">You have heard evidence that the defendant\u2019s actions were based on a mistake of fact. Mistake of fact is a defense and you are required to find the defendant not guilty if all of the following three factors are present:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">(1) the defendant actually believed <em>(alleged mistake);</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">(2) the defendant\u2019s belief and actions were reasonable under the circumstances; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">(3) the defendant did not intend to commit the crime of <em>(crime) </em>and the defendant\u2019s conduct would not have amounted to the crime of <em>(crime) </em>if the mistaken belief had been correct, meaning that, if the true facts were what the defendant thought them to be, the [defendant\u2019s conduct would not have been criminal][defendant would have the defense of <em>(defense) ].</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">In order to convict the defendant, the State must show that the mistake of fact defense does not apply in this case by proving, beyond a reasonable belief, that at least one of the three factors previously stated was absent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">While I believe that even a cursory comparison of the requested mistake of fact instruction and the issued intent and knowledge instructions reveals the substantive similarities, I will proceed with the following factor-by-factor analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">First, pursuant to the requested mistake of fact instruction, the jury would have been instructed that it must find that the petitioner <em>actually believed </em>he hit a trash bag (the mistaken fact) and not the victim, Lynn Thompson (the accident which caused the injury/death). Under the issued instructions, the jury was instructed that it must find that the petitioner had <em>actual knowledge </em>that the accident or injury occurred, and that the State produced evidence demonstrating that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>petitioner perceived the accident or injury. No consequential distinction between these instructions exists. A finding that the petitioner had actual knowledge of the accident or injury implicitly requires a finding of the absence of mistake; one who actually believes he hit a trash bag cannot have actual knowledge that the accident or death occurred, and vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">In addition to requiring the jury to find that the petitioner actually believed he hit a trash bag, the requested instruction would have required the jury to find that this belief was <em>reasonable under the circumstances. </em>Similarly, the issued instructions required the jury to \u201cdetermine whether a reasonable person who possessed all of the information at the time of the collision, should have known that a collision occurred and should have anticipated that the accident resulted in an injury to a person.\u201d To achieve such a finding and attain a conviction, the State was required to demonstrate that the petitioner\u2019s beliefs (i.e. that he hit a trash bag when, in fact, he actually hit and killed a woman) and actions (i.e. subsequently leaving the scene of an accident) were objectively unreasonable. Again, no consequential distinction between these instructions exists. If, pursuant to the requested instruction, the jury had found that the petitioner\u2019s belief \u2014 i.e. hitting a trash bag instead of a human being \u2014 was reasonable, then clearly the State would not have met its burden to demonstrate that the petitioner \u201cshould have known\u201d that the accident and injury occurred, pursuant to the issued instruction. These instructions are mirror-images; a finding of one outcome necessarily requires the absence of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Finally, the third factor of the requested mistake of fact instruction would have required the jury to find that the petitioner did not intend to commit the crimes for which he was charged. That the trial judge in this case independently instructed the jury on the intent requirements for the crimes charged is indisputable, as is, I believe, the conclusion that this portion of the requested instruction and the issued instruction on intent are comparable.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">As discussed, <em>supra, </em>this Court may disturb a trial judge\u2019s instructions only when errors of law occur. When the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>instructions fairly cover the substance of the requested instruction, the trial court, in denying the requested instruction, cannot be said to have committed an error warranting reversal. A purely commonsensical application of the \u201cfairly cover\u201d standard, as outlined by Rule 4-325(c), prescribes the conclusion that the requested instruction is fairly covered by the issued instructions in this case, and that no error of law occurred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That notwithstanding, I will delve briefly into the case law on which the majority relies, as I believe it is distinguishable from, and inapplicable to, the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The majority emphasizes the principle that whether a particular instruction must be given depends upon whether there is any evidence in the case that supports the instruction. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 487 (citing <em>Roach, </em>358 Md. at 428-29, 749 A.2d at 792-93; <em>Hof v. State, </em>337 Md. 581, 655 A.2d 370 (1995); <em>Binnie v. State, </em>321 Md. 572, 582, 583 A.2d 1037, 1041 (1991)). While correctly restating the law, the sufficiency of the evidence generated by the petitioner regarding a mistake of fact is not in dispute. Unfortunately, the decisional issue before this Court \u2014 whether the requested instruction was fairly covered by the issued instructions \u2014 becomes muddled with the majority\u2019s discussion of sufficiency of evidence rather than retaining its separate and independent structure and analysis. I agree that a particular instruction only may be given upon the presentation of some evidence that supports the requested instruction. <em>See Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 216-17, 571 A.2d 1251, 1256-57 (1990). That an instruction is supported by the evidence, however, does not necessarily mean that the failure to give the requested instruction renders the instructions actually given inadequate; nor does it mean that the defendant is entitled automatically to the very instruction he requests. To the contrary, a defendant is entitled to the instruction so long as it is generated by the evidence <em>AND </em>is not fairly covered by the instructions given. These are two separate inquiries; the petitioner may have satisfied the first, but he failed to satisfy the second condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The majority states that \u201c[o]nce the defendant properly has generated the defense of mistake of fact, he or she is entitled to have the jury understand that the State must still prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt and that the burden never shifts to the defendant.\u201d <em>See </em>maj. op. at 485-86. While this, too, is a legally sound assertion, the majority fails to explain how this principle was thwarted by the trial court\u2019s failure to give a mistake of fact instruction. The court\u2019s instructions neither allude to a shift in the burden of proof nor do they fail to assist the jury in understanding that the State is required to establish each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. It is altogether unclear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>how the majority\u2019s assertion \u2014 that a jury must understand that the State must prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 is better promoted by the conclusion it demands, i.e. requiring the trial court to issue a mistake of fact instruction. Furthermore, as will be discussed in greater detail <em>infra, </em>the authority for establishing such a requirement is seemingly lacking: The mistake of fact defense remains a common law defense in this State; accordingly, the authority to demand a mistake of fact instruction cannot be based on any explicit legislative recognition of the specific theory of defense. Furthermore, Rule 4-325(c) only mandates that the issued jury instructions fairly cover the requested instruction; I firmly believe the issued instructions in this case met the requirements of Rule 4-325(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The majority relies on the case of <em>Smith v. State, </em>302 Md. 175, 486 A.2d 196 (1985), to advance its contention that a defendant has a <em>right </em>to an instruction on mistake of fact. Such reliance is misplaced, and the legal principles for which the <em>Smith </em>case stands, inappropriately applied. The issue before our Court in <em>Smith </em>was whether the evidence generated by the defense, i.e. his alibi, was sufficient to require the trial court to issue the requested instruction on the alibi issue, <em>see id. </em>at 179, 486 A.2d at 197; the issue was not whether the issued jury instructions fairly covered the requested (alibi) instruction. That we supported a defendant\u2019s right to an alibi instruction <em>because we held the evidence to be sufficient to warrant the instruction, see id. </em>at 183, 486 A.2d at 200, does not mean that we should, today, grant a defendant an automatic right to a mistake of fact instruction upon generating sufficient evidence, particularly when the substance of the requested instruction has been fairly covered by the issued instructions concerning knowledge and intent in this case. Furthermore, that we mentioned that \u201cthe defendant is entitled to a specific alibi instruction, and ... the trial court\u2019s general instructions concerning the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof, etc., are not deemed \u2018fairly to cover\u2019 the matter of alibi,\u201d has little persuasive value to the issue in the case <em>sub judice. Id. </em>at 180, 486 A.2d at 198 (citing <em>Pulley v. State, </em>38 Md.App. 682, 688-91, 382 A.2d 621, 624-26 (1978)). Unlike an alibi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>instruction and a \u201ccourt\u2019s general instructions concerning the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof, etc.,\u201d the mistake of fact instruction and the intent and knowledge instructions are mirror images, easily meeting the standard established by Rule 4-325(c) because the intent and knowledge instructions \u201cfairly cover\u201d the requested mistake of fact instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The cases to which the majority cites from other jurisdictions are also distinguishable. In <em>Iowa v. Freeman, </em>267 N.W.2d at 70, the Supreme Court of Iowa did indeed consider a similar issue, i.e. whether the concept of mistake of fact was adequately covered in the trial court\u2019s intent instruction. There exists one important factual distinction, however, which makes the application of the Iowa decision inappropriate: contrary to the trial court\u2019s instructions in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the lower court in Iowa <em>did not provide the jury a knowledge instruction, </em>rather, the court only provided an instruction on intent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Supreme Court of Iowa was required to consider the necessity of a mistake of fact instruction in terms of the issued intent instruction. <em>Id. </em>As I indicated <em>supra, </em>the intent instruction only \u201cfairly covers\u201d prong three of the standard mistake of fact instruction. Without a knowledge instruction, two critical elements of the mistake of fact defense \u2014 the <em>actual belief </em>by the defendant and the <em>reasonableness </em>of that belief \u2014 would not have been \u201cfairly covered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">I cannot predict whether the Iowa Court would have decided differently had a knowledge instruction been issued along with the intent instruction. I can state confidently, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>that had the trial court in this case neglected to adequately instruct the jury on the knowledge requirements for the crimes for which the defendant was charged, I would not be dissenting today. Knowledge and intent are similar concepts, but not synonymous. Knowledge is an \u201cunderstanding of a fact or circumstance,\u201d <em>see </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 876 (7th Ed.1999), and intent is \u201cthe mental resolution or determination to do\u201d an act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 813 (7th Ed.1999). A mistake of fact defense requires <em>both </em>an absence of knowledge about the facts or circumstances and an absence of intent to commit the criminal act. Therefore, the Iowa Court\u2019s analysis \u2014 based only on a review of an intent instruction \u2014 is immaterial to the issue presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The majority also relies on the analysis of the Illinois Supreme Court in <em>People v. Crane, </em>145 Ill.2d 520, 165 Ill.Dec. 703, 585 N.E.2d 99 (1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 924, 112 S.Ct. 1977, 118 L.Ed.2d 576 (1992), which considered whether the defendant was denied a fair trial when the trial court refused to instruct on mistake of fact defense. Again, the issue appears facially similar to the one presently before us, but two important distinctions exist. First, contrary to Maryland Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>4-325(c), the comparable Illinois Rule,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> has largely been interpreted by its Supreme Court as a compulsory rule, i.e. \u201c[a] defendant is <em>entitled, </em>to an instruction on his theory of the case if there is some foundation for the instruction in the evidence.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 102 (citing <em>People v. Unger </em>66 Ill.2d 333, 5 Ill.Dec. 848, 362 N.E.2d 319, 321 (1977))(emphasis added). A trial court\u2019s consideration on the necessity of a jury instruction in Illinois is solely dependent upon the sufficiency of the evidence, while trial courts in Maryland have the additional consideration of whether the issued instructions have fairly covered the substance of the requested instruction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Rule 4-325(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>The second distinction between Illinois and Maryland law, which makes the application of the <em>Crane </em>analysis improper, is that while a mistake of fact is a common law defense in Maryland, <em>see Wynn v. State, </em>351 Md. 307, 330-31, 718 A.2d 588, 599-600 (1998); <em>Outmezguine v. State, </em>335 Md. 20, 47-48, 641 A.2d 870, 883-84 (1994), the Legislature explicitly provides for a mistake of fact defense in Illinois. <em>See </em>\u00a7 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/4-8 (West 1993). In fact, nearly every jurisdiction to which the majority cites, <em>see </em>maj. op. at pg. 490, statutorily recognizes a mistake of fact defense. <em>See e.g. </em>GaCode. Ann. \u00a7 16-3-5 (1999); \u00a7 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/4-8 (West 1993); Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 501.070 (Michie 1999); Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A \u00a7 36 (West 1983); Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 8.02 (West 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">This Court has never stated that a defendant is only entitled to a theory of defense instruction when the defense is recognized by the Legislature; nor do I propose the adoption of such a principle today. I do believe, however, that when the Legislature explicitly recognizes a theory of defense, an instruction regarding that defense is independently compulsory. Our Court affirmed this principle in <em>Sibert v. State, </em>301 Md. 141, 482 A.2d 483, (1984), holding that \u201cwhen the legislature explicitly enumerated four defenses to the crime of theft, it intended a defendant to be entitled to a jury instruction on any defense generated by the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154, 482 A.2d at 490; <em>accord Binnie v. State, </em>321 Md. at 582-83, 583 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>1042.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Where the Legislature does not provide a statutory theory of defense and one exists only on the basis of judicial creation, this Court should measure the necessity of a requested jury instruction under the only guidance and authority remaining, the guidance provided to all courts for jury instruction matters: Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 325(c). Thus, this Court must consider whether the issued jury instructions \u201cfairly cover\u201d the requested instruction; if so, no error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Because I believe that the knowledge and intent instructions issued by the trial court in this case fairly cover the requested mistake of fact instruction, I would find no error of law. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-5\">. That intent and knowledge instructions fairly covered a requested mistake of fact instruction is also evidenced by LaFave and Scott\u2019s <em>Substantive Criminal Law, </em>quoted in part by the Court of Special Appeals in its unreported affirmance of the trial court's judgment, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">[i]n actuality, the basic rule is extremely simple: ignorance or mistake of fact ... is a defense when it negatives the existence of a mental state essential to the crime charged. Indeed it is so simple because, unlike the other defenses discussed in this chapter, it is merely a restatement in somewhat different form of one of the basic premises of the criminal law. Instead of speaking of ignorance or mistake of fact or law as a defense, it would be just as easy to note simply that the defendant cannot be convicted when it is shown that he does not have the mental state required by law for commission of that particular offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">1 Wayne R.

Several jurisdictions have held in accordance with this principle and do not require a trial court to specifically give a mistake of fact instruction so long as the court instructed the jury adequately on intent and knowledge. <em>See State v. Charles, </em>628 N.W.2d 734, 738 (S.D.2001)(stating that \"whenever an intent instruction involving the defendant's mental state is given, the mistake of fact concept is automatically included and does not merit a separate instruction\u201d) (quoting <em>State v.

Dellatore, </em>761 A.2d 226, 231-32 (R.I.2000)(holding that instructions regarding the requisite intent of the defendant precluded the necessity for a mistake of fact instruction); <em>State v.

The trial court\u2019s intent instruction in <em>Freeman </em>was very similar to the intent instruction issued by the trial court in the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">Where intent is an essential element of any of the offenses charged, it must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The intent with which an act is done is a purpose or mental condition seldom capable of proof by positive or direct evidence. Such intent, if any, may be arrived at by such just and reasonable inferences and deductions from the facts and circumstances proved by the evidence as the guarded judgment of a candid and cautious person would ordinarily draw therefrom. The law warrants an inference that when a person intentionally commits an act, he intends the natural results or consequences to follow which ordinarily do follow such acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">267 N.W.2d at 70.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b660-6\">.

Intention and knowledge commonly go together, for he who intends a result usually knows that it will follow, and he who knows the consequences of his act usually intends them. But there may be intention without knowledge, the consequence being desired but not foreknown as certain or even probable.
