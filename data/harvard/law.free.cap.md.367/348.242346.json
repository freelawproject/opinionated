We agree and shall hold that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were a direct comment on petitioner\u2019s exercise of his privilege against self-incrimination. The error was not harmless, and a new trial is therefore in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In March, 1998, the home of Mr. and Mrs. Davis was burglarized and several items of property taken. The missing items included: a twenty-two caliber revolver, a shotgun, jewelry, coins, four women\u2019s leather jackets, two men\u2019s leather jackets, and a pair of leather chaps. On the basement stairs, the police found a shoe print of a person\u2019s boot; they found a similar print on a shirt left in the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">On March 4, 1998, Ridgely police officer Phil Dixon spoke with a person who told him that Smith offered to sell a twenty-two caliber revolver that matched the description of the gun stolen from the Davis\u2019 home. Based on this information, the police secured a search and seizure warrant for Smith\u2019s home. They found no evidence linking him to the burglary. On March 9, 1998, Officer Dixon interviewed Denise Brown, who told him that she purchased a leather jacket from Smith for twenty dollars. Ms. Brown also said that Smith showed some leather clothing to Richard Greenwood. The police contacted Greenwood, and he told them that he bought a men\u2019s leather jacket and leather chaps from Smith. The police then showed the leather clothing to Mr. and Mrs. Davis, who identified it as their property. The police also compared Smith\u2019s shoes to the print found at the Davis\u2019 home and concluded that it was \u201can exact match or a near exact match.\u201d Smith was arrested. While he was in jail, he telephoned Arkendra Candi. Candi testified at trial that Smith asked her to telephone Denise Brown and offer her a bribe to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>change her story and deny receiving the clothing from Smith. Greenwood and Brown also testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Petitioner was tried in the Circuit Court for Caroline County before a jury on charges of first degree burglary, conspiracy to obstruct justice, malicious destruction of property, and four counts of theft. Petitioner did not testify and presented no evidence on his behalf. The prosecutor argued in closing argument that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\u201cThe Judge has said that you can look backwards in this case. Look to see who ends up with the property and then you can work backwards and here if the recent unexplained possession of stolen property allows you to work backwards to conclude, hey, this guy was the thief, this guy was the burglar. In making that conclusion, ask yourself this. <em>What explanation </em>has been given to us <em>by the defendant </em>for having the leather goods? Zero, none.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The defense objected to the last comment, but the trial court, before the jury, overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection, stating: \u201cI think that\u2019s a comment on the evidence. Overruled. I think he was as much referring to any excplanation to the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Smith was convicted by the jury on all counts and sentenced to a term of incarceration. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. The intermediate appellate court found that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s remarks in closing concerned the lack of evidence to excplain, on some legitimate basis, appellant\u2019s possession of the Davises\u2019 leather clothing and did not concern appellant\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d Rejecting Smith\u2019s argument that the prosecutor commented on his failure to testify, the court reasoned that the prosecutor\u2019s comments merely \u201cserved to highlight that none of the witnesses who testified at trial could refute or excplain the fact that, soon after the burglary, appellant was seen in possession of the Davises\u2019 missing leather goods.\u201d We granted Smith\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Smith v. State, </em>360 Md. 485, 759 A.2d 230 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Before this Court, Smith argues that the prosecutor directly referred to his failure to testify and that this error was not harmless. The State counters that the prosecutor\u2019s remark was merely a comment on the lack of evidence to explain Smith\u2019s possession of recently stolen property. In the State\u2019s view, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were made to remind the jury that it could infer that Smith was the thief from his unexplained possession of recently stolen goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">We begin with a brief discussion of the privilege against self-incrimination. It has long been the law in Maryland that a defendant in a criminal trial need not testify. Comment upon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify in a criminal trial was prohibited in Maryland before the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed2d. 106 (1965), held that the federal constitutional right against compelled self-incrimination prohibits prosecutorial comment on the accused\u2019s silence or failure to testify. <em>See e.g., Woodson v. State, </em>325 Md. 251, 265, 600 A.2d 420, 426 (1992) (citing <em>Barber v. State, </em>191 Md. 555, 62 A.2d 616 (1948); <em>King v. State, </em>190 Md. 361, 58 A.2d 663 (1948); <em>Smith v. State, </em>169 Md. 474, 182 A. 287 (1936)). Today, the privilege against self-incrimination is protected by the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2000 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>ings Article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Woodson, </em>325 Md. at 264-65, 600 A.2d at 426 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Despite our long history of protecting defendants\u2019 right not to testify, a prosecutor may summarize the evidence and comment on its qualitative and quantitative significance. <em>See Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 412-13, 326 A.2d 707, 714 (1974). In closing argument, lawyers have wide latitude to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence, and discuss the nature, extent, and character of the evidence. <em>See Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 681-82, 759 A.2d 764, 780 (2000); <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 429-30, 722 A.2d 887, 901 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In evaluating whether a prosecutor\u2019s comments are improper, this Court long ago set forth the following test: is the remark <em>\u201csusceptible of the inference </em>by the jury that they were to consider the silence of the traverser in the face of the accusation of the prosecuting witness as an indication of his guilt.\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>169 Md. 474, 476, 182 A. 287, 288 (1936) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Smith, </em>a trial for bastardy, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>prosecutor argued before the jury that \u201cthis defendant has sat here all during the trial and has not denied his fatherhood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">\u201cThere can be no question of the impropriety of this remark, as it was susceptible of the inference by the jury that they were to consider the silence of the traverser in the face of the accusation of the prosecuting witness as an indication of his guilt. The constitutional provision [Declaration of Rights, art. 22] is \u2018that no man ought to be compelled to give evidence against himself in a criminal case,\u2019 but the statutory law enlarges this privilege by declaring: \u2018In the trial of all indictments, complaints and other proceedings against persons charged with the commission of crimes and offense * * * the person so charged shall at his own request, but not otherwise, be deemed a competent witness; but the neglect or refusal of any such person to testify shall not create any presumption against him.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Maryland is not alone in adopting a test that is highly protective of a defendant\u2019s ability to exercise his Fifth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ment right to remain silent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Indiana Supreme Court, for example, rejected the \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d test, finding that it is the test \u201cwhich goes the farthest in allowing the prosecution to remark on the accused\u2019s silence.... \u201d <em>Rowley v. Indiana, </em>259 Ind. 209, 285 N.E.2d 646 (1972). The court adopted a test much like the Maryland <em>Smith </em>test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201cWe prefer the test which does not in such an obvious fashion place the burden on the accused to show that the jury <em>necessarily </em>took the comment to be related to his failure to take the stand. A more reasonable test, in our opinion, was stated in <em>Williams v. Wainwright, </em>416 F.2d 1042 (5th Cir.1969), where the court stated that it is settled in both Federal and Florida law that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-4\">A comment made by the prosecuting attorney, directly or indirectly which is subject to interpretation by a jury as a comment upon failure of a defendant to testify has been strictly regarded as an impingement on the substantial right of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 648. <em>See also Moore v. Indiana, </em>669 N.E.2d 733 (1996) (recounting the history of the no-comment rule, adhering to the <em>Rowley </em>decision, and rejecting <em>Morrison-Knowles).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Likewise, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts applies a test similar to the Maryland test as set out in <em>Smith: </em>irrespective of the prosecutor\u2019s intent, the test is whether the remarks were reasonably susceptible of being interpreted as a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to take the witness stand. <em>See Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>387 Mass. 900, 444 N.E.2d 374, 381 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Florida also has adopted the \u201cfairly susceptible\u201d test and specifically rejected the \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d test. When asked by the State to abandon the \u201cfairly susceptible\u201d test, the Supreme Court of Florida held that \u201cthe fairly susceptible test offers more protection to defendants than does the federal test, and we decline the state\u2019s invitation to adopt the latter [for purposes of the state constitution].\u201d <em>State v. Kinchen, </em>490 So.2d 21, 22 (Fla.1985); <em>Rodriguez v. State, </em>753 So.2d 29, 37 (Fla.2000) (\u201cThe \u2018fairly susceptible\u2019 test is a very \u2018liberal rule.\u2019 \u201d). In <em>Trafficante v. State, </em>92 So.2d 811 (Fla.1957), the Supreme Court of Florida stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">\u201c[0]ur law prohibits any comment to be made, directly or indirectly, upon the failure of the defendant to testify. This is true without regard to the character of the comment, or the motive or intent with which it is made, <em>if such comment is subject to an interpretation which would bring it within </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>the statutory prohibition and regardless of its susceptibility to a different construction. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 814 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In keeping with the test established in <em>Smith, </em>this Court has viewed references to a defendant\u2019s failure to testify as violative of a defendant\u2019s Article 22 and Fifth Amendment rights. In <em>Griffin v. State, </em>which addressed both the trial court\u2019s jury instruction and the prosecutor\u2019s comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, the United States Supreme Court explained the significance of the prohibition against the prosecution\u2019s commenting on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azg\">\u201cFor comment on the refusal to testify is a remnant of the \u2018inquisitorial system of criminal justice\u2019 which the Fifth Amendment outlaws. It is a penalty imposed by courts for exercising a constitutional privilege. It cuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly. It is said, however, that the inference of guilt for failure to testify as to facts peculiarly within the accused\u2019s knowledge is in any event natural and irresistible, and that comment on the failure does not magnify that inference into a penalty for asserting a constitutional privilege. What the jury may infer, given no help from the court is one thing. What it may infer when the court solemnizes the silence of the accused into evidence against him is quite another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">380 U.S. at 614, 85 S.Ct. at 1232-1233, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">In the instant case, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks to the jury, \u201cwhat explanation has been given to us <em>by the Defen</em>dant,\u201d and his answer, \u201czero, none,\u201d referred to the defendant\u2019s decision to exercise his constitutionally afforded right to remain silent. The prosecutor did not suggest that his comments were directed towards the defense\u2019s failure to present witnesses or evidence; rather, the prosecutor referred to the failure of the defendant alone to provide an explanation. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were therefore susceptible of the inference by the jury that it was to consider the silence of the defendant as an indication of his guilt, and, as such, the comments clearly constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>As is suggested above, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments merely addressed the lack of evidence to explain Smith\u2019s possession of the leather goods. To so conclude would ignore the prosecutor\u2019s explicit reference to the defendant and the insinuated duty of the defendant personally to offer an explanation for his possession of the property. The prosecutor\u2019s comment went beyond any qualitative assessment of the evidence in that, when he asked the jury \u201cwhat explanation has been given to us by the <em>defendant,\u201d </em>he effectively suggested that the defendant had an obligation to testify at trial. This burden-shifting is contrary to the basic tenets of our criminal justice system, an accusatorial system, where the question is whether the government has met its burden of proof. <em>See Mitchell v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 314, 330, 119 S.Ct. 1307, 1316, 143 L.Ed.2d 424 (1999); <em>Sullivan v. Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 277-78, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 2080, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993)(explaining that the burden of proving all elements of the offense charged falls on the prosecutor, who must persuade the fact finder beyond a reasonable doubt of the facts necessary to establish each of those elements).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">We recognize that prosecutors and judges are permitted to argue or comment that the unexplained possession of recently stolen goods permits the inference that the possessor was the thief. <em>See, e.g., Grant v. State, </em>318 Md. 672, 680, 569 A.2d 1237, 1241 (1990); <em>Brewer v. Mele, </em>267 Md. 437, 449, 298 A.2d 156, 164 (1972); <em>Cason v. State, </em>230 Md. 356, 358, 187 A.2d 103, 104 (1963); <em>Stapf v. State, </em>230 Md. 106, 108, 185 A.2d 496, 497 (1962); <em>Lewis v. State, </em>225 Md. 474, 475-76, 171 A.2d 244, 245 (1961); <em>Glaros v. State, </em>223 Md. 272, 280, 164 A.2d 461, 466 (1960);\u2019 <em>Felkner v. State, </em>218 Md. 300, 305, 146 A.2d 424, 428 (1958); <em>Debinski v. State, </em>194 Md. 355, 360, 71 A.2d 460, 462 (1950). A majority of courts have held that prosecutors may comment on the uncontradicted nature of the prosecution\u2019s evidence <em>unless </em>the only person who could have contradicted, denied,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> rebutted or disputed the evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the defendant himself. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cotnam, </em>88 F.3d 487, 497 (7th Cir.1996); Annotation, <em>Comment or Argument by Court or Counsel That Prosecution Evidence Is Uncontradicted as Amounting to Improper Reference to Accused\u2019s Failure to Testify, </em>14 A.L.R.3d 723, 746 (1967); <em>cf, </em>Annotation, <em>Modem Status: Instruction Allowing Presumption of Inference of Quilt from Possession of Recently Stolen Property as Violation of Defendant\u2019s Privilege Against Self-Incrimination, </em>88 A.L.R.3d 1178 (1978). In this case, however, the prosecutor went beyond the permissible comment on the absence of the evidence, and impermissibly commented directly on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">On the basis of the foregoing, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were impermissible. Our inquiry, however, is not at an end. We must address whether the error was harmless. While not every impermissible comment by the prosecutor constitutes reversible error, the State bears the burden of proving that an error is harmless. The State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the contested error did not contribute to the verdict. <em>See Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Petitioner maintains that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s comments. He also argues that, by overruling defense counsel\u2019s objection before the jury and advising the jury that the comment was permissible, the court gave its imprimatur to the prosecutor\u2019s insinuation that the jury should penalize Smith for not testifying. <em>See Good v. State, </em>723 S.W.2d 734, 738 (Tex.Cr.App.1986) (stating that that a trial court, by overruling an objection to an improper argument, puts \u201cthe stamp of judicial approval\u201d on the improper comments, thus magnifying the possibility for harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>In addition to effectively giving his imprimatur to the State\u2019s comment on the defendant\u2019s silence, the judge suggested that Smith had some obligation to explain his actions to the police. This Court explicitly has rejected the notion that one\u2019s failure to explain events to the police may be construed as evidence of guilt. <em>See Grier v. State, </em>351 Md. 241, 253, 718 A.2d 211, 217 (1998). Furthermore, this comment by the trial judge refers to evidence not in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The State\u2019s argument impermissibly commented on appellant\u2019s failure to testify. We cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt the improper comment did not contribute to the guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

The complete analysis by the Court was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">\"We also agree with Judge Levitz that Oken's counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to the comments Oken claims infringed on his right to remain silent.

To be sure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>comments on a defendant's failure to testify violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See Griffin v.

Reading the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument in context, however, we do not believe the statements were comments on Petitioner\u2019s right to remain silent. <em>See King v.

Read in context, <em>Oken </em>stands for the proposition that, under <em>any </em>test, Oken\u2019s right to remain silent was not violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b516-5\">. The concurring opinion urges this Court to abandon the <em>Smith </em>test and to adopt the test adopted in the federal courts and many state jurisdictions, sometimes referred to as the <em>Morrison-Knowles </em>test. The test proposed by the concurring opinion is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">\"the standard, unanimously adopted in all federal circuits, for ascertaining when a prosecutor\u2019s argument constitutes improper comment on a defendant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent is whether the language used manifestly intended to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify, or whether the language was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be such a comment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Cone, op at 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The concurring opinion's proposed test has several problems. First, whether the prosecutor <em>intended </em>the argument to be a comment on the defendant's exercise of his or her constitutional right has no bearing on the ultimate question: whether the jury would take the remark to be comment on the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege. The purpose of the no-comment rule is to protect against prosecutorial comment on the privilege, not to punish the prosecutor. Therefore, the crucial question is not the prosecutor\u2019s intent, but whether the jury would view the remark as a comment on the privilege. In rejecting the test that addresses the subjective intent of the prosecutor, the Illinois Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">\u201cIt seems quite irrelevant for the purpose of the no-comment rule\u2014 protecting unfettered exercise of the right to remain silent \u2014 whether or not a prosecutor actually intended to produce an inference of guilt. It is the effect of a remark, not the intent of its speaker, that frustrates a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to remain silent at trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-10\"><em>Moore v. Indiana, </em>669 N.E.2d 733, 738 (Ind.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">Second, this test, which excludes those comments that the jury <em>naturally and necessarily </em>takes to be comments on the accused\u2019s failure to testify, is, beyond cavil, less protective of the accused\u2019s constitutional rights than the <em>Smith </em>test, which requires that the comment be susceptible of such interpretation. The concurring opinion complains that the Court has not specified whether the majority test is \"a \u2018fairly susceptible' or \u2018reasonably susceptible' test.\u201d Cone. op. at 370. It is folly to suggest that the Court would adopt a test embracing an \"unreasonable\u201d inference by the jury. Obviously, only those statements that are reasonably or fairly susceptible of the inference by the jury are contemplated by the <em>Smith </em>test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b519-10\">.

In fact, this Court recently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>employed standards strikingly similar to the test articulated in nearly all other jurisdictions. In <em>Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 681 A.2d 30 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1079, 117 S.Ct. 742, 136 L.Ed.2d 681 (1997), our Court was tasked with determining the viability of a defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a primary source of which was his counsel\u2019s failure to object to an allegedly improper comment by the prosecutor in summation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In considering whether a prosecutor\u2019s comments infringed on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, Judge Raker, writing for this Court, stated, \u201c[rjeading the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument in context, however, we do not believe the statements were comments on Petitioner\u2019s right to remain silent ..: [n]or do we find that the jury would naturally interpret the State\u2019s argument as a comment on Petitioner\u2019s failure to testify,\u201d which is essentially the same analysis used in all federal and nearly every state court. <em>Id. </em>at 295, 681 A.2d at 49 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Despite this Court\u2019s recent application of the nearly universal test in <em>Oken, </em>the majority prefers to resurrect a 1936 case, <em>Smith v. State, </em>169 Md. 474, 182 A. 287 (1936), as the authoritative case in self-incrimination jurisprudence; unfortunately, such reliance lacks substantiation by subsequent case law in this Court. In the sixty-five years of its existence, <em>Smith </em>has been cited infrequently: rarely, in relation to self-incrimination issues as a whole, and never, until today, as the authoritative case or standard by which all self-incrimination questions should be measured. In <em>Woodson v. State, </em>325 Md. 251, 265, 600 A.2d 420, 426 (1992), <em>Booth v. State, </em>306 Md. 172, 227, 507 A.2d 1098, 1126 (1986)(Eldridge, J., dissenting), <em>cert. granted, in part, </em>479 U.S. 882, 107 S.Ct. 269, 93 L.Ed.2d 246 (1986), <em>and vacated, in part, </em>482 U.S. 496, 107 S.Ct. 2529, 96 L.Ed.2d 440 (1987), and <em>Littreal v. Redwine, </em>252 Md. 662, 666, 250 A.2d 894, 896 (1969), this Court <em>only </em>cited <em>Smith </em>to support the assertion that prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>holding in <em>Griffin v. California </em>that the constitutional right against compelled self-incrimination forbids prosecutorial comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify, our State had prohibited such practice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Not only has our Court declined to employ the <em>Smith </em>\u201ctest,\u201d but the Court of Special Appeals, which reviews a far greater number of claims by defendants that their constitutional right to remain silent has been infringed, has only employed <em>Smith </em>once, <em>see Grace v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 520, 522, 252 A.2d 297, 298 (1969), and ostensibly, practitioners have not utilized the <em>Smith </em>\u201ctest\u201d either, as may be evident from the fact that neither of the parties in the present case proffer the \u201ctest\u201d from <em>Smith </em>as the standard by which courts should measure a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">While our State can certainly take pride in its longstanding tradition of protecting a defendant\u2019s constitutional right against self-incrimination, I do not believe that this Court should now claim that our decision sixty-five years ago also provided a test by which courts have in the past, can in the present, and should in the future, determine whether a defendant\u2019s constitutional right was infringed. I find the fact that this Court neglected to apply <em>Smith </em>when determining whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments infringed on the defendant\u2019s constitutional right against self-incrimination in <em>Oken v. State </em>to be a valuable insight into the proper weight that should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>afforded the <em>Smith </em>opinion, particularly when <em>Oken </em>was one of the few times this Court had been asked to consider the propriety of a prosecutor\u2019s comments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If <em>Smith </em>had truly been the pinnacle of self-incrimination jurisprudence, then <em>Smith </em>should have been the standard by which the prosecutor\u2019s comments were measured in <em>Oken; </em>instead this Court in <em>Oken </em>chose to measure the prosecutor\u2019s comments by a standard nearly identical to that adopted in almost every jurisdiction in this country. It seems peculiar that the <em>Smith </em>\u201ctest\u201d would not have unmasked itself until today.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Again, while it is true that this Court has resolutely and consistently forbidden comment upon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify in a state criminal trial, <em>see Veney, </em>251 Md. at 179, 246 A.2d at 620 (stating, \u201c[i]t is clear that in Maryland comment upon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify in a state criminal trial was forbidden long prior to <em>Griffin v. California </em>... \u201d) (internal citations omitted); <em>Woodson, 325 </em>Md. at 265, 600 A.2d at 426-427 (demonstrating that both the cases prior to and subsequent to <em>Griffin </em>in this State prohibited comments by prosecutors on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify); <em>Oken, </em>343 Md. at 295, 681 A.2d at 49 (stating, \u201c[t]o be sure, comments on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify violate the defendant\u2019s constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>tional rights\u201d), this Court has not <em>explicitly </em>outlined a test by which comments may be measured to determine whether a constitutional violation has occurred. Our historical protections of a defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination are noble indeed, yet I believe that these rights would be better safeguarded if prosecutors and trial courts were guided by a \u201cbright line\u201d standard articulated by this Court. A defendant\u2019s constitutional rights are often best protected when prosecutors are provided an inexorable framework under which they must operate. If left with no framework, or if left to operate under the guise of a framework that, in reality, is so fallible as to render the framework ineffectual, a court\u2019s protection of constitutional rights is left to a reactionary stance summarized by case after case of harmless error analysis. If we were to allow the government to freely comment on a defendant\u2019s silence \u2014 in the absence of a definitive framework \u2014 by resorting to \u201che\u2019s clearly guilty anyway,\u201d our protection of this constitutional right would amount to little more than a technicality, and the right itself would become little more than a \u201ccatch 22\u201d \u2014 the defendant would be damned if he does testify and damned if he does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">It is particularly noteworthy that the \u201ctest\u201d which this Court employs today is neither the \u201cfairly susceptible\u201d test, nor the \u201creasonably susceptible\u201d test,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but rather, simply the \u201csusceptible\u201d test. A \u201ctest\u201d that encompasses everything \u201csusceptible\u201d is not, in my experience, the type of standard under which prosecutors and courts can effectively operate. Relegating self-incrimination jurisprudence to countless exercises of harmless error analysis is not an effective way to protect the rights of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The constitutional right against self-incrimination is a perennial guarantee assiduously guarded by the courts against violation. As articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>\u201cIt may be that it is the obnoxious thing in its mildest and least repulsive form; but illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way, namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure. This can only be obviated by adhering to the rule that constitutional provisions for the security of person and property should be liberally construed. A close and literal construction deprives them of half their efficacy, and leads to gradual depreciation of the right, as if it consisted more in sound than in substance. <em>It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon. </em>Their motto should be <em>obsta principiis. </em>We have no doubt that the legislative body is actuated by the same motives; but the vast accumulation of public business brought before it sometimes prevents it, on a first presentation, from noticing objections which become developed by time and the practical application of the objectionable law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 635, 6 S.Ct. at 535, 29 L.Ed at 752 (emphasis added). A prosecutor\u2019s comments on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify are precisely the \u201cstealthy encroachments\u201d against which this Court is obligated to guard. In light of our legislature\u2019s explicit statutory guarantee to be free from adverse inferences, this Court\u2019s protection of a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent should be particularly vigorous. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.) \u00a7 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. I believe that the standard recently employed in <em>Oleen </em>incorporates our consistent and steadfast protection of a defendant\u2019s rights and gives prosecutors a consistent \u201cbright line\u201d standard under which to operate. The facts of this case provided our Court with the opportunity to <em>explicitly </em>adopt the standard which we employed in <em>Oken, </em>and which other jurisdictions around the country have utilized, successfully, for decades. Because I believe this Court should have seized upon this opportunity, I concur in judgment only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-6\">. A minority of states have adopted something akin to a \"fairly susceptible\u201d test, finding a violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege when a prosecutor makes a statement that is subject to reasonable interpretation by a jury as an invitation to draw an adverse inference from a defendant\u2019s silence. <em>See Moore v. State, 669 </em>N.E.2d 733, 739 (Ind. 1996). Interestingly, when applying the \"fairly susceptible\" test, some of those states have used the second prong of the nearly universal test to articulate the standard by which to determine a constitutional violation. <em>See e.g. Rodriguez v. State, </em>753 So.2d 29, 37 (Fla.2000) <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 859, 121 S.Ct. 145, 148 L.Ed.2d 96 (2000) (quoting <em>Marshall v. State, </em>473 So.2d 688, 689 (Fla. 4th DCA 1984) (stating that \"[a] constitutional violation occurs ... if either the defendant alone has the information to contradict the government evidence referred to or the jury \u2018naturally and necessarily\u2019 would interpret the summation as a comment on the failure to testify\u201d)(internal quotations omitted)); <em>Commonwealth v. Grant, </em>418 Mass. 76, 634 N.E.2d 565, 570 (1994) (finding that because the prosecutor\u2019s rhetorical questions were not \"of such a nature that a jury would naturally and necessarily construe them to be directed to the failure of the defendant to testify,\u201d there was no error). That the few courts which have deviated from the majority test have subsequently employed the standard used by most state and federal jurisdictions is an indication of the more workable nature of the majority test.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The minority states\u2019 basis for rejecting the majority test, as articulated by Indiana\u2019s Supreme Court in <em>Moore v. State, supra, </em>and by this Court in the case <em>sub judice, see </em>maj. op. at note 6, appears to be rooted in fears which, upon closer review, are unwarranted. The Indiana court claimed that \"[tjhere may be an understandable impulse to deem intentional comments improper and inadvertent ones valid\u201d because the first prong considers whether the prosecutor manifestly intended the comment to be a reference to the defendant\u2019s silence. <em>Moore, 669 </em>N.E.2d at 738. I agree with the Indiana court that whether the prosecutor <em>actually </em>or subjectively intended to produce an inference of guilt is irrelevant. Contrary to the assertions by the Indiana court and our Court today, the nearly universal test does not suggest or require an inquiry into the prosecutor\u2019s <em>actual </em>intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Rather, the first prong requires a court to <em>objectively </em>consider whether the prosecutor <em>manifested </em>such intent; meaning, the prosecutor's comments, taken in the context of the argument, must <em>outwardly convey or clearly evince </em>the intent to reference the defendant's silence. To \u2018manifestly intend\u2019 such comment is to make a statement that is readily seen, perceived or understood to be a comment on the failure to testify; it is one that is obvious and direct. <em>See e.g. United States v. Wagner, </em>884 F.2d 1090, 1099 (8th Cir.1989) (finding the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the defendant to have clearly been \"inadvertent confusion of the names of the three Wagner brothers made in the midst of her recap of the testimony of the two brothers who did take the stand at trial, ... [t]he reference did not <em>manifest </em>an intent on the part of the prosecutor to call attention to Robert\u2019s failure to testify\u201d)(emphasis added); <em>United States v. Whitehead, </em>618 F.2d 523, 527 (4th Cir.1980) (stating that \u201c[e]ven assuming, as appellants contend, that both the questions and answers were carefully planned by the prosecutor, we believe that their manifest intent, as well as their likely impact on the jury, was confined to a comment on Dowdy\u2019s probable veracity while testifying under oath\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Furthermore, while the State of Florida boasts that the \"fairly susceptible\u201d test is a \"very liberal rule,\u201d <em>see Rodriguez, </em>753 So.2d at 37 (quoting <em>State v. DiGuilio, </em>491 So.2d 1129, 1135 (Fla.1986)), upon surveying its application, it does not appear to be significantly more prohibitive of prosecutorial comments than the test applied in the majority of jurisdictions. In fact, the Florida court admits that \u201cdespite our repeated admonitions to avoid any comment that is 'fairly susceptible\u2019 to interpretation as a comment on silence, [we have] attempted to draw a distinction between impermissible comments on silence and permissible comments on the evidence in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37. The court also acknowledged other \"narrow exceptions\u201d to the rule against prosecutorial comments, including where the defendant has asserted a defense of alibi, self-defense, or defense of others, or where the prosecutor\u2019s comment was an \u201cinvited response,\u201d a proper rebuttal to a defense attorney\u2019s statement. <em>Id. </em>at 38-39. That the minority test has been littered with exceptions and distinctions is arguably indicative of its unworkable nature. If the minority rule is more \u201cliberal\u201d at all, it is arguably not in the scope of its protections, but rather in the manipulation of its applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>I believe that a <em>clearly articulated and practicable standard </em>often provides more protection to a defendant than a standard which is malleable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-6\">. The prosecutor, in summation stated that, \"the defendant said some things through his attorney in opening ...\u201d and that \"[his attorney] really doesn't dispute these items.\u201d <em>Oken, supra, </em>at 293, 681 A.2d at 48.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b528-6\">. The few other occasions where <em>Smith </em>was cited in relation to self-incrimination issues included: <em>Veney v. State, </em>251 Md. 159, 180, 246 A.2d 608, 621 (1968) <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 948, 89 S.Ct. 1284, 22 L.Ed.2d 482 (1969), where the Court, noting that the factual scenario for <em>Veney </em>and <em>Smith </em>were similar, virtually block-quoted the entire <em>Smith </em>opinion, without emphasizing any particular portion or principle articulated in <em>Smith; </em>and <em>King v. State, </em>190 Md. 361, 374, 58 A.2d 663, 668 (1948), after this Court referred to the 1939 Maryland Code, Article 35, Section 4 which provided that the refusal of a defendant to testify must not create a presumption against him. Otherwise, <em>Smith </em>was only cited when referring to the portion of the decision discussing harmless error, <em>see e.g. Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 570, 276 A.2d 214, 224 (1971), <em>Hill v. State, </em>218 Md. 120, 127, 145 A.2d 445, 449 (1958) (Henderson, J., dissenting), <em>Lambert v. State, </em>197 Md. 22, 29, 78 A.2d 378, 381 (1951), or the effect of a curative instruction by the trial court. <em>See e.g. Barber v. State, </em>191 Md. 555, 566, 62 A.2d 616, 621 (1948); <em>Wilkerson v. State, </em>171 Md. 287, 290, 188 A. 813, 814 (1937).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b529-6\">. The majority attempts to side-step its failure to apply the now-presumed <em>Smith </em>\u201ctest\u201d in <em>Oken </em>by stating that \"the issue of the appropriate test was never raised\u201d in <em>Oken. </em>I do not dispute the majority\u2019s assessment of the issues before the Court in <em>Oken, </em>as it is clear that we were tasked with determining whether a defendant\u2019s counsel was ineffective because of his failure to object to an allegedly improper prosecutorial comment on the defendant's exercise of his right to remain silent. <em>See supra </em>note 2 and accompanying text. That the precise issue of \"which test is appropriate\u201d was not raised or addressed in <em>Oken </em>does not change the fact that the <em>Oken </em>Court <em>did not apply </em>the <em>Smith </em>\u201ctest\u201d when determining whether the prosecutors comment was improper. The Court's failure to employ the <em>Smith </em>\"test\u201d then reinforces the perception of its seemingly sudden unveiling of the <em>Smith </em>\u201ctest\u201d now.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">That notwithstanding, if the majority\u2019s reasoning were to stand, (i.e. <em>Oken </em>should somehow be less consequential because the \u201cissue of the appropriate test was never raised\u201d), then its reliance on <em>Smith </em>itself would be without merit, because the precise \"issue of the appropriate test\u201d was not before the Court in 1936 in <em>Smith </em>either.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b530-7\">.
