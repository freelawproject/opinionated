Code 3701-53-02(A) and (B)(2), and 3701-53-04(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Directive No. 6 of Instruction No. 009 issued by the Director of Health on March 16, 1983 states, in pertinent part, that \u201c [calibration solutions are to be stored in their original screw-top container, under refrigeration, while not in use.\u201d The controversy over whether or not this instruction was complied with turns on the question of whether the calibration solution is \u201cin use\u201d when it is in the simulator and not under refrigeration. Appellant contends that the solution is \u201cin use\u201d only when it is connected to the intoxilyzer breath hose during an actual calibration. Appellee maintains that the portion of the calibration solution which is maintained at breath temperature in the simulator is \u201cin use\u201d insofar as the general testing procedure is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">The purpose of Directive No. 6, as well as all the regulations and prescribed procedures for breath testing and calibration of breath testing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>equipment, is to ensure the most accurate test results possible. The procedure employed by the State Highway Patrol at the Clinton Township Police Station, that is, maintaining the calibration solution at breath temperature in a simulator, allows the intoxilyzer to be calibrated before and after each test, rather than once per week as is minimally required.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because cold solution must warm up from twenty to forty-five minutes before a calibration can be performed, such thorough testing would be impossible if the solution were refrigerated after each calibration according to appellant\u2019s interpretation of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Furthermore, as noted by the Court of Appeals for Franklin County herein, citing its own case, <em>State </em>v. <em>Korte </em>(Apr. 12, 1983), No. 82 AP-994, unreported, for authority, \u201ca failure to use fresh solutions [for intoxilyzer calibrations] may * * * [result in] low readings which would favor the defendant.\u201d Thus, appellant in this case is unable to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the state\u2019s calibration procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Therefore, based on both the purpose and actual results of the intoxilyzer calibration procedure, we conclude that a calibration solution is \u201cin use\u201d for the purpose of Directive No. 6 of Instruction No. 009 while it is being maintained at breath temperature in the simulator jar. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the court of appeals below.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b94-8\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown, Douglas and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-11\"> R.C. 3701.143 provides that, \u201c[t]he director of health shall determine, or cause to be determined, techniques or methods for chemically analyzing a person\u2019s * * * breath * * * in order to ascertain the amount of alcohol in a person\u2019s blood.\u201d The intoxilyzer has been approved as an instrument for testing a person\u2019s breath to measure the subject\u2019s blood alcohol concentration. Ohio Adm. Code 3701-53-02(B)(2). The Director of Health is further vested with the duty of issuing instructions for analyzing breath samples. Ohio Adm. Code 3701-53-02(A). To that end, Ohio Adm. Code 3701-53-04(A) provides that \u201c[b]reath testing instruments must be calibrated * * * using methods and techniques * * * recommended by the manufacturer of the calibration instrument or the director of health.\u201d The Director of Health has outlined such calibration methods and techniques in Instruction No. 009 issued on March 16, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b94-9\"> Ohio Adm.
