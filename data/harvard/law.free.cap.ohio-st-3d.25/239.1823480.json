An application for reconsideration so filed shall be heard by a staff hearing officer and his decision shall be final. <em>No application for subsequent percentage determinations on the same claim for injury or occupational disease shall be accepted for review by the district hearing officer unless supported by substantial evidence of new and changed circumstances developing since the time of the hearing on the original or last determination.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The principal contention advanced by appellant centers upon the medical report submitted by Dr. Arnold, a nonexamining physician, who, after analyzing Dr. Ljuboja\u2019s report, concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">\u201cNo increase in the amount of PPI [permanent partial impairment] is warranted by the findings presented by Dr. Ljuboja. In my opinion there is no worsening of the effects of the allowed conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Appellant is correct in his contention that the commission was not at liberty to consider Dr. Arnold\u2019s analysis as constituting <em>medical evidence </em>upon which to grant or deny benefits since, as a nonexamining physician, he did not expressly adopt the factual findings of one or more examining physicians as the basis for an opinion. See, <em>e.g., State, ex rel. Wallace, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St. 2d 55 [11 O.O.3d 216]; <em>State, ex rel. Anderson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 166 [16 O.O.3d 199]; <em>State, ex rel. Teece, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St. 2d 165 [22 O.O.3d 400]; <em>State, ex rel. Paragon, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St. 3d 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">This is not to say that the commission could not seek an analysis of the medical report from Dr. Arnold to serve as guidance for its determination. However, in order to constitute a medical report upon which the commission was entitled to rely, when granting or denying benefits, the report must have expressly adopted findings revealed by an examining physician\u2019s report. Thus, the only report in the file complying with the standards set forth in <em>Wallace, Teece </em>and <em>Anderson </em>was the report of Dr. Ljuboja.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">By the clear and unambiguous requirements of R.C. 4123.57(B), it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>incumbent upon a party seeking an increase in his percentage of permanent partial disability to present \u201csubstantial evidence of new and changed circumstances developing since the time of the hearing on the * * * last determination.\u201d In spite of this requirement, the medical report submitted by appellant was devoid of any reference whatsoever that the medical conditions described therein represented new or changed conditions which developed since the date of the commission\u2019s prior determination in May 1982. In essence, the report is a recapitulation of the history, findings and recommendation previously submitted by Dr. Neuman, which fails to characterize the conditions as having arisen subsequent to the commission\u2019s prior review of an increase in appellant\u2019s permanent partial disability benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">It has long been this court\u2019s view that since the writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, the burden is on the relator to demonstrate a clear legal right for the issuance of the writ. <em>State, ex rel. Pressley, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St. 2d 141 [40 O.O.2d 141]; <em>State, ex rel. Gerspacher, </em>v. <em>Coffinberry </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 32 [47 O.O. 31]. In the case at bar, the medical evidence relied upon by appellant failed to satisfy the requirements imposed pursuant to R.C. 4123.57(B) and, as such, we conclude the commission did not abuse its discretion in denying the application for an increase in benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals, denying the writ, is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b270-8\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locker, Holmes and C. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b270-9\">Douglas and Wright, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-10\"> We emphasize that the similarity between the medical reports of Drs. Neuman and Ljuboja did not, in and of itself, fatally flaw appellant\u2019s request for benefits. Thus, a claimant with a recognized injury may choose to seek an increase in permanent partial disability compensation as a result of his belief that his injury has worsened over a period of time. In the event the request for an increase in benefits is denied, the claimant is not prohibited by the provisions of R.C. 4123.57(B) from seeking similar compensation at a later date, provided, however, that the worsening condition developed <em>since </em>the commission\u2019s previous determination and that the application is supported by <em>substantial evidence </em>to that effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
