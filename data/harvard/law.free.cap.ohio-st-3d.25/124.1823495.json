Further, that action was a violation of DR 7-105. Such overt and non-professional action should not be countenanced within our profession, and should be punished within the meaning of our professional rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Therefore, this court accepts the recommendation of the board, and orders that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law in the state of Ohio for a period of one year. Further, the court orders that the cost of these proceedings be taxed to respondent for which a judgment is hereby rendered and execution may issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b155-11\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C.
