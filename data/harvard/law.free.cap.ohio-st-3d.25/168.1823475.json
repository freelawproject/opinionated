Such total indifference to the legal needs of one\u2019s clients perhaps would reasonably warrant the total removal of this individual from any future practice of law in Ohio; however, we shall accept the recommendation of the board for an indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">Therefore, it is hereby ordered that respondent, James T. Patnode, is indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio, and that he is further ordered to pay all of the costs of these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b197-13\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C.
