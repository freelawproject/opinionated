The executors of the estate of James F. White, Sr., who was the major stockholder in the two closely held corporations, contend that R.C. 5731.12(A) precludes the commissioner from listing proceeds derived from White\u2019s life insurance policies as assets of the corporations because this practice increases the value of White\u2019s gross estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">R.C. 5731.12(A), as effective at the time of White\u2019s death, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">\u201cThe value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property to the extent of the amount receivable by the decedent\u2019s estate as insurance under policies on the life of the decedent. The value of the gross estate shall not include any amount receivable as insurance under policies on the life of the decedent by beneficiaries other than the decedent\u2019s estate, whether paid directly to such beneficiaries or to a testamentary or inter vivos trust for their benefit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Appellants-executors first assert that R.C. 5731.12 is a taxing statute that must be strictly construed against the state, with \u201cany doubt [being] * * * resolved in favor of the citizen upon whom or the property upon which the burden is sought to be imposed.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Willoughby </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 338 [19 O.O.2d 270], paragraph one of the syllabus. The executors then argue that the second sentence of R.C. 5731.12(A) must be construed to prohibit any valuation of a decedent\u2019s gross estate that directly or indirectly includes an \u201camount receivable as insurance under policies on the life of the decedent <em>by beneficiaries other than the decedent\u2019s estate\u201d </em>(emphasis added), and that because the beneficiaries in this case were two closely held corporations (and not the decedent\u2019s estate), the commissioner improperly increased the value of White\u2019s estate by including White\u2019s life insurance proceeds in the assets of those corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The commissioner counters the executors\u2019 first argument by asserting that the second sentence of R.C. 5731.12(A) is an exclusion from taxation that must be strictly construed <em>against </em>the taxpayer with any doubt as to the meaning of the exclusion being resolved in favor of taxation. See, <em>e.g., Beckwith </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1977), 49 Ohio St. 2d 277, 279, [3 O.O.3d 411]; <em>Tax Comm. of Ohio </em>v. <em>Paxson </em>(1928), 118 Ohio St. 36, 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">We find the commissioner\u2019s characterization of the second sentence of R.C. 5731.12(A) to be persuasive. Although the first sentence of R.C. 5731.12(A) is a taxing provision that requires the <em>inclusion </em>of any \u201camount receivable by the decedent\u2019s estate as insurance under policies on the life of the decedent,\u201d the second sentence of division (A) <em>excludes </em>from taxation any \u201camount receivable as insurance * * * by beneficiaries other than the decedent\u2019s estate.\u201d The second sentence of division (A) therefore must be strictly construed. \u201c * * [T]axation is the rule and exemption is the exception. There is no presumption favorable to the exemption of property from taxation. An exemption [or exclusion] from taxation must be clearly and expressly stated in the statute * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beckwith </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>Kosydar, supra, </em>at 279, quoting <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 97, 99-100 [41 O.O. 176].</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Guided by the foregoing, we continue our analysis of the relevant statutes and note that the value of White\u2019s stock in the agency and the dealership must be included in the value of his gross estate. R.C. 5731.03. The valuation of the decedent\u2019s stock is based, in part, upon the corporate assets that were in existence immediately after the decedent\u2019s death \u2014 <em>i.e., </em>upon formation of the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In the instant case, the assets of the agency and the dealership, calculated as of the moment after White\u2019s death, included amounts receivable as insurance on the life of White. These assets, in combination with corporate liabilities and other factors, were calculated into the value of White\u2019s agency and dealership stock, which is a taxable portion of White\u2019s gross estate. The executors contend that R.C. 5731.12(A) prohibits the inclusion of White\u2019s life insurance proceeds in the valuation of his stock, even though the stock \u2014 not the insurance proceeds \u2014 is the taxable property directly included in the decedent\u2019s gross estate. The executors note that the agency and the dealership were \u201cbeneficiaries other than the decedent\u2019s estate,\u201d and they assert that the gross estate therefore should not include, even indirectly, the \u201camount receivable [by the corporations] as insurance * * * on the life of [White].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The commissioner challenges the executors\u2019 assertion by noting, in effect, that the only insurance proceeds that indirectly were included in the decedent\u2019s gross estate were those that benefited the estate; and, to the extent that White\u2019s life insurance proceeds directly increased^he value of his agency and dealership stock, such proceeds were \u201creceivable by the decedent\u2019s estate\u201d and not within the scope of the exclusory provision of R.C. 5731.12(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Based upon the foregoing conflicting interpretations of the applicable statute, it is apparent that considerable doubt exists as to the meaning of R.C. 5731.12(A). With this in mind, we note that \u201c* * * [a] claim of exemption from taxation * * * must rest upon language in regard to which there can be no doubt as to the meaning, and the exemption must be granted in terms too plain to be mistaken.\u201d <em>Tax Comm. of Ohio </em>v. <em>Paxson, supra, </em>at 41. This rule of construction, when combined with the legislature\u2019s expressed intent to \u201cinclude [in the gross estate] the value of all property to the extent of the amount receivable by the decedent\u2019s estate as insurance under policies on the life of the decedent,\u201d requires us to find in favor of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">A contrary result is not supported by the applicable rules of construction and would enable certain individuals to circumvent the legislative intent behind the taxing provision <em>{i.e., </em>the first sentence of R.C. 5731.12[A]) simply by procuring life insurance and listing a closely held corporation, in which they are the majority or sole stockholder, as the beneficiary thereof. We therefore hold that \u201cany amount receivable as in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>surance under policies on the life of [a] * * * decedent\u201d by a closely held corporation, in which the decedent was a stockholder, is properly listed as an asset of the corporation when the decedent\u2019s stock is valued for estate tax purposes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b387-8\">Celebrezze, C;J., Locher and C. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b387-9\">Holmes, Douglas and Wright, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-12\"> The dissent implies that today\u2019s decision ignores the purpose of \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies and imposes a burden on the taxpayer for Ohio estate tax purposes that was not imposed by the federal estate tax. The dissent does not openly take these positions, however, because they are not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">First, it should be noted that-the values of the agency and the dealership were significantly enhanced by the insurance proceeds that were receivable by the corporations upon White\u2019s death; and, in computing the value of dealership stock, the commissioner discounted the book value of the stock .by thirty-five percent in consideration of the loss of a key man. Thus, assuming that White\u2019s insurance policies in fact were designed as \u201ckey man\u201d policies, they clearly served their purpose. Second, the record is clear that the commissioner and the Internal Revenue Service used the <em>same formula </em>to compute the value of White\u2019s agency stock for Ohio and federal estate tax purposes, and the per share value of White\u2019s dealership stock was <em>identical </em>on the Ohio and federal estate tax returns. The valuation formula used by the commissioner thus placed no burdens on the taxpayer that were not also imposed by the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s formula. - .</p>\n<p id=\"Akd\">Based on the foregoing, it is apparent that today\u2019s decision neither discourages the use of \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance policies nor imposes wholly unexpected or unprecedented tax burdens upon the decedent\u2019s estate. ;</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b387-10\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"An3\">dissenting. Over two generations ago the life insurance industry devised a policy; commonly known as \u201ckey man\u201d insurance, to insure small businesses against the untimely death of one or more of the principals. This form of insurance coverage is generally used to protect a company from pecuniary loss resulting from the death of one of its principals or to provide funds to purchase the decedent\u2019s interest in the company from his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Many states such as Ohio have enacted a specific exemption from estate taxes for insurance proceeds. R.C. 5731.12(A) states in unequivocal terms that \u201c[t]he value of the gross estate shall not include any amount receivable as insurance under policies on .the life of the decedent by beneficiaries other than the decedent\u2019s estate * * *.\u201d The plain meaning of the language of the statute could not be more clear in its thrust. In this case, the proceeds were received by beneficiaries <em>other than </em>the decedent\u2019s estate, namely: an agency and an automobile dealership. The proceeds, therefore, are not taxable under R.G. 5731.12(A). Further, decedent did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>not purchase the policies of life insurance nor did he hold any indicia of ownership with respect to the policies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In my view, the plain and simple meaning of the words of this statute precludes the interpretation urged by the majority. The majority permits the Tax Commissioner to accomplish indirectly what the statute prohibits directly. The majority holds that the commissioner is not taxing the proceeds of the insurance policies, but rather the increased value of the shares of corporate stock owned by the decedent and included in his estate. The majority, through its expansive interpretation of R.C. 5731.12(A), sanctions a confiscatory version of the statute. I cannot endorse this attack on a taxpayer through a grossly erroneous interpretation of the Tax Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b388-7\">Holmes and Douglas, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\"> The proceeds from key man insurance are exempt from taxation by the federal government under the Internal Revenue Code. Section 2042, Title 26, U.S. Code. These proceeds are not taxable to the estate of the decedent absent substantial indicia of ownership by the decedent such as the retention of the right to change'ihe beneficiary of the policy, the ownership of the policy, or the ability to procure a loan against the policy's cash value. See, <em>e.g., First Natl. Bank of Midland </em>v. <em>United States </em>(C.A. 5, 1970), 423 F. 2d 1286.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
