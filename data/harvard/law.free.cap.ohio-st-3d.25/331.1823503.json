First, Robert D. Smith, Sr. contends that the juvenile court order that permanently terminated his parental rights with regard to his son, Robert Smith, Jr., was not supported by clear and convincing evidence. The juvenile court was required to determine (1) whether the welfare department had made a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d to implement a family reunification plan, R.C. 2151.414(A)(1); (2) whether the parent had \u201cacted in such a manner that the child is a child without adequate parental care, and will continue to act in the near future in such a manner that the child will continue to be a child without adequate parental care,\u201d R.C. 2151.414(A)(2); and (3) whether it was \u201cin the best interest of the child to permanently terminate parental rights,\u201d R.C. 2151.414(A)(3). Upon consideration of the answers to the foregoing questions and of the child\u2019s custodial history, the juvenile court was authorized to grant permanent custody of Robert Smith, Jr. to the welfare department if clear and convincing evidence supported a finding that Robert, Jr. was (at the time of the hearing) and would continue to be (in the near future) \u201ca child without adequate parental care.\u201d R.C. 2151.414(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">We believe that clear and convincing evidence does support the order terminating Robert Smith, Sr.\u2019s parental rights. The record reveals that, pursuant to the Cuyahoga County Welfare Department\u2019s family reunification plans, Robert, Sr. received a variety of services \u2014 including evaluation of, and counseling for, his alcoholism. These services continued up until Robert, Sr.\u2019s incarceration following his conviction of gross sexual imposition; and, even after Robert, Sr.\u2019s imprisonment, a county social worker contacted the prison\u2019s social worker in order to supply information regarding Robert, Sr.\u2019s background and need for continued support services.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">In spite of the services provided to Robert, Sr., he was unable to control his alcoholism; and, after his son and stepdaughters were removed from his home, he continued to physically abuse his wife, causing her to seek shelter in a home for battered women in February and June-July 1982. Robert, Sr.\u2019s son, Robert Smith, Jr., was removed from his parent\u2019s custody in 1981 at the age of eight months, and he apparently has lived with only one set of foster parents during the time that he has been in the custody of the welfare department. Robert, Jr.\u2019s prospects for adoption were described as \u201cexcellent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The foregoing evidence satisfies the requirement that \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d support a termination of parental rights. The record reveals that Robert, Sr. was an alcoholic, who could not control his abuse of alcohol. Robert, Sr. sexually abused his stepdaughters; and he physically abused his wife,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> even after his stepdaughters and son had been removed from Robert, Sr.\u2019s home as a result of his behavior. Robert, Sr.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>counselors did not believe that he would be able to control either his alcoholism or his abusive behavior in the near future. As such, Robert Smith, Jr. properly was adjudged \u201ca child without adequate parental care,\u201d and Robert Smith, Sr.\u2019s parental rights properly were terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The second appellant herein, Donna Smith, also contends that the order terminating her parental rights was not supported by clear and convincing evidence. We disagree with this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Like Robert Smith, Sr., Donna Smith received a variety of services as a result of the implementation of the welfare department\u2019s family reunification plans. The record reveals, however, that Donna was less than diligent in her utilization of the available services. In January 1983, Donna Smith terminated counseling sessions that had focused on her inability to protect her children from the abusive conduct of her husband. Later, Donna was referred to parenting classes; but, as noted by the juvenile court, she attended only eleven of the twenty classes, made little progress, and was found to have tremendous emotional needs that took precedence over her desire to provide parental care.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Donna Smith did regularly exercise her right to visit once monthly with her children, and she demonstrated love and affection towards them. The record is clear, however, that Donna was desirous of reuniting with Robert, Sr. upon his release from prison. Donna was diagnosed at a community mental health center as having \u201cadjustment disorder with anxiety and a personality problem with passive features,\u201d and a staff psychiatrist found her to have poor judgment and insight. These findings, in combination with the testimony of the social workers who dealt with Donna Smith, reveal that Donna was an extremely dependent person who was unable to place the safety and well-being of her children above her own emotional needs. Additionally, based upon Donna\u2019s reluctance to diligently pursue available services or to break her ties with Robert, Sr., Donna\u2019s counselors did not foresee any changes in her ability to care for her children in the near future.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Donna Smith argues that the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion that she had emotional problems was insufficient to support the termination of her parental rights, because R.C. 2151.414(A)(2)(b) requires the court to consider whether the parent has any emotional or mental \u201cdisorder.\u201d This argument lacks merit, however, because R.C. 2151.414(A)(2)(b) requires only <em>consideration </em>of whether an emotional or mental \u201cdisorder\u201d exists and, assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the evidence concerning Donna Smith\u2019s emotional state does not amount to a \u201cdisorder,\u201d R.C. 2151.414 does not preclude the juvenile court from basing its determination, in part, on Donna\u2019s admitted emotional \u201cproblems.\u201d In fact, R.C. 2151.414(A)(2) <em>directs </em>the court to consider \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining whether the child is, or will be, without adequate parental care.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Thus, the juvenile court properly considered a wide variety of factors in rendering its judgment; and the children\u2019s best interests were properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>given great weight in the final determination. Lisa and Tammy Schmidt\u2019s prospects for adoption were described as \u201cuncertain\u201d at the time of the hearing; and, unlike Rob\u00e9rt Smith, Jr., Lisa and Tammy had resided in several different foster homes prior to the juvenile court\u2019s decision in this case. In spite of the unsettled nature of Lisa and Tammy\u2019s care, however, the evidence clearly supports a finding that Lisa and Tammy\u2019s best interests (as well as those \u00f3f\u2018Robert, Jr.) were served by a permanent termination of Donna Smith\u2019s parental rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Donna Smith\u2019s children properly were determined to be \u201cwithout adequate parental care,\u201d and the Cuyahoga County Welfare Department\u2019s motion for permanent custody was properly granted based upon clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Appellant Donna Smith challenges the clear and convincing evidence standard that is set forth in R.C. 2151.414 by asserting that Section 1, Article I, of the Ohio Constitution requires application of a reasonable doubt standard in proceedings involving the termination of parental rights. Donna Smith contends that because parental rights are encompassed in the fundamental rights of \u201cenjoying and defending life and liberty\u201d and \u201cseeking and obtaining hapjiihess\u201d (as enunciated in Section 1, Article I, of the Constitution), the state should be required to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt bef\u00f3te parental rights are terminated. We decline to adopt this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">While parental rights \u00bfhay be encompassed in the fundamental rights enunciated in both the' Ohit\u00ed and United States Constitutions, the rights of children to be free from physical, sexual and other abuses also are encompassed therein. We believe that the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard set forth in R.C. 2151;414'strikes a proper balance between the fundamental rights of both parents .and children; and, for this reason, we do not believe that the Ohio Constitution mandates the application of a \u201creasonable doubt\u201d standard in proceedings involving the termination of parental rights. See <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 745, in which the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard was found to satisfy the due process requirements of the Unit\u00e9d States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The third appeal consolidated herein was brought by William and Goldie Smith (the \u201cSmiths\u201d), the paternal grandparents of Robert Smith, Jr. The Smiths contend that their motion to intervene in the permanent custody proceedings b\u00e9low was denied in violation of both their constitutional right <em>to </em>due process and their rights, as interested parties, under statute and procedural rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The Smiths first argue that they were denied due process of law when the trial court denied their motion to intervene in the custody proceedings below. The crux of the Smiths\u2019 argument is that they were deprived of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>their constitutional right of association (with their grandson, Robert, Jr.) without being given the opportunity to be heard. This argument is flawed in its basic premise, however, because the proceeding in question did not deprive the Smiths of a \u201cright\u201d to associate with their infant grandson. The Smiths\u2019 association with Robert, Jr. occurred only because Robert, Jr.\u2019s parents and, later, the Cuyahoga County Welfare Department (as Robert, Jr.\u2019s temporary custodian) had granted the Smiths the privilege of visiting with him. This visitation privilege cannot reasonably be construed as an absolute or constitutionally protected \u201cright\u201d of association.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The Smiths\u2019 second argument focuses on the joinder requirements for custody proceedings as set forth in R.C. 3109.28. This statute states, in relevant part, that a \u201cperson not a party to the custody proceeding [who] has physical custody of the child or [who] claims to have custody or visitation rights with respect to the child\u201d must be joined as a party to the proceeding. The Smiths contend that because they claimed to have custody or visitation rights with respect to Robert, Jr., it was error for the juvenile court to deny their motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We find that the juvenile court did not err in its application of R.C. 3109.28 when it rejected the Smiths\u2019 motion to intervene. There were no allegations or evidence set forth in the Smiths\u2019 motion to intervene that would reasonably indicate that the Smiths had a \u201cright\u201d to custody of, or visitation with, their grandson. While persons \u201cclaiming a right\u201d to custody or visitation must be joined as parties to custody proceedings, any such claim must be colorable. The record in this case reveals only that the Smiths had a \u201cdesire\u201d for custody or visitation. They never sought temporary or permanent custody of Robert, Jr., and their visitation with Robert, Jr. had occurred, with the consent of the welfare department, only during Donna Smith\u2019s once monthly visits with her children. In summation, the Smiths never obtained, through statute, court order, or other means, any <em>legal right </em>to custody or visitation with their grandson.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Likewise, the Smiths had no <em>legal interest </em>in the care and custody of their grandson, which would have allowed them to intervene as of right pursuant to Civ. R. 24(A). Although the Smiths contend that they claimed \u201can interest relating to the * * * transaction which [was] * * * the subject of the action and [were] * * * so situated that the disposition of the action [would] * * * impair or impede [their] * * * ability to protect that interest,\u201d Civ. R. 24(A)(2), the Smiths\u2019 \u201cclaimed interest\u201d was not legally protectable. Just as the Smiths\u2019 desire for custody or visitation cannot be construed as a legal right to custody or visitation, the Smiths\u2019 concern for their grandson\u2019s welfare cannot be construed as a legal interest that falls within the scope of Civ. R. 24(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The final issue properly before the court is whether the juvenile court abused its discretion in failing to grant the Smiths\u2019 motion to intervene. The Smiths assert that a liberal construction of R.C. Chapter 2151 and the Rules of Juvenile Procedure, as required by R.C. 2151.01 and Juv. R. 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>warranted their inclusion as parties to the permanent custody proceeding. Specifically, the Smiths point to R.C. 2151.01(C), which declares that one purpose of R.C. Chapter 2151 is to provide for the care of children <em>\u201cin a family environment, </em>separating the child from its parents only when necessary for his welfare or in the interests of public safety.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">We concur in the Smiths\u2019 assertion that both R.C. Chapter 2151 and the Juvenile Rules are to be liberally construed so as to protect the interests of all concerned parties. We do not believe, however, that the juvenile court abused its discretion in denying the Smiths\u2019 motion to intervene. As discussed above, the Smiths had no legal right to custody or visitation with their grandson, and they held no legally protectable interest that was related to Robert, Jr.\u2019s care and custody. Additionally, the emphasis placed on family unity by R.C. Chapter 2151 is limited almost exclusively to the nuclear family; and, unless a child is orphaned or abandoned, or an adult from the child\u2019s extended family in some manner has filled the role of parent, R.C. Chapter 2151 does not require that extended family members be made parties to custody proceedings. The record does not indicate that the Smiths ever stood <em>in loco parentis </em>to Robert, Jr. or that they ever exercised significant parental control over, or assumed any parental duties for the benefit of, their grandson. Based upon the foregoing and upon the nature of the custody proceeding, which was to determine <em>only </em>whether the parental rights of Robert Smith, Sr., Donna Smith, and John Schmidt should be terminated, the denial of the Smiths\u2019 motion to intervene was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed as to all the appellants herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b365-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b365-8\">Celebrezze, C.J., concurs, with opinion.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b365-9\">Douglas, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\"> Although the juvenile court did not make a finding on this point, some evidence in the record indicates that Robert Smith, Jr. also was physically abused while in his parent\u2019s custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\"> Donna Smith apparently placed her desire to reunite with Robert Smith, Sr. above her concern for the welfare of her children \u2014 especially that of Lisa and Tammy, whom Robert, Sr. had abused.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b365-10\">Celebrezze, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ABu\">concurring. I concur in the majority\u2019s determination to uphold the termination of the parental rights of Donna Smith, Robert Smith, Sr. and John Schmidt.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">I also agree that on the facts of this case, the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion of Robert Smith, Jr.\u2019s grandparents to intervene in the permanent custody proceeding. I write separately to emphasize that our decision today does not foreclose grandparent intervention in all such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The goal of R.C. Chapter 2151 and the Juvenile Rules is to \u201cprovide for the care, protection and mental and physical development\u201d of those/ children who find themselves under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. R.C. 2151.01(A); Juv. R. 1(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">State intervention in the parent-child relationship and the termination of that relationship is the final option. Although R.C. Chapter 2151 does not require that grandparents be made parties to permanent custody proceedings brought by the state against the parents, I firmly believe that it is contrary to common sense, compassion and the best interests of the child to deny suitable grandparents their last meaningful opportunity to gain custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Intervention by grandparents in a permanent custody proceeding is appropriate where the grandparents have a legal right to or a legally protective interest in custody or visitation with their grandchild, where the grandparents have stood <em>in loco parentis </em>to their grandchild, or where the grandparents have exercised significant parental control over, or assumed parental duties for the benefit of, their grandchild. Where any of these circumstances are present, it is my view that a denial of the grandparents\u2019 motion to intervene would constitute an abuse of the juvenile court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
