After a formal hearing the board found petitioner guilty of aiding and abetting an unlicensed person to practice dentistry unlawfully, and suspended his license for five years. Petitioner sought to test the legality of his trial and conviction upon a writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>of review issued in the superior court. After a hearing on said writ the judgment of the board was affirmed and the writ was dismissed. Petitioner now appeals from the judgment of the superior court. The salient facts are gathered from the return to the writ made in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\">Complaint being made to the board of dental examiners that one Finley, and others, were unlawfully practicing dentistry in the city of Oakland, A. Boyiarides, an investigator employed by the board and acting under the direction of its attorney, was sent to investigate the matter, and, if possible, to secure evidence of such unlawful practice. Boyiarides went to a dental office in the city of Oakland and found Dr. Jacobs, the petitioner, in charge. He submitted himself to the petitioner for the purpose of having a plate made. Dr. Jacobs made an examination of his mouth and told him that it would cost twenty-five or thirty dollars for the plate. The price of fifteen dollars was finally agreed upon, and Boyiarides paid Dr. Jacobs five dollars. Thereafter Boyiarides visited the dental office several times. On the first visit Finley made a plaster paris mould or cast of Boyiarides\u2019 mouth for the purpose of getting the measure for the plate. On the next day Finley took a \u201cwax bite\u201d of the mouth of Boyiarides by placing a piece of wax in his mouth and telling him to bite into it. On the third visit Finley put a wax plate set with teeth in Boyiarides\u2019 mouth for a \u201ctry-in,\u201d causing the patient to bite into the wax mould for a \u201ctry-in.\u201d On the fourth visit the finished plate was delivered by Finley to Boyiarides, who paid Finley ten dollars, taking his receipt for the money. On one of his visits to the office Boyiarides observed Finley taking a plaster cast of the mouth of another patient. On another occasion he saw Finley \u201cworking in another man\u2019s mouth.\u201d It was established by the testimony of a witness connected with the dental office that Finley was employed there for the purpose of taking impressions of plates.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The petitioner on this appeal attacks the action of the board of dental examiners upon the ground that its action was without due process of law and in excess of its jurisdiction. The contention, in brief, is that the Dental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Act (Stats. 1915, pp. 698, 706) does not confer power upon the board to revoke or suspend the license of a dentist for unprofessional conduct. He bases his contention upon the fact that section 14 of the act provides that proceedings to revoke or suspend any license, under the first subdivision of section 13, for the conviction of a felony or misdemeanor must be taken by the board on the receipt of a certified copy of the record of conviction, and that the proceeding under the second subdivision of section 13, based upon unskillful or negligent dental practice, may be taken upon the information of another, the statute being silent as to how the board may proceed on a proceeding to revoke or suspend a license of a dentist for unprofessional ' conduct, as provided in the third subdivision of section 13. Petitioner therefore contends that there is no provision by which the board may proceed to the trial of one charged with unprofessional conduct. There is nothing in this point. To apply such a construction to the statute would leave the board powerless to proceed in those eases which, no doubt, call for the largest intervention of its powers. Having conferred the power upon the board to revoke or suspend licenses for the three general causes specified, and having directed how the proceedings may be had under two of the provisions for revocation, it is not to be thought that the legislature intended to leave the board helpless to proceed against dentists accused of unprofessional conduct. The provision of section 14, relating to proceedings to revoke and suspend licenses, providing as to the first cause that such proceedings must be taken by the board on the receipt of a certified copy of the record of conviction, and that proceedings for the second cause may be taken upon the information of another, are followed by the general provision that \u201cAll accusations must be in writing, verified by some party familiar with the facts therein charged, and three copies thereof must be filed with the secretary of the board.\u201d The remainder of the section relates to the procedure to be followed by the board upon receiving such accusation. There can be no doubt that section 13 of the act confers full jurisdiction upon the board to revoke or suspend the license of a dentist for any of the causes specified in the section. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Neither can there be any doubt that section 14 was intended to, and does, provide for a complete procedure by which the board may hear and determine an accusation made under any one of the three subdivisions of the preceding section.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\">Another contention advanced by the appellant is that, conceding that the board of dental examiners had power to hear a complaint to revoke a license for unprofessional conduct, in the instant case the accusation filed against him is not one which the board has jurisdicton to hear, for the reason that the proceeding was not \u201ctaken upon the information of another.\u201d His argument in support of the point is that as Boyiarides was a paid investigator employed by the board, and acting under the direction of its attorney for the purpose of securing evidence upon which to base a charge against him, the accusation was in fact one made by the agent of the board, or, in other words, is but an accusation by the board itself, and results in the board sitting in judgment upon its own complaint. E'ven if the contention were worthy of serious consideration, the provision of section 14, relied upon, is permissive in the first instance and, in the next, relates only to proceedings upon an accusation, charging the dentist with grossly unskillful or negligent practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Appellant also contends that there was no showing that he \u2022 aided and abetted an unlicensed person to practice dentistry. The petitioner was the manager of the office where Einley was employed, made the first examination of Boyiarides \u2019 mouth, and entered into the contract for the work to be done. That work was done by Finley. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from this is that the petitioner assigned Finley to do the work. It appears without contradiction that Finley was not licensed to practice dentistry. Section 11 of the Dental Act provides that any person shall be understood to be practicing dentistry within the meaning of the act who shall \u201c ... (2) for a fee, salary or reward, paid directly or indirectly either to himself or to some other person, perform an operation of any kind upon, or treat diseases or lesions of the human teeth or jaws, or correct malimposed positions thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>It does not require the performance of a surgical operation to bring one within the purview of the law. The words \u201coperate\u201d and \u201coperation,\u201d technically used in connection with surgery, mean \u201cto perform some manual act upon the body of the patient, usually with instruments, with a view to restore soundness or health, or otherwise improve the physical condition,\u201d and \u201cthe act or series of acts and manipulations performed upon a patient\u2019s body, as in setting a bone, amputating a limb, extracting a tooth, etc.\u201d (Century Dictionary.) They have also a plain ordinary meaning, in the light of which this act may and, we think, should be construed. According to the authority just quoted \u201coperate\u201d means \u201cto perform or to be at work\u201d; \u201cto produce an effect; act; work,\u201d and \u201coperation\u201d means \u201caction,\u201d \u201cworking,\u201d \u201ca specific act or activity,\u201d and \u201cthe course of action or series of acts by which some result is accomplished.\u201d The same dictionary defines \u201can operator\u201d as \u201cone who operates in any way, or on or against anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The ultimate purpose of the Dental Act is to bring about and insure skill and proficiency in the practice of the profession in this state. When all of its provisions are read together, and construed in the light of the plain ordinary meaning of the words and terms just noted, little difficulty is experienced in arriving at an understanding of what the legislature intended by the enactment of section 11 of the act, defining what shall constitute \u201cpracticing dentistry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The particular purpose to be accomplished by that portion of the section germane to this appeal is manifestly to prevent the doing by unlicensed persons of those things about or upon the human teeth, or jaws, which require skill, adequate training and understanding in their performance. The section provides that one who performs <em>an operation of any hind </em>upon those portions of the human anatomy shall be understood to be practicing dentistry, but that nothing within the act shall prohibit \u201can unlicensed person from performing merely mechanical work upon inert matter in a dental laboratory.\u201d The legislature has very plainly indicated what work may be done by an unlicensed person in connection with the lawful practice of dentistry in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>state. The acts done by the appellant in the present case do not fall within the permission of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Lennon, J., Lawlor, J., Richards, J., <em>pro tern., </em>and Wilbur, acting C. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">All the Justices present concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Richards, J., <em>pro tem., </em>was acting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
