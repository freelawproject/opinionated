We further ORDER that trial court proceedings are stayed pending the completion of this appeal. On motion of a party or on its own motion, the Court of Appeals may modify, set aside, or place conditions on the stay if it appears that the appeal is not being vigorously prosecuted or if other appropriate grounds appear.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
