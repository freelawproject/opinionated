We confirm that the Grandparent Visitation Statute is\n   facially constitutional because there are circumstances under which the law can be constitutionally enforced. We determine that the Grandparent Visitation Statute is narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest because a grandparent must overcome the presumption in favor of a fit parent's visitation decision with clear and convincing evidence that the decision is not in the child's best interest. Lastly, we conclude that the Grandparent Visitation Statute is unconstitutional as applied because Kelsey did not overcome the presumption in favor of Lyons and Michels' visitation decision with clear and convincing evidence that their decision is not in A.A.L.'s best interest. The order of the circuit court is vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL POSTURE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 This case arises out of a dispute between the parents of A.A.L., Cacie Michels and Keaton Lyons, and Lyons' mother Jill Kelsey. Lyons and Michels were never married but lived together when A.A.L. was born in October 2009 until they broke up in late 2011. Since then, Michels has had primary custody of A.A.L. and\n   Lyons has had extended periods of placement. Prior to A.A.L. starting kindergarten in the fall of 2015, A.A.L. spent a significant amount of time with Kelsey, including overnight stays. After A.A.L. started kindergarten, Lyons and Michels agreed to reduce the amount of time A.A.L. spent with Kelsey in order to accommodate A.A.L.'s new commitments with school and friends, as well as her previously agreed upon placement time with Lyons on alternate weekends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 At the end of 2015, Kelsey's relationship with Lyons and Michels began to deteriorate due to a disagreement over a proposed vacation to Disney World\n   and Kelsey's decreased visitation time with A.A.L. Even though the relationship was deteriorating, Lyons and Michels still arranged for Kelsey to spend time with A.A.L. Shortly thereafter, Kelsey intervened in Michels' paternity action and filed a petition for additional visitation pursuant to the Grandparent Visitation Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 At the court trial, Lyons and Michels testified that they decided to decrease Kelsey's visitation time because of the strain on A.A.L.'s schedule. They also expressed concern over Kelsey's judgment, as she allowed A.A.L. to ride a horse without a safety helmet, contrary to their explicit instructions, and she gave four-year-old A.A.L. a sip of alcohol. Both Lyons and Michels testified that granting Kelsey's petition is not in A.A.L.'s best interest. However, both Lyons and Michels also testified that they would not completely eliminate Kelsey's visitation with A.A.L. unless they felt that visitation was unhealthy for A.A.L. or not in her best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Lyons and Michels also testified at the court trial about a gentleman's agreement that the parties had in place after September 2016. Kelsey was allowed to see A.A.L. every other weekend for five hours, which occurred during the weekends when Lyons had his placement time with A.A.L. Lyons and Michels expressed their frustration with A.A.L. splitting time between three households, as it was difficult and exhausting for her. Lyons also testified about his frustration with the schedule because it was not beneficial for his relationship with A.A.L. Both Lyons and Michels indicated that they preferred an informal schedule they could set themselves to accommodate all of A.A.L.'s commitments and let them \"make decisions for [their child] as parents do.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Despite finding that Lyons and Michels were not only fit parents but \"good parents,\" the circuit court granted Kelsey's petition. The circuit court ordered visitation at least one Sunday each month for five hours and granted Kelsey \"a seven-day period during [A.A.L.'s] summer vacation whereby she may take [A.A.L.] to Disney World or other vacation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Lyons and Michels moved for reconsideration of the circuit court's order, asserting that the order violated their due process rights. The circuit court denied the motion and decided that pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Roger D.H. v.

Prior to granting a petition for grandparent visitation, a majority of state statutes require a triggering event dissolving the family unit, such as the death or abandonment of a parent, divorce, or the child residing with a third party prior to granting a petition for grandparent visitation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ala.

Like the Grandparent Visitation Statute, some states include a child born out of wedlock as a triggering event to a petition for grandparent\n   visitation.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ala. Code 1975 \u00a7 30-3-4.2 (Alabama); A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409 (Arizona); IC 31-17-5-1 (Indiana); M.G.L.A. 119 \u00a7 39D (Massachusetts); 43 Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 109.4 (Oklahoma).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b630 In addition to the statutory precursor of a dissolving family unit, the majority of jurisdictions also require a grandparent to demonstrate that absent visitation, the child will suffer some form of emotional harm.

The circuit court also stated that it did not \"think it was fair to [A.A.L.] then or now to just cut off cold turkey her contact with grandma.\" The circuit court concluded that the \"bare bones\" schedule it set forth was therefore in A.A.L.'s best interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b641 The Grandparent Visitation Statute is unconstitutional as applied because Kelsey did not overcome the presumption in favor of Lyons and Michels' visitation decision with clear and convincing evidence that their decision is not in A.A.L.'s best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Although the circuit court asserted that it applied a presumption that Lyons and Michels' decision was in A.A.L.'s best interest, the decision of the circuit court exemplifies a circuit court improperly substituting its judgment for that of fit parents. Lyons and Michels did not seek to eliminate Kelsey's visitation entirely and there is no indication that they would deprive A.A.L. of having a relationship with Kelsey. In fact, they testified that they would not eliminate Kelsey's visitation with A.A.L. unless they felt that it was unhealthy for A.A.L. or not in her best interest. At the time Kelsey petitioned for visitation there had been no change in circumstances involving A.A.L.'s family unit, as Lyons and Michels had not lived together since A.A.L. was a small child. Kelsey's desire to merely secure a more generous and predictable visitation schedule is not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of Lyons and Michels' visitation decision and demonstrate that their decision is not in A.A.L.'s best interest, thus barring intervention by the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rogers v.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b642 In sum, a fit parent has a fundamental liberty interest in the care and upbringing of his or her child and therefore to be applied constitutionally, the Grandparent Visitation Decision must withstand strict scrutiny.

We conclude that the Grandparent Visitation Statute is narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest because it requires a grandparent to overcome the presumption in favor of a fit parent's visitation decision with clear and convincing evidence that the decision is not in the child's best interest. Lastly, we conclude that the Grandparent Visitation Statute is unconstitutional as applied because Kelsey did not overcome the presumption in favor of Lyons and Michels' visitation decision with clear and convincing evidence that their decision is not in A.A.L.'s best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b643 Based upon the record below, we decline to remand the case to the circuit court.

However, \u00a7 767.43(3) contains no requirement that a child's health or welfare be in jeopardy before authorizing the circuit court to grant visitation rights.

Wisconsin already has expansive statutory provisions set forth in Chapter 48 governing the State's intervention in family matters to protect children from harm that has been or may be inflicted upon them as a result of their parents' incapacities or unfitness. Regardless, nothing in the text of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20767.43\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 767.43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) suggests its purpose is to protect children from harm. When two fit parents agree on the manner in which they raise their child, the child must be in danger in order for the State to inject itself into the private realm of a family. A statute permitting such governmental intrusion based solely on the best interests\n   of a child without being tethered to any compelling interest is constitutionally infirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b655 The majority endeavors to \"save\" the grandparent visitation statute from facial invalidation by concluding that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20767.43\">\n    Wis.

The majority attempts to reconcile this inconsistency by deciding that \"[t]he Grandparent Visitation Statute is unconstitutional as applied because Kelsey did not overcome the presumption in favor of Lyons and Michels' visitation decision with clear and convincing evidence that their decision is not in\n   A.A.L.'s best interest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority does not explain how the constitutionality of a statute could possibly be dependent upon the strength of a party's presentation of evidence. Merely maintaining that\n   under certain circumstances the State may have a compelling interest in interfering with the fundamental right at stake in this case, when the State expresses no compelling interest within the text of the statute itself, cannot \"save\" a statute subject to strict scrutiny, under any circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b656 The majority goes on to caution a circuit court against \"improperly substituting its judgment for that of fit parents,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   but then allows a petitioning \"grandparent to overcome the presumption in favor of a fit parent's visitation decision with clear and convincing evidence that the decision is not in the child's best interest,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   apparently preserving the ability of courts to substitute their judgment for the judgment of fit parents so long as the petitioning grandparents surmount the heightened evidentiary hurdle imposed by the majority here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b657 Even if a compelling state interest could be identified, Wisconsin's grandparent visitation statute is not narrowly tailored.

In comparison, other jurisdictions narrowly tailor their statutes to apply only when a grandparent has functionally served as the child's parent for a lengthy period of time so that severing that relationship would cause significant harm to the child's health or well-being.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Conn.

Then the circuit court must merely find that a petitioning grandparent has overcome the\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   presumption by clear and convincing evidence, which affords the circuit court the discretion to overrule the decisions of fit parents and instead impose on the family the circuit court's view of the best interests of the child. Surely the fundamental liberty interest of parents in being free from State interference in the care, custody, and upbringing of their families-\"perhaps the oldest of the fundamental\n   liberty interests recognized by\" the United States Supreme Court-deserves much more protection than this.\n   \u00b659 Of course, grandparents can play significant and beneficial roles in the lives of their grandchildren.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   But \"as the constitutional body vested with the power to say 'what the law is,' the judiciary evaluates a statute for its fidelity to the constitution, and 'an act of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution, is void.'\n   <em>\n    Marbury[ v.
