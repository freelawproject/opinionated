He also appeals an order denying his motion for postconviction relief. As to both, Branson argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because counsel failed to object to testimony that improperly bolstered the testimony of a prosecution witness in violation of\n   <em>\n    State v. Haseltine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674927\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/120/92/\">\n    120 Wis. 2d 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8674927\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/120/92/\">\n    352 N.W.2d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ct. App. 1984). We agree with the circuit court's view that the challenged testimony here is not the sort of opinion-for-truthfulness testimony prohibited by\n   <em>\n    Haseltine\n   </em>\n   and its progeny. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b62 While driving, Branson was pulled over for a seat belt violation and because one of the vehicle's tires was flat. A man named Chad Queen was in the front passenger seat. During the stop, an officer's attention was drawn to Queen because he appeared to be trying to \"shove something ... between the center console and his left thigh.\" After Queen got out of the car, the officer located a large plastic bag with smaller plastic bags inside. A subsequent testing showed that the bags contained methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b63 Branson and Queen were later interviewed at the police station. The dispute on appeal relates to an officer's trial testimony regarding a comparison of the behaviors of Branson and Queen while they answered the officer's questions. The officer's testimony indicated that, during their police interview, each man effectively asserted that the drugs belonged to the other. At trial, Queen testified that the drugs belonged to Branson. Branson did not testify. The details of the officer's testimony regarding Branson's and Queen's behavior during their interviews will be discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b64 The jury found Branson guilty of possession of the methamphetamine. In a postconviction motion and on appeal, Branson argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because counsel failed to object to the officer's testimony comparing the behavior of Queen and Branson during the police interviews with the men. The circuit court rejected the argument. Branson appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b65 Branson asserts ineffective assistance of trial counsel.

In\n    <em>\n     Echols\n    </em>\n    , a witness who was familiar with the defendant testified that Echols \"always stutters when he lies.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4037130\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/348/81/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , \u00b626.

Queen testified that when he and Branson were stopped by police, Branson pulled a \"bag of drugs\" from his \"pants area,\" tried to give it to Queen, and ended up dropping it between Queen's seat and the center console. Queen responded by \"knock[ing] that bag towards the backseat.\" Later, both men were interviewed at the police station. At trial, the questioning officer described Queen as cooperative and indicated that Queen answered questions consistent with his trial testimony. In contrast, the officer told the jury that Branson failed to make eye contact and appeared nervous. During the interview, Branson effectively implicated Queen by telling the officer that Branson did not know anything about methamphetamine being in his car.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    \u00b611 Branson's argument focuses on the part of the officer's trial testimony in which the officer contrasts the behavior of the two men during their interviews. Branson argues that his counsel deficiently failed to object to the following testimony. The officer testified that Queen:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n    \u2022 \"[was] very talkative\";\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n    \u2022 \"would look me in the eye\";\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n    \u2022 \"was calm, he looked me in the eye\";\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    \u2022 \"seemed more than happy to help clear this thing up\";\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n    \u2022 was \"cooperative.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    As to Branson, the officer testified:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n    \u2022 \"I noticed that [Branson] wouldn't look me in the eye\";\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    \u2022 \"I'd ask him a question and either he would not answer it[,] or give some sort of vague answer\";\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    \u2022 \"[Branson] appeared nervous, he wasn't looking me in the eye, he seemed fidgety\";\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    \u2022 \"[Branson] didn't answer questions completely; very vague about them.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Notably, the officer did not give an opinion about the relative truthfulness of the two men. During closing arguments, the prosecutor and Branson's counsel argued contrary interpretations of this behavior evidence and other behavior evidence admitted during the trial. The prosecutor argued that Queen's behavior during the interview indicated that Queen was calm and helpful because he was innocent, and that Branson's behavior indicated the opposite. Branson's counsel argued the flip side. He argued that Queen was one of \"those people [who] can turn onto a role when they need [to] ... really can turn on the salesman.\" He also drew the jury's attention to how Queen's behavior changed from the time of the police interview to the time of his trial testimony, where, according to counsel, Queen acted \"very defensive.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    \u00b612 We conclude that the challenged testimony does not violate the\n    <em>\n     Haseltine\n    </em>\n    rule. Describing the behavior of another person when that person is communicating in some manner does not effectively attest to that person's truthfulness within the meaning of\n    <em>\n     Haseltine\n    </em>\n    and subsequent cases such as\n    <em>\n     Echols\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Miller\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    \u00b613 To the contrary, the officer's testimony here was completely unremarkable. As is true in countless cases, the witness here related what another person said and described how that person acted when making the statement. In such cases, it is up to the jury to decide how to interpret the described behavior and whether to give weight to the description.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    \u00b614 Moreover, in a prior decision, we affirmed the admissibility of testimony that was easily more problematic than the testimony against Branson. In\n    <em>\n     State v. Davis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11920245\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/199/513/\">\n     199 Wis. 2d 513\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11920245\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/199/513/\">\n     545 N.W.2d 244\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Ct. App. 1996), a police officer testified that two witnesses, who testified against the defendant, prior to trial \"[g]ave very good statements,\" and that they were \"excellent witnesses.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11920245\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/199/513/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11920245\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/199/513/\">\n     at 519\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . We concluded that this testimony \"did not unfairly taint the fact-finding process.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11920245\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/199/513/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11920245\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/199/513/\">\n     at 521\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . We think it obvious that the challenged testimony in\n    <em>\n     Davis\n    </em>\n    was less neutral than the testimony here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    \u00b615 It follows that Branson's trial counsel did not perform deficiently when counsel did not object to the testimony set forth above.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    \u00b616 Before concluding, we choose to comment on a Seventh Circuit case on which Branson, understandably, places heavy reliance. In\n    <em>\n     United States v. Williams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22308\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/1048/\">\n     133 F.3d 1048\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (7th Cir. 1998), the court discussed testimony that is directly comparable to the challenged testimony in this case. In\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    , a federal agent questioned the defendant about a bank robbery.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22308\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/1048/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22308\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/1048/\">\n     at 1050\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . While testifying about the questioning, the agent said that the defendant, in response to being told that he had been identified by a teller as the robber, \" 'turned and began avoiding eye contact with us, kind of lowered his head, and he thought about it for a moment and then said that he didn't rob a bank.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22308\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/1048/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22308\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/1048/\">\n     at 1052\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The agent went on to relate his strategy in questioning the defendant, what he said to the defendant, and described the defendant's reaction to that: \" 'And while I'm making these statements he was-had his head held down and he was nodding as if in agreement with these statements.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22308\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/1048/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22308\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/1048/\">\n     at 1052-53\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    \u00b617 Based on this testimony, and without citing to any authority, the Seventh Circuit opined:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    The admission of this testimony also presents some concerns.... Williams denied that he participated in the robbery, yet Special Agent Johnson purports to be a human lie detector in observing Williams' demeanor. These observations are improper characterizations of the defendant and useless in the determination of innocence or guilt, and in fact, they tend to prejudice the jury. It is Williams' denial of guilt that is important and not the manner in which he communicates it.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22308\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/1048/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22308\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/1048/\">\n     at 1053\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . We are unable to reconcile the\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    court's discussion with the testimony of the agent in that case. The agent did not give his opinion of the suspect's truthfulness; rather, he described the suspect's reaction. Obviously, the prosecutor, and likely the agent, thought it would be sensible for the jury to draw the inference that the suspect's reactions indicated a guilty mind, but in no way did the agent \"purport[ ] to be a human lie detector.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22308\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/1048/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    \u00b618 We acknowledge that we cited\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    as supporting authority in our\n    <em>\n     Echols\n    </em>\n    decision and, in particular, pointed to the above discussion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Echols\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4037130\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/348/81/\">\n     348 Wis. 2d 81\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b624.
