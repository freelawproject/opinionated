The trial court erred in citing MCR 2.612(C)(2) as a reason for denying defendant's motion because \"[u]nless otherwise specified by\n   these rules, a judgment of conviction and sentence entered by the circuit court not subject to appellate review under subchapters 7.200 or 7.300 may be reviewed only in accordance with the provisions of\" subchapter 6.500.
