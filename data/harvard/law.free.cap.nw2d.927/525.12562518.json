Goldman accepting concessions Attorney\n   Hammis made in a stipulation with the Office of Lawyer Regulation (OLR) that he committed 40 counts of professional misconduct and recommending that his license to practice to law in Wisconsin be revoked. In his appeal, Attorney Hammis primarily challenges the sanction recommendation and asserts that an appropriate sanction would be a suspension of his license to practice law in the range of one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 Upon careful review of this matter, we uphold all of the referee's findings of fact and conclusions of law. We conclude, however, that the facts of this case do not warrant revocation. Instead, we conclude that a three-year suspension of Attorney Hammis' law license is an appropriate sanction for the misconduct at issue. We also deem it appropriate to impose certain conditions upon the reinstatement of his law license. We also order him to pay $ 400 in restitution to one former client and, as is our usual custom, we impose the full costs of this proceeding, which are $ 13,160.22 as of March 4, 2019 on Attorney Hammis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 Attorney Hammis was admitted to practice law in Wisconsin in 1988. The State Bar of Wisconsin shows that he has a Stoughton address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 In 2011, Attorney Hammis was suspended for four months for ten counts of misconduct involving two clients. The misconduct included practicing law while administratively suspended and failing to cooperate with the OLR's investigation.\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Hammis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4007099\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/331/19/\">\n    2011 WI 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4007099\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/331/19/\">\n    331 Wis. 2d 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4007099\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/331/19/\">\n    793 N.W.2d 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Attorney Hammis filed an answer on January 5, 2015. On August 27, 2015, the OLR filed an amended complaint alleging 49 counts of misconduct. Attorney Hammis filed an answer on January 19, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 On September 29, 2016, the parties filed a stipulation, and Attorney Hammis entered a no contest plea to 40 counts of misconduct. Attorney Hammis agreed that the referee could use the allegations of the amended complaint as an adequate factual basis to support findings of misconduct as to each of the counts to which Attorney Hammis was pleading no contest. The OLR withdrew nine counts of misconduct. Attorney Hammis agreed that the referee's report should recommend that the court order him to make restitution to one client, R.G., in the amount of $ 400. The parties further agreed that the issue of the appropriate level of discipline to be imposed for Attorney Hammis' misconduct would be addressed on briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 On January 6, 2017, the parties filed a stipulation of facts specifying that the referee may use specific allegations in the amended complaint as an adequate factual basis to support findings of misconduct as to each of the misconduct counts to which Attorney Hammis pled no contest. The referee issued her report and recommendation on September 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b68 The counts to which Attorney Hammis pled no contest involved nine separate client matters as well as numerous trust account and other violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     G.L.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 According to the amended complaint, in 2006 Attorney Hammis represented G.L. in several criminal cases. The representation ended sometime in 2006 or 2007. In early 2008, the Department of Corrections revoked G.L.'s probation and G.L. was resentenced. G.L. hired Attorney Hammis to appeal his post-revocation sentences. In October 2008, Attorney Hammis wrote to G.L. saying he had mailed a copy of the original sentencing transcript to G.L. \"a month ago\" and the letter had been returned. Actually Attorney Hammis had just obtained a transcript within the prior two weeks and had not mailed anything to G.L. since June 2008. Attorney Hammis did not file a notice of appearance in the case until January 2009. That same month G.L. asked Attorney Hammis for information about the cost of representation but Attorney Hammis never responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 By virtue of the stipulation, Attorney Hammis pled no contest to the following counts of misconduct with respect to his representation of G.L.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Four\n   </strong>\n   : By failing to respond to his client's request for information on the costs of his representation, Attorney Hammis violated SCR 20:1.5(b)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Five\n   </strong>\n   : By making misrepresentations to his client by letter dated October 31, 2008, Attorney Hammis violated SCR 20:8.4(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.D.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 In 2010, B.D. was employed as a recreation director for the City of Janesville (City). On November 5, 2010, Janesville sent B.D. a \"Pre-determination Notice of Discharge.\" B.D. met with Attorney Hammis regarding her employment and paid him an advance fee of $ 2,000. B.D. signed a written fee agreement which allowed Attorney Hammis to deposit the fee into his business account. The agreement required Attorney Hammis to send B.D. a written accounting of his fees at the end of his representation. Attorney Hammis told B.D. he would attend any meetings with the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 On December 6, 2010, the City terminated B.D.'s employment. That same day, B.D. instructed Attorney Hammis to file a discrimination complaint against the City. Attorney Hammis prepared a complaint but never filed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 On February 23, 2011, Attorney Hammis believed he ceased representing B.D. He never provided her with an accounting. In March of 2011, B.D. filed a grievance against Attorney Hammis with the OLR. Attorney Hammis failed to respond to numerous OLR requests for a response to the grievance. Attorney Hammis eventually responded to the OLR in July 2011 indicating he had time sheets and phone records for his representation of B.D. The OLR requested Attorney Hammis to provide that information, but Attorney Hammis failed to provide it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 By virtue of the stipulation, Attorney Hammis pled no contest to the following counts regarding his representation of B.D.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Six\n   </strong>\n   : For failing to account to B.D. for her $ 2,000 advance fee deposited into his operating account,\n   as required by the alternative fee placement\n   measures of former SCR 20:1.15(b)(4m), Attorney Hammis violated former SCR 20:1.15(b)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Counts Eight and Nine\n   </strong>\n   : By failing to pursue his client's interest in negotiating considerations in exchange for termination of her employment and by failing at any time from December 6, 2010, to February 23, 2011, to file the discrimination complaint he had prepared for his client, Attorney Hammis violated SCR 20:1.3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Ten\n   </strong>\n   : By failing to timely respond to the OLR's request for a written response to B.D.'s grievance, Attorney Hammis violated SCR 22.03(2),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforced via\n   SCR 20:8.4(h).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Eleven\n   </strong>\n   : By failing to furnish documents requested by the OLR, which he previously admitted he possessed, Attorney Hammis violated SCR 22.03(6),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforced via SCR 20:8.4(h).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     S.K.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b615 In 2002, M.K. filed for divorce from S.K. Attorney Hammis agreed to represent S.K. in the matter in June of 2009. In November of 2010, the circuit court found S.K. in contempt and ordered him to spend 45 days in jail, commencing December 1, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 Attorney Hammis moved to withdraw from representing S.K. on January 4, 2011. S.K. filed a grievance with the OLR against Attorney Hammis on June 1, 2011. Attorney Hammis failed to respond to numerous OLR requests for information regarding the grievance. Attorney Hammis finally provided a partial response in September of 2011. He provided additional documents in December of 2011. By virtue of the\n   stipulation, Attorney Hammis pled no contest to the following count of misconduct regarding his representation of S.K.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Thirteen\n   </strong>\n   : By not timely responding to the OLR's request for a written response to S.K.'s grievance, and then making only a partial and incomplete response that did not include the documents expressly requested and which was not supplemented until approximately four months after the original OLR request, Attorney Hammis violated SCR 22.03(2) and SCR 22.03(6), enforced via SCR 20:8.4(h).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     R.B. and Trust Account Violations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b617 In May 2010, R.B. hired Attorney Hammis to represent him in an automobile accident case. The parties agreed that R.B. would receive the first $ 4,800 collected, while Attorney Hammis would advance all expenses and recover anything in excess of $ 4,800. Attorney Hammis filed a complaint in the case in June 2010. He subsequently negotiated settlements for R.B. with two insurance companies. One of the companies mailed Attorney Hammis a check in early August 2010 along with a release for R.B.'s signature. Attorney Hammis asked R.B. to lower his share of the settlement to $ 4,500. R.B. reluctantly agreed. Attorney Hammis deposited the check in his trust account but never obtained R.B.'s signature on the release or sent a signed release to the insurance company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b618 On or around August 13, 2010, Attorney Hammis gave R.B. a trust account check for $ 4,500. Attorney Hammis failed to send a check to another insurance company for their subrogation interest. By January 27, 2011, the trust account's balance was $ 1,000 less than the second insurance company was\n   owed for their subrogation interest. In February 2011, the circuit court dismissed the R.B. case with prejudice because although the parties had reported a settlement, no dismissal order was submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b619 In the summer of 2011, both insurance companies filed grievances with the OLR against Attorney Hammis. Attorney Hammis did not respond to the OLR's initial requests for information about the grievances. He subsequently provided partial responses. In December 2011, Attorney Hammis closed the trust account, which then had a balance of $ 9.07, having never disbursed the $ 1,489.82 due to the subrogated insurance carrier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b620 On December 14, 2011, the OLR filed a motion requesting an order to show cause with this court due to Attorney Hammis' noncooperation with the OLR's investigation. An order to show cause was issued. On December 30, 2011, Attorney Hammis sent the subrogated insurance carrier a \"replacement check\" for $ 1,489.82 with a cover letter representing that he had previously sent a check on August 13, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b621 The OLR withdrew its motion for an order to show cause on January 9, 2012. On January 20, 2012, the credit union on which the check was drawn refused to honor the check. The account was closed four days later. In May of 2012, Attorney Hammis sent the subrogated insurance carrier a check dated April 17, 2012, for $ 1,489.82 drawn on a business account at a different bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b622 In July and August 2013, the OLR wrote and then personally served Attorney Hammis with requests for various documents. Attorney Hammis did not timely respond. In September 2013, the OLR filed another motion requesting an order to show cause. An order to show cause was issued. In November 2013, this\n   court temporarily suspended Attorney Hammis' Wisconsin law license due to his failure to cooperate with the OLR's investigation. Attorney Hammis responded to several of the OLR's requests in December 2013. On December 30, 2013, pursuant to the OLR's\n   request, this court reinstated Attorney Hammis' law license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b623 On October 7, 2010, Attorney Hammis transferred $ 15,000 from his trust account to his wife's checking account, leaving the trust account with a shortfall of $ 1,589.50. On December 14, 2010, Attorney Hammis withdrew $ 45,000 from the trust account and purchased a cashier's check in that amount. Between July 2010 and December 2011, Attorney Hammis deposited $ 15,400 of his or his law firm's funds into the trust account but his client ledgers did not reflect those deposits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b624 Between July 2010 and February 2011, Attorney Hammis made 56 prohibited Internet or telephone transactions totaling over $ 250,000 with his trust account. Attorney Hammis failed to identify the client or matter on deposit slips for 19 deposits totaling over $ 640,000 into the trust account between July 2010 and February 2011. Attorney Hammis' client ledgers indicate that he disbursed more funds then he received for four clients, creating negative balances for those clients in the trust account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b625 By virtue of the stipulation, Attorney Hammis pled no contest to the following counts of misconduct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Fourteen:\n   </strong>\n   By converting funds held in trust for a third party to other purposes sometime between August 10, 2010 (the deposit of the insurance settlement check in the R.B. matter) and January 27, 2011 (a date on which the trust account balance was less than\n   the money owed to the subrogated insurance carrier in the R.B. matter), Attorney Hammis violated SCR 20:8.4(c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Fifteen:\n   </strong>\n   By receiving funds in trust for a third party, the subrogated insurance carrier, and then failing to pay that party for over 20 months, Attorney Hammis violated former SCR 20:1.15(d)(1) through (3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Sixteen:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to hold in trust the funds he received for the purpose of paying the subrogation claim of R.B.'s insurer, Attorney Hammis violated SCR 20:1.15(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Eighteen:\n   </strong>\n   By falsely representing to the subrogated insurance carrier that he had sent a check for $ 1,489.82\n   to it on August 13, 2010, Attorney Hammis violated SCR 20:8.4(c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Twenty:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to timely answer the OLR's request for a response and his subsequent failure to fully and fairly disclose all the facts and circumstances including those concerning the subrogated insurance carrier's claim, by his wilful failure to fully answer questions, by failing to furnish requested documents, by repeatedly responding to requests for information by referencing non-existent attachments and by generally failing to provide relevant information, Attorney Hammis violated SCR 22.03(2) and (6), and SCR 20:8.4(h).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Twenty-One\n   </strong>\n   : By withdrawing $ 45,000 from his trust account on December 14, 2010, in order to obtain a cashier's check, Attorney Hammis violated former SCR 20:1.15(e)(4)a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    County Twenty-Two:\n   </strong>\n   By engaging from July 2010 through February 2011 in 56 prohibited Internet and telephone transactions with a combined dollar value of $ 259,281.22 to and from his trust account, Attorney Hammis violated former SCR 20:1.15(e)(4)b. and c.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Twenty-Three:\n   </strong>\n   By failing to identify the client or matter on every deposit slip for all of the 19 deposits totaling $ 640,745.79 made to the trust account between July 9, 2010, and February 24, 2011, Attorney Hammis violated former SCR 20:1.15(f)(1)d.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Twenty-Four:\n   </strong>\n   By converting funds held in trust for clients to other purposes sometime between July 21, 2010, and December 9, 2011, Attorney Hammis violated SCR 20:8.4(c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Twenty-Six:\n   </strong>\n   By depositing at least $ 15,400 of lawyer or law firm funds into the trust account between July 2, 2010, and February 24, 2011, which funds far exceeded any amounts reasonably necessary to pay monthly account service charges, and none of which was allocated to any client or matter for which funds were held in trust, Attorney Hammis violated former SCR 20:1.15(b)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    Count Twenty-Seven:\n   </strong>\n   By disbursing funds from the trust account on at least four occasions that resulted in negative balances on the individual client ledgers recording funds held in trust with respect to four different clients or matters,\n   Attorney Hammis violated former SCR 20:1.15(f)(1)b.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     M.V.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b626 On May 28, 2010, M.V. hired Attorney Hammis to represent her in her role as the personal representative of an estate.

On October 8, 2010, Attorney Hammis sent the special administrator's attorney a check for $ 145,000 representing the estate's funds. An invoice for Attorney Hammis' representation of M.V. dated February 28, 2011, indicated that Attorney Hammis used the $ 5,000 as a \"reserve fee.\" Attorney Hammis' client ledger\n   indicates that on February 28, 2011, he transferred the remaining $ 4,000 of estate funds out of his trust account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b628 M.V. died on November 16, 2011. On December 7, 2011, D.E. was appointed as special administrator of M.V.'s estate. D.E. hired Attorney Michael Rumpf to represent her. On December 7, 2011, Attorney Rumpf wrote to Attorney Hammis requesting, among other things, that he transfer to Attorney Rumpf any estate funds held in trust, and provide an accounting of those funds.

On January 21, 2014, the bankruptcy trustee held a meeting of\n   creditors in D.A.'s bankruptcy.

The referee noted that virtually all of the conduct stipulated to by Attorney Hammis occurred after the OLR had filed its complaint in Attorney Hammis' first disciplinary matter. The referee said that many of the violations alleged in this case are similar to violations that occurred in Attorney Hammis' two previous disciplinary matters. The referee pointed out that Attorney Hammis stipulated to committing five violations of SCR 20:8.4(c), which would have required the OLR to prove that Attorney Hammis \"engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\" The referee said that by entering a no contest plea to each of those counts and the facts supporting the counts, Attorney Hammis waived his right to contest that those counts in fact involved fraud, misrepresentation, dishonesty, or deceit. The referee said that Attorney Hammis' argument that those counts involved mere negligence must be ignored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b652 The referee also noted that Attorney Hammis pled no contest to ten counts involving trust account violations under SCR 20:1.15, one count involving 56\n   separate prohibited transactions. The referee said, \"perhaps Hammis despises the rules of trust accounting, has not learned them, or finds them too difficult to comply with, and so chooses to ignore them entirely.\" The referee also said \"his subsequent untruthful explanations of what occurred ... only highlight his inherent dishonesty. It is difficult to understand what lesser corrective discipline than revocation would prompt proper corrective action on his part to ensure compliance with what is required.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b653 The referee went on to say that in this matter, as in his past disciplinary cases, Attorney Hammis developed a pattern whereby he would avoid answering or responding to the OLR's requests for information about a grievance until an order to show cause had been issued and then would avoid a license suspension by minimally responding to the OLR. The referee pointed out Attorney Hammis pled no contest to 11 counts involving his failure to respond to the OLR's request for information. The referee said Attorney Hammis dismisses all of his violations of the duty to respond to the OLR as justified or minimal and claims little or no sanction should be imposed for those violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b654 The referee said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   It seems from the current violations that Hammis has not changed his practices or his conduct found in each of the prior discipline decisions. Hammis seems to do what he wants without regard for the Supreme Court rules and when caught he asserts or implies that his violations are merely technical irregularities, a nuisance that he cannot possibly be expected to follow. At no point in his response brief did he express remorse for his transgressions, or empathy for those clients who filed complaints against him. And, he points out in his brief that many of the technical violations pled to\n   were discovered by OLR's snooping around in his business, his files, his record keeping. ... Hammis' argument misses the mark.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b655 The referee concluded by saying:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Revocation should be imposed when there is little hope that an attorney will chose to modify his or her behavior to\n   the standards required in Chapter 20. This is Hammis' third disciplinary action and involves the same rule violations, the same conduct as his other actions. Some attorneys violate the same rules Hammis has but show a genuine desire to correct their behavior, to learn new practices to prevent mishaps, and commit themselves to better communications with their clients. Hammis is not among them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b656 The referee said Attorney Hammis' two prior suspensions apparently did nothing to provoke any change in his law business practices. For that reason, the referee agreed with the OLR's recommendation that Attorney Hammis' license to practice law in Wisconsin should be revoked. The referee also recommended, consistent with the terms of the stipulation, that Attorney Hammis be required to pay restitution to R.G. in the amount of $ 400, if he has not already done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b657 Attorney Hammis' appeal raises three issues: (1) Did the referee err in the introduction and utilization of facts and subsequent conclusions that were not stipulated by the parties? (2) Is the use of the OLR of unknown and undisclosed subpoenas and discovery with financial institutions a violation of due process? (3) Did the referee err in the recommendation that Attorney Hammis' license be revoked?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b658 Attorney Hammis says the parties' stipulation and his no contest plea and separate stipulation of facts \"were a balanced and negotiated decision made by the parties to assure that the format of the briefing and arguments of the parties would follow a series of facts that were the result of the agreements of the parties.\" He says the referee's report made reference to \"multiple very specific incorrect or non-stipulated facts.\" He accuses the referee of stepping outside the stipulation of facts reached by the parties. He says \"the degree and damage to such stepping out is not completely determinable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   He says the referee's reliance on non-stipulated facts should be considered the \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b659 Attorney Hammis notes that SCR 22.03(8) provides that the OLR director may subpoena the respondent and others and compel any person to produce pertinent books, papers and documents. He argues this rule is contrary to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20805.07\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 805.07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   which outlines the process and procedure for the service and notification to parties of subpoenas. He says, \"once again the 'fruit of this poisonous tree' are significant. ...\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b660 Most significantly, Attorney Hammis argues that the referee erred in adopting the OLR's recommendation that Attorney Hammis' law license should be revoked. He argues that his misconduct does not demonstrate a pattern of intentionally inflicted harm, malfeasance or financial malfeasance to any of his clients. He says without question he did make mistakes that\n   were in violation of supreme court rules, but he attempts to paint the misconduct as not being all that serious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b661 Contrary to the referee's conclusion that there is little hope Attorney Hammis will modify his behavior and that he has shown little remorse for his actions, Attorney Hammis argues he has acknowledged his errors and mistakes. Rather than revocation of his license, he says a one-year suspension would be an appropriate sanction. In the alternative, he asks that the entire referee report be set aside and a new referee appointed \"and that counts\n   connected to the issued subpoenas, [R.B.] and the Trust account issues are duly dismissed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b662 The OLR takes the position that this court should endorse the referee's report, revoke Attorney Hammis' license, and order him to pay $ 400 restitution to R.G. The OLR argues that the referee's findings of fact are supported by the record and are not clearly erroneous. The OLR says none of the facts that Attorney Hammis argues were outside of the parties' stipulation are material to the misconduct. The OLR says, \"the facts which Hammis identifies on appeal as erroneous or problematic were either immaterial or properly cited in the referee's report.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b663 The OLR says this court should reject Attorney Hammis' theory that the documents subpoenaed by the OLR \"poisoned\" the case. The OLR says while disciplinary proceedings generally follow the rules of civil procedure, OLR investigations do not, and the supreme court rules do not require the OLR to notify a respondent when it subpoenas documents during a confidential investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b664 As to the appropriate sanction, the OLR says revocation is warranted. It points out Attorney\n   Hammis' misconduct involves multiple client matters and 40 counts of misconduct ranging from abandonment of clients, to misleading clients, to false notarization, to practicing bankruptcy law while suspended, to serious trust account malfeasance, and multiple willful failures to cooperate with OLR investigations into his conduct. The OLR says Attorney Hammis' misconduct reaches almost every aspect of practicing law and shows a pervasive pattern of disregarding the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b665 The OLR also notes that the misconduct at issue here encompass the time frame from 2008 to 2012.

This court determines the appropriate level of discipline given the particular facts of the case, independent of the referee's recommendation but benefitting from it.\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Widule\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9098281\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/261/45/\">\n    2003 WI 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 44,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9098281\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/261/45/\">\n    261 Wis. 2d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9098281\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/261/45/\">\n    660 N.W.2d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b667 By entering into the stipulation and by pleading no contest, Attorney Hammis has admitted the factual basis underlying the 40 counts of misconduct. The only legitimate challenge he can lodge to the referee's report is the recommended sanction of revocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   It was appropriate for the referee to note similarities between the misconduct at issue here and the misconduct for which Attorney Hammis was previously disciplined, which led her to conclude he had learned nothing from his previous mistakes. Similarly, Attorney Hammis' complaints about the OLR's subpoenaing his bank records is unavailing since he has admitted the trust account and other banking violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b668 As to the appropriate level of discipline, the facts alleged in the amended complaint, to which Attorney Hammis pled no contest, show a clear pattern of neglect of his clients' needs and objectives and an utter disregard for his obligations as an attorney. His misconduct was not an isolated occurrence but occurred in nine separate\n   client representations over the course of years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b669 We recognize, as the dissent points out, that the misconduct at issue here occurred prior to Attorney Hammis' 2015 suspension. The complaint in this matter was filed in 2014 and the amended complaint was filed in 2015. Some of the delay in the completion of this case was caused by Attorney Hammis' failure to cooperate in the OLR's investigations as well as by his motion practice and multiple extension motions. While it may have been preferable for this matter to have been brought to conclusion sooner, the passage of time since Attorney Hammis' most recent misconduct in no way excuses or mitigates the misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b670 While Attorney Hammis portrays himself as remorseful and says he has accepted responsibility for his transgressions, some of his statements at oral argument call those assertions into question. Attorney Hammis' representation of R.G. is illustrative. R.G. retained Attorney Hammis in November of 2011 and paid him $ 400. Attorney Hammis never did the work. R.G. terminated his representation in December of 2011 and\n   demanded a refund of the $ 400. R.G. filed a grievance in March of 2012. In April of 2013 she obtained a small claims judgment against him. In September of 2016, Attorney Hammis stipulated that he owed R.G. $ 400 in restitution. When asked at oral argument why he had not paid R.G. the $ 400, Attorney Hammis replied that he was \"waiting for a court order.\" The small claims court rendered a judgment in favor of R.G. six years ago, and Attorney Hammis stipulated two and a half years ago that he needed to pay R.G. the $ 400. The fact that this modest sum remains unpaid in 2019 belies Attorney Hammis' claim that he is remorseful and has fully accepted responsibility for his actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b671 Revocation is the most serious sanction that may be imposed under our attorney disciplinary system and it is reserved for the most egregious cases. Although Attorney Hammis' misconduct was undeniably very serious, we are not convinced that it rises to the level of warranting revocation. We note that the misconduct at issue here occurred between 2008 and 2012. Attorney Hammis stated at oral argument that he stepped away from his general legal practice in 2011 or 2012. Since that time he has performed some legal work for a company with which he has a long-term relationship. He says he currently is representing a defendant in one felony criminal case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b672 While no two disciplinary matters are identical, we find this case to be somewhat similar to\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Bryant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256354\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/360/625/\">\n    2015 WI 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256354\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/360/625/\">\n    360 Wis. 2d 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256354\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/360/625/\">\n    858 N.W.2d 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Attorney Bryant stipulated to a three-year suspension for 37 counts of misconduct including one violation of SCR 20:8.4(c) and multiple counts of failing to take meaningful action or advance his clients' interests, failing to properly hold unearned fees and advanced payment of fees\n   in trust, converting client funds to pay himself attorney's fees, and failing to cooperate in the OLR's investigations. Attorney Bryant had a previous consensual private reprimand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b673 In addition, this case is somewhat similar to\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Dahle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256952\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/361/430/\">\n    2015 WI 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256952\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/361/430/\">\n    361 Wis. 2d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256952\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/361/430/\">\n    862 N.W.2d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Attorney Dahle committed 55 counts of misconduct, including borrowing or taking some $ 400,000 from clients without regard to conflict of interest restrictions and requirements. Attorney Dahle had no prior disciplinary history. We suspended her law license for two years and six months. Although the amount of money converted or mishandled by Attorney Hammis is much less, he does\n   have a prior disciplinary history and he repeatedly failed to respond to the OLR's request for information after his clients had filed grievances and only when served with an order to show cause and faced with the possible suspension of his law license did he finally respond to the OLR's inquiries. Under the unique facts of this case, we conclude that a three-year suspension of Attorney Hammis' license to practice law in Wisconsin is an appropriate sanction for his misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b674 We also deem it appropriate to impose various conditions upon Attorney Hammis' resumption of the practice of law, in the event his law license is reinstated. Those conditions include practicing law under the supervision of a legal mentor approved by the OLR for a period of two years after his license is reinstated; a prohibition upon ever maintaining a trust account; and limiting his practice to performing legal work for his corporate client and assisting family and friends in legal matters.

(dissenting).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u00b682 Attorney Hammis stated, both in his brief and at oral argument, that in 2012 he virtually discontinued his legal practice, with the exception of occasionally assisting family members and friends-usually without charge-and performing three to five hours of legal work per month for a longtime corporate client. He no longer has a trust account and does not make his living from practicing law. He stated he has no intention of expanding his legal practice in the future. He has expressed remorse for his admitted misconduct and questions what more he could have done in the past seven years to alleviate concerns that his extremely limited practice would be a threat to his clients or the legal profession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u00b683 The majority acknowledges that all of the misconduct at issue here occurred prior to 2015, when Attorney Hammis' license\n   was suspended for 90 days, and some of the misconduct occurred prior to the four-month suspension imposed in 2011. Indeed, the complaint in this matter was filed nearly five months before the court issued its order imposing the 2015 suspension. The serial nature of the OLR's complaints against Attorney Hammis appears to expose a flaw in Wisconsin's attorney regulatory system. If the misconduct counts at issue in this case and the counts at issue in the case resulting in the 90-day suspension had been prosecuted at the same time, the resulting discipline may well have been less than the three years and three months that was imposed in the two separate cases. In spite of the fact that Attorney Hammis has virtually not practiced law since 2012 and has committed no misconduct since 2015, he is nonetheless being suspended for an additional three years in 2019 for misconduct that occurred long ago. While the passage\n   of time should not excuse misconduct, the majority fails to adequately justify why a three-year suspension is warranted given that the previous suspensions were for four months and 90 days and there has been no misconduct in the past four years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   \u00b684 The Office of Lawyer Regulation Procedures Review Committee recently filed a series of administrative rule petitions dealing with various aspects of Wisconsin's attorney regulatory system. The Committee was tasked with reporting to this court any recommendations that would increase the efficiency, effectiveness, and fairness of the OLR process. In my view, this case raises issues that warrant the court's review when it takes up the rules petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b685 Given the facts and procedural history of this case, I am unable to conclude that a three-year suspension is warranted. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u00b686 I am authorized to state that Justice REBECCA GRASSL BRADLEY joins this dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
