Involuntary commitment and medication orders were obtained in 2012 and those court orders have been extended on several occasions. The petition at issue in this case was filed on May 22, 2015. Within the\n   petition, a psychologist affirmed C.S.'s schizophrenia diagnosis and opined that C.S. satisfied the statutory criteria for an extension of commitment and for\n   involuntary medication. C.S. objected, and a jury trial was held in June 2015. The jury, addressing the elements of WIS. STAT. \u00a7 51.20(1)(ar), found that (1) C.S. was mentally ill; (2) C.S. was a proper subject for treatment and in need of treatment; (3) C.S. was an inmate of a state prison; (4) less restrictive forms of appropriate treatment had been attempted and were unsuccessful; and (5) and (6) C.S. had been fully informed of his treatment needs, the mental health services available, and his rights, and he had an opportunity to discuss these matters with a licensed physician or psychologist. The circuit court entered an order extending C.S.'s commitment under \u00a7 51.20(1)(ar) and an order for involuntary medication and treatment under WIS. STAT. \u00a7 51.61(1)(g).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 In a postcommitment motion, C.S. challenged WIS. STAT. \u00a7 51.61(1)(g) as \"unconstitutional for all prisoners committed under WIS. STAT. \u00a7 51.20(1)(ar)\" as it allows prisoners to be involuntarily medicated without a finding of dangerousness.
