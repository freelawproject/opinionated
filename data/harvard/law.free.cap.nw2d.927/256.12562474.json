On remand, the Court of Appeals shall address: (1) whether the definition of \"prison\" found in MCL 750.193(2) controls whether a facility is a \"penal or reformatory institution\" for purposes of MCL 768.7a(1), even though the two statutes appear in different codes, compare\n   <em>\n    People v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2203289\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/96/84/#p86\">\n    96 Mich.App. 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 86-88,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20N.W.2d%20489\">\n    292 N.W.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980), and\n   <em>\n    People v.

In all other respects, leave to appeal is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the remaining\n   question presented should be reviewed by this Court.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
