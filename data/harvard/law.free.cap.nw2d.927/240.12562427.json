We note that the Court of Appeals currently has before it the case of\n   <em>\n    People v. Clark\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 345459. The\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   case involves an issue similar to an issue presented in this case, and the court's disposition in\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   may be instructive in resolving that issue.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
