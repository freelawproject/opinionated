The MPCA asserts that the district court erred by granting summary judgment to respondent on the grounds that the APO was in excess of the MPCA's authority and unsupported by substantial evidence and by denying the MPCA's motion for summary judgment. Respondent asks that we affirm and offers two constitutional arguments, raised below but unaddressed by the district court, as alternative grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We conclude that the MPCA had the authority to issue the APO, and respondent violated the APO, but because a genuine issue of material fact remains over whether the penalty was warranted, and because respondent's constitutional arguments are unavailing, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Twin Cities metropolitan area generates a significant amount of garbage each year.

In 1985, the legislature started down this path by requiring that, after January 1, 1990, \"waste disposal facilities located in the metropolitan area may not accept mixed municipal solid waste for disposal unless the waste has been transferred to the disposal facility from a resource-recovery facility identified by the [metropolitan] council.\" 1985 Minn.

Certification must include at least the number and size of loads certified as unprocessible and the reasons the waste is unprocessible.

Laws 1st Spec. Sess. ch. 1, art. 2, \u00a7 161, at 2171-72.

Stat. \u00a7 473.149\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , subd. 1 (2018). In early 2011, the MPCA published a policy plan, and one of its objectives was to ensure compliance with section 473.848. Under section 473.848, subdivision 4, the MPCA was permitted to \"adopt standards for determining when waste is unprocessible\" for purposes of certification. The policy plan includes standards for making that determination: waste is \"unprocessible when all reasonably available capacity within the [metropolitan area] processing system is fully utilized at 100 percent of its operating capacity.\" The geographic location of resource-recovery facilities is considered in determining \"reasonably available capacity.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    In 2012, the legislature required the MPCA to prepare a report on how compliance with section 473.848 might be achieved.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    2012 Minn. Laws ch. 272, \u00a7 93, at 1125.

The report stated that the metropolitan landfills and resource-recovery facilities were \"not in compliance with the restriction on disposal,\" and it proposed amendments to landfill permits \"to restrict landfills from accepting unprocessed metropolitan [waste] unless the waste has been certified by the county as unprocessible.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Pursuant to the landfill-permit strategy, the MPCA issued a permit to respondent on July 30, 2015, containing language drawn from section 473.848 :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    The permittee shall not dispose of unprocessed mixed municipal solid waste generated in the metropolitan area at the facility unless:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    (1) the waste has been certified as unprocessible by a county under [ section] 473.848, subdivision 2 ; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    (2)(i) the waste has been transferred to the disposal facility from a resource recovery facility;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    (ii) no other resource recovery facility serving the metropolitan area is capable of processing the waste; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    (iii) the waste has been certified as unprocessible by the operator of the resource recovery facility under [ section] 473.848, subdivision 3.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The permit also stated that pursuant to section 473.848, subdivision 2, and the policy plan, \"the determination to certify waste will be made by the [m]etropolitan [c]ounties through certification reports submitted to the MPCA. The MPCA will use these reports to determine whether the permittee is in compliance with the restriction on disposal requirement.\" Essentially, the MPCA's strategy was to allow for after-the-fact certification of waste by the counties and to use this retroactive-certification process to determine if landfills had actually disposed of uncertified waste.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    On March 31, 2017, the MPCA issued an APO to respondent. The APO alleged that, in 2016, respondent disposed of 236,001 tons of unprocessed metropolitan waste at Pine Bend Landfill. The APO alleged that, during this same period, resource-recovery facilities serving the metropolitan area processed a combined total of 96,177 tons less than their total capacities. The APO stated that the counties certified only 830 tons of waste as unprocessible. From this information, the MPCA concluded that respondent violated section 473.848 and its landfill permit by accepting unprocessed, uncertified waste. The APO assessed a $ 20,000 \"nonforgivable\" penalty against respondent, the maximum amount allowed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20116.072\">\n     Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116.072\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2016). The APO was not based upon any specific loads or tons that were in violation of the disposal restriction, but rather the aforementioned aggregate statistics. As for the APO penalty, the violation was deemed to be \"serious.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    In May 2017, respondent petitioned the district court for review of the APO pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20116.072\">\n     Minn.

In April 2018, the district court granted summary judgment to respondent for two reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    First, the court found that the MPCA \"exceeded its authority when it issued an APO against [respondent] based on a violation of its [p]ermit and [ section] 473.848.\" Second, the court concluded that the MPCA \"failed to demonstrate that it issued the $ 20,000 APO based on substantial evidence.\" This appeal followed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <strong>\n     ISSUES\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    I.

Because section 473.848 is an implementation arm of chapter 115A, and APOs may be used to enforce chapter 115A, it plainly follows that APOs may be used to enforce section 473.848.\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20115.071\">\n     Minn.

The MPCA argues that the plain language of section 473.848 makes clear that it applies to landfills. The MPCA focuses on the word \"person,\" and notes that its statutory definition includes every entity other than the MPCA. Respondent focuses on the term \"dispose,\" and asserts that the word limits the scope of section 473.848 to trash haulers and those getting rid of waste, thereby excluding landfills and entities accepting waste. The terms \"person\" and \"dispose\" are defined by statute, and based on those definitions,\n    we conclude that section 473.848 unambiguously applies to respondent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The term \"person\" is broadly defined under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20116.06\">\n     Minn.

Respondent, however, fails to present evidence indicating that no violation occurred, that is, that respondent did not dispose of uncertified, unprocessed metropolitan waste. \"When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported, the nonmoving party must present specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"\n    <em>\n     Russ\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959341\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/566/60/#p70\">\n     566 N.W.2d at 69\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quotation omitted).

The district court never reached these issues. The MPCA's case-development form indicates that the MPCA deemed the APO violation to be serious and imposed a nonforgivable penalty because of respondent's failure to comply with section 473.848. Respondent argued that the county-certification process was flawed and more waste should have been certified as unprocessible. Respondent submitted evidence to support that assertion.
