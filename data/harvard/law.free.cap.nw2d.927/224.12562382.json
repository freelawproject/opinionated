If it is determined on remand that the defendant owed no such duty or obligation, the Court of Appeals should also consider whether the defendant \"abused its legitimate powers\" when it took \"affirmative actions\" in the absence of any duty or obligation that potentially were \"directly\n   aimed at the plaintiff[s'] property.\" See\n   <em>\n    Marilyn Froling Revocable Living Trust v.

In all other respects, leave to appeal is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the remaining questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   We do not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
