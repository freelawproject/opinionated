However, I write separately to, once again, \"call to the attention of the Legislature what I believe may be the effective nullification of its mandatory minimum sentence for certain first-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC-I) offenses set forth in MCL 750.520b(2)(b).\"\n   <em>\n    People v. Keefe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12151293\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/498/962/#p962\">\n    498 Mich. 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 962,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=872%20N.W.2d%20688\">\n    872 N.W.2d 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) ( MARKMAN , J., concurring). In the present case, defendant was alleged to have engaged in penetration with a person under 13 years of age. Prior to trial, defendant waived his right to a jury trial in exchange for the prosecutor's promise not to pursue the 25-year mandatory minimum sentence that is required for a conviction under MCL 750.520b(2)(b). Defendant was subsequently convicted of two counts of CSC-I and was sentenced to two concurrent prison terms of 10 to 30 years, in accordance with the agreement between defendant and the prosecutor. I continue to believe that as a result of prosecutor-defendant agreements such as this one, \"there is no longer any real mandatory minimum sentence for the class of criminal sexual conduct offenses at issue-those involving interactions between persons 17 years of age or older and those under the age of 13.\"\n   <em>\n    Keefe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12151293\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/498/962/#p962\">\n    498 Mich. at 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=872%20N.W.2d%20688\">\n    872 N.W.2d 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ( MARKMAN , J., concurring). Once again, the Legislature may or may not wish to \"review MCL 750.520b(2)(b) to ascertain whether the outcome of this case is in accordance with its intentions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=872%20N.W.2d%20688\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
