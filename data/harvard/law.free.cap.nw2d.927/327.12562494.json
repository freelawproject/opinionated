Respondent Andrew Cilek is its executive director (respondents referred to collectively as \"the MVA\"). On July 21, 2017, the MVA sent a letter to appellants Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State and Steve Simon in his official capacity as Minnesota Secretary of State (appellants referred to collectively as \"the secretary of state\") requesting access, pursuant to the MGDPA, to \"non-private government data\" \"contained in the Statewide Voter Registration System [ (the SVRS)].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The SVRS is the centralized voter registration database used by the secretary of state and election officials to administer elections in Minnesota.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20201.022\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 201.022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). The SVRS contains information on registered voters and previously registered voters. Voter information includes: name; voter ID number; address; date of birth; driver's license number; phone number; email address; method by which registration application was submitted; whether a request was made to protect SVRS data from public disclosure due to safety concerns; status (active, inactive, challenged, and deceased); and voter history, including a list of prior elections in which the voter cast a vote. The MVA requested:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Voter registration, status and voting history information on every Minnesota voter, whether active, inactive or deleted [for] whom the secretary of state maintains or has maintained voter registration data from January 1, 2016, to present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The information requested includes, but is not limited to the following voter data:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Voter ID #\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 First middle and last names and any suffix\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Address\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Phone number (if available)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Year of birth\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Voter history indicating ballot type (ie: in-person or absentee)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Voter status (ie: active, inactive, deleted challenged, etc)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Reason for challenge or other status (ie: felon, address, etc)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 All other data routinely provided on the public information CD (\"detailed history for all elections\")\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 1, 2017, the secretary of state responded to the MVA's request: \"Pursuant to section 201.091, subds. 4 and 5, [the MVA is] entitled only to the public information list.\" The public information list includes: \"voter name, voter address, year of birth of the voter, voting history, information on the voting districts in which the voter resides and is eligible to vote, and the telephone number, if available.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20201.091\">\n    Minn.

The secretary of state indicated that the \"other information [that the MVA] requested is not part of the Public Information List, and is therefore unavailable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 10, 2017, the MVA filed a complaint in district court seeking access to the data that the secretary of state refused to provide. The secretary of state moved to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, arguing that under Minnesota law, (1) registered voters' data contained on the SVRS is presumed not accessible to the public, and (2) the secretary of state is granted discretion whether to disclose that SVRS data. The secretary of state claimed that section 201.091 protects from public disclosure the SVRS data that it withheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On December 18, 2017, the district court denied the secretary of state's motion to dismiss. The district court determined that the secretary of state failed to point to a statute, federal law, or temporary classification that provides that the data requested are not public. The district court further concluded, that while the secretary of state had discretion to disclose \"other information\" maintained in the SVRS, the secretary of state did not have discretion to classify that other information as not public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following failed settlement negotiations, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On July 11, 2018, the district court granted the MVA's motion for summary judgment and denied the secretary of state's motion for summary judgment. The district court concluded that the MVA is entitled to summary judgment because the MGDPA \"presumes government data, including data at issue in this case, [are] public and [the secretary of state] failed to set forth a federal law, state statute or a temporary classification of data that provides that the data requested by [the MVA] [are] not public.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Did the district court err in granting the MVA's motion for summary judgment and denying the secretary of state's motion for summary judgment based on its determination that the data requested by the MVA are public data under the MGDPA?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The secretary of state challenges the district court's summary-judgment rulings.

The secretary of state partially granted the MVA's request and provided the MVA access to the public information list because there is no dispute that the MVA sought the information for a statutorily permissible use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20201.091\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , subd. 4 (stating that before inspecting the public information list, the individual requesting access \"shall state in writing that any information obtained from the list will not be used for purposes unrelated to elections, political activities, or law enforcement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The MVA's request included data in the SVRS that is not on the public information list. Significantly, under section 201.091, subdivision 4, the secretary of state \"may\" provide \"other information from the [SVRS]\" if requested for permissible purposes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20201.091\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is undisputed that the MVA sought the data for political activities, a permissible purpose. The secretary of state argues that the \"may\" language in the statute affords discretion to disclose this \"other information,\" and that therefore it is not public data. We are not persuaded. If the secretary of state has unfettered discretion to disclose the contested data, which we need not decide, it would be nonsensical to conclude that the legislature has classified that data on individuals as private or confidential data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    KSTP-TV v.

The secretary of state may not assume a function of our legislature and classify data as not public when the legislature has not made that determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, section 201.091, subdivision 4, does not support the secretary of state's decision to withhold the data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Section 201.091, subdivision 5, is similarly unhelpful to the secretary of state's position. Under this section, \"the secretary of state shall provide copies of the public information lists in electronic or other media to any voter registered in Minnesota within ten days of receiving a written or electronic request accompanied by payment of the cost of reproduction.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20201.091\">\n    Minn.

This section relates to access to public information lists; it does not provide that the data that the MVA requested is classified as not public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The secretary of state also relied on an unpublished case from this court that states \"by statute the only list available for inspection by members of the public is the public information list.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205829345\">\n    2011 WL 5829345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.

App. 1993) (stating dangers of miscitation and unfairness associated with use of unpublished opinions). Second, in denying a request for government data, the responsible authority must cite \"the specific statutory section, temporary classification, or specific provision of federal law on which the determination is based.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013.03\">\n    Minn.

An unpublished case from this court is not among the identified legal authorities upon which a denial may be based.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We acknowledge that, reading section 201.091 in conjunction with related statutory sections, an argument can be made that the legislature did not intend the bulk of the SVRS database to be accessible to the public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

But the legislature has not expressly stated that the data in the SVRS is not public. And section 201.091, subdivision 4, expressly contemplates dissemination of data beyond that included on the public information list. Construing the statute as a whole, we cannot conclude that the legislature intended to classify the requested data as not public, thereby overriding the general presumption that all government data are public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Section 201.091 does not classify the data requested by the MVA as not public. Thus, the secretary of state incorrectly relied on section 201.091 as the \"specific statutory section\" to support its denial of the MVA's request for data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013.03\">\n    Minn.

At oral argument, counsel for the MVA asserted that requested data not received included: detailed voter history, ballot type, voter status, and reason for challenge. Counsel for the secretary of state countered that the MVA was provided voter history because that is data contained on the public information list.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20201.091\">\n     Minn.
