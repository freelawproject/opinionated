At the December 1, 2017 hearing, the district court heard testimony from the State Hospital's expert, Dr. Byrne, and J.M.'s independent evaluator, Dr. Benson. In his testimony, Dr. Byrne stated J.M. was likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct based on actuarial tests and his review of J.M.'s records. Dr. Byrne also found J.M.'s diagnoses are linked to a serious difficulty in controlling his behavior. During her testimony, Dr. Benson testified J.M. was not likely to engage in sexually predatory conduct and no longer met the criteria for a sexually dangerous individual. Dr. Benson based her testimony on interviews with J.M. and his family, actuarial tests, and dynamic factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b64] The district court also received testimony about an incident where J.M. threw a rock at another resident and an altercation with another resident investigated by the State Hospital. The experts disagreed on what these incidents represented about J.M.'s likelihood to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct. However, both Dr. Byrne and Dr. Benson stated that aggression remained an issue for J.M. Additionally,\n   the court received evidence of behavioral write-ups J.M. received for writing negative comments about other residents in his journal and withdrawing twelve dollars more than he was allowed to from the ATM. Nothing in the record suggests J.M. did anything inappropriate with the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b65] Quoting from Dr. Byrne's report, the district court found J.M. continues to be a sexually dangerous individual under N.D.C.C. ch. 25-03.3 and denied J.M.'s application for discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b66] Civil commitments of sexually dangerous individuals are reviewed under a modified clearly erroneous standard.\n   <em>\n    In Interest of Tanner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12334338\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/897/901/\">\n    2017 ND 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12334338\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/897/901/\">\n    897 N.W.2d 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, much of Dr. Byrne's report, relied on heavily by the district court, was based on J.M.'s history and prior patterns of treatment progress. The record establishes that J.M. has not acted out sexually, has not had any sexual in nature rule violations, and has either completed his sex offender treatment or made substantial progress since his last evaluation. While we are aware both Dr. Byrne and Dr. Benson expressed concerns over J.M.'s potential aggression issues, the record does not establish that J.M.'s propensity towards sexual violence is of such a degree as to pose a threat to\n   others.\n   <em>\n    Tanner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12334338\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/897/901/\">\n    2017 ND 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12334338\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/897/901/\">\n    897 N.W.2d 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For instance, according to Dr. Byrne, J.M.'s diagnosis of other specified paraphilic disorder (polymorphously perverse) indicates that individuals with that disorder tend to engage in ongoing recurrent and intense sexual fantasies, urges and behaviors involving a wide range of sexual behavior which predisposes J.M. to engage in future sexually predatory conduct. In addition, Dr. Byrne opined that J.M.'s personality disorder adversely affects his ability to modulate the fantasies, urges, and behavior related to the sexual disorders. These pages of Dr. Byrne's report also summarize J.M.'s dynamic factors. While some of the factors weigh in J.M.'s favor or are neutral, a number of them show why he poses a high risk to sexually reoffend, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 Impulsive-\n   <em>\n    Partially Present:\n   </em>\n   [J.M.'s] rate of RBW's has decreased significantly but have not been eliminated. His RBW's show he is still not fully and consistently implementing his treatment concepts as he progresses through the treatment program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 Poor Cognitive Problem Solving-\n   <em>\n    Partially Present:\n   </em>\n   As noted in the descriptions, [J.M.] appears to have the ability to do well in treatment but as he progresses he continues to act out in ways that result in his losing his treatment status. In addition, his writing with profanity and negativity toward his peers in his journal is also not a good solution to his problems in managing himself within the program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 Negative Emotionality-\n   <em>\n    Present:\n   </em>\n   [J.M.] appears to harbor and cultivate resentments and blames others for his problems which continues to result in anxiety, frustration, and anger.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 Sex Drive/Sexual Preoccupation-\n   <em>\n    Partially Present:\n   </em>\n   [J.M.], after having been masturbating regularly, has now claims to have not had much masturbatory activity due to his religious changes. However, the possibility of his attempting to \"look good\" is also possibly present as well and it appears unlikely that he would go from regularly masturbating not virtually not doing so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 Deviant Sexual Preference-\n   <em>\n    Present:\n   </em>\n   [J.M.] has at least two prepubescent victims, has admitted to masturbating to prepubescent children while at NDSH. There has been no objective evidence of any treatment changes other that his self-report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 Cooperation with Supervision-\n   <em>\n    Present:\n   </em>\n   [J.M.'s] RBW's (resident behavioral write-ups), while, reduced, still constitute significant rule breaking on his part and also his journal entries also represent a disdain for treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Thus, it is the undersigned professional's opinion that [J.M.] continues to demonstrate \"serious difficulty\" controlling his behavior that would likely be worse in a less restrictive environment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   [\u00b625] The district court also found the necessary nexus between J.M.'s condition and the danger he poses to others is linked to a serious difficulty in controlling his behavior, relying in part on pages 10-11 of Dr. Byrne's report. The court focused on Dr. Byrne's opinion that J.M.'s antisocial personality and psychopathic traits are\n   still behaviorally present in the form of his RBW's and a concerning pattern of progress in treatment is followed by acting out resulting in him being demoted to Stage 1 treatment. Dr. Byrne opined J.M. is not adaptively managing his risk as he is granted more privileges and freedoms, and his acting out while in a secure setting gave concerns of an increased probability of acting out if he were given greater access to the community. It was Dr. Byrne's professional opinion that J.M. continues to demonstrate serious difficulty controlling his behavior that would likely be worse in a less restrictive environment. The district court also noted that Dr. Benson indicated that aggression continues to be an issue for J.M., but Dr. Benson did not believe it increased his likelihood to reoffend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [\u00b626] There is sufficient evidence to justify the district court's findings that J.M. is a sexually dangerous individual and likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b627] Lisa Fair McEvers\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Jon J.
