Graham Place Apartments is owned and managed by respondent Stonebridge Communities, LLC (Stonebridge). On October 20, 2014, Barbara Wise (Wise) tripped and fell on an uneven section of the sidewalk in front of the main entrance to Graham Place Apartments. Wise claimed that she tripped on both the uneven sidewalk and a black mat, but the precise location of the mat is disputed. As a result of her fall, Wise suffered a bloody nose, concussion, torn right bicep tendon, severe bruising, and an aggravation of a prior rotator-cuff repair to her right arm. She claims resulting pain, headaches, vision problems, and insomnia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Wises sued Stonebridge in August 2016, claiming negligence and loss of consortium.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stonebridge moved for summary\n   judgment, arguing that the Wises' claims fail because Stonebridge did not have notice of the mat being in a dangerous position on the sidewalk, and, in the alternative, that the uneven sidewalk constituted an open-and-obvious condition, for which Stonebridge did not owe the Wises a duty to warn. The Wises opposed Stonebridge's motion, arguing that Stonebridge had an unwaivable duty, under statute and common law, to repair and maintain the common areas of the premises and that this duty superseded any open-and-obvious determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court granted Stonebridge's motion for summary judgment on the sole basis that the uneven sidewalk presented an open-and-obvious condition. In the same order, the district court denied as moot the parties' other pretrial motions. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.

Stat. \u00a7 504B.161, subd. 1(a), by failing to repair the uneven sidewalk and failing to maintain the front entrance of the Graham Place Apartments, a common area on the premises. In effect, the Wises ask us to recognize a new statutory negligence cause of action. But it is not the function of this court to create new causes of action.\n   <em>\n    Stubbs v. N. Mem'l Med.

App. 1989),\n   <em>\n    review denied\n   </em>\n   (Minn. Jan. 12, 1990). Given the supreme court's instruction on the legislative intent of the covenants of habitability in Minn. Stat. \u00a7 504B.161, subd. 1(a), and the limited permitted methods of enforcing them, we hold that the covenants of habitability do not support a negligence cause of action by a tenant against a landlord for breach of its duty to repair and maintain the common areas of the leased premises. As a result, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Stonebridge on the Wises' claim of negligence under Minn.

App. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because Wise's accident occurred at the front entrance of the Graham Place Apartments, a common area used by all tenants and under Stonebridge's control, the Wises contend that the common-area exception applies. We agree. When a landlord retains control over a common area of the leased premises, the landlord has a duty to ensure that it constructs and maintains the area in a reasonably safe condition.\n   <em>\n    Nubbe v. Hardy Cont'l Hotel Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"380339\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/225/496/\">\n    225 Minn. 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20N.W.2d%20332\">\n    31 N.W.2d 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 334 (1948). This duty requires the landlord to inspect the condition of the common area at reasonable intervals, and not to wait until someone has injured themselves as a result of a dangerous condition that a reasonable inspection would have revealed.\n   <em>\n    Geislinger v. Vill. of Watkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"344097\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/269/116/\">\n    269 Minn. 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"344097\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/minn/269/116/\">\n    130 N.W.2d 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68 (1964).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Wises, Stonebridge's current maintenance supervisor testified that the uneven sidewalk had existed for \"some time\" before Stonebridge repaired it. He said that he had actual knowledge of the uneven sidewalk for \"possibly\" more than two months but not more than six months before Wise's accident. The Wises' daughter's testified that she observed the uneven sidewalk in the six months before Wise's accident and considered it to be a trip hazard. Because sufficient evidence exists in the record to raise a genuine issue of material fact about whether Stonebridge breached its common-law duty to repair and maintain the common areas of the leased premises, we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment and in declining to consider the Wises' claim that Stonebridge had a common law duty to repair and maintain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The district court erred in granting summary judgment based on its determination that Stonebridge did not owe the Wises a duty to warn of the uneven sidewalk because it constituted an open-and-obvious condition.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Wises argue that the district court erred in applying the open-and-obvious exception to Stonebridge's duty to warn of\n   dangerous conditions because the uneven sidewalk was not visible to Wise. While the Wises' argument about the open-and-obvious exception fails based solely on Wise's testimony, we conclude that the district court erred by failing to resolve any doubts or factual inconsistencies in favor of the Wises, as the nonmoving parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A landlord's duty to warn tenants applies only to hidden, dangerous conditions.\n   <em>\n    Oakland v.

When determining whether a dangerous condition is open and obvious, courts use an objective determination: \"the question is not whether the injured party actually saw the danger, but whether it was in fact visible.\"\n   <em>\n    Louis v. Louis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9465622\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/636/314/#p321\">\n    636 N.W.2d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 321 (Minn. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Wises contend that Wise's testimony that she did not see the uneven sidewalk - albeit because she did not look down - supports the finding that the uneven sidewalk was not open and obvious. The district court found that the mat covered the uneven sidewalk and that Wise tripped on both the mat and the concrete. The district court ultimately determined that Stonebridge did not have a duty to warn the Wises, based on the testimony of several witnesses who claimed that the uneven sidewalk was open and obvious. Both analyses are erroneous. The Wises' argument focuses solely on Wise's subjective observation when the open-and-obvious analysis requires an objective determination, and the district court's analysis fails to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Wises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The record contains inconsistent testimony about the extent to which the mat may have concealed the uneven sidewalk. Wise testified that the mat covered \"a lot of lips\" in the concrete and she could remember and depict the location of the mat on the day of her accident. But she later testified that, as she approached the front entrance, she \"wasn't even looking for the mat.\" A former Stonebridge employee testified that he observed the uneven sidewalk to be under the mat, at the edge near the front entrance. Yet he also testified that he observed the raised part of the sidewalk as \"coming out on either side\" of the mat. Wise testified that when she fell her face was above the mat, the middle of her body was on the mat, and her feet were below the mat on the concrete. The inconsistencies surrounding the precise placement and the role of the mat in Wise's accident present a genuine issue of material fact on whether the uneven sidewalk constituted a hidden danger or an open-and-obvious condition, and renders this case ill-suited for summary judgment. While the Wises' challenge to the objective standard of the open-and-obvious determination fails, the inconsistencies surrounding the exact placement of the mat should have been resolved in favor of the Wises, as the nonmoving parties, and precluded the district court's grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Based on the supreme court's interpretation of the covenants of habitability under Minn.

We affirm the portion of the district court's grant of summary judgment to Stonebridge on the Wises' negligence claim based on violation of the covenants of habitability, reverse the district court's grant\n   of summary judgment to Stonebridge on the remainder of the Wises' claims, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The Wises moved to amend their complaint to add claims for punitive damages and negligence per se.

Therefore, we decline to address both issues.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The Wises raise two additional issues in their brief.
