Stat. \u00a7 62Q.75, subd. 3, did not bar respondent's no-fault claim. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 27, 2014, Nichols was injured in a motor-vehicle accident and transported to North Memorial Hospital (North Memorial), where she received treatment in the emergency department. At the time of the accident, Nichols was insured by a no-fault insurance policy with State Farm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In January 2015, Nichols applied for no-fault benefits under the State Farm policy. Shortly thereafter, North Memorial submitted a $2,753.20 invoice to State Farm for Nichols's November emergency-room visit. State Farm paid the invoice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From April 2015 through December 2015, Nichols received several additional treatments at North Memorial. The charges for these treatments were not submitted to State Farm. Instead, North Memorial submitted them to Nichols's health insurer, UCare. North Memorial submitted each charge to UCare within six months of treatment, and UCare paid each charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In July 2016, Nichols filed a petition for no-fault arbitration, seeking an award of $10,000 from State Farm for the health-care expenses incurred for her 2015 treatments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For reasons not germane to this appeal, Nichols filed a subsequent arbitration petition in February 2017 seeking an award for the same 2015 treatments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following a hearing, the arbitrator awarded Nichols $10,000 in economic-loss benefits for her medical expenses. State Farm filed a motion with the district court to vacate the arbitration award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court denied the motion, concluding that Minn. Stat. \u00a7 62Q.75, subd. 3, unambiguously requires a health-care provider to submit its charges to a health-plan company within six months of treatment. Because, the district court ruled, North Memorial submitted its charges to UCare within six months, North Memorial complied with the statute. The district court affirmed the arbitrator's decision and this appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Did the district court err in concluding that the insured was entitled to economic-loss benefits because her medical provider complied with the requirements of Minn. Stat. \u00a7 62Q.75, subd. 3 ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   State Farm argues that the district court erred by declining to vacate Nichols's no-fault arbitration award.

Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 65B.41 -.71 (2018), requires no-fault insurers to provide benefits for \"[b]asic economic loss\" from injuries \"arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 65B.44, subd. 1(a). These economic-loss benefits, which include medical expenses, are payable as loss accrues. Minn.

Stat. \u00a7 62Q.75, subd. 3 ( subdivision 3 ), bars Nichols's no-fault claim because the statute requires North Memorial to submit its charges to State Farm within six months and North Memorial failed to do so. Nichols contends that the statute unambiguously requires North Memorial to submit its charges to an insurer within six months and that by submitting its charges to UCare within six months, North Memorial complied with the statute.

By State Farm's interpretation, a health-care provider is required to submit its charges to the responsible health-plan company within six months of service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We disagree. As we noted above, subdivision 3 is clear and unambiguous. Rather than modifying the phrase \"a health plan company,\" the phrase \"the responsible health plan company\" relates only to the alternative timeline which may extend the six months from the \"date of service\" to six months from \"the date the health care provider knew or was informed of the correct name and address of the responsible health plan company or third-party administrator, whichever is later.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 62Q.75, subd. 3. Put another way, the unambiguously stated sole obligation for health-care providers by this statutory language is to submit their charges to\n   <em>\n    a health plan company\n   </em>\n   . The unambiguously stated timeline for this submission is either six months from the date of service or six months from the date the health-care provider knew or was informed of the correct name of the responsible health-plan company, whichever is later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Furthermore, State Farm's interpretation fails to give effect to the phrase \"a health plan company,\" and we may not deem any word or phrase \"superfluous, void, or insignificant.\"\n   <em>\n    Schroedl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243447\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/616/273/#p277\">\n    616 N.W.2d at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, State Farm's interpretation eliminates the phrase \"a health plan company\" from the statute. We conclude that the statute unambiguously allows a health-care provider to comply with subdivision 3 by submitting its charges to\n   \"a health plan company\" within six months of service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   State Farm contends that this is an absurd result-the legislature would not require a health-care provider to submit charges to health-plan companies it knew were not responsible for the charges. Because subdivision 3 is clear and unambiguous, we need not reach an absurd-result analysis. As we have noted above, the rule of statutory construction concerning absurdity applies to unambiguous statutes only where the statute's \"plain meaning utterly confounds the clear legislative purpose of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Schatz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7071281\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/811/643/#p651\">\n    811 N.W.2d at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). Minn. Stat. \u00a7 62Q.75 (2018) is a prompt payment statute. \"[T]he general purpose underlying prompt-payment statutes is to prescribe a designated time period for health insurers to pay valid claims in order to facilitate timely payment to health-care providers.\"\n   <em>\n    Nguyen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12337967\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/902/645/#p651\">\n    902 N.W.2d at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
