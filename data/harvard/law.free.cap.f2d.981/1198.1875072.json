Later, Hobbs violated the terms of his probation. After a hearing, the district court resen-tenced Hobbs to six months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by a two-year term of supervised release. Hobbs appeals, arguing that the district court had no authority to include a supervised release period after the revocation of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-9\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a)(2), if a defendant violates a probation condition, the district court may revoke probation and \u201cimpose any other sentence that was available under subchapter A [18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3551-59] at the time of the initial sentencing.\u201d In turn, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551(b)(3) provides that a defendant may be sentenced to \u201ca term of imprisonment as authorized by subchapter D [\u00a7\u00a7 3581-86].\u201d And Subchapter D, \u00a7 3583(a) says that the court \u201cmay include as part of the sentence a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment.\u201d So, district courts are authorized to impose a period of supervised release as a consequence of probation revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
