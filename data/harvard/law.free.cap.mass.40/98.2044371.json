The defendant objected to the admission of such evidence ; but the court overruled the objection. The plaintiff then introduced as a witness, John J. Loring, who testified that the plaintiff, before the note was made, and after he was of age, had frequently performed services for his father, at his request, and had often let him have money, and that he never knew the father to repay the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-6\">Other witnesses testified as to declarations of the father in relation to the transaction in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-7\">It was left to the jury, to find whether there was any thing due to the son from the father, at the date of the note, and if so, v'hether it formed a part of the consideration of the note.

The doctrines of the case of <em>Parish </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>14 Pick. 198, apply directly to the count on the promissory note. The subject was there fully examined and deliberately considered ; and we have no doubt of the soundness of the principles there laid down. They are decisive of this question. A note given for the purpose of settling the promisor\u2019s estate, or of equalizing its distribution after his decease, and without other consideration, is <em>nudum, pactum. </em>But if the promise be founded upon two distinct considerations, the one of which is valid and the other invalid, the promise may be apportioned, and holden to be binding in part and void in part. As far as the note is supported by a good consideration, it may be enforced, and as far as the consideration fails, repudiated, and the holder recover <em>pro tanto. </em>When the note is given for two distinct considerations, liquidated by the parties, there can be no difficulty in making the apportionment. But when there are two or more considerations, which combined together, move the promisor to make the note, some of which are valid and others invalid, it is not easy to determine how much of the promise was founded upon a good consideration, and how much upon a gratuitous one. But if in this respect perfect accuracy cannot be attained, the Court will, as in many other cases, resort to the near est practical approximation to it. And this must be done by referring it to the jury, to determine how much of the promise was founded on a valid consideration, and how much on a gratuity. See <em>Parish </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>14 Pick. 198, and the cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">In this case it was left to the jury to find if thei e was any thing due to the plaintiff at the date of the note, and if so, whether it formed a part of the consideration of the note. It is probable that- this report, which was drawn up and agreed upon by the counsel, is, in some respects, imperfect and defective. But we must form our opinion upon it as it stands. The instruction presents for the consideration of the jury the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>two questions above stated ; but does not ask their judgment upon the amount of the legal consideration, and leaves a very strong implication, that if they found these two points for the plaintiff, they were sufficient to support the contract. We cannot be satisfied from the report, that the jury intended to find that the <em>amount </em>due to the plaintiff was equal to the whole consideration of the note. But if they did, we are well satisfied that their finding was not only unsupported by, but directly opposed to, all the evidence in the case. The note, the receipt, the will, the promisor\u2019s account of the matter as proved by the parol evidence, all show irresistibly, that either a part or the whole of the consideration which moved the parties to make this contract, was the settlement or distribution of the testator\u2019s estate, and not the payment of a preexisting debt. We are, therefore, of opinion, that the verdict cannot be sustained upon the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">But the plaintiff\u2019s writ contains counts upon a legacy as well as the note, and it was agreed by the parties, that if there was a legacy in the will to.the plaintiff, he should recover on these counts. By this agreement the Court may render judgment on the verdict, provided, upon a true construction of the will, the plaintiff is entitled to a legacy of a thousand dollars, the amount claimed upon the note and the legacy and the time of the payment of both, being the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The will was written by the testator, who, from the instrument itself, appears to have been an illiterate man; and it certainly is very inartificially drawn. There are no instruments more frequently written by unpractised hands, or in which less formality or precision is required, than wills. In whatever language they may be couched or however incorrectly and bunglingly drawn, if they are duly executed and the intention of the testator can be ascertained, they are valid and effectual to pass property of any kind or amount. Great allowance should be made for the ignorance of testators and the incorrectness of the language used by them. Uneducated men may make wills as well as others. If, upon the inspection of the whole instrument, duly regarding the situation and intelligence of the testator, his intentions can be satisfactorily ascertained, they must be carried into execution. <em>Richardson </em>v. Noyes, 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Mass. R. 58 ; <em>Baddeley </em>v. <em>Leppingwell, </em>3 Burr. 1541 ; <em>Frogmorton </em>v. <em>Holyday, Ibid. </em>1625. It is the expressed intention or volition of the testator in relation to the <em>post mortem </em>disposition of his property, which constitutes a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The testator, after several other legacies, uses these words. \u201cI have given to my son, Nathaniel Loring junior, one thousand dollars, by note, for his full part of my estate.\u201d The note before referred to, was made before the will, and was then in existence. If the above language, however ill chosen, or inappropriate to the object, is satisfactory evidence of the intention of the testator, that the amount of the note should be paid out of his estate, to the plaintiff, it is a valid legacy. <em>Thellusson </em>v. Woodford, 11 Ves. 148. Now, although it may not be easy to form arguments upon the literal construction of such language, or to draw inferences from the grammatical structure of the sentences, yet we think no intelligent person can read this clause without at once learning from it, that the testator intended to declare his volition or determination that his executor should pay this note.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Subsequent clauses in the will have some tendency to con firm this construction. The testator says : \u201c I also order my executor to pay all the legacies above named, in one year after my death.\u201d And again, in conclusion, he says, I \u201csee fit to dispose of my estate as mentioned in the above will,\u201d viz., as we understand it, that among other things one thousand dollars be paid to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">There is no doubt that a valid bequest or devise may be made by reference to objects and documents, not incorporated in or annexed to the will. Powell on Dev. 22, 50, and cases, cited; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>12 Johns. R. 390; <em>Habersham </em>v. Vincent, 2 Ves. jun. 228. A person may, by his will, revive a note barred by the statute of limitations, or give effect to an invalid instrument. There are several cases to this effect in Vesey\u2019s Reports. <em>I will that a certain note be paid, </em>or <em>that a certain promise be performed, </em>would be a valid legacy of the amount of the note or of the thing promised to be done, although the note or promise were invalid. It seems to us, that the language of this will is equivalent to saying, <em>I will that this note of one thousand dollars, given to Nathaniel Loring </em>junior, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>be paid. </em>And we can entertain no doubt that such would be a valid legacy. See <em>Bibin </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>Ambl. 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">There is every reason to suppose, that the testator believed that the note given by him to his son was obligatory, and that the receipt or discharge given by the son was a binding acquittance of all claims which he might have as an heir of his father. In this state of things, the testator could have no motive to mention this son or this transaction, but to recognize and give effect to this arrangement, and to express his desire and determine\u2022 tion, that the money mentioned in it should be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The language used in the will, is only the evidence of the intention of the testator; and however incorrect, imperfect, or ungrammatical the language may be, as far as it furnishes satisfactory evidence of the testator\u2019s intention, that must prevail. And for the purpose of carrying into effect this intention, the Court will supply or reject particular words, or substitute one word for another. <em>Brownswood </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>2 Ves. sen. 248. Thus, in almost innumerable cases, <em>or </em>has been substituted for <em>and, </em>and <em>and </em>for <em>or. </em>Sometimes, even negative words are substituted for affirmative ones, and <em>vice versa. Maberly </em>v. <em>Strode, </em>3 Ves. 450 ; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Phyn, </em>7 Ves. 458. So words in the <em>past </em>are changed to those in the <em>future, </em>and the reverse. I recollect the case of a German, in London, with a very imperfect knowledge of the English language, who wrote his own will, and made sad work with the grammar of the language; yet the court, being satisfied that they understood his meaning, carried into effect his intention as fully as if the will had been written in good English. <em>Wilde </em>v. <em>Holtzmeyer, </em>5 Ves. 810. There is also a case in Vesey, where the court went a great way, in changing a particular phrase, to execute the general intention of the testator. The father bequeathed to his daughter \u00a3 3500, which, he added, with \u00a3 6000 she was entitled to by his marriage settlement, and \u00a3 500 given to her by her grandfather, would make her portion \u00a3 10,000. It turned out that the sum in the marriage settlement was \u00a3 5000, instead of \u00a3 6000 as named in the will, and that to make the daughter\u2019s portion \u00a3 10,000, would require \u00a3 4500. The court being satisfied that the leading intention was to make up the portion to \u00a3 10,000, held, that the will gave a legacy of \u00a3 4500, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>stead of the <em>\u00a3 </em>3500 expressly named. <em>Clark </em>v. Guise, 2 Ves. sen. 617. See <em>Milner </em>v. Milner, <em>1 </em>Ves. sen. 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">In the, case before us the testator says, <em>I give to my son </em>Daniel, $ 150, <em>as I have given him a liberal education. </em>Now if the father had taken notes of this son, for the money advanced for his education, it can hardly be doubted, that this would be a remission of the notes or a legacy to the amount of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Now, although we cannot doubt that the testator supposed that this note was obligatory, and that it was unnecessary to make a testamentary provision for the plaintiff, yet, upon the whole, the testator, by his will, also manifested an intention or determination, that the amount should be paid out of his estate. And although the testator might not suppose that there would be a necessity to resort to his will to enforce it, yet we can see no good reason why this determination thus manifested should not be carried into execution. We are therefore of opinion, that this is a valid legacy to the plaintiff for $ 1000, pay \u00abole at the same time with the note. The verdict being for the exact amount due on the legacy and being a general verdict on all the counts, though doubtless founded on the note, is well sustained by the legacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
