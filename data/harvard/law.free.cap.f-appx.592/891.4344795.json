They first assert the district court erred by denying their motion to remand the case to state court, because the district court lacked jurisdiction over their claims and over any action involving a national bank. Alternatively, they contend the district court erred by dismissing their complaint, which arose out of the foreclosure of their home loans, because the claims were barred by <em>res judicata. </em>After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ac9\">\n<em>A. Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The Hayeses argue that, pursuant' to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349, the district court lacked jurisdiction over Mellon, a national bank that is incorporated and operates under the laws of the United States. Additionally, they contend that, although they cited federal statutes, the district court did not have federal question jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441, a defendant may remove a claim to federal court \u201cif the ease could have been filed in federal court originally.\u201d <em>Hill v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., </em>364 F.3d 1308, 1314 (11th Cir.2004). District courts have \u201cfederal question jurisdiction over \u2018all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331). A claim \u201carises under\u201d federal law when \u201cthe face of the plaintiffs properly pleaded complaint\u201d presents a federal question. <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). A district court may also exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims that form part of the federal \u201ccase or controversy,\u201d or, more specifically, \u201carise out of a common nucleus of operative fact with a substantial federal claim.\u201d <em>Parker v. Scrap Metal Processors, Inc., </em>468 F.3d 733, 742-43 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. Additionally, \u201c[t]he district courts shall not have jurisdiction of any civil action by or against any corporation upon the ground that it was incorporated by or under an Act of Congress, unless the United States is the owner of more than one-half of its capital stock.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">The district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the Hayes\u2019s complaint. The complaint alleged violations of several federal statutes, including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692, <em>et seq., </em>Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(e), and Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1641. The court could also exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the accompanying state law claims, since both the state and federal claims were based on the same allegations regarding the Hayes\u2019s Adjustable Rate Mortgage. Further, \u00a7 1349 did not preclude removal of the case to federal court, because the defendants at no time alleged the sole basis for federal jurisdiction was a company\u2019s \u201cincorporation by or under an Act of Congress.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349. Instead, they correctly argued the district court had jurisdiction over the various claims in the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1367, 1441. Therefore, the defendants properly removed the case to federal court. <em>Parker, </em>468 F.3d at 742-43; <em>Hill, </em>364 F.3d at 1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">\n<em>B. Dismissal of Complaint</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">The Hayeses also contend the district court erred by finding their claims were barred by <em>res judicata. </em>They contend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>district court lacked jurisdiction to enter a final order in their previous lawsuit, and, accordingly, no valid judgment precluded the claims presented in the current complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">\u201cWhen an appellant fails to challenge properly on appeal one of the grounds on which the district court based its judgment, [they are] deemed to have abandoned any challenge of that ground, and it follows that the judgment is due to be affirmed.\u201d <em>Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 680 (11th Cir.2014) (citing <em>Little v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., </em>691 F.3d 1302, 1306 (11th Cir.2012)). \u201cA party fails to adequately brief a claim when he does not plainly and prominently raise it, for instance by devoting a discrete section of his argument to those claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681 (quotations omitted). Additionally, a \u25a0 party can abandon a claim by only making passing references to it in the \u201cstatement of the case\u201d or \u201csummary of the argument\u201d section. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">In its order, the district court dismissed the Hayes\u2019s complaint for the reasons indicated in the magistrate judge\u2019s report, namely that it failed to state a cognizable claim, and the magistrate judge\u2019s report did not mention <em>res judicata. </em>Accordingly, we need not address whether the district court erred by finding that the claims were also barred by <em>res judicata, </em>because it dismissed the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), which the Hayeses do not challenge on appeal. As such, they have abandoned any challenge to the dismissal of their complaint by failing to challenge each basis for its dismissal. <em>Sapuppo, </em>739 F.3d at 680. Thus, we affirm the dismissal of the Hayes\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-7\">.
