Underlying this motion is Boykin\u2019s conviction on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and the resulting sentence, which was the product of an Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) enhancement, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), and predicated on three prior felonies. Boykin filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence in February 2002, which the district court denied with prejudice. Boykin filed a second \u00a7 2255 motion in December 2003, in which he explained that his conviction for one of the three prior felonies had been vacated in October 2002 and that he was now entitled to resentencing without the ACCA enhancement. The district court dismissed Boykin\u2019s second \u00a7 2255 motion as successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">In August 2005, Boykin filed a \u201cmotion to secure jurisdiction,\u201d pursuant to Article III of the U.S. Constitution and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, and again argued that he should be resenteneed without the ACCA enhancement. The district court construed Boykin\u2019s motion as one seeking \u00a7 2255 relief or, in the alternative, relief under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, and denied the motion. The district court noted that while the state court vacated Boykin\u2019s pri- or conviction on October 4, 2002, Boykin did not file his second \u00a7 2255 motion until December 10, 2003, over two months past the one-year filing deadline. Thus, the district court found that Boykin did not meet the requirements for relief under \u00a7 2255 because his December 2003 second \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely. The district court further concluded that, to the extent that Boykin sought relief under \u00a7 2241, such relief was barred because he had not satisfied any of the requirements of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Boykin filed several other postconviction motions, and in April 2013, filed the instant, and his third, \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. He argued that the district court erred in determining that his second \u00a7 2255 motion was second or successive when the grounds that he asserted for challenging his sentence did not exist when filed his first motion to vacate in 2002. The district court dismissed Boykin\u2019s third \u00a7 2255 motion as successive. In this appeal, Boyle addresses the question presented in the certificate of appealability granted by this Court: \u201cWhether the district court erred in dismissing as successive Boykin\u2019s numerically third 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence, in light of <em>Stewart v. United States, </em>646 F.3d 856 (11th Cir.2011).\u201d After careful review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2255 motion as second or successive. <em>McIver v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 1327, 1329 (11th Cir.2002). Pursuant to \u00a7 2255, a federal prisoner claiming the right to be released on the grounds that his sentence was imposed in violation of federal law or the Constitution, the court lacked jurisdiction to impose sentence, his sentence is beyond the maximum authorized by law, or his sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack, \u201cmay move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside[,] or correct the sentence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). If the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>determines that relief is warranted, it must vacate and set aside the judgment and discharge or resentence the prisoner, or grant a new trial or correct the sentence, if appropriate. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2255(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) provides for a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion, which begins to run following the latest of four possible events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-6\">(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\">(2) the date on which the impediment to making a [\u00a7 2255] motion created by governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevent from making a motion by such governmental action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-9\">(8) the date on.which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-10\">(4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2255(f). The Supreme Court has held that a state court vacatur is a matter of fact that refreshes the one-year statute of limitations period, as long as the petitioner has shown due diligence in seeking the vacatur order. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 295, 302, 125 S.Ct. 1571, 161 L.Ed.2d 542 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">Before a prisoner may file a second or successive motion to vacate, he must first obtain an order from this Court authorizing the district court to consider the motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h). Without our authorization, the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. <em>United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">In <em>Stewart, </em>we held that a numerically second \u00a7 2255 motion may not be \u201csecond or successive\u201d under AEDPA. <em>See Stewart, </em>646 F.3d at 857; <em>see also Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 486, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (explaining that the phrase \u201csecond or successive,\u201d as used in AEDPA, is a term of art). The <em>Stewart </em>prisoner had filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion, and had then successfully challenged the state convictions that were predicate convictions for his career offender sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 857-58. One month after his state convictions were vacated, he filed a second-in-time \u00a7 2255 motion, and requested vacatur of the career offender enhancement pursuant to <em>Johnson. See id. </em>at 858. The district court dismissed the second-in-time \u00a7 2255 motion as successive, but we explained, in reversing, that the basis for the second-in-time \u00a7 2255 motion \u2014 vacatur of the predicate state convictions \u2014 did not exist at the time of the prisoner\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 motion, and thus the numerically second motion was not \u201csecond or successive\u201d within the meaning of AEDPA. <em>Id. </em>at 863-65. We also said that the prisoner had acted diligently in pursuing the vacatur and in bringing a subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion raising a claim, under <em>Johnson, </em>that the statute of limitations for bringing his claim had been refreshed. <em>Id. </em>at 863-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">We applied the <em>Stewart </em>holding in <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>754 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir.2014). In <em>Boyd, </em>the petitioner, whose sentence was enhanced pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 based on two prior state convictions, filed an initial \u00a7 2255 motion in which he did not argue the validity of those state convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 1300. His convictions were later vacated, and the petitioner requested to be resentenced in his second and third \u00a7 2255 motions, which were dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>missed as successive. <em>Id. </em>After his fourth \u00a7 2255 motion, in which he raised the same claim, was also dismissed as successive, we held that, under <em>Stewart, </em>the petitioner\u2019s initial \u00a7 2255 motion did not render his fourth \u00a7 2255 motion successive because the grounds for the fourth \u00a7 2255 motion \u2014 the vacatur of his state conviction \u2014 did not exist at the time of the initial \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1300-02. We also explained that the petitioner\u2019s second and third \u00a7 2255 motions did not render his fourth \u00a7 2255 motion successive because \u201csecond or successive status only attaches to a judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1802.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Here, the district court properly dismissed Boykin\u2019s third \u00a7 2255 motion for lack of jurisdiction because it was successive. Boykin\u2019s claim was rejected on the merits in conjunction with his August 2005 motion to secure jurisdiction. <em>See Stewart, </em>646 F.3d at 863-65. In his motion to secure jurisdiction, Boykin argued that the vacatur of his state conviction entitled him to resentencing without the ACCA enhancement. The district court held that Boykin\u2019s construed \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely because, while <em>Johnson </em>refreshed the one-year statute of limitations for \u00a7 2255 motions following the vacatur of a state conviction, Boykin still filed even his earlier, second \u00a7 2255 motion too late. Thus, although <em>Stewart </em>holds that subsequent-in-time \u00a7 2255 motions are not necessarily \u201csuccessive,\u201d that fact does not help Boykin. Rather, Boykin\u2019s third \u00a7 2255 motion is in fact successive because his claim regarding the vacated state conviction was in existence when he filed his second \u00a7 2255 motion and his motion to secure jurisdiction, and the district court denied the claim on the merits as untimely. <em>See Boyd, </em>754 F.3d at 1302; <em>Stewart, </em>646 F.3d at 863-65. Because Boykin did not obtain our authorization before filing his third \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court properly found that it lacked jurisdiction over the action and dismissed it. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-8\">.
