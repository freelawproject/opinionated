United States, </em>258 Fed.Appx. 696, 696 (5th Cir.2007) (noting that Morris \u201cwas released from Bureau of Prisons custody in July 2004 and completed her concurrent, three-year terms of supervised release during the pendency of this appeal\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Scruggs, </em>691 F.3d 660, 662 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2012) (stating that the movant was \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2255 because he was serving a term of supervised release). Although incarcerated in state prison on apr parently different charges, Morris is no longer serving her federal sentence, nor was she serving her sentence or term of supervised release when she filed her motion. Because she is not in custody under the federal sentence or under any restriction related to that sentence, the proper vehicle for her claims would be to seek the extraordinary remedy of <em>coram nobis. See United States v. Esogbue, </em>357 F.3d 532, 534-35 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Nevertheless, the district court\u2019s alternative basis for denying relief remains unchallenged on appeal. To satisfy the requirements for seeking a writ of <em>coram nobis, </em>the movant must present a \u201csound reason\u201d for \u201cthe failure to seek appropriate earlier relief.\u201d <em>United States v. Dyer, </em>136 F.3d 417, 422 (5th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>346 U.S. 502, 512, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954)). Because Morris has not briefed that issue, she has waived it. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993) (holding that even pro se litigants must brief arguments to preserve them).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Because Morris has presented a meritorious issue \u2014 that she is no longer \u201cin custody\u201d \u2014 her appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits, so leave to proceed IFP is GRANTED. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). The order denying the request for a writ of <em>coram nobis </em>is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
