INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b297-20\">Plaintiff-Appellant Robert McGuire, Jr. waited in jail for nearly a year for a trial that never came; the district - attorney eventually dropped the case. About a year after his release, McGuire sued five law-enforcement officers and the district attorney (collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d) for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In his pro se complaint, McGuire alleges that the district attorney and law enforcement arrested him based on spurious \u201chearsay evidence\u201d to induce him to provide information on an acquaintance of his who was the target of an ongoing drug investiga-, tion. McGuire asserts that his arrest and detention were unlawful and that Defendants thereby deprived him of his constitutional rights. The district court granted summary judgment against McGuire because his \u00a7 1983 claims were time-barred. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-21\">II. JURISDICTION, STANDARD OF REVIEW, AND APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b297-22\">The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and this Court has jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment on a time-barred claim. <em>In re Hinsley, </em>201 F.3d 638, 644 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>We apply federal and state law to determine whether the \u00a7 1983 limitations period has run. <em>See Bourdais v. New Orleans City, </em>485 F.3d 294, 298 (5th Cir.2007). The question of when a \u00a7 1983 cause of action first accrues \u201cis a question of federal law.\u201d <em>Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 388, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007). The limitations period for \u00a7 1983 claims in federal court is governed by state law, and we apply the limitations period that \u201cthe state would apply in an analogous action in its courts.\u201d <em>Bourdais, </em>485 F.3d at 298. Accordingly, because the operation of a state\u2019s limitations period \u201cis understood fully only in [its] context,\u201d the Supreme Court instructs federal courts to also borrow the state\u2019s rules with respect to tolling. <em>Bd. of Regents of Univ. of State of N.Y. v. Tomanio, </em>446 U.S. 478, 485-86, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980) (quoting <em>Johnson v. Ry. Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 463-64, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The issue on appeal is whether McGuire\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims are time-barred. Under applicable Louisiana law and Fifth Circuit precedent, the limitations period for McGuire\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims is one year. <em>See Bourdais, </em>485 F.3d at 294 (citing La.Civ.Code art. 3492).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">A.The District Court\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The district court liberally construed McGuire\u2019s pro se complaint to allege an injury in the form of an \u201cunlawful arrest and incarceration.\u201d Quoting <em>Edmonds v. Oktibbeha County, Mississippi, </em>675 F.3d 911, 916 (5th Cir.2012), the district court concluded that the limitations period started running when McGuire was arrested because the \u201cstatute of limitations under \u00a7 1983 begins to run the moment the plaintiff becomes aware that he has suffered an injury.\u201d McGuire was arrested on November 4, 2011, and incarcerated on November 9, 2011. \u201cThus,\u201d the district court found that \u201cthe injuries at issue were sustained nearly two years before suit was filed, well outside the one-year limitation.\u201d In the alternative, the district court noted that McGuire was released on October 3, 2012, making his complaint \u201ctendered for filing on October 7, 2013,\u201d \u201cuntimely\u201d even if the limitations period did not start to run until he was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">B. The Parties\u2019 Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">On appeal, McGuire takes issue with this last point. McGuire asserts that he \u201cfiled his claim on October 3, 2013.\u201d Indeed, McGuire\u2019s pro se complaint is dated October 3, 2013, but it is postmarked October 4, 2013, and stamped as filed with the clerk\u2019s office on October 7, 2013. McGuire argues the district court improperly resolved this factual dispute against him on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">The Defendants counter that McGuire \u201cknew that he had suffered an injury and/or had sufficient information to know that he had been injured\u201d when he was arrested in 2011, because he \u201cimmediately began to assert he was innocent of the charges.\u201d Thus, Defendants argue that McGuire\u2019s October 2013 complaint was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">The district court erred when it concluded that McGuire\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims \u201caccrued\u201d and that the limitations period started to run as soon as McGuire was arrested. In <em>Wallace v. Kato, </em>the Supreme Court distinguished the circumstance in which a suspect is unlawfully arrested <em>without </em>a warrant, from the circumstances in this case, in which McGuire was allegedly unlawfully arrested under a warrant for his arrest. <em>See </em>549 U.S. at 388-89, 127 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>1091. If a suspect is unlawfully arrested under a warrant, the Court held that the limitations period begins to run when the suspect\u2019s \u201cfalse imprisonment e[omes] to an end,\u201d which occurs when the suspect \u201cappear[s] before the examining magistrate and [is] bound over for trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 127 S.Ct. 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Therefore, even assuming, as McGuire asserts, that the complaint was filed on October 3, 2013, McGuire\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim is time-barred. McGuire was arraigned before a magistrate on November 9, 2011, more than one year before he filed his complaint. The limitations period began much earlier than his release from detention, as the Supreme Court made clear in <em>Wallace v. Kato. See </em>549 U.S. at 390, 127 S.Ct. 1091 (\u201cpetitioner\u2019s contention that his false imprisonment ended upon his release from custody, after the State dropped the charges against him, must be rejected.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Moreover, Louisiana law does not toll the limitations period for McGuire\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims for the time that he was in prison. Louisiana\u2019s civil law system\u2019s limitations period is called \u201cprescription,\u201d and the only potentially applicable exception to prescription is \u201csuspension\u201d of the prescription period under the doctrine <em>contra non valentem, </em>which provides that a prescription period does not run against one who is unable to act. <em>Jackson v. Jefferson Parish Clerk of Court, </em>No. 07-963, at 4-5 (La.App. 5 Cir. 4/15/08); 981 So.2d 156, 159-60 (La.Ct.App.), <em>writ denied, </em>2008-1150 (La. 10/31/08); 993 So.2d 219. \u201cThe doctrine of <em>contra non valentem </em>applies only in exceptional circumstances, and must be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, 981 So.2d 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">In <em>Jackson, </em>a Louisiana intermediate appellate court squarely rejected the argument that imprisonment \u201csuspends\u201d the prescription period under the doctrine of <em>contra non valentem:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\"><em>[CJontra non valentem </em>is not applicable. The fact that [the Plaintiff] waited until he was released to obtain counsel to investigate the matter does not fall into any of the exceptions to the running of prescription. Most importantly, the Plaintiff knew of his cause of action, or the cause of action was reasonably knowable, when he was erroneously sent back to prison for violating his parole due to a non-existent conviction.... Thus, we find that the trial judge did not err in granting the peremptory exception of prescription.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 7, 981 So.2d 156.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, <em>Jackson </em>forecloses the possibility that <em>contra non valentem </em>suspends or tolls the prescription period for McGuire's \u00a7 1983 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">In sum, McGuire could have filed suit under \u00a7 1983 as soon as he was allegedly unlawfully arrested in November 2011, <em>see Wallace, </em>549 U.S. at 388, 127 S.Ct. 1091, and the limitations period started to run when he was arraigned before the magistrate on November 9, 2011, <em>see id. </em>at 391, 127 S.Ct. 1091. Because McGuire filed suit after November 9, 2012 (at the earliest on October 3, 2013), his delay\u2014under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>standable though it may be \u2014 dooms his \u00a7 1983 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AKq\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\">. Notably, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied the writ of review in <em>Jackson </em>over a dissent that pointed out the injustice of this rule. <em>Jackson v. Jefferson Parish Clerk of Court, </em>No. 2008-1150, at 2 (La. 10/31/08), 993 So.2d 219, 219-20 (Johnson, J., dissenting) (\"I find the result reached by the lower courts to be unjust. Plaintiff was imprisoned without a judgment of the trial court and left with no recourse. Plaintiff was imprisoned with limited access to resources or legal represen-tation_ Thus, I would hold that the doctrine of <em>contra non valentem </em>applies in this case to suspend the running of prescription.\u201d). No subsequent Louisiana case has revisited this issue, and we are powerless to adopt a rule contrary to Louisiana case law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
