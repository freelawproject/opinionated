Normally, the statutory maximum for that offense is ten years in prison. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 924(a)(2). But the indictment provided notice of the government\u2019s intent to seek enhanced penalties under \u00a7 924(e) of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 924(e). That statutory enhancement subjects defendants to a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 924(d)(1). The indictment listed six of King\u2019s prior Florida convictions as bases for an ACCA enhancement: a 1996 conviction, for aggravated battery on a pregnant victim; a 1997 conviction for burglary of an unoccupied structure; a 2001 conviction for possession of marijuana; two 2001 convictions for possessing cocaine with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver; and a 2001 conviction for grand theft in the third degree. King pleaded guilty in April 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>The presentence report (PSR) concluded that he qualified as an armed career criminal and thus was subject to the ACCA\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years in prison. The PSR\u2019s recitation of King\u2019s criminal history described the six offenses from the indictment, as well as several others, but it did not specify which prior convictions served as the bases for its conclusion that the ACCA enhancement applied. But King did not object to the enhancement, and at the sentence hearing the district court adopted the PSR\u2019s findings and imposed the ACCA enhancement without any discussion from the attorneys or a finding by the court identifying which of the prior convictions it was relying on to impose the enhancement. The court then sentenced King to 180 months in prison\u2014 the minimum time permitted under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">King did not challenge his sentence on direct appeal, and the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate that he filed in 2008 was dismissed as time-barred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2010 he filed the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition at issue here. The petition challenged King\u2019s sentence on the ground that his conviction under Florida Statute \u00a7 784.045(l)(b) for battery on a pregnant victim no longer qualified as a violent felony under the ACCA. King argued that the status of that prior conviction had changed as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1270, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), and an order of this Court in <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>610 F.3d 716 (11th Cir.2010).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court dismissed King\u2019s petition after concluding that it did not have jurisdiction to consider his challenge because (1) <em>Johnson </em>was not retroactively applicable and (2) circuit precedent had not prevented King from challenging the ACCA status of his battery conviction at his sentence hearing, on direct appeal, or through a timely \u00a7 2255 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision that it lacks jurisdiction over a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas petition. <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir.2013). Because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) limits the claims that may be brought in a \u00a7 2241 petition, <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1337-41, King cannot challenge his sentence unless he demonstrates that he meets all of \u201cthe five specific requirements a \u00a7 2241 petitioner must satisfy to proceed under \u00a7 2255(e),\u201d <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1257 (11th Cir.2013). Those five requirements are: (1) during the petitioner\u2019s sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, binding circuit precedent \u201cspecifically and squarely foreclosed the claim raised in the \u00a7 2241 petition\u201d; (2) after his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, that binding circuit precedent was overturned by the Supreme Court; (3) \u201cthat Supreme Court decision applies retroactively on collateral review\u201d; (4) if that Supreme Court decision is applied retroactively, the petitioner\u2019s current sentence ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>ceeds the statutory maximum; and (5) \u201cthe savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) reaches his claim.\u201d <em>Jeanty v. Warden, FCI-Miami, </em>757 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2014) (citing <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">King clearly falters on <em>Bryant\u2019s </em>fourth hurdle. That fourth requirement is met only if applying the Supreme Court decision retroactively would change the statutory maximum authorized by Congress for the petitioner\u2019s crime. <em>See id. </em>at 1286. In the context of a \u00a7 2241 petition challenging an ACCA enhancement, petitioners cannot meet that requirement unless a retroactive application of the Supreme Court decision .would result in the petitioner now having two or fewer ACCA predicates. <em>See Mackey v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>739 F.3d 657, 658-59, 662 (11th Cir.2014) (requirement met where retroactive application of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision would reduce the petitioner\u2019s ACCA predicates from four to two); <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1257-58, 1278-79 (requirement met where retroactive application of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision would reduce the petitioner\u2019s ACCA predicates from three to two).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">King\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition and his opening brief on appeal challenge the use of his 1996 conviction under Florida Statute \u00a7 784.045(l)(b) as an ACCA predicate, but they do not question the ACCA status of the other five convictions identified in the indictment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> So even if we accept the United States\u2019 concession that <em>Johnson </em>is retroactively applicable and overturns circuit precedent that squarely foreclosed King\u2019s previous ability to challenge the ACCA status of his \u00a7 784.045(1)(b) conviction, there would still be five unchallenged prior convictions serving as ACCA predicates for his enhanced sentence \u2014 two more than necessary to impose the enhancement. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). King therefore has not met <em>Bryant\u2019s </em>fourth requirement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-5\">. Kang\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion argued that his 1994 conviction for strong-arm robbery did not qualify as an ACCA predicate because he pleaded <em>nolo contendere </em>to that charge. While that conviction was listed in the PSR's account of his criminal history, it was not one of the six prior convictions identified in the indictment as the bases for the requested ACCA enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b860-8\">. The citation in King\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is to an order dealing with the parties' motions in response to the mandate being held for the panel decision in <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>609 F.3d 1159 (11th Cir.2010). <em>See Gilbert, </em>610 F.3d at 716-17. We need not concern ourselves with whether, in light of King\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status, we have to construe that citation as a reference to one of the substantive <em>Gilbert </em>decisions because, regardless of whether we do, the result of this appeal is the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b861-6\">. King dedicates the bulk of his brief to arguing that the government had the burden at the sentence hearing of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that he had three prior convictions that qualified as ACCA predicates. He is mistaken. <em>See, e.g., Descamps v. United States, </em>- U.S. -. 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2288, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013) (explaining that, for ACCA purposes, \"the fact of a prior conviction\u201d need not be submitted to a jury or proved beyond a reasonable doubt) (quotation marks omitted); <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2160 n. 1, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013) (noting that, in determining whether a mandatory minimum sentence applies, the fact of a prior conviction need not be submitted to a jury or proved beyond a reasonable doubt). Furthermore, King's failure to object to the PSR meant the district court could adopt its findings without error. <em>See United States v. Aguilar-Ibarra, </em>740 F.3d 587, 592 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b861-15\">. In his reply brief, King raises new arguments about why several of his other prior convictions do not qualify as ACCA predicates. But we will not consider such arguments when they are raised for first time in a reply brief \u2014 even with a <em>pro se </em>party. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008). In any event, King does not identify any circuit precedent that squarely prevented him from arguing \u2014 at sentencing, on appeal, or in a timely filed \u00a7 2255 motion \u2014 that those other prior convictions did not qualify as ACCA predicates. The ACCA status of those convictions cannot now be challenged through a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Jeanty, </em>757 F.3d at 1285.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
