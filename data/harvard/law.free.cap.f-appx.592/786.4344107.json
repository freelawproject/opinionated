She brought three claims against HHS under the antidiscrimination provision of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973(RA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. She alleged that HHS committed three separate violations of the RA by: terminating her, failing to accommodate her disability, and retaliating against her for requesting an accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-15\">Meyer worked as a Consumer Safety Officer for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She suffers from social phobia, avoidant personality disorder, and dependent personality disorder. In October 2006 she brought these disabilities to the attention of William Lyn, her supervisor at the time. He responded by assigning her less field work and allowing her to work primarily at the FDA\u2019s office. Despite those changes, Meyer began accumulating unscheduled absences. After an official, written warning, Lyn placed her on leave restriction in August 2008. Leave restriction required Meyer to report her arrival and departure times each day and to provide certification from a doctor any time she stayed home sick. This lasted six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-16\">In April 2010, Meyer\u2019s new supervisor, William Keck, again placed her on leave restriction for problems with her attendance. This led Meyer to formally request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>a reasonable accommodation for her disabilities under the RA in July 2010. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). On September 14, 2010, Meyer and her union representatives met with Keck and Facundo Bernal, Keck\u2019s supervisor, to discuss accommodation options. As a result of that meeting, Bernal, allowed Meyer to work an \u201cAny 80\u201d schedule, which permitted her to adjust her daily schedule as long as she worked from 10:00 A.M. to 2:00 P.M., Monday through Friday, and a total of 80 hours every two weeks. Shortly after Meyer\u2019s schedule change, the FDA and Meyer\u2019s union entered into a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which abolished the Any 80 schedule. Bernal did not understand the effect of the new CBA and thought that he needed to change Meyer\u2019s Any 80 schedule, even though it was an accommodation for her disability and unrelated to the CBA. About three weeks after the September 14 meeting he met with Meyer to explain that he was changing her accommodation to a \u201cFirst 40\u201d schedule, which permitted her to adjust her daily schedule as long as she worked from 10:00 A.M. to 2:00 P.M., Monday through Friday, and a total of 40 hours each week.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">In October 2010 two FDA employees separately spoke with Keck, each alleging that she had been invited by Meyer to go to the park during work hours. At Ber-nal\u2019s request, Keck investigated Meyer\u2019s daily schedule. He discovered that, when Meyer was in the field inspecting businesses, she would return to the office two to four hours after having left the business and would have put more miles on her vehicle than needed to drive to the business and back to the office. Bernal approached the FDA\u2019s director of the Florida District with Keck\u2019s findings. Calling Meyer\u2019s behavior \u201cegregious,\u201d the Florida director reported it to the Southeast Regional director, and they decided to report Meyer to the Office of Internal Affairs. The Florida director contacted Internal Affairs, which decided to begin surveillance of Meyer. From November 31, 2010, to February 2, 2011, two Internal Affairs agents ran a surveillance operation of Meyer that revealed she had made 31 trips to the park during working hours over the course of 35 workdays, each time using a government-owned vehicle to get there. On February 3, 2011, the two agents met with Meyer to discuss their surveillance. At this meeting, Meyer lied to the agents about the frequency, duration, and purpose of these trips to the park.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">On April 11, 2011, Keck sent Meyer a notice that he had proposed that Bernal terminate her. This notice charged three types of misconduct: (1) thirty-two instances of misuse of a government-owned vehicle, primarily for trips to the park; (2) providing misleading information to the two agents about her trips to the park; and (3) twenty-eight instances of misrepresenting time and attendance records between November 30, 2010, and January 26, 2011, resulting in records that over-reported her time worked during that period by about 43 hours. After Meyer had responded to that notice, Bernal reviewed both it and her response to it, and then issued a final decision to terminate Meyer on July 12, 2011. Meyer responded by filing this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the grant of summary judgment against Meyer, applying the same legal standard that the district court used and drawing all factual inferences in the light most favorable to Meyer. <em>See Johnson v. Bd. of Regents, </em>263 F.3d 1234, 1242-43 (11th Cir.2001). To show that the district court improperly granted summary judgment, Meyer must present more than a mere scintilla of evidence supporting her position. She must instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>make a sufficient showing that a jury could reasonably find for her. <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n, </em>446 F.Sd 1160, 1162 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Meyer first contends that her termination constituted disability-based discrimination in violation of the RA. The RA prohibits federal employers from subjecting an \u201cotherwise qualified person with a disability\u201d to discrimination \u2014 including discrimination in the discharge of employees \u2014 \u201csolely by reason of her or his disability.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We apply the plain meaning of the phrase \u201csolely by reason of,\u201d and Meyer cannot prevail if she shows that HHS based her termination partially on her disability and partially on other factors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Ellis v. England, </em>432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cIt is not enough for a plaintiff to demonstrate that an adverse employment action was based partly on his disability\u201d). Meyer may create a genuine issue of material fact about whether she was terminated solely by reason of her disability with either direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>See EEOC v. Joe\u2019s Stone Crabs, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). She attempts to use both.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">As direct evidence of disability discrimination, Meyer presents comments made by Bernal and Keck. Direct evidence must prove \u201cwithout inference or presumption\u201d that HHS terminated her solely by reason of her disability. <em>See Joe\u2019s Stone Crabs, </em>296 F.3d at 1272 (quotation marks omitted). She first asserts that comments made by Bernal during their September 14 meeting are such evidence. That meeting was held at Meyer\u2019s request for the sole purpose of discussing options for reasonably accommodating her disability. During that meeting, Bernal referred to her as a \u201cliability\u201d and questioned her ability to do field work \u201cif she has this inability to communicate with others.\u201d But that meeting did not result in any adverse action against Meyer. Quite the opposite: Ber-nal granted her request for a reasonable accommodation. To take those comments as .evidence of discriminatory intent, we would have to presume that Bernal harbored discriminatory motives against Meyer despite his actions to the contrary. And if we must presume those comments reflected Bernal\u2019s discriminatory intent, they are not direct evidence of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">She also points to crude comments by Keck, who on two occasions told her to \u201cshake [her] ass\u201d .to avoid \u201cthis problem out there in the field.\u201d Meyer asserts that Keck\u2019s reference to her \u201cproblem\u201d is the inappropriate part of this comment. She sees it as a reference to her disability. But she does not identify the exact \u201cproblem\u201d Keck was referencing, which means she has asked us to infer that he referred to a disability-related problem. If we must infer that Keck\u2019s comment referred to her disability, it is not direct evidence of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Because she has produced no similarly-situated comparator, Meyer does not rely on the familiar burden-shifting analysis of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). She instead attempts to create a genuine issue of material fact using the \u201cmosaic theory\u201d of circumstantial evidence. <em>See Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., </em>644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir.2011). Under this approach, \u201c[i]f a' plaintiff \u2018presents circumstantial evidence that creates a triable issue concerning the employer\u2019s discriminatory intent,\u2019 she \u2018will always survive summary judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chapter 7 Tr. v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., </em>683 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Smith, </em>644 F.3d at 1328).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Meyer\u2019s RA claim cannot survive summary judgment under the mosaic theory unless she presents enough circumstantial evidence to raise a reasonable inference that HHS terminated her \u201csolely by reason of\u2019 her disability. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); <em>Ellis, </em>432 F.3d at 1326 (\u201cIt is not enough for a plaintiff to demonstrate that an adverse employment action was based partly on his disability.\u201d). So her circumstantial evidence must undermine the undisputed evidence that HHS actually terminated her because she violated agency policy. <em>See Gate Gourmet, </em>683 F.3d at 1255-56; <em>Smith, </em>644 F.3d at 1328. Meyer does not dispute that the two employees who initially reported her policy violations played no role in her ongoing discussions with HHS about her disability and reasonable accommodations. She does not dispute that the Florida District director, who called her policy violations \u201cegregious,\u201d did not know about her disability. She does not dispute that the Southeast Regional director, who along with the Florida director referred her case to Internal Affairs, did not know about her disability. She does not dispute that the Internal Affairs investigators assigned to her case did not know about her disability. And she does not dispute that she committed the violations of HHS policy discovered by those investigators and upon which Bernal relied when he terminated her. Meyer\u2019s circumstantial mosaic must, despite that undisputed evidence, allow a reasonable jury to infer that HHS terminated her solely by reason of her disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">In her attempt to meet this burden, she lists a handful of incidents without drawing any connection between them, failing to show how they comprise \u201ca convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence\u201d of discriminatory intent. <em>See Smith, </em>644 F.3d at 1328 (quotation marks omitted). She starts with the same comments by Bernal and Keck that have already been discussed, now using, them as circumstantial instead of direct evidence of discrimination. She builds on those comments with evidence of HHS\u2019s \u201crepeated revocation^]\u201d of her reasonable accommodations, pointing to three incidents in particular: (1) Keck\u2019s decision to assign her more field work, (2) Bernal\u2019s decision to change her schedule, and (3) Keck\u2019s refusal to allow her to move to a less-exposed cubicle. She finishes her mosaic with Bernal\u2019s decision to report her to Internal Affairs and his failure to explain her disability and accommodation to the investigators.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Meyer\u2019s mosaic of evidence does nothing to discredit the undisputed evidence that HHS terminated her at least partly because she violated agency policy. It may suggest that Bernal and Keck harbored some disability-based hostility against her. It could even .be read to suggest that Bernal referred Meyer to his supervisors at least partly by reason of that hostility. But it does not contradict the undisputed evidence that Meyer\u2019s policy violations at least partially motivated HHS\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>terminate her. If she shows only that her termination \u201cwas based <em>partly </em>on [her] disability,\u201d then her claim fails. <em>See Ellis, </em>432 F.3d at 1326 (emphasis added). She must raise an inference that HHS terminated her <em>\u201csolely </em>by reason of her ... disability.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a) (emphasis added). \u2022 Because her mosaic of circumstantial evidence can do no more than raise an inference that HHS terminated her partly because of her disability and partly because of her violations of HHS policy, Meyer failed to establish a prima facie discrimination claim under the RA-</p>\n<p id=\"AOq\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Meyer next contends that the district court erred by rejecting her claim that by switching her from the Any 80 schedule to the First 40 schedule, Bernal failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The RA requires an employer to \u201cmak[e] reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A); <em>Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, </em>492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201c[A]n employer\u2019s failure to reasonably accommodate a disabled individual <em>itself </em>constitutes discrimination under the ADA....\u201d) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(d). Meyer, however, has \u201cthe burden of identifying an accommodation that would allow [her] to perform the job,\u201d along with \u201cthe ultimate burden of persuasion with respect to demonstrating that such an accommodation is reasonable.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Happy Herman\u2019s Cheshire Bridge, Inc., </em>117 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir.1997). HHS had no obligation to accept the accommodations suggested by her. <em>See id. </em>at 1285 (\u201c[A]n employer is not required to accommodate an employee in any manner in which that employee desires.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Meyer\u2019s disability could cause bouts of anxiety and depression lasting \u201ca day or two, with the occasional longer period.\u201d To accommodate this condition, she suggested that HHS allow her a flexible schedule, in particular the Any 80 schedule. Bernal agreed to this suggestion. About three weeks later, he changed his mind and her schedule, allowing her the First 40 schedule instead. She asserts that because the First 40 schedule is less flexible than the Any 80 schedule, HHS has therefore failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation. But she has not argued that the.First 40 schedule is itself not a reasonable accommodation, just that the Any 80 schedule would be better. HHS had no obligation to provide her \u201cthe maximum accommodation ... possible,\u201d nor was she \u201centitled to the accommodation of her choice, but only a reasonable accommodation.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). ,</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">Meyer tries to dodge her failure to show that the First 40 schedule is unreasonable by arguing that Bernal \u201cfailed to engage [h\u00e9r] in the interactive process required under the [RA].\u201d But she cannot evade summary judgment with this argument. The applicable regulation suggests that to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>determine an appropriate reasonable accommodation \u201cit may be necessary for [the employer] to initiate an informal, interactive process with the individual with a disability in need of the accommodation.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 <em>1630.2(o </em>)(3). In applying this regulation, we have stated that \u201c[[liability simply cannot arise under the ADA when an employer does not obstruct an informal interactive process; makes reasonable efforts to communicate with the employee and provide accommodations based on the information it possesses; and the employee\u2019s actions cause a breakdown in the interactive process.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>117 F.3d at 1287. Bernal did not obstruct the interactive process. At the meeting on September 14, 2010, he and Meyer discussed her disability and options for accommodating it. When he decided to change her accommodation three weeks later, he spoke to Meyer about it. She did not tell Bernal that she disapproved of the change, nor did she request a different accommodation. If there was a failure in an interactive process, it was Meyer\u2019s actions that caused it, not Bernal\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Meyer finally contends that HHS discriminated against her by changing her schedule and terminating her in retaliation for requesting a reasonable accommodation and for filing charges of discrimination with the EEOC. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a) (\u201cNo person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge ... under this chapter.\u201d); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(d). To establish a prima facie retaliation claim, Meyer must show that (1) she engaged in a protected activity, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) the protected activity was causally connected to the adverse employment action. <em>Stewart, </em>117 F.3d at 1287. Meyer met the first requirement in two ways: requesting a reasonable accommodation and filing charges of discrimination with the EEOC. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a); <em>Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., 161 </em>F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that a request for a reasonable accommodation is a \u201cstatutorily protected activity\u201d only if the plaintiff \u201chad a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that he was entitled to those accommodations\u201d). To prove the causal connection between those activities and HHS\u2019s termination of her, Meyer relies on their \u201ctemporal proximity.\u201d <em>See Higdon v. Jackson, </em>393 F.3d 1211, 1220 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cA \u2018close temporal proximity' between the protected expression and an adverse action is sufficient circumstantial evidence of a causal connection for purposes of a prima facie case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">First, Meyer highlights the three weeks between Bernal\u2019s alleged hostility toward her in the reasonable accommodation meeting and his decision to place her on the First 40 schedule instead of the Any 80 schedule. She asserts that this \u201cclose temporal proximity\u201d creates a triable retaliation issue. <em>See id. </em>We disagree. Meyer illogically asserts that Bernal retaliated against her for requesting a reasonable accommodation by agreeing to meet with her to discuss that request, and then in further retaliation, he agreed to her request. Only after those two steps did he , alter the terms of her accommodation, providing her with a schedule that she does not dispute is itself a reasonable accommodation. \u201cClose temporal proximity\u201d cannot overcome the illogic of her argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Meyer\u2019s second retaliation argument\u2014 that HHS terminated her because she filed charges of discrimination with the EEOC \u2014 again relies on temporal proximity to show causation. Meyer filed an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>formal complaint on March 3, 2011, which resulted in a telephone conference between her, Bernal, Keck, and an EEOC counsel- or. She asserts that because Keck proposed her removal \u201conly seventeen days after the EEOC conference call,\u201d and because Bernal approved her termination about two months later, she has shown enough .temporal proximity to defeat summary judgment. <em>See id. </em>But she has not. The Internal Affairs investigation that led to her termination had finished a month before she complained to the EEOC. Keck and Bernal already had all the evidence before them that they would eventually rely on when they terminated her. HHS had already taken substantial steps towards terminating Meyer, which means she needed to show more than mere temporal proximity. <em>See Cotton v. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc., </em>434 F.3d 1227, 1232 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cWhen an employer contemplates a given action before the harassment takes place, temporal proximity between the action and the incident of harassment alone will not suffice to show causation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">For those reasons, HHS was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-10\">. Meyer also claimed that HHS discriminated against her on the basis of gender, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>She has not appealed the district court's ruling on that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b811-17\">. Because the district court entered summary judgment against Meyer, we recount the facts in the light most favorable to her claims. <em>See Johnson v. Bd. of Regents, </em>263 F.3d 1234, 1242-43 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b813-9\">.

Smith, </em>231 F.3d 1301, 1305 n. 2 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cCases decided under the Rehabilitation Act are precedent for cases under the ADA, and vice-versa.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b813-14\">.
