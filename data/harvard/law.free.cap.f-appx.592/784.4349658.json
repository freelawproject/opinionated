Candelario filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate in 2002, which was denied as untimely. On appeal, he argues that because he is actually innocent, his \u00a7 2241 petition should be heard in light of <em>McQuiggin v. Perkins, </em>569 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Typically, challenges to the validity of a federal sentence are made via \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). Section 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d permits a petition under \u00a7 2241\u2014 which is \u201cgenerally reserved for challenges to execution of a sentence or the nature of confinement, not the validity of the sentence itself or the <em>fact </em>of confinement,\u201d <em>Bryant v. Warden, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1288 (11th Cir.2013) \u2014 if a petitioner establishes that the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see also Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. The savings clause is a jurisdictional provision, <em>Williams v. Warden, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1338 (11th Cir.2013); a petitioner bears the burden of showing that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective before the district court can review his \u00a7 2241 petition, <em>Turner v. Warden, </em>709 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.2013). The restrictions imposed by \u00a7 2255(h) on filing second or successive motions do not render it inadequate or ineffective for purposes of the savings clause. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1267. We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause. <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">Candelario bases his claim on <em>McQuig-gin. </em>There, the Supreme Court held that actual innocence can serve as a gateway through which a prisoner may bring his first post-conviction challenge despite the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations. 569 U.S. at -, 133 S.Ct. at 1928, 1934-36. That holding was based on an equitable exception to the statute of limitations contained in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. <em>Id.; see Gore v. Crews, </em>720 F.3d 811, 817 (11th Cir.2013) (per curiam). The <em>McQuiggin </em>Court emphasized that its holding concerned an <em>initial </em>habeas petition brought by a state prisoner; it did not discuss successive petitions by federal prisoners. <em>See </em>569 U.S. at -, 133 S.Ct. at 1933-34 (differentiating initial habeas petitions from second or successive petitions).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-18\">Candelario attacks the validity of his sentence, not the manner of his confinement or execution of his sentence: he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>asserts that he is innocent of his crimes and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. For that reason, he may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition only via the savings clause. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1288; <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. But he has not satisfied the requirements of the savings clause. He purports to rely on <em>McQuig-gin, </em>but even assuming <em>McQuiggin </em>is retroactively applicable and applies to federal prisoners, his reliance is misplaced. <em>McQuiggin\u2019s </em>holding was limited to <em>initial </em>petitions for habeas corpus. <em>See McQuiggin, </em>569 U.S. at -, 133 S.Ct. at 1933-34. It cheated an exception to the limitations period; it said nothing about whether a petitioner may bring a second or successive petition under the savings clause. <em>Id. </em>at -, 133 S.Ct. at 1934-36. Candelario has not met the requirements of the savings clause, so the district court properly dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition as second or successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-12\">. Candelario first argues that his petition is not successive because his initial \u00a7 2255 motion was denied as untimely rather than on the merits. But a second petition is successive if the first was denied or dismissed with prejudice, <em>Guenther v. Holt, </em>173 F.3d 1328, 1329 (11th Cir.1999) (discussing \u00a7 2254), and a dismissal for untimeliness is with prejudice, <em>see Jordan v. Sec\u2019y, Dep't of Corr., </em>485 F.3d 1351, 1353 (11th Cir.2007) (same). <em>Accord Villanueva v. United States, </em>346 F.3d 55, 61 (2d Cir.2003) (\"[W]e hold that a habeas or \u00a7 2255 petition that is properly dismissed as time-barred under AEDPA constitutes an adjudication on the merits for successive purposes.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
