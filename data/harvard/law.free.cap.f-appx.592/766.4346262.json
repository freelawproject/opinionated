While on company business, Wall 2 Walls employee Keith Galloway struck Yarbra Gibbs\u2019 car and injured her. Galloway was driving a pickup truck owned by Clyde Walls, the eponymous owner of Wall 2 Walls. At the time of the accident, Wall 2 Walls had two insurance policies covering the pickup truck. The first was a $100,000 commercial automobile insurance policy through Progressive Express Insurance Company. That policy covered bodily injury liability of up to $100,000 per person and property damage liability of up to $50,000 per incident. It also covered additional risks including uninsured motorists and collision damage. The policy covered three vehicles, one of which was the truck Galloway was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The second policy was a commercial general liability (CGL) policy issued by Southern-Owners. Although Southern-Owners\u2019 CGL policies generally excluded automobile-related claims, Wall 2 Walls\u2019 policy contained a $1 million endorsement for \u201cHired Auto and Non-Owned Auto Liability,\u201d which Wall 2 Walls had purchased for an additional premium. The endorsement read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-7\">2. HIRED AUTO AND NON-OWNED AUTO LIABILITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax4\">Coverage for \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cproperty damage\u201d liability provided under SECTION I COVERAGES, COVERAGE A. BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY, is extended as follows under this item, but <em>only if you do not have any other insurance available to you which affords the same or similar coverage.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-8\">COVERAGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-9\">We will pay those sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cprop- \u25a0 erty damage\u201d arising out of the maintenance or use of an \u201cauto\u201d:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-10\">a. You do not own;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-11\">b. Which is not registered in your name; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-12\">c. Which is not leased or rented to you for more than ninety consecutive days</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-13\">and which is used in your business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqgd\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-14\">The two insurance companies reacted to the accident in different ways. Progressive quickly determined that its policy did cover Gibbs\u2019 injury. Less than a month after the accident, it entered into an agreement with Gibbs in which Progressive gave her $100,000 (the policy\u2019s full limit per person for bodily injury) and Gibbs released any claim she had arising from the accident. The release did not, however, preclude her from filing suit to recover for losses that other insurance policies might cover. In contrast, Southern-Owners denied Wall 2 Walls\u2019 request for coverage under the CGL policy\u2019s \u201cHired Auto and Non-Owned Auto Liability\u201d endorsement. It justified its decision on the ground that the pickup truck was not a \u201chired auto\u201d under the endorsement because \u201cthe vehicle is registered to and/or owned by an insured, Clyde J. Walls, as owner of Wall 2 Walls Construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">In July 2012 Gibbs filed suit in state court against Galloway, Wall 2 Walls, and Clyde Walls. Southern-Owners then filed a complaint in federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment that (1) Southern-Owners\u2019 policy did not cover the accident and (2) Southern-Owners therefore had no duty to defend or indemnify Wall 2 Walls. Southern Owners did not rely on the rationale it gave when it denied Wall 2 Walls\u2019 request for coverage. Instead, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>relied on the exclusionary clause in the endorsement. That clause stated that the endorsement applied \u201conly if [Wall 2 Walls did] not have any other insurance available to [it] which affor[ded] the same or similar coverage.\u201d In Southern Owners\u2019 view, the Progressive policy provided \u201cthe same or similar coverage,\u201d and therefore the endorsement did not apply. Wall 2 Walls counterclaimed, alleging breach of Southern-Owners\u2019 duty to defend and indemnify. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled that the policy language was ambiguous and therefore Florida law mandated granting summary judgment to Wall 2 Walls.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Nat\u2019l Fire Ins. Co. v. Fortune Constr. Co., </em>320 F.3d 1260, 1267 (11th Cir.2003). We also review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation of contract language. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Florida substantive law governs in this diversity case. <em>See Tech. Coating Apps., Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>157 F.3d 843, 844 (11th Cir.1998). It requires us to construe insurance contracts \u201cin accordance with the plain language of the policies as bargained for by the parties.\u201d <em>Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Anderson, </em>756 So.2d 29, 34 (Fla.2000). \u201cIf a policy provision is clear and unambiguous, it should be enforced according to its terms.\u201d <em>Penzer v. Transp. Ins. Co., </em>29 So.3d 1000, 1005 (Fla.2010) (quotation marks and alteration omitted); <em>see also Siegle v. Progressive Consumers Ins. Co., </em>819 So.2d 732, 736 (Fla.2002) (admonishing courts to read insurance contract terms \u201cin their ordinary sense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">But \u201c[i]f the relevant policy language is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, one providing coverage and ... another limiting coverage, the insurance policy is considered ambiguous.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>756 So.2d at 34. Any ambiguous passage is to be \u201cinterpreted liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the drafter who prepared the policy.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Golden Door Jewelry Creations, Inc. v. Lloyds Underwriters Non-Marine Ass\u2019n, </em>117 F.3d 1328, 1337 (11th Cir.1997) (noting that Florida law requires construing ambiguities in a contract against the contract\u2019s drafter); <em>Penzer, </em>29 So.3d at 1005 (ambiguity to be \u201cconstrued against the insurer and in favor of coverage\u201d) (quotation mark omitted). And exclusionary clauses \u201care construed even more strictly against the insurer than coverage clauses.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>756 So.2d at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">Thus if Wall 2 Walls advances a reasonable interpretation of the policy language favoring coverage, we must affirm. <em>See Penzer, </em>29 So.3d at 1005; <em>Anderson, </em>756 So.2d at 34. It contends that the exclusionary clause can be reasonably read so that the Progressive policy\u2019s coverage is neither the \u201csame\u201d as nor \u201csimilar\u201d to the CGL policy\u2019s coverage because insurance that \u201caffords the same or similar coverage\u201d would have to be a policy with a non-owned-auto liability endorsement. Southern-Owners obviously disagrees, arguing that the policies\u2019 coverages are \u201cthe same or similar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">The parties have not pointed to any binding authority interpreting this clause and we have found none, so we must interpret the clause ourselves. Because the Progressive policy is plainly \u201cother insurance,\u201d the question turns on the phrase \u201cthe same or similar coverage,\u201d which is not defined in the policy. When a policy does not define relevant terms, our \u201cfirst step towards discerning the plain meaning of the phrase is to consult references that are commonly relied upon to supply the accepted meaning of the words.\u201d <em>Penzer, </em>29 So.3d at 1005 (quotation marks and alterations omitted). In insurance, \u201ccover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>age\u201d means \u201cthe risks within the scope of an insurance policy.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 394 (8th ed.2004). So the question is whether the risks within the scope of the two policies are \u201cthe same\u201d or \u201csimilar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">We begin with whether they are \u201cthe same.\u201d \u201cSame\u201d means \u201cnot different\u201d or \u201cexactly like someone <em>or </em>something else.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Progressive policy insured and paid on bodily injury liability arising from the use of an automobile. It additionally covered property damage liability arising from the use of an automobile. Those are the same types of risks that the Southern-Owners endorsement covers. But the Progressive policy is tied to three specific vehicles, while the Southern-Owners endorsement covers any \u201cauto\u201d not owned by, leased or rented for more than ninety consecutive days by, or registered to Wall 2 Walls \u2014 a universe that potentially includes far more than the three vehicles covered by the Progressive policy. The Southern-Owners endorsement thus covers risks to a significantly broader class of vehicles than the Progressive policy covers. Even though in this case the Progressive policy covered the vehicle at issue, it would not have covered, for example, injuries resulting from an accident in which Galloway was driving his own vehicle or a rental vehicle that was not rented for more than ninety days. The coverage provided by the Progressive policy was therefore not \u201cthe same\u201d as that afforded by the Southern-Owners endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">We next turn to whether the risks within the scope of the insurance policies were \u201csimilar.\u201d \u201cSimilar\u201d is variously defined as \u201calmost the same as someone or something else,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201calike in substance or essentials: corresponding,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201chaving characteristics in common: strictly comparable,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or \u201chaving a likeness or resemblance, especially] in a general way.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These definitions encompass varying degrees of likeness. And depending on the degree of likeness required to make things \u201csimilar,\u201d there are arguments both for and against the view that the Southern-Owners endorsement\u2019s broad-scope coverage is \u201csimilar\u201d to the Progressive policy\u2019s coverage of the same types of risks across a far narrower scope. For example, it would be reasonable to argue that the two policies\u2019 coverages \u201chav[e] a likeness or resemblance, especially] -in a general way\u201d to one another, in that they both cover bodily injury and property damage. But it would also be reasonable to argue that the Progressive policy\u2019s coverage of those risks across a scope of three vehicles is not \u201calmost the same\u201d as the much broader coverage of the Southern-Owners endorsement. Florida law is clear that where reasonable interpretations compete, the insured wins. <em>See Anderson, </em>756 So.2d at 34. This conclusion is in line with Florida\u2019s directive to \u201cinterpret[ the policy language] liberally in. favor of the insured and strictly against the drafter who prepared the policy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-6\">.
