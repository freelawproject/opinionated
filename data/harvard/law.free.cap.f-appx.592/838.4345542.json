Jacob\u2019s <em>pro se </em>amended complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>racially discriminatory discharge and racially hostile work environment, pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l), as well as various state law claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court dismissed Jacob\u2019s amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>complaint <em>sua sponte </em>and without prejudice for failure to state a claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">I. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">According to her amended complaint, during the 2011 and 2012 tax seasons, Plaintiff Jacobs, who is African American, worked as a tax preparer at one of Bian-do\u2019s Liberty Tax offices. During this time, Jacob\u2019s supervisor was Defendant Kristy Freitas, and one of her coworkers was Defendant Snowden.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Biando, Freitas and Snowden are white.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">According to the amended complaint, Freitas engaged in various conduct to undermine Plaintiff Jacobs at work, including: (1) intentionally withholding from Jacobs information Freitas told \u201call other employee\u2019s [sic],\u201d such as new procedures for processing state tax returns or cell phone usage; (2) instructing Jacobs to give customer discounts, but then later claiming Jacobs gave too many customer discounts; (8) falsely claiming that Jacobs had violated work policies, such as attendance, and had demanded more work hours and a promotion; and (4) treating other employees \u201cwith favoritism: they were trusted more, were well informed of all changes, and were received in a more pleasant manner\u201d by Freitas and Biando.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Freitas was \u201c[h]ostile to questions [Jacobs] ask[ed],\u201d and interpreted Jacobs\u2019s \u201cfeeling in a negative way.\u201d Additionally, Freitas\u2019s \u201ctone toward [Jacobs] before customers [was] demeaning on a couple of occasions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">In addition to these general allegations of mistreatment, Jacobs\u2019s amended alleged two incidents of \u201cRacism.\u201d First, in the 2011 tax season, Jacobs had an \u201caltercation\u201d with Snowden when \u201cSnowden went against policy for tax preparers and they\u2019re [sic] customers.\u201d During the altercation, Snowden \u201cstated he was better than [Jacobs], attempted to fire [Jacobs] without authority and [made] a physical demonstration of racial dislike.\u201d Jacobs does not say what Snowden did physically. Although Jacobs had never had problems with Snowden before, Defendant Biando \u201cused that one incident and fictionalized all [Jacobs\u2019s] past interactions with Snowden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">Second, during a ten-week training course and the 2012 tax season, Freitas \u201cmade racial comments/inference.\u201d Specifically, Freitas made comments \u201cabout how African American females should get along, [Jacobs\u2019s] character, and etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">In early February 2012, things came to a head when Freitas falsely accused Jacobs of mishandling two customers \u2014 when in fact it was Freitas who was to blame\u2014 and then decreased the number of hours Jacobs was scheduled to work, claiming that \u201cpeak season\u201d was over \u2014 when in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>peak season did not end for another week. When Jacobs discovered on February 22, 2012 that Freitas had again decreased Jacobs\u2019s hours, Jacobs asked Freitas about the schedule change \u201cin a pleasant tone.\u201d Freitas became \u201chostile\u201d and \u201cdefensive,\u201d told Jacobs that she did not have to justify herself, and gave \u201cnew reasons\u201d for the decreased hours having to do with Jacobs\u2019s availability. When Jacobs asked Freitas if she \u201ccould keep [Jacobs] around 12 hours because this was [Jacobs\u2019s] only job,\u201d Frei-tas responded, \u201cok.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The next day, however, Freitas called Jacobs into her office and said \u201cshe was going to have to let [Jacobs] go because [of]\u201d co-worker and customer complaints and Jacobs\u2019s asking about her hours and questioning Freitas\u2019s authority. Jacobs alleges that all of Freitas\u2019s reasons for terminating Jacobs were false. In fact, Jacobs was a good tax preparer who was friendly and courteous to all customers and to her co-workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AgQ\">A. Failure to State a Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Dismissal for failure to state a claim is appropriate if the complaint\u2019s factual allegations fail to state a claim for relief that is \u201cplausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009); <em>see also Bell Atl. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (\u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">\u201cAlthough a Title VII complaint need not allege facts sufficient to make out a classic <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>prima facie case, it must provide enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest intentional race discrimination.\u201d <em>Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., </em>516 F.3d 955, 974 (11th Cir.2008) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Further, \u201c[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1949. While we construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally, <em>Alba, </em>517 F.3d at 1252, we do not have \u201clicense to serve as <em>defacto </em>counsel for a party, or to rewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.\u201d <em>GJR Invs., Inc., v. Cnty. of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998) (citation omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds by Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">B. Jacobs\u2019s Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">Even construed liberally, the factual allegations in Jacobs\u2019s amended complaint fail to \u201csuggest intentional race discrimination.\u201d <em>See Davis, </em>516 F.3d at 974. To be sure, Jacobs\u2019s allegations, taken as true, establish that Freitas was a poor supervisor who treated Jacobs badly and terminated Jacobs based on trumped-up accusations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But, it is axiomatic that Title VII prohibits only discrimination and is not a \u201cgeneral civility code,\u201d <em>Reeves v. C.H. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number><em>Robinson Worldwide, Inc., </em>594 F.3d 798, 809 (11th Cir.2010), or \u201ca shield against harsh treatment at the work place.\u201d <em>Succar v. Dade Cnty. Sch. Bd., </em>229 F.3d 1343, 1345 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 1253, 1266 (11th Cir.2010) (explaining that Title VII is not concerned with .the wisdom of an employer\u2019s decisions, so long as they \u201cwere not made with a discriminatory motive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">To be actionable under Title VII, the harassing conduct or the adverse employment action must be <em>because of </em>the employee\u2019s protected characteristic, in this case race. <em>See Reeves, </em>594 F.3d at 809 n. 3 (addressing hostile work environment claim); <em>Stimpson v. City of Tuscaloosa, </em>186 F.3d 1328, 1331 (11th Cir.1999) (addressing discriminatory discharge claim). Jacobs, however, did not allege that the reason Freitas mistreated her or falsely accused and then fired her was because she was African American.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Even if we liberally construe Jacobs\u2019s amended complaint to infer such a conclu-sory allegation, Jacobs did not allege any specific facts to support it. For example, Jacobs did not allege that Freitas treated similarly-situated employees who were not African American more favorably or that Jacobs was replaced by an employee that was not African American.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At a minimum, Jacobs needed to allege enough facts to \u201cdraw the reasonable inference\u201d that Freitas\u2019s actions were motivated by racial animus. <em>See Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1949. A threadbare allegation that an employee believes she was discriminated against because of her race is not enough to \u201craise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(explaining that mere conclusory statements do not satisfy <em>Twombly\u2019s </em>facial plausibility standard); <em>Davis, </em>516 F.3d at 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">The only allegation about Freitas that relates at all to race is that Freitas made some comments that African-American women \u201cshould get along.\u201d There were no additional allegations, however, to connect these comments to Freitas\u2019s treatment or termination of Jacobs. Such general, race-based comments, unrelated to the complained-of conduct, do not suggest that Freitas singled Jacobs out for harassment or terminated her because she was African American.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">As to Defendant Snowden, Jacobs\u2019s allegations at best are an attempt to state a racially hostile work environment claim, but fail as well. Jacobs alleged only a onetime altercation, in which Snowden said he was better than Jacobs and tried to fire her. Even assuming Snowden\u2019s accompanying \u201cphysical demonstration of racial dislike\u201d indicated his statements were motivated by Jacob\u2019s race, the altercation was an isolated incident that was not severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment. <em>See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 2283, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (stating that isolated incidents that are not extremely serious are not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an objectively hostile work environment); <em>see also Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., </em>277 F.3d 1269, 1276-77 (11th Cir.2002) (explaining that the \u201cmere utterance\u201d of an epithet does not implicate Title VII). Furthermore, as Jacobs\u2019s coworker, Snowden was \u201cwithout authority\u201d to fire Jacobs. Thus, Snow-den\u2019s conduct, while upsetting to Jacobs, did not actually result in an adverse employment action. <em>See Davis v. Town of Lake Park, Fla., </em>245 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>Cir.2001) (explaining that an adverse employment action requires a significant change in employment status, such as firing, failing to hire or promote, or significantly changing responsibilities or benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\">For all these reasons, Jacobs\u2019s amended complaint failed to state a facially plausible claim of either discriminatory discharge or a racially hostile work environment under Title VII. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Jacob\u2019s amended complaint without prejudice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-19\">. Jacobs also alleged a retaliation claim under Title VII and claims under the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d), and the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, <em>et seq. </em>Because on appeal Jacobs raises no meaningful arguments as to these claims, they are deemed abandoned. <em>See Singh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>561 F.3d 1275, 1278 (11th Cir.2009); <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b863-8\">. Although Jacobs\u2019s amended complaint named Freitas and Snowden as defendants, a Title VII claim \"may be brought against only the <em>employer </em>and not against an individual employee.\" <em>Dearth v. Collins, </em>441 F.3d 931, 933 (11th Cir.2006). Thus, to the extent Jacobs asserted Title VII claims against Defendants Freitas and Snowden, the district court properly dismissed them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b863-9\">. Although page 3 of Jacobs\u2019s amended complaint identifies Snowden as a supervisor, Jacobs's appeal brief states that the district court misread her amended complaint and that Freitas was her supervisor, and Snowden \u201cwas an employee at the time of the discriminatory events.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b863-15\">.In paperwork filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, attached to Jacobs\u2019s amended complaint, Jacobs stated that she overheard a telephone conversation between Freitas and an unknown employee about Freitas \"showing favoritism in distribution of hours to other employees\u201d and that Freitas \u201cinstructed the employee to not discuss the above concern with other employees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b864-11\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim, accepting the complaint\u2019s allegations as true and applying the same standards that govern dismissals under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"Avz\">. Jacobs\u2019s amended complaint does not allege whether it was Biando or Freitas who made the decision to terminate her. Construing Jacobs\u2019s allegations liberally, we treat both Biando and Freitas as decisionmakers,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b865-7\">. Notably, while Jacobs alleged that Freitas showed favoritism to \"other employees,\u201d she did not identify the race of these other employees or allege that the favoritism was based on race.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b866-15\">. Because the district court properly dismissed Jacobs\u2019s federal claims, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her remaining state law claims.
