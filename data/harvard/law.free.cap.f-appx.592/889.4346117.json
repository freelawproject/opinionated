First, she contends the district court erred by admitting evidence of her prior involvement in marijuana traf-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>Ticking with Gary Williams and Robert Beneby in 2011. Second, she argues the district court erred in denying her motion for a judgment of acquittal because the government did not offer sufficient evidence of her knowledge of the contents of the package purportedly containing cocaine. Upon review, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">The district court did not plainly err in admitting the testimony regarding Williams-Hill\u2019s marijuana trafficking in 2011 because these prior acts were admissible as inextricably intertwined intrinsic evidence. <em>See United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1344 (11th Cir.2007) (holding uncharged conduct is not \u201cextrinsic\u201d evidence subject to Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) when it is \u201cinextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense\u201d) (quotation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The testimony pertained to prior acts necessary for the jury to understand the witness\u2019s account of Williams-Hill\u2019s involvement in the instant offense. Based on Gary\u2019s testimony, Williams-Hill continued an existing role in 2013 that she began performing in 2011 as Beneby\u2019s and Gary\u2019s co-conspirator. In this role, Williams-Hill intercepted and rerouted drug packages via her employment with the United States Postal Service. Thus, Gary\u2019s testimony about the meeting at the Cheetah Club in 2011, where he first met Williams-Hill and learned of her role in the marijuana scheme, was necessary for the jury to understand Gary\u2019s account of the 2013 cocaine transaction in which Williams-Hill performed an identical role. The prior acts formed an \u201cintegral and natural part of the witness\u2019s accounts,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quotation omitted), that were necessary for the jury to comprehend Gary\u2019s identification of Williams-Hill as the same mail carrier who participated in the 2011 and 2013 schemes.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">Gary\u2019s testimony was not unfairly prejudicial under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. <em>See id. </em>(holding inextricably intertwined evidence \u201cmust satisfy Rule 403\u201d). The prior acts showed Gary\u2019s understanding of Williams-Hill\u2019s role in the conspiracy and explained why and how Williams-Hill helped Beneby and Gary deliver the cocaine. The danger of unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh the highly probative value of this evidence. As such/we conclude' the district court did not err in admitting the evidence of Williams-Hill\u2019s participation in the 2011 marijuana trafficking scheme.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>We likewise hold the district court did not err in denying Williams-HiH\u2019s motion for acquittal because sufficient evidence existed for a reasonable juror to conclude she knew or was deliberately ignorant that the package contained cocaine. <em>See United States v. Friske, </em>640 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2011) (\u201cA jury\u2019s verdict cannot be overturned if any reasonable construction of the evidence would have allowed the jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>United States v. Prather, </em>205 F.3d 1265, 1270 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]he knowledge element of a violation of a criminal statute can be proved by demonstrating either actual knowledge or deliberate ignorance.\u201d). Gary\u2019s testimony, Williams-Hill\u2019s presence in the Salvation Army parking lot with Beneby, the falsified delivery receipts, and the text messages discovered in Beneby\u2019s phone were sufficient for a jury to infer the requisite mens rea. <em>See Friske, </em>640 F.3d at 1291 (reviewing court in sufficiency of evidence challenge must draw \u201call reasonable inferences and credibility choices in the Government\u2019s favor\u201d (quotation omitted)). The facts here are far from the sort of speculative or impermissible conclusion that is so tenuous as to render Williams-Hill\u2019s conviction shocking.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">In light of the foregoing reasons, we affirm Williams-HiH\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b913-7\">. Although the jury also convicted Williams-Hill for theft of mail matter by a postal service employee, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1709, she does not challenge that conviction on appeal. We accordingly address only her drug conspiracy conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b914-5\">.We review the admissibility of Gary's testimony about Williams-Hill\u2019s marijuana trafficking for plain error because Williams-Hill did not contemporaneously object to the evidence at trial. See <em>United States v. Brown, </em>665 F.3d 1239, 1247 (11th Cir.2011) (holding overruling of motion in limine does not suffice for preservation of objection on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"AYo6\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal for a manifest miscarriage of justice because Williams-Hill failed to renew her motion at the end of all the evidence. <em>See United States v. House, </em>684 F.3d 1173, 1196 (11th Cir.2012). To reverse under this standard, the government\u2019s proffered trial evidence as to a \"key element\u201d of the charged offense must be \"so tenuous that the conviction is shocking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations and quotation omitted). We may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>United States v. Acuna-Reyna, </em>677 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b914-10\">.- Our finding that the evidence was intrinsic makes meritless Williams-Hill\u2019s claim that the Government failed to timely disclose the prior acts. The Government's duty to provide pretrial notice of prior acts, applied only to Rule 404(b) extrinsic evidence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 402(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b914-11\">. Williams-Hill challenges the prior acts evidence as incredible, untrustworthy, and speculative. This argument lacks merit because \"credibility determinations are the exclusive province of the fact finder.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260, 1270 (11th Cir.2005). Williams-Hill also contends the prior acts were inadmissible because Gary spoke on the phone to a government agent during a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>recess. Williams-Hill has not, however, pointed to clearly-established, binding authority rendering the witness's testimony inadmissible. <em>See United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003) (\"[T]here can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving [the issue].\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
