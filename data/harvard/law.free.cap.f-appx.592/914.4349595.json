On appeal, Defendant argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) because his two prior convictions for possession of cocaine with the intent to sell or deliver, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1)(a), did not qualify as ACCA-predicate \u201cserious drug offense[s].\u201d We disagree, and affirm Defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">After Defendant entered his guilty plea, the probation office prepared Defendant\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). The probation officer calculated an initial base offense level of 26, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(1), because Defendant\u2019s offense involved a semi-automatic weapon capable of accepting a large-capacity magazine and he had at least two prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or controlled substance offense. Because he had trafficked in firearms, Defendant received a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), resulting in an offense level of 30. The probation officer also determined that Defendant was an armed career criminal subject to an offense level of 33 under \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B), because he had one prior conviction for a violent felony and three prior convictions for serious drug offenses. The probation officer then applied a three-level acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), yielding a total offense level of 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-13\">Defendant qualified for a criminal history'category of VI, based on both his numerous criminal convictions and on his armed career criminal status. As relevant here, the PSI noted that Defendant had two September 2011 convictions for possession of cocaine with the intent to sell or deliver, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1)(a). Based on a total offense level of 30 and his criminal history category of VI, Defendant\u2019s initial guideline range was 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, as an armed career criminal, Defendant was subject to a statutory minimum 15-year (180-month) term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Thus, Defendant\u2019s guideline range became 180 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-14\">Prior to and during his sentencing hearing, Defendant objected to the ACCA sentence enhancement. Defendant argued that his prior \u00a7 893.13(1)(a) convictions did not qualify as ACCA-predicate offenses because they failed to meet that statute\u2019s definition of \u201cserious drug offense[s].\u201d According to Defendant, his conyictions failed to meet that definition because \u00a7 893.13(1)(a) did not require the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the illicit nature of the controlled substance he possessed. The district court overruled this objection and sentenced Defendant to imprisonment for 180 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-15\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b939-16\">As he did before the district court, Defendant argues on appeal that his two pri- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>or \u00a7 893.13(1)(a) convictions do not qualify as ACCA-predicate \u201cserious drug offense[s].\u201d Defendant contends that, when applying the categorical approach, his \u00a7 893.13(1)(a) convictions do not fit within the generic federal definition of a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d because under Florida law, unlike federal law, the State is not required to prove that the defendant had knowledge of the illicit nature of the controlled substance he possessed. We review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>742 F.3d 949, 952 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Under the ACCA, a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is subject to a mandatory minimum, 15-year sentence if he has three prior convictions for a violent felony or \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). A \u201cserious drug offense\u201d is defined as \u201c(i) an offense under the Controlled Substances Act, ... or (ii) an offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ... for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law[.]\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(i), (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Defendant\u2019s argument that his \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) conviction for possessing cocaine with the intent to sell or deliver is not a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA is squarely foreclosed by this Court\u2019s recent precedent. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1268, 2014 WL 7250963, at *5 (11th Cir. Dec. 22, 2014) (holding that a conviction under \u00a7 893.13(1) is a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)). \u201cWe are bound by prior panel decisions unless or until we overrule them while sitting <em>en banc, </em>or they are overruled by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>635 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir.2011). Accordingly, we affirm Defendant\u2019s 180-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
