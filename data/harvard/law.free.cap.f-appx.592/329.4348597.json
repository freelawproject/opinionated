Loma argues that the district court erred by refusing to grant him a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. He maintains that he was incorrectly denied credit because his statement to the probation officer that he was involved in the conspiracy for three weeks, not three months, does not concern relevant conduct and did not impact his guidelines calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">We examine the denial of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under a standard of review even more deferential than a pure clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Angeles-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d 742, 753 (5th Cir.2005). We will affirm the denial of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1 unless the denial is without foundation. <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002). The defendant has the burden of demonstrating that he is entitled to a reduction. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>915 F.2d 947, 950 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">While Loma pleaded guilty and truthfully admitted his offense conduct in his factual resume, Lopez minimized his role in the conspiracy by diminishing the time period that he was involved in the conspiracy and by maintaining that the ledger found in his house was used in his construction business rather than to keep records of drug sales. The presentence report and addendum, which the district court adopted, relied on both these facts to support the denial of the adjustment. A defendant\u2019s attempt to minimize conduct provides a sufficient foundation for the denial of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. <em>United States v. Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d 163, 175-77 (5th Cir.2002). Given the foregoing, the district court\u2019s ruling that Loma had not accepted responsibility was not clearly erroneous or without foundation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
