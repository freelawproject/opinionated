In May 2012 Pritchett was convicted in Alabama state court of electronic solicitation of a child and enticing a child to enter for immoral purposes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In September 2012 Pritchett filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging that the two police officers who arrested him had violated his Fourth Amendment rights by searching his home and seizing his cell phone without a warrant or his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-16\">The district court referred the complaint to a magistrate judge for pre-service screening pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), and the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation concluding that the complaint should be dismissed under \u00a7 1915(e) (2) (B )(ii) for failure to state a claim. The sole basis for its conclusion was that the complaint sought damages based on an allegation that the police officers unlawfully entered Pritch-ett\u2019s home and seized a cell phone that was later introduced at his criminal trial to convict him of the charges for which he was still in prison. The magistrate judge believed that Pritchett\u2019s claim was foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>which held that a state prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit must be dismissed if \u201ca judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his [still-outstanding] conviction or sentence.\u201d 512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2372, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Pritchett objected, arguing that a favorable judgment in his \u00a7 1983 suit would not necessarily imply that his conviction was invalid because there was other inculpatory evidence introduced at his criminal trial, such as testimony by the victim. Though he did not cite to a specific portion of <em>Heck, </em>his argument is consistent with that decision\u2019s discussion of \u00a7 1983 suits based on unlawful search claims, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-17\">[A] suit for damages attributable to an allegedly unreasonable search may lie even if the challenged search produced evidence that was introduced in a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>criminal trial resulting in the \u00a7 1983 plaintiffs still-outstanding conviction. Because of doctrines like independent source and inevitable discovery, and especially harmless error, such a \u00a7 1983 action, even if successful, would not necessarily imply that the plaintiffs conviction was unlawful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 487 n. 7, 114 S.Ct. at 2372 n. 7 (citations omitted). The district court, however, was not persuaded and overruled Pritchett\u2019s objection. It reasoned that, \u201cgiven the specific allegations\u201d in Pritch-ett\u2019s complaint, \u201cthe search and seizure about which [he] complains could not be considered appropriate under any other legal doctrine, e.g., independent source.\u201d The district court then adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and ordered that Pritchett\u2019s claims against the officers .be dismissed without prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). In doing so, we liberally construe Pritchett\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The district court misapplied Heck\u2019s bar in two ways. First, the court overlooked circuit precedent construing the term \u201cnecessarily.\u201d This Court has understood that term to mean that <em>\u201cas long as it is possible </em>that a \u00a7 1983 suit would not negate the underlying conviction, then the suit is not Heck-barred.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Lee, </em>488 F.3d 876, 879-80 (11th Cir.2007) (emphasis added); <em>see also Datz v. Kilgore, </em>51 F.3d 252, 253 n. 1 (11th Cir.1995) (holding that <em>Heck </em>does not apply where the plaintiffs conviction in state court <em>\u201cmight </em>still be valid considering such doctrines \u00e1s inevitable discovery, independent source, and harmless error\u201d) (emphasis added). The slim record in this case leaves open the possibility that a judgment in favor of Pritchett would not implicate the validity of his convictions. The record includes Pritchett\u2019s three-paragraph <em>pro se </em>complaint and his four-page objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, which provide only the barest details about Pritchett\u2019s trial. For example, they do not even indicate which particular statutes Pritchett was convicted under, much less the nature and extent of any other evidence against him. Without more, we cannot conclude that a civil judgment for Pritchett would necessarily imply that his criminal convictions were invalid. <em>See Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1161 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cIn this case, the circumstances surrounding [the plaintiffs] convictions for burglary and receipt of stolen property are unknown from the record. It was impossible, therefore, for the district court to determine that a successful \u00a7 1983 action for unreasonable search and seizure <em>necessarily </em>implied the invalidity of those convictions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Second, the district court may have confused the legality of the search with the validity of the conviction. When it over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>ruled Pritchett\u2019s objection, the court did so on the ground that \u201cthe search and seizure about which [he] complains could not be considered appropriate under any other legal doctrine, e.g., independent source.\u201d But the exception to Heck\u2019s bar turns on whether a judgment for Pritchett in this \u00a7 1988 suit would necessarily imply the invalidity of his state court convictions, not on whether the search of his house could \u201cbe considered appropriate.\u201d <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487 n. 7, 114 S.Ct. at 2372 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Nor do the allegations in Pritchett\u2019s complaint foreclose the possibility that his state convictions \u201cmight still be valid\u201d in light of the doctrines discussed in <em>Heck. See Datz, </em>51 F.3d at 253 n. 1 (citing <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487 n. 7, 114 S.Ct. at 2372 n. 7). For instance, it may well be the case that the information from Pritchett\u2019s phone introduced at trial \u2014 which we assume (for present purposes only) was text messages or records of phone calls to the victim\u2014 would have been admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine because the police conceivably could have discovered that same evidence by looking at the victim\u2019s phone. <em>See id.; cf. Kabat v. State, </em>867 So.2d 1153, 1157 (Ala.Crim.App.2003) (discussing \u201cthe inevitable-discovery exception\u201d in Alabama criminal trials).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-12\">. Those are the descriptions that Pritchett provides in his <em>pro se </em>complaint. There are currently no filings in the record, such as a copy of the state court indictment or judgment, indicating which particular statutes Pritchett was convicted under.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\">. The magistrate judge read the <em>pro se </em>complaint as raising additional claims against the Wadley Police Department and the Randolph County Sheriff's Department. But Pritchett\u2019s objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation stated that those departments were listed as the addresses of the officers, not as separate parties. The district court nevertheless dismissed any claim that lie might have raised against the departments, citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Pritchett does not challenge that aspect of the district court's order, so we need not consider it. <em>See Hamilton v. Southland Christian Sch., Inc., </em>680 F.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir.2012) (holding that a party abandons an issue when it \u201dfail[s] to list or otherwise state it as an issue on appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
