On October 15, 2010, the District Court reduced Chambers\u2019s sentence to 130 months pursuant to the Government\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b) for providing the Government substantial assistance in its investigation of criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>On September 10, 2013, Chambers petitioned the District Court for a writ of mandamus compelling the Government to move the court under \u00a7 3553(e) for the imposition of a sentence below the five-year minimum sentence mandated by statute for the offense committed in his case. He argued that under the terms of the plea agreement, the Government, prior to his sentencing, was required to request a sentence below the five-year mandatory minimum. The District Court denied his petition, and he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">We review a district court\u2019s refusal to issue a writ of mandamus for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Stewart, </em>641 F.3d 1271, 1275 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cMandamus is an extraordinary remedy which should be utilized only in the clearest and most compelling of cases.\u201d <em>Cash v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1252, 1257 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation and alteration omitted). Thus, we have articulated three requirements for the issuance of a writ of mandamus: (1) the petitioner has a clear right to the relief requested; (2) the defendant has a clear duty to act; and (3) no other adequate remedy is available. <em>Id. </em>at 1258. Moreover, a petitioner must prove that his right to the issuance of the writ is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>In re BellSouth Corp., </em>334 F.3d 941, 953 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b), a district court may, upon the Government\u2019s motion, reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if the defendant provided substantial assistance, and the court has authority \u201cto reduce the sentence to a level below the minimum sentence established by statute.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b). Under \u00a7 3553(e), the court has the authority, upon the government\u2019s motion, \u201cto impose a sentence below a level established by statute as a minimum sentence so as -to reflect a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">We find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s denial of the writ. Chambers failed to demonstrate that, prior to sentencing, he had a clear right to, and the Government had a clear duty to file, a motion requesting that he be sentenced below the five-year mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
