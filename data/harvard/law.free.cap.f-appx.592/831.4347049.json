Belk, Nancy Greenwood, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Augusta, GA, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b856-13\">Andrew Magruder, Wilkinson <em>&amp; </em>Magru-der, LLP, Augusta, GA, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b856-15\">Before TJOFLAT, MARTIN and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b856-16\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b856-17\">A Southern District of Georgia jury found Nicklaus Grant guilty on both counts of an indictment: Count One, felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); Count Two, possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(k). After the District Court imposed sentence, concurrent prison terms of 96 months on Count One and 60 months on Count Two, Grant lodged this appeal. He seeks the reversal of his convictions on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to convict, and the vacation of his sentences as substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-19\">To establish Brant\u2019s guilt on Count One, the Government had to prove that (1) Brant was a convicted felon, (2) he knowingly possessed the firearms described in the indictment, and (3) the firearms were in or affected interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Howard, </em>742 F.3d 1334, 1341 (11th Cir.2014). His possession element would be established if he actually or constructively possessed the firearms. Direct or circumstantial evidence of constructive possession is sufficient to prove the ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>ment of knowing possession. <em>Howard, </em>742 F.3d at 1341. Constructive possession could be shown by evidence that Grant had ownership, dominion, or control over the firearm, or that he had the power and intent to exercise control over it. <em>Id. </em>To establish Grant\u2019s guilt on Count Two, the Government had to prove both that Grant possessed the firearm and that he knew that the serial number was obliterated. <em>United States v. Haile, </em>685 F.3d 1211, 1220 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain Grant\u2019s convictions. <em>United States v. Lebowitz, </em>676 F.3d 1000, 1013 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1492, 185 L.Ed.2d 547 (2013). We take the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, resolving any conflicts and accepting all reasonable inferences in favor of the jury\u2019s verdicts. <em>Lebowitz, </em>676 F.3d at 1013. Credibility questions were for the jury to resolve, and we assume that it resolved them <em>Id. </em>In the end, we must uphold Grant\u2019s convictions \u201cunless the jury could not have found [Grant] guilty under any reasonable construction of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Frank, </em>599 F.3d 1221, 1233 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Grant argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of the two counts of the indictment because the jury could not reasonably have believed Deputy Steppe\u2019s testimony that at the time of his arrest, he acknowledged possession of the three handguns described in the indictment. Nor could the jury have interpreted a phone call he made from jail as admitting that he possessed the guns. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Deputy Steppe responded to a 911 call Grant\u2019s wife, Wendy, made on the evening of March 14, 2013, complaining of a domestic disturbance at their residence involving a gun.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On Steppe\u2019s arrival at the residence, Wendy was noticeably upset. Grant and another man were loading boxes and personal items from the residence into a SUV. Wendy told Steppe that guns were in the SUV. He contacted an investigator and learned that the SUV was registered in the names of Wendy and Grant. She then gave him permission to search the vehicle. Grant told Steppe that the guns were in a safe inside a shoe box located in the rear passenger seat and gave Steppe the key to open the safe. Opened, the safe disclosed two revolvers, a semi-automatic handgun, a magazine, and some loose rounds of ammunition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The serial number of one of the guns was obliterated. After Steppe confirmed that Grant was a convicted felon, he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">Later in the evening of March 14, and while in jail, Grant made a monitored telephone call in which he stated, in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfUd\">They got three pistols, [expletive], they only charged me -with one, so [expletive] it, let that [expletive] ride.... I got all them guns in there. [Expletive], I\u2019m trying to figure out how to beat this one. I don\u2019t think I have enough money to beat all three of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">Given what Grant said over the telephone and his statements to Deputy Steppe, it was clearly within the jury\u2019s province to find that Grant possessed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>guns at issue, that the serial number on one of them had been obliterated, and that he was guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\"><em>Gall v. United States, </em>instructs that we cannot consider the substantive reasonableness of a sentence unless we are satisfied that the sentence is procedurally reasonable. 552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). That is, we must first \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Id. Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Grant does not contend that the District Court committed procedural error in fashioning his sentences; rather, it committed substantive error. Grant argues that the court gave too much weight to his criminal history and did not give any consideration to his history of providing for his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">We review the reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A district court abuses its discretion when it \u201c(1) fails to afford consideration to relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Campa, </em>459 F.3d 1121, 1174 (11th Cir.2006) <em>(en </em>banc). Reasonableness review encompasses the totality of the circumstances, and the party challenging the sentence has the burden of showing that it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d 1353, 1361 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">We ordinarily expect a sentence that falls within the guideline range to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). The district court must evaluate all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but it may attach great weight to one factor over the others. <em>Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d at 1361. We defer to the district court\u2019s judgment regarding the weight of the factors unless the court has made a clear error of judgment and has imposed a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences based on the facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 1361-62. Ultimately, the sentence imposed must be sufficient but not greater than necessary to satisfy the purposes for sentencing \u2022 set out in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). These purposes include the need for the sentence to: (1) reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense; (2) afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; and (3) protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">We find no substantive unreasonableness here; thus, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentences at issue. The court considered all of the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, gave due weight to Grant\u2019s criminal history and his family responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-8\">. According to Grant, who took the stand and testified in his defense, he married Wendy Grant in 2008; they were separated thereafter on two occasions; he filed for divorce in 2011; and on August 2, 2013, they were divorced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b857-13\">.
