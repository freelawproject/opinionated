Stat. \u00a7 794.011(5), is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). The district court determined that it was not and therefore declined to apply the 16-level enhancement that the guidelines provide for prior convictions of such crimes. The government appeals the district court\u2019s refusal to apply the guidelines enhancement, arguing that second-degree sexual battery qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">Raul Dagoberto Contreras, a national of El Salvador, pleaded guilty to illegally reentering the United States after removal for committing an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. The probation office generated a presentence investigation report (PSR), which assigned Contreras a base offense level of 8 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). Because Contreras had previously been convicted of second-degree sexual battery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 794.011(5), and because the probation office determined that this offense qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d it recommended a 16-level increase in Contreras\u2019 base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). After a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a)-(b), the probation office calculated a total offense level of 21. That offense level, coupled with Contreras\u2019 criminal history category of VI, yielded a guidelines range of 77 to 96 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">Contreras objected to the 16-level enhancement, arguing that this sexual battery offense is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), but only an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under subsection (b)(1)(C). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C),i a conviction for an aggravated felony warrants only an 8-level increase in the defendant\u2019s base offense level. The government countered that sexual battery is a crime of violence because it involves sexual contact without consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-16\">At sentencing, the district court noted that conviction under the Florida statute does not require physical force or violence. Because the court understood the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to require \u201csomething more than a nonconsensual touching,\u201d it determined that the 16-level enhancement recommended by the probation office was unwarranted. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>court further reasoned that, because we have not decided whether Florida\u2019s sexual battery offense is a crime of violence, it was \u201crequired to resolve this in favor of the defendant.\u201d As a result, the court sustained Contreras\u2019 objection to the 16-level enhancement and replaced it with an 8-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court calculated Contreras\u2019 offense level to be 13, which resulted in a guidelines range of 33 to 41 months imprisonment, and sentenced him to 36 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz-Calderone, </em>716 F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir.2013) (citation omitted). In making that determination, we generally apply the categorical approach first articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1336 (11th Cir.2010). The categorical approach compels us to \u201clook only at the fact of conviction and the statutory definition\u201d to determine whether a conviction under the statute would necessarily constitute a crime of violence. <em>United States v. Romo-Villalobos, </em>674 F.3d 1246, 1248 (11th Cir.2012). Under certain circumstances, we will also apply a \u201cmodified categorical approach,\u201d but neither party has requested the use of such a standard in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1336.</p>\n<p id=\"AP4\">When construing the meaning of sentencing guidelines, we are bound by the guidelines commentary. The commentary is \u201cauthoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cortes-Salazar, </em>682 F.3d 953, 954 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Wilks, </em>464 F.3d 1240, 1245 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cCommentary and Application Notes of the Sentencing Guidelines are binding on the courts unless they contradict the plain meaning of the text of the Guidelines.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AQq\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap0\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"A2O5\">The guidelines require a sentencing court to enhance the base offense level of a defendant convicted of illegal reentry by 16 if the defendant was previously deported after being convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The commentary accompanying this guideline defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-13\">forcible sex offenses (including where consent to the conduct is not given or is not legally valid, such as where consent to the conduct is involuntary, incompe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>tent, or coerced), statutory rape, sexual abuse of a minor ... or any other offense under federal, state, or local law which has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AY8\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(iii). The parenthetical statement delineating the scope of \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d was added by the Sentencing Commission in 2008 (the \u201c2008 Amendment\u201d). That amendment took effect nearly four years before the arrest of Contreras that led to the sentence at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Under Florida law, sexual battery means \u201coral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another or the anal or vaginal penetration of another by any other object.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 794.011(l)(h). The second-degree felony of which Contreras was convicted is established when a person \u201ccommits sexual battery upon a person 12 years of age or older, without that person\u2019s consent, and in the process thereof does not use physical force and violence likely to cause serious personal injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 794.011(5). Consent, in turn, is defined as \u201cintelligent, knowing, and voluntary consent\u201d and does not include coerced submission. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 794.011(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">We have not yet decided whether a conviction under Florida\u2019s second-degree sexual battery statute is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for the purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. However, we have held that a conviction for any of the offenses enumerated in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(iii) \u2014 which includes \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d \u2014 qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d regardless of whether the use of physical force is an element of the crime. <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1327. Thus, if we determine that Florida\u2019s second-degree felony of sexual battery is a \u201cforcible sex offense,\u201d then it is also a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Contreras argues that the sexual battery offense of which he was convicted is not categorically a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. The focal point of his argument is that, because \u00a7 749.011(5) does not require any sort of force \u2014 other than the force necessary to achieve \u201cpenetration\u201d or \u201cunion\u201d \u2014 it is not a <em>forcible </em>sex offense or a crime of violence. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 794.005 (\u201c[I]t was never intended that the sexual battery offense described in [\u00a7 ] 794.011(5) require any force or violence beyond the force and violence that is inherent in the accomplishment of \u2018penetration\u2019 or \u2018union.\u2019 \u201d). The very text of the statute makes clear that it deals with nonconsensual sexual contact in which a person \u201cdoes not use physical force and violence likely to cause serious personal injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 794.011(5). Contreras points out that nonconsensual \u201cunion\u201d of sexual organs is sufficient for a conviction under the statute and that \u201cunion\u201d has been defined as mere \u201ccontact.\u201d <em>See State v. Pate, </em>656 So.2d 1323, 1325-27 (Fla. 5th DCA 2010). To say that \u201cillicit non-consensual sexual conduct\u201d is a \u201cforcible sex offense,\u201d Contreras argues, is \u201cto read \u2018forcible\u2019 out of \u2018forcible sex offenses.\u2019 \u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">The 2008 Amendment to \u00a7 2L1.2 unambiguously defines as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d any forcible sex offense \u201cwhere consent to the conduct is not given or is not legally valid, such as where consent to the conduct is involuntary, incompetent, or coerced,\u201d and it includes \u201cstatutory rape.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(iii). That this definition includes sex offenses like second-degree sexual battery under Florida law is evidenced by the Sentencing Commission\u2019s explanation for the 2008 Amendment: \u201cThe amendment makes clear that forcible sex offenses ... are always classified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>\u2018crimes of violence,\u2019 regardless of whether the prior offense expressly has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C., Amend. 722 (2011) (citing U.S.S.G.App. C\u201e Amend. 658 (2011)). It may seem odd that the term <em>\u201cforcible </em>sexual offenses\u201d is defined to include crimes that do not have physical force as an element but, as Toni Morrison observed, \u201cDefinitions belong to the definers, not the defined.\u201d Toni Morrison, <em>Beloved </em>190 (1987); <em>see also Stansell v. Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, </em>704 F.3d 910, 915 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201cIn general, statutory definitions control the meaning of a statute\u2019s terms.\u201d). The definer in this instance is the Sentencing Commission which authored the 2008 Amendment the meaning of which could hardly be any clearer.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The Sentencing Commission\u2019s discussion of case law provides additional support for the proposition that Contreras\u2019 offense qualifies as a \u201cforcible sex offense\u201d and, thus, a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d As the Commission explains, the 2008 Amendment clarifies that the scope of \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d includes crimes where there is \u201cassent in fact but no legally valid consent.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C., Amend. 722 (2011). The examples the Commission cites are <em>United States v. Gomez-Gomez, </em>493 F.3d 562, 564 (5th Cir.2007), where the Fifth Circuit held that a prior conviction under California\u2019s forcible rape statute was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because it allowed for \u201crape by deception,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <em>United States v. Sarmiento-Funes, </em>374 F.3d 336, 341 (5th Cir.2004), which excluded from the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d a Missouri sexual assault statute because it allowed for conviction where the victim assented while intoxicated. Both of those decisions preceded the 2008 Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"AV7\">The pre-amendment definition of \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d did not include the parenthetical \u201c(including where consent to the conduct is not given or is not legally valid, such as where consent to the conduct is involuntary, incompetent, or coerced).\u201d Construing the pre-amendment definition, the Fifth and Ninth Circuits held that sex offenses involving noneonsensual sexual contact could not be categorically classified as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d if they did not require some level of physical force. <em>United States v. Beltran-Munguia, </em>489 F.3d 1042, 1051 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201c[Because [the Oregon statute] does not make \u2018the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\u2019 an element of the crime ... [defendant\u2019s] prior conviction does not qualify as a \u2018crime of violence.... \u2019 \u201d); <em>Sar-miento-Funes, </em>374 F.3d at 341 (\u201cSince some (though not all) methods of violating the Missouri statute do not require the use of physical force against the victim, the statute therefore does not have, <em>as an element, </em>the use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d). Nor could such crimes be \u201cforcible sex offenses.\u201d <em>Bel-tran-Munguia, </em>489 F.3d at 1051 (\u201cNot surprisingly, given its language, we have interpreted the phrase \u2018forcible sex offenses\u2019 as requiring the use of force.\u201d); <em>Sarmiento-Funes, </em>374 F.3d at 344 (\u201c[T]he adjective \u2018forcible\u2019 centrally denotes a species of force that either approximates the concept of forcible compulsion or, at least, does not embrace some of the assented-to-but-not-consented-to conduct at issue here.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>After the 2008 Amendment, however, both of those circuits changed their tunes. The Fifth Circuit recognized that \u201cthe amended definition of forcible sex offense has supplanted this Circuit\u2019s previous definition of the term,\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz-Corado, </em>648 F.3d 290, 294 (5th Cir.2011), and held that a defendant who \u201cengag[es] in sexual conduct with an individual who cannot legally give consent because of physical ailment or mental illness\u201d commits a \u201cforcible sex offense,\u201d <em>United States v. Herrera, </em>647 F.3d 172, 179 (5th Cir.2011). Meanwhile, the Ninth Circuit has held that, \u201cunder the 2008 Amendment, indicia of additional force or violence [are] no longer required for the enhancement so long as consent to the sex offense was shown to be lacking.\u201d <em>United States v. Gallegos-Galindo, </em>704 F.3d 1269, 1272 (9th Cir.2013). Other circuits\u2019 rulings on the issue have also defined \u201cforcible sex offense\u201d to include nonconsensual sexual contact that does not involve physical force beyond the sexual contact itself. <em>See United States v. Rangel-Castaneda, </em>709 F.3d 373, 380 (4th Cir.2013) (concluding that, under the amended definition of \u201cforcible sex offense,\u201d the \u201crequisite compulsion need not be physical in nature\u201d); <em>United States v. Reyes-Alfonso, </em>653 F.3d 1137, 1142 (10th Cir.2011) (\u201c[W]hen an offense involves sexual contact with another person, it is necessarily forcible when that person does not consent.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Applying this definition of \u201cforcible sex offense,\u201d the conclusion that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 794.011(5) qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is inescapable. In order to be convicted under the statute, a defendant must have committed an act of sexual contact or penetration without the victim\u2019s consent. <em>See Khianthalat v. State, </em>974 So.2d 359, 362 (Fla.2008) (\u201cTo constitute sexual battery under [\u00a7 794.011(5) ], the State must prove the victim did not consent.\u201d). Because consent under Florida law does not include \u201ccoerced submission\u201d and must be \u201cintelligent, knowing, and voluntary,\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 794.011(l)(a), any nonconsensual sexual contact will satisfy the guidelines definition of \u201cforcible sex offense,\u201d which includes situations in which \u201cconsent to the conduct is not given or is not legally valid, such as where consent to the conduct is involuntary, incompetent, or coerced.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"Aao\">Our conclusion that sexual battery under \u00a7 794.011(5) is a \u201cforcible sex offense\u201d and therefore a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is reinforced by the Fifth Circuit\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Garza-Guijan, </em>714 F.3d 332 (5th Cir.2013). In that case, the Fifth Circuit was presented with precisely the same issue that we face today \u2014 whether a violation of \u00a7 794.011(5) qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. In holding that it did, the Fifth Circuit explained that the defendant \u201cplainly was convicted of an offense proscribing sexual conduct \u2018where consent ... is not given or ... is involuntary\u2019 and this conviction falls squarely within the Guidelines category of \u2018forcible sex offenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(iii)). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"AcQ\">For these reasons, we conclude that \u00a7 794.011(5) falls within the definition of \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d and is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The district court therefore erred by applying only an 8-level enhancement to Contreras\u2019 base offense level. In making that determination, the district court apparently relied on precedent from the Supreme Court which held that a defendant\u2019s prior battery conviction under Florida law was not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). However, the Supreme Court in <em>Johnson </em>was dealing with a different issue \u2014 the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA, not the amended definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The district court\u2019s confusion in this respect is understandable, for we have observed that \u201cwhether a crime constitutes a \u2018violent felony\u2019 under the ACCA involves an inquiry strikingly similar to that in determining whether a conviction is a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) inasmuch as the definitions for both are virtually identical.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>586 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). However, the sentencing guideline at issue in this case, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, \u201cdefines \u2018crime of violence\u2019 very differently than the ACCA does,\u201d <em>Cortes-Salazar, </em>682 F.3d at 957, so cases dealing with the definition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA are not applicable here. For this reason, reliance on <em>Johnson </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">We vacate Contreras\u2019 sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-6\">. Contreras requested the 8-level enhancement applicable to \"aggravated felonies\" in his written objection to the PSR. At sentencing, however, he argued that his prior conviction did not qualify even as an \"aggravated felony\u201d and that he should have only received a 4-level enhancement for being convicted of \"any other felony\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(c). Contreras has not appealed the district court\u2019s application of the 8-level \"aggravated felony\u201d enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Aq_I\">. Because <em>Descamps v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), primarily addresses when it is proper to use the modified categorical approach and we decide the case now before us using the categorical approach, the limitations set forth in <em>Descamps </em>play no part in our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b620-5\">. The example of \"rape by deception\u201d the court gave was an employer threatening to fire an employee unless the employee had sex with him. That conduct would be sufficient to convict under the California statute at issue in that case, but the Fifth Circuit concluded that it would not be a forcible sex offense under the sentencing guidelines. <em>Gomez-Gomez, </em>493 F.3d at 567.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b621-6\">. Even before the 2008 Amendment and its decision in <em>Reyes-Alfonso, </em>the Tenth Circuit had determined that nonconsensual sexual contact was a forcible sex offense regardless of whether the crime required physical compulsion. <em>See United States v. Romero-Hernandez, </em>505 F.3d 1082, 1089 (10th Cir.2007). It merely reaffirmed that judgment in <em>Reyes-Alfonso, </em>noting that the 2008 Amendment lent additional support.
