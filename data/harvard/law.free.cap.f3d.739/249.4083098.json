He argues that the evidence adduced at trial was not sufficient to support his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-22\">Because Vasquez-Garcia did not preserve his sufficiency challenges, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Delgado, </em>672 F.3d 320, 328-31 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 525, 184 L.Ed.2d 339 (2012). To show plain error, Vasquez-Garcia must establish that \u201cthe record is <em>devoid of evidence </em>pointing to guilt or [that] the evidence is so tenuous that a conviction is shocking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To convict Vasquez-Garcia under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii), the Government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-25\">(1) an alien entered or remained in the United States in violation of the law, (2) [Vasquez-Garcia] transported the alien within the United States with intent to further the alien\u2019s unlawful presence, and (3) [Vasquez-Garcia] knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that the alien was in the country in violation of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-26\"><em>United States v. Nolasco-Rosas, </em>286 F.3d 762, 765 (5th Cir.2002) (footnote citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-27\">While Vasquez-Garcia argues that his own attestations of innocence were more credible than the testimony of Government witnesses that established his guilty knowledge and intent, we will not second-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>guess the jury\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>See Ramirez v. Dretke, </em>398 F.3d 691, 695 (5th Cir.2005). Considering the evidence adduced at trial, Vasquez-Garcia fails to show that the record is devoid of evidence of his guilt. <em>See Delgado, </em>672 F.3d at 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
