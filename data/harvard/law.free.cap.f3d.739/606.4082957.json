(Urology) and University of Alabama at Birmingham Health System West (UAB West), respectively. Because Appellants failed to pay their debts, Urology and UAB West referred the accounts to appellee Franklin Collection Service, Inc. (Franklin). As part of the referral, Urology and UAB West added to Appellants\u2019 accounts a charge for collection fees. It is this charge that prompted Appellants to file suit against Franklin, alleging violations of Alabama state law, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692-1692p, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>parties moved for summary judgment. The district court denied Appellants\u2019 motion on all claims except for Calma\u2019s unjust enrichment claim and granted Franklin\u2019s motion. After the district court\u2019s ruling, Appellants filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice Calma\u2019s unjust enrichment claim. Their motion was granted, and the case was dismissed with prejudice. Appellants now appeal the district court\u2019s decision to grant Franklin\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of Franklin on Bradley\u2019s claim under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f of the FDCPA. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision granting Franklin\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all remaining claims raised in this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment decision de novo, applying the same legal standards as those that governed the district court. <em>Capone v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>592 F.3d 1189, 1194 (11th Cir.2010). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). We construe the facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Walters v. Am. Coach Lines of Miami, Inc., </em>575 F.3d 1221, 1226 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). We therefore state the facts in the light most favorable to the Appellants, the non-moving party.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A7s\">A <em>UAB West</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">UAB West is a healthcare institution operating under the control of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Health System (UAB). UAB manages healthcare delivery and billing for its hospitals, including UAB West. UAB and UAB West contracted with Franklin to collect unpaid medical bills. UAB West\u2019s agreement with Franklin involved adding a 30% collection fee to all accounts UAB West referred for collection. The agreement also gave Franklin the right to pursue collection lawsuits on UAB\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">In 2007, Appellant Calma incurred a $735 bill when he took his daughter to UAB West for treatment. Calma failed to pay his bill. In response, UAB West sent him three separate statements, warning that, pursuant to their agreement, if Cal-ma failed to pay, UAB West would send his account to a collection agency. The agreement Calma signed with UAB West stated, in part, \u201cI agree that if this account is not paid when due, and the hospital should retain an attorney or collection agency for collection, I agree to pay all costs of collection including reasonable interest, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees (even if suit is filed) and reasonable collection agency fees.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Calma never paid UAB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>West. According to its debt collection policy, UAB added a 30% collection fee to his account and referred his account to Franklin for collection. With the 30% added collection fee, Calma owed UAB West $922.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">\n<em>B. Urology</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Urology is a healthcare provider that also uses Franklin to collect unpaid medical bills. The collection contract between Urology and Franklin stated that Urology would add 33-and-l/3% to a debt prior to transferring the account to Franklin. The contract also stipulated that Franklin was entitled to 30% of the total collected from each debt. Critically, Bradley was not a party to this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">In 2009, Appellant Bradley received medical treatment from Urology and incurred a bill for $861.96. Like Calma, Bradley also signed a patient agreement, which stated: \u201cIn the event of non-payment ... I agree to pay all costs of collection, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.... \u201d Also like Calma, Bradley failed to pay his medical bill. As a result, Urology added a $293.06 collection fee to Bradley\u2019s balance. Urology then sent his account to Franklin for collection. Bradley\u2019s new balance due to Urology was $1,155.02. To avoid being sued, Bradley paid the $1,155.02 and reserved his right to recover overcharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">In enacting the FDCPA, Congress sought \u201cto eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent State action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(e). The FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from using \u201cany false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt\u201d as well as the use of \u201cunfair or unconscionable\u201d means of collection. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692e, 1692f. Here, the sole issue is Bradley\u2019s claim under \u00a7 1692f. We affirm the district court on all other issues raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">Section 1692f prohibits unfair ' or unconscionable means of collection. Subsection (1) of this section specifically prohibits \u201ccollection of any amount (including any interest, fee, charge, or expense incidental to the principal obligation) unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(l). Bradley argues that the collection fee he paid violates this section of the FDCPA because the fee was really liquidated damages rather than the actual cost of collection. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">While the Eleventh Circuit has not previously addressed this issue, we find the Eighth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Kojetin v. CU Recovery, Inc., </em>212 F.3d 1318, 1318 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam), to be persuasive. There, the Eighth Circuit held that the debt collector violated the FDCPA when it charged the debtor a collection fee based on a percentage of the principal balance of the debt due rather than the actual cost of collection. <em>Id. </em>That is what happened here. When Bradley signed Urology\u2019s patient registration form, he only agreed to pay \u201call costs of collection.\u201d That is, Bradley agreed to pay the actual costs of collection; his contractual agreement with Urology did not require him to pay a collection agency\u2019s percentage-based fee where that fee did not correlate to the costs of collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">Before Urology handed over Bradley\u2019s delinquent account to Franklin, it added a 33-and-l/3% \u201ccollection fee.\u201d Franklin failed to direct this Court to any evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>that the 33-and-l/3% \u201ccollection fee\u201d\u2014 which was assessed <em>before </em>Franklin attempted to collect the balance due \u2014 bears any correlation to the <em>actual </em>cost of Franklin\u2019s collection effort. As such, the 33-and-l/3% fee breaches the agreement between Bradley and Urology, since, contractually, Bradley was only obligated to pay the \u201ccosts of collection.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Urology and Franklin cannot alter Bradley\u2019s obligations by the terms of their subsequent agreement. Because there was no express agreement between Urology and Bradley allowing for collection of the 33- and-1/3% fee, that fee violates the FDCPA. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(e); <em>see also Kojetin, </em>212 F.3d at 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">This is not to say that Bradley and Urology could not have formed an agreement allowing for the collection of the percentage-based fee. It is the nature of the agreement between Bradly and Urology, not simply the amount of the fee that is important here. For example, Plaintiff Calma agreed to pay, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201creasonable collection agency fees.\u201d And, based on this contractual language, Calma declined to argue on appeal that the agreement that he had with UAB West did not cover Franklin\u2019s percentage-based collection fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Courts examining other contractual language have also suggested that a percentage-based fee can be appropriate if the contracting parties agreed to it. For example, the Seventh Circuit suggested that the following contractual provision may allow the imposition of a percentage-based collection fee when a delinquent account was referred to a third-party collection agency: \u201cYou agree to reimburse us the fees of any collection agency, which may be based on a percentage at a maximum of 33% of the debt, and all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, we incur in such collection efforts.\u201d <em>See Seeger v. AFNI, Inc., </em>548 F.3d 1107, 1110, 1113 (7th Cir.2008); <em>see also Boatley v. Diem Corp., </em>No. CIV. 03-0762-PHX-SMM, 2004 WL 5315892, *5-6 (D.Ariz. Mar. 24, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">But, Bradley\u2019s contract with Urology was not like Calma\u2019s contract with UAB West or the contracts from these other cases. Under the contract at issue here, Bradley agreed to pay the actual costs of collection; he did not agree to pay a percentage above the amount of his outstanding debt that was unrelated to the actual costs to collect that debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Franklin argues that <em>Kojetin </em>is distinguishable because it holds that a violation of the FDCPA only occurs where the debt collector charges a percentage-based fee not supported by the language of the underlying agreement. But that is exactly what we have here. As explained above, the agreement creating the debt \u2014 the patient agreement between Urology and Bradley \u2014 only allows a charge for \u201ccosts of collection.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Nowhere on the form does Bradley agree to a collection fee that is not tied to the actual costs of collection, let alone the 33-and-l/3% \u201ccollection fee\u201d he was ultimately assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">We therefore hold that Franklin violated the FDCPA when it collected from Bradley a debt that included a 33-and-l/3% \u201ccollection fee\u201d when Bradley only agreed to pay the actual costs of collection. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of Franklin on Bradley\u2019s claim under \u00a7 1692f of the FDCPA. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment on Appellants\u2019 RICO claims, remaining FDCPA claims, and state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-14\">. Based on the district court\u2019s order and the parties\u2019 briefing on appeal, it appears that only Bradley appeals his claims under the FDCPA and state law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-5\">.In a footnote, Franklin notes that Appellants also appeal the district court's order denying their motion for class certification. However, class certification is never mentioned in Appellants\u2019 briefing. Because Appellants did not brief the issue, we consider it waived. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that \"a legal claim or argument that has not been briefed before the court is deemed abandoned and its merits will not be addressed\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AUP\">. Because we find Appellants\u2019 remaining FDCPA claims, RICO claims, and claims under state law unavailing, we affirm those claims based on the thorough and well-reasoned order of the district court entered on March 28, 2013.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AS1\">. Unlike Bradley, Calma did not appeal Franklin\u2019s collection fee based on a violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f. And, unlike Bradley\u2019s agreement, Calma\u2019s agreement explicitly provided that Calma agreed to pay \u201creasonable collection agency fees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
