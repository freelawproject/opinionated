Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s judgment revoking supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). In exercising this discretion, the district court must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2005). The district court abuses its discretion when it fails or refuses to exercise its discretion or when its exercise of discretion is flawed by an erroneous legal or factual premise. <em>See James v. Jacobson, </em>6 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.1993). To revoke supervised release, the district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). We have reviewed the record and find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Young\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Before <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we reviewed a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>Davis, </em>53 F.3d at 642. This court has not yet decided whether, after <em>Booker, </em>the proper standard is reasonableness. However, Young\u2019s revocation sentence was within the advisory Chapter 7 revocation range of 7-13 months and can be affirmed under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment revoking Young\u2019s supervised release. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
