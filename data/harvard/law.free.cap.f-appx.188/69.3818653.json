At the time of the incidents, Carroway was appearing before the court in criminal proceedings pending against him. His complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim by the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The District Court found that all named defendants were immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment or judicial or prosecutorial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Carroway has filed a petition for a writ of mandamus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 asking us to direct the New Jersey Attorney General\u2019s Office to \u201cproceed with an investigation of the actions, inactions, [and] behaviors\u201d of the defendants in his civil suit. The \u201cscope of the investigation\u201d should \u201cencompass the necessary remedies,\u201d including, \u201cthe dismissal of criminal charges for all violations charged to the Petitioner.\u201d Carroway also asks that we \u201corder the Superior Court of New Jersey, the Superior Court of Morris County, the Superior Court of Union County, and [t]he Honorable Joseph A. Falcone, and [Prosecutor] Victor R. Jusino, Esq., to recuse themselves from ... Petitioner\u2019s criminal matters.\u201d Petition at 4, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Mandamus is a \u201cdrastic remedy\u201d which is generally used only to \u201c \u2018confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kerr v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976) (citations omitted). Only \u201c \u2018exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial \u201cusurpation of power\u201d \u2019 \u201d warrant the use of this extraordinary remedy. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The relief sought by Carroway is well outside the scope of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">To the extent that Carroway\u2019s requests for relief may be read as asking us to reverse the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint, this petition is not the proper vehicle. To be entitled to the writ, a petitioner must show that there are no other adequate means to obtain the relief sought. <em>See Oracare DPO, Inc. v. Merin, </em>972 F.2d 519, 522-23 (3d Cir.1992). A mandamus petition is not a substitute for an appeal; if a petitioner can obtain relief by an ordinary appeal, a court will not issue the writ. <em>See In Re Ford Motor Co., </em>110 F.3d 954, 957 (3d Cir.1997). Here, Carroway has an alternate means to raise his challenge to the District Court\u2019s ruling in the form of an appeal. Indeed, Carroway appealed the District Court\u2019s decision and his appeal is currently pending. <em>See </em>C.A. No. 06-3087.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">Accordingly, we will deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
