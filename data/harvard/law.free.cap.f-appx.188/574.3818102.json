Robart, United States District Judge for the Western District of Washington, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b599-23\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-24\">Alberto Terriquez-Flores appeals his conviction and corresponding sentence for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960, importation of marijuana, and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm the conviction but vacate the sentence and remand the case back to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Terriquez-Flores contests the admission of the Mexican vehicle registration and the gasoline receipts found in his vehicle. We need not decide whether the district court abused its discretion in admitting these documents. If any error occurred, it was non-prejudicial because the defendant later testified that the vehicle was registered in his name, that the registration placed in evidence by the government was authentic, and that the gas receipts were an accurate reflection of gasoline purchases he made during a pri- or trip to California. <em>See Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, </em>168 F.2d 846, 856 (9th Cir.1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">There was no <em>Brady </em>violation. Agent Tracy\u2019s secondary report, dated February 7, 2005, was given to Terriquez-Flores during the lunch recess on the first full day of trial, February 8, 2005. At this time, the government had not yet rested and Agent Tracy had only just finished testifying. The report could have been used by Terriquez-Flores during the trial. Thus, any delay in the disclosure of the report did not prejudice TerriquezFlores\u2019s preparation or presentation of his defense such that he was prevented from receiving a fair trial. <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>844 F.2d 1397, 1403 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The district court properly exercised its discretion to neutralize any potential bias in the jury exhibit requests and questions. A trial judge enjoys \u201cwide discretion\u201d in responding to questions from members of the jury. <em>Arizona v. Johnson, </em>351 F.3d 988, 994 (9th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 836, 125 S.Ct. 254, 160 L.Ed.2d 57 (2004). Here, the trial judge properly used his discretion to neutralize biases inherent in the jury questions and requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">With regard to TerriquezFlores\u2019s sentence, the district court did not clearly err by denying Terriquez-Flores the minor role adjustment to his sentence. Based on evidence in the record, the district court judge determined that Terriquez-Flores\u2019s role was not minor. The trial court did, however, err by imposing an obstruction enhancement because it failed to make an explicit finding that Terriquez-Flores\u2019s false testimony was material. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>300 F.3d 1166, 1171 (9th Cir.2002). Consequently, we remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Conviction AFFIRMED; sentence VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b599-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b600-10\">REINHARDT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AR6\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">I concur with the majority\u2019s resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims with the exception of its conclusion that the district court did not err in denying Terriquez-Flores a minor role adjustment to his sentence. The district judge did not determine that Terriquez-Flores\u2019 role in a larger drug trafficking scheme was not minor, nor did he conclude that Terriquez-Flores was not a part of such a scheme. Instead, he made clear that he refused to consider granting a minor role adjustment in cases such as the one before us\u2014notwithstanding the fact that such an adjustment is authorized under section 3B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines\u2014because he simply disagreed with the Guidelines\u2019 authorization of the reduction. In doing so, he erred. <em>See United States v. Webster, </em>996 F.2d 209, 211 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Even after the Sentencing Guidelines were made non-mandatory by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district judge is not free to disregard one of the Guidelines merely because he disagrees with it. <em>See United States v. Menyweather, </em>447 F.3d 625 (9th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Kimbrew, </em>406 F.3d 1149, 1152 (9th Cir.2005). Accordingly, I would hold that the district judge erred by refusing to consider granting the minor role adjustment to appellant and would remand for resentencing in that respect as well.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
