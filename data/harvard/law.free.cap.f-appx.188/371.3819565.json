For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Davis first argues that the district court violated her Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it sentenced her to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment based on judge-found facts. Because the district court sentenced Davis pursuant to an advisory guidelines regime and did not use judicially-found facts to sentence her beyond the statutory maximum, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, we find no Sixth Amendment violation. <em>United States v. Stone, </em>432 F.3d 651, 654-55 (6th Cir.2005) (holding that district courts continue to \u201ccalculate the Guideline range as they would have done prior to <em>Booker, </em>\u201d finding facts by a preponderance of the evidence and taking into account the relevant factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Davis next argues that the evidence does not support a finding that she was an organizer or leader within the meaning of USSG \u00a7 3B1.1 and, thus, the district court clearly erred in applying this guideline. Under this guideline, the court generally considers \u2018the defendant\u2019s exercise of decision-making authority, any recruitment of accomplices, \u2018the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime,\u2019 the degree of participation in planning the offense, and the degree of control the defendant exercised over others.\u201d <em>United States v. Vandeberg, </em>201 F.3d 805, 811 (6th Cir.2000) (quoting USSG \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt n. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">The evidence that Davis was an organizer or leader in this case is considerable. Davis admitted that she devised the scheme, carried it out, and showed others how to further the scheme by accessing the computer and generating fraudulent checks. She also wrote a letter congratulating her co-conspirators for their efforts, referring to herself as \u201cTiffany the Great,\u201d and demonstrating her role as organizer and leader. Therein, she advised eo-conspirators to deposit the checks into their bank accounts, to refrain from signing them over to anyone for cash, and told them whom to call for check verification. She also instructed the others to call her immediately if they had questions: \u201cDo not make any decisions on your own always call me first.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">Based on the above, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that the guideline applied. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
