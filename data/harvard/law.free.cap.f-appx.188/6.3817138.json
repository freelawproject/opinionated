Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(c)(2), Attorney General Alberto R.

We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-18\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 158 (2d Cir.2004). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-19\">Upon our review of the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility determination of the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-20\">As the IJ\u2019s decision denying Lian\u2019s claim for withholding of removal was based on her denial of asylum, that decision is also supported by substantial evidence. The IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief was also proper, as there is no evidence in the record that it is more likely than not that Lian would be tortured if he returned to China. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>see also Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 133 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED in all respects. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this proceeding is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this proceeding is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this proceeding is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2) and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
