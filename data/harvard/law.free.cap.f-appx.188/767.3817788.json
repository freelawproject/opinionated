TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">Defendant-Appellant Dewayne E. Christiansen appeals 180-month concurrent sentences imposed after he was convicted of two counts of bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). Christiansen argues that the district court\u2019s sentence was unreasonable because it departed upward by six offense levels after it concluded the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) did not adequately account for his extensive criminal history. The additional offense levels increased Christiansen\u2019s minimum sentence from 92 months to 151 months. Since the district court correctly applied USSG \u00a7 4A1.3 in deciding upon a six-level upward departure, and Christiansen has failed to otherwise demonstrate that his sentence is unreasonable, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-16\">I. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b792-17\">Christiansen and co-defendant Taylor Garrison, Jr. were indicted on two counts of bank robbery. After Christiansen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>pleaded guilty, the presentence report calculated his criminal history category as VI and his offense level as 23, yielding a Guideline range of 92-115 months for each robbery. The report noted that Christian-sen had an additional 27 felony convictions that were not used in the criminal history calculation because of their age. At sentencing, the district court determined that the Guidelines did not adequately account for Christiansen\u2019s criminal history. The court therefore invoked USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and departed upward six levels in its calculation of the applicable Guideline sentence. This resulted in an offense level of 29, which, when combined with Christiansen\u2019s criminal history category of VI, yielded a recommended Guideline range of 151-188 months. The court sentenced Christian-sen to two concurrent terms of 180 months.</p>\n<p id=\"AzG\">Christiansen argued at sentencing and maintains on appeal that the district court acted unreasonably when it imposed sentences of 180 months. Christiansen contends that the district court should not have applied USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a) and that doing so resulted in a sentence unreasonable in light of the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-15\">While we have held that an \u201cextreme divergence\u201d from the applicable Guideline range must be supported by \u201cdramatic facts\u201d in order to be reasonable, we require only an \u201cappropriate justification\u201d where the sentence is more moderately separated from the Guideline recommendation. <em>See United States v. Cage, </em>451 F.3d 585 (10th Cir.2006) (reversing a non-Guidelines sentence of six days for unreasonableness where the minimum advisory Guideline sentence was 46 months and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>district court had already decided that a departure under the Guidelines themselves would be inappropriate). Moreover, a sentencing court \u201cis not required to consider individually each factor listed in \u00a7 3553(a) before issuing a sentence,\u201d and we will \u201cnot demand that the district court recite any magic words to show us that it fulfilled its responsibility to be mindful of the factors that Congress has instructed it to consider.\u201d <em>United States v. Contreras-Martinez, </em>409 F.3d 1236, 1242 (10th Cir.2005). Nonetheless, we turn to a consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as they apply to Christiansen\u2019s sentence to determine whether they were properly taken into account by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Section 3553(a)(1) mandates consideration of \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d Here, Christiansen\u2019s history and characteristics were plainly considered by the district court when it decided to enhance under USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a) in light of Christiansen\u2019s extensive criminal record. The next factor requires that the sentencing court balance the need for the sentence imposed to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">(A) reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-6\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The district court concluded that Christiansen deserved a higher sentence in light of this factor. His extensive criminal history demonstrated a longstanding lack of respect for the law, his offense was of a serious nature, prior convictions have obviously failed to deter him from criminal conduct, and the public clearly required protection from Christian-sen\u2019s demonstrated penchant for criminality.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">The next three factors mandate that the sentencing court consider the kinds of sentences available, the applicable Guideline sentencing range, and any pertinent policy statements in the Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(3)-(5). These factors were explicitly considered by the district court when it acknowledged the initial Guideline range and decided that an enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a) was appropriate. The enhanced sentence is reasonable in light of these factors for the same reason that the enhancement was itself appropriate under the Guidelines: the Guidelines significantly under-represented Christiansen\u2019s criminal career.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">Finally, \u00a7 3553(a)(6) requires the district court be cognizant of \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d Christiansen\u2019s sentence is undeniably disparate from the typical sentence imposed for bank robbery; however, this factor cautions only against <em>unwarranted </em>sentence disparity. Christiansen\u2019s enhanced sentence was warranted by his exceptional criminal record and the inability of the Guidelines to properly account for his criminal history absent a USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a) departure. Therefore, Christiansen\u2019s sentence is reasonable under this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">In sum, a review of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors discloses that the district court did not impose an unreasonable sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>II. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we find Christiansen\u2019s sentence to be reasonable and AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b792-18\">This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

It is worth noting that Christiansen\u2019s sentence was properly enhanced under USSG \u00a7 4A1.3.

The same can be said of those portions of the Guidelines which explicitly provide for circumstances in which a departure may be necessary in order to achieve a reasonable sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
