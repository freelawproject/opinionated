Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court resentenced Underwood to the same term as before\u2014100 months. Underwood appeals, raising a series of challenges to his second sentencing proceeding. Because the district court satisfied the procedural requirements of our cases in resentencing Underwood and because it issued a substantively reasonable sentence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-25\">On January 21, 2004, state police stopped Underwood in Battle Creek, Michigan. He pulled into a parking lot, then attempted to evade the police on foot. The officers caught him and found 28.18 grams of cocaine base, a Ruger P89 9mm handgun and $696 in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-26\">On July 6, 2004, Underwood pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm as well as to possession with the intent to deliver 28.18 grams of cocaine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>base. Applying mandatory sentencing guidelines, the district court sentenced Underwood to concurrent 100-month prison terms for the two offenses. In the aftermath of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court (with the parties\u2019 consent) remanded the case to the district court for resentencing. On December 1, 2005, the district court, applying advisory guidelines, resentenced Underwood to concurrent 100-month sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">We review the sentencing decision of a district court for procedural and substantive reasonableness and accord a sentence within the advisory guidelines range that satisfies the procedural requirements of <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing a presumption of substantive reasonableness. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>436 F.3d 706, 708 (6th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>437 F.3d 550, 553-54 (6th Cir.2006). Each of Underwood\u2019s challenges to his sentence is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Underwood initially contends that the sentencing court did not appropriately consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in calculating his sentence. While a district judge must consider the \u201cfactors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d <em>United States v. Webb, </em>403 F.3d 373, 383 (6th Cir.2005), we have \u201cnever required the \u2018ritual incantation\u2019 of the factors to affirm a sentence,\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>403 F.3d 813, 816 (6th Cir.2005). In this instance, the district judge adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">During the sentencing hearing: the district court noted that \u201cthis offense involved both drugs and a weapon, which is an extremely dangerous combination.\u201d JA 100; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (\u201cThe court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider\u2014(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d). The court noted that if it issued a shorter sentence, it remained concerned about what Underwood would do next given the unfortunate trajectory of his criminal behavior. JA 101; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C) (referring to \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d). The court noted that the sentence would give Underwood time to \u201cwork on his GED.\u201d JA 101; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D) (referring to \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner\u201d). And the court noted that similar offenders had been sentenced similarly. JA 100; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (referring to \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct\u201d). As these examples illustrate, whether or not the district court considered each \u00a7 3553(a) factor in form (ie., by naming each subsection), it plainly considered them in substance, which is what matters. <em>See Williams, </em>436 F.3d at 708-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">In addition to this general challenge to the procedural reasonableness of his sentence, Underwood makes two specific procedural arguments: that the district judge failed to account for his age and failed to account for the disparity in the guidelines between sentences relating to crack cocaine and powder cocaine. We disagree on both fronts.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">As to defendant\u2019s contention that his youth counseled in favor of a downward variance, the court rejected the contention for several reasons. It noted that Underwood \u201cis a young man. There is no doubt about it. On the other hand, he\u2019s been in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>trouble since he was thirteen. And it\u2019s not just little stuff; it\u2019s serious kinds of things.\u201d JA 100. Later the court indicated that it imposed the sentence \u201csomewhat reluctantly,\u201d but it noted that \u201cMr. Underwood needs some time to get ahold of himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court went on to say that Underwood would still \u201cbe a young man when he gets out,\u201d and that while \u201cit seems like a long time to him because it\u2019s a relatively long period for such a young man in the scheme of his life,\u201d Underwood would still \u201chave a long life ahead of him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court expressed concern that because Underwood had been convicted of increasingly serious offenses, it feared \u201cwhat would happen if he got out earlier.\u201d JA 101. This reasoning adequately explained why the court rejected Underwood\u2019s youth-based requests for leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The court also adequately addressed Underwood\u2019s argument premised on the disparity between sentences for crack and powder cocaine. \u201cCongress and the sentencing commission,\u201d it reasoned, \u201chave found that there are differences in the amount of violence, for example, related to the two different types of cocaine.\u201d JA 100. And \u201cmany people,\u201d the court added, already \u201chave been sentenced with that disparity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Turning from the procedural to the substantive, Underwood argues that his sentence was \u201cgreater than necessary[] to comply with the purposes set forth in\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(2). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). But as we have noted, a sentence within the guidelines that satisfies the procedural requirements of <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing is presumed to be substantively reasonable. And Underwood has failed to rebut that presumption. After considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range and did so in a procedurally apt manner. The question is not whether we would have exercised a trial court\u2019s sentencing discretion in the same manner; it is whether the district court acted within its considerable discretion in issuing this sentence. In our view, it did. <em>See Webb, </em>403 F.3d at 385 (noting that because \u201cthe record indicates that the district judge carefully reviewed and weighed all the relevant information provided by [the defendant], the government, and the probation office before arriving at [the defendant\u2019s] sentence ..., we find nothing in the record that indicates that [the defendant\u2019s] sentence is an unreasonable one\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
