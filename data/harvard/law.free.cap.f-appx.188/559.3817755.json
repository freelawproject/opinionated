We affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal on the basis that Feied\u2019s claims are time-barred. With respect to the Regents, Feied\u2019s claims are also barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">We review de novo the dismissal of an action for failure to file within the applicable limitations period. <em>Silva v. Crain, </em>169 F.3d 608, 610 (9th Cir.1999). We review questions of law de novo, <em>United States v. Ziskin, </em>360 F.3d 934, 938 (9th Cir.2003), such as whether an entity is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, <em>Doe v. Lawrence Livermore Nat\u2019l Lab., </em>131 F.3d 836, 838 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Feied filed his \u00a7 1983 action with the District Court on June 29, 2004. Section 1983 claims are characterized as personal injury claims. <em>Silva, </em>169 F.3d at 610. The statute of limitations for personal injury claims in California is two years. Cal. Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 335.1 (West 2006). Prior to January 1, 2003, the applicable limitations period was one year. Cal.Civ.Proc. Code \u00a7 340(3) (West 1982), <em>amended and redesignated by </em>2002 Cal. Stat. ch. 448 \u00a7 3. We examine when Feied\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action accrued to determine which limitations period applies, and whether that limitations period had run by the time Feied filed his complaint in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">A \u00a7 1983 action accrues when the party \u201cknows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action.\u201d <em>Elliott v. City of Union City, </em>25 F.3d 800, 802 (9th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). The basis for Feied\u2019s action is the Defendants\u2019 allegedly unconstitutional denial of contested retirement benefits. At the latest, Feied knew of this injury in 1996, when PERS refused to pay Feied contested interest/capitalization as part of its final award to him of retirement benefits. By 1996, the Regents had also clearly conveyed to Feied their position that he was ineligible for retirement benefits and that no payments from them would be forthcoming. Nothing that has occurred in the interim, such as the California state court\u2019s dismissal of Feied\u2019s 2002 contract suit against the same Defendants, enhances the Defendants\u2019 original injury or creates a new injury attributable to the Defendants that could have the effect of restarting the clock. Since Feied waited until 2004 to challenge the Defendants\u2019 1996 denial of benefits as unconstitutional, his \u00a7 1983 action is time-barred under the one-year statute of limitations in effect in 1996. Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 340(3) (West 1982) (amended 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Feied argues unavailingly that his \u00a7 1983 action accrued not in 1996, but rather at the conclusion of the contract suit that he filed in state court in 2002 against the Regents and PERS. Feied contends that the relevant \u00a7 1983 injury is the Defendants\u2019 unconstitutional \u201csubjection\u201d of his state court suit to a time bar. This claim is without merit. The Defendants did not \u201csubject\u201d Feied\u2019s contract suit to a time bar\u2014they merely complied with the state court\u2019s ruling that Feied\u2019s suit was time-barred. In so complying, the Defendants did not violate any federal laws or otherwise deprive Feied of his constitutional rights. As such, Feied\u2019s claim that the outcome of the state court suit forms the basis of his \u00a7 1983 action fails on its face. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (providing for a cause of action when the defendant <em>acts under color of state law to deprive the plaintiff of his federal </em>rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">With respect to the Regents, Feied\u2019s action is also barred by the Elev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>enth Amendment, which prohibits suits against states by their citizens, <em>Hans v. Louisiana, </em>134 U.S. 1, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890), and by citizens of other states or foreign countries, U.S. Const, amend. XI. Under the Eleventh Amendment, the State of California is generally immune from \u00a7 1983 suits, as are any entities considered to be an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d or \u201carm\u201d of the state. <em>BV Eng\u2019g v. Univ. of Cal., L.A., </em>858 F.2d 1394, 1395 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">This Court has repeatedly held that the Regents are an arm of the state entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>E.g., Armstrong v. Meyers, </em>964 F.2d 948, 949-50 (9th Cir.1992); <em>Thompson v. City of L.A., </em>885 F.2d 1439, 1443 (9th Cir.1989); <em>BV Eng\u2019g, </em>858 F.2d at 1395; <em>Jackson v. Hayakawa, </em>682 F.2d 1344, 1350 (9th Cir. 1982). Despite this line of cases, Feied contends that the Regents are not entitled to immunity in his case. In support of this position, Feied emphasizes the substantial organizational and administrative autonomy that the Regents enjoy.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Feied\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Doe v. Lawrence Livermore Nat\u2019l Lab., </em>in which this Court held that the \u201csingle most important factor\u201d in assessing whether an entity is an arm of California is not the degree of administrative autonomy the entity enjoys, but whether the State of California is ultimately legally hable for a judgment against the entity. <em>See </em>131 F.3d at 838-39. In <em>Doe, </em>we recognized that the Regents enjoy substantial autonomy, <em>see </em>65 F.3d 771, 775 (9th Cir.1995), but went on to hold that because the dispositive inquiry is California\u2019s legal liability for the Regents, \u201cthe University is an arm of the State of California,\u201d 131 F.3d at 839 (on remand from the Supreme Court). Accordingly, Feied\u2019s contention that the Regents are not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity due to their administrative autonomy fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Feied makes two additional arguments countering the Regents\u2019 claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity: first, that the Regents are judicially estopped from claiming to be an arm of California based on their position in the 2002 state court proceedings; and second, that the <em>Ex parte Young </em>exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity applies in this case. <em>See </em>209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). We reject both of these arguments for the reasons well-stated in the District Court opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Feied\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action as time-barred, and find in the alternative that his claims against the Regents are barred under the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b583-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this Circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
