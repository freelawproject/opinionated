Vasquez-Ramirez entered the United States in 1986, and in 1998 he was charged with being removable. He conceded removability and in November 1999 an Immigration Judge (IJ) denied his application for cancellation of removal. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision on October 25, 2002. In January 2003 Vasquez-Ramirez moved to reopen, asserting that his United-Statesborn children would suffer hardship if he is removed to Mexico, but the BIA denied the motion. On October 31, 2003, Vasquez-Ramirez again moved the BIA to reopen, this time to allow him to apply for asylum and withholding of removal on the grounds that one of his United-States-born children suffered from a psychological impairment and that his family would have decreased economical and educational opportunities in Mexico. The BIA denied the motion as numerically barred. The BIA also concluded that Vasquez-Ramirez did not qualify for the asylum-application exception to the numerical limitation because he failed to establish changed circumstances in Mexico or prima facie eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">We conclude that the BIA acted within its discretion in denying Vasquez-Ramirez\u2019s second motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), (c)(3)(ii) (2006) (permitting only one motion to reopen, except when alien seeks to apply for asylum or withholding of removal based on changed circumstances in country to which alien is to be removed); <em>Kanyi v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1087, 1089 (8th Cir.2005) (standard of review). We cannot consider Vasquez-Ramirez\u2019s newly raised argument that the numerical limitation should be waived because he received ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Alyas v. Gonzales, </em>419 F.3d 756, 761-62 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
