Ortega argues that the district court committed plain error by considering that Ortega had not cooperated with the Government in deciding to sentence him to imprisonment rather than probation. This was not error. <em>See Roberts v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 552, 557-58, 100 S.Ct. 1358, 63 L.Ed.2d 622 (1980); <em>United States v. Dickson, </em>712 F.2d 952, 955 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-22\">Ortega argues that consideration of his lack of cooperation violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. He did not assert the privilege in the district court and, thus, this issue is deemed waived. <em>See Roberts, </em>445 U.S. at 559, 100 S.Ct. 1358; <em>United States v. Pool, </em>660 F.2d 547, 556 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
