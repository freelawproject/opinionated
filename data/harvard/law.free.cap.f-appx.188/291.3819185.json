For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-15\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b316-16\">Between August 1999 and June 2002, Thomas Watson was employed by the North Panola School District (the \u201cSchool District\u201d) as an instructor in the high school\u2019s Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (\u201cJROTC\u201d) program. During his employment, Watson entered into a series of successive written employment contracts with the School District. In June 2002, Watson resigned his position as an instructor and enrolled in nursing school. After his formal separation from the School District, Watson performed some limited services for\u2019the School District, but not in his former capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-17\">In the spring of 2003, Watson learned that the person who had taken his position as an instructor had resigned. Watson decided that he wanted to return to his previous job; he applied for the position and was granted an interview. During the interview, the high school principal indicated that Watson would get the instructor position. Based on his belief that he was going to be employed by the School District, Watson withdrew from nursing school and reported for work at the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-18\">Watson worked as an instructor for one week before the school\u2019s spring vacation. After the vacation, Watson was informed that a different candidate had been hired to fill the instructor position. The school principal explained to Watson that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>school board (the \u201cBoard\u201d) had made the decision to hire the other candidate. Watson was sent home and asked not to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Watson brought suit against the School District. In his Third Amended Complaint, Watson alleged that the School District was liable for (1) violations of both substantive and procedural due-process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, (2) breach of employment contract, (3) damages for detrimental reliance, and (4) <em>quantum meruit </em>for the five days he worked at the school. The district court granted the School District\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed all of Watson\u2019s claims with prejudice. Watson now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Farese, </em>423 F.3d 446, 454 (5th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>264 F.3d 493, 498 (5th Cir.2001)). In our review of a summary judgment, we apply the same standard as the district court. <em>Cooper Tire, </em>423 F.3d at 454. Summary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.See also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">A court considering a motion for summary judgment must view evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. <em>Bryan v. McKinsey &amp; Co., </em>375 F.3d 358, 360 (5th Cir.2004). The movant bears an initial burden to demonstrate \u201can absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Celestine v. Petroleos de Venezuella SA, </em>266 F.3d 343, 349 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). If the movant meets this burden, \u201ca nonmovant must bring forward sufficient evidence to demonstrate that a genuine issue of material fact exists for every element of a claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Summary judgment is appropriate if the nonmovant \u201cfail[ed] to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp., </em>477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">We limit our review to the single issue preserved on appeal\u2014whether the School District deprived Watson of a property interest without due process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Watson argues that he entered into an employment contract when he accepted the principal\u2019s oral job offer. And as a teacher, Watson\u2019s argument continues, he has a constitutionally-protected property interest in continued employment that cannot be taken from him without a hearing. Because he never had a hearing before he lost his job, Watson concludes, his constitutional rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">The School District contests the first prong of Watson\u2019s argument. The School District maintains that Mississippi law required the Board to approve of Watson\u2019s hiring. In the School District\u2019s view, the absence of the Board\u2019s approval is fatal to Watson\u2019s claim because he never had the job and, therefore, never had a property interest. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>The viability of Watson\u2019s due-process claim depends on his entitlement to a property interest. <em>See Nunez v. Simms, </em>341 F.3d 385, 387 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201cIn order to allege a due process deprivation of a property interest under the Fourteenth Amendment, the plaintiff must demonstrate a \u2018legitimate claim of entitlement\u2019 to that interest.\u201d) (quoting <em>Bd. of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)). Watson contends that he had a property interest in continued employment as an instructor by the School District. In support of his argument, Watson points out that \u201c[a] public school teacher has a constitutionally protected property interest in continued employment if he can demonstrate a reasonable expectation of continued employment.\u201d <em>Nunez, </em>341 F.3d at 388 (citing <em>Coats v. Pierre, </em>890 F.2d 728, 732 (5th Cir.1989)). We agree with this general proposition. But unless he can first demonstrate that he was employed, Watson has no expectation of continued employment\u2014no property right\u2014to protect. <em>See Cabrol v. Town of Youngsville, </em>106 F.3d 101, 105 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201cAbsent a property interest, there is nothing subject to due process protections and our inquiry ends.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u201cProperty interests are not created by the Constitution; rather, they stem from independent sources such as state statutes, local ordinances, existing rules, contractual provisions, or mutually explicit understandings.\u201d <em>Blackburn v. City of Marshall, </em>42 F.3d 925, 936-37 (5th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Perry v. Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 599-601, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972)). Nor are property interests created by unilateral understanding or belief: \u201cTo have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Even if we assume, as we must at this point, that the school principal did orally offer Watson the instructor position, Watson\u2019s claim nevertheless fails. Watson relies on <em>Perry, </em>408 U.S. at 601-02, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570, for the proposition that property interests can arise from implied contracts or mutually understood informal procedures. Again, we do not dispute this well-established doctrine. But this court has long held that, \u201cwhen formal rules and informal understandings conflict, the formal rules control. In other words, when the state provides an explicit and formal policy governing entitlement to a job, informal and customary understandings cannot create a property interest in the face of the formal rules.\u201d <em>Staheli v. Univ. of Miss., </em>854 F.2d 121, 125 (5th Cir.1988). <em>See also Batterton v. Tex. Gen. Land Office, </em>783 F.2d 1220, 1224 (5th Cir.1986) (\u201cTo say that customs entirely contrary to a statute\u2019s meaning may stem from that statute would defy reason; only if consistent with official law may such practices create a property interest in one\u2019s job.\u201d). Watson\u2019s reliance on an implied contract or an understood school policy is misplaced because Mississippi has codified detailed procedures for hiring teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Mississippi law confers on a school board the authority \u201c[t]o select all school district personnel in the manner provided by law.\u201d Miss.Code \u00a7 37-7-301. While Mississippi law contemplates a role for a principal in the hiring of teachers, that role is limited to recommending candidates; the decision to approve a recommended candidate is left exclusively to the school board. <em>See </em>Miss.Code \u00a7 37-9-17(1). Before a school district can enter into an employment contract with a teacher, that teacher must be \u201celected and ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>proved for employment by the school board.\u201d Miss.Code \u00a7 37-9-23. <em>See also </em>Miss.Code \u00a7 37-9-17(1) (authorizing a school superintendent to enter into an employment contract after a candidate has been approved by a school board); Miss. Code \u00a7 37-9-1 (defining the term \u201clicensed employee\u201d). Under our precedent, the existence of explicit statutorily-mandated hiring procedures in Mississippi\u2019s law precludes Watson\u2019s attempt to establish a property interest by resort to contrary informal practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Because under the codified hiring procedures Watson cannot demonstrate a valid contract of employment, we hold that he cannot have a reasonable expectation of <em>continuing </em>employment. Without an expectation of continuing employment, Watson is not entitled to a due-process hearing. Without a valid employment relationship, Watson has no property interest. <em>Cf. Montez v. S. San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>817 F.2d 1124, 1125-26 (5th Cir.1987) (determining, for different reasons, that a JROTC instructor\u2019s employment contract was invalid under state law and holding that \u201cinvalid contracts bestow[] no property interest\u201d). This case presents no genuine issues of material fact and the School District is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Finding no reversible error, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-9\">. Before the district court, Watson raised both state and federal claims. But because Watson\u2019s brief focuses exclusively on the due process issue, we hold that Watson has waived all other claims and issues on appeal. <em>See Braud v. Transp. Serv. Co. of Ill., </em>445 F.3d 801, 809 n. 17 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union AFL-CIO, CLC v. Champion Int'l Corp., </em>908 F.2d 1252, 1255 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
