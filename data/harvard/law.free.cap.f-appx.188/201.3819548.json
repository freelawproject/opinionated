The district court directed Rankins to particularize his claims within twenty days and denied his requests for injunctive relief and a temporary restraining order. We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Rankins has been transferred from Butner to Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, so his requests for a temporary restraining order and injunctive relief are now moot, and we dismiss his appeal as to the denial of injunctive relief for that reason.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To the extent that Rankins appeals the disposition of his \u00a7 1983 claims, his appeal is interlocutory because the district court\u2019s order is not a final disposition of those claims. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions of the parties are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-11\">. We grant Rankins\u2019 motion to reconsider and grant him leave to proceed under the PLRA in this appeal. Even though he has accumulated three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), construing his allegations as true, we conclude he made a colorable showing he was in \u201cimminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d We express no opinion, however, as to the merits of his claims. We deny Rankins\u2019 motion to reconsider our denial of his request for a stay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-20\">. The denial of a temporary restraining order is generally not appealable. <em>See Virginia v. Tenneco, Inc., </em>538 F.2d 1026, 1029-30 (4th Cir.1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
