He was sentenced to concurrent terms of fifty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment on each count. Gozo appeals his sentence, and his attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that Gozo was sentenced in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In his pro se supplemental brief, Gozo disputes the calculation of his sentence, claiming that the district court erred in imposing certain enhancements. Because Gozo\u2019s plea agreement contained a waiver of his right to appeal his sentence within the guidelines, we dismiss the appeal and deny Gozo\u2019s motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-21\">A defendant may waive his right to appeal his sentence as part of a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990). The waiver must be knowing and voluntary. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 403 (4th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 168 (4th Cir.1991). This court reviews de novo the validity of a waiver. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992). In his plea agreement, Gozo waived his right to appeal his sentence and \u201cany issues that relate to the establishment of the guidelines range, reserving only the right to appeal from an upward or downward departure from the guidelines range that is established at sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-22\">Upon our review of the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy, we conclude that Gozo understood the terms of his plea agreement and entered into it voluntarily. <em>See Brown, </em>232 F.3d at 403. In addition, Gozo\u2019s challenge to his sentence under <em>Booker </em>is barred by the appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151-53 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 461, 163 L.Ed.2d 350 (2005); <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 171-73 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-25\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We thus dismiss the appeal, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>deny Gozo\u2019s motion to remand and his motions to strike counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. Finally, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
