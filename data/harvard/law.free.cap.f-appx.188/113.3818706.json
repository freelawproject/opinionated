The plea was entered pursuant to a plea agreement in which McElveen waived his right to appeal absent certain contingencies that are not present. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-21\">McElveen asks us to review the reasonableness of his sentence pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). However, as noted, he entered into a plea agreement in which he expressly waived all his rights to appeal or collaterally attack his conviction, sentence, or any other matter relating to his prosecution, SuppApp. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-23\">Such waivers are valid and are strictly construed if entered into knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently. <em>United States v. Khattak, </em>273 F.3d 557, 562-63 (3d Cir. 2001). Nothing on this record suggests that McElveen\u2019s plea agreement was not entered into knowingly, voluntarily or intelligently. Thus absent a miscarriage of justice, McElveen\u2019s waiver effectively deprives us of jurisdiction to review the merits of his appeal. <em>Id. </em>Here, there is not even a suggestion that enforcing the waiver would result in any such miscarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-24\">McElveen\u2019s offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines was 23, and his criminal history category was \u201cV.\u201d This resulted in a sentencing range of 84-105 months of imprisonment as stated in the Presentence Investigation Report. App. 43. The court imposed a sentence of 75 months incarceration, which fell below the applicable Guideline range. There was no upward departure, and the sentence is clearly less than the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-25\">McElveen argues that <em>Booker </em>grants the right to appeal the reasonableness of his sentence despite his waiver. However, an intervening court decision does not negate the waiver in his plea agreement. <em>United States v. Lockett, </em>406 F.3d 207, 213 (3d Cir.2005). We have held that, despite the sea change that followed in the wake of <em>Booker, </em>we will enforce the terms of a valid waiver of the right to appeal from a sentence imposed pursuant to a guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>at 213-14. Moreover, before sentencing, all parties and the sentencing court recognized the impact of <em>Booker, </em>and understood that the Guidelines had become advisory. App. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Accordingly we will affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
