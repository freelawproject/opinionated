RICHARD C. WESLEY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b62-17\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b62-18\">Mohammed Raissudin and Shaila Rais petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of their August 2005 motion to reopen their deportation proceedings and reconsider its previous decisions. We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-19\">This Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen and reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>(2d Cir.2006). With respect to petitioners\u2019 request that the BIA reconsider its prior adverse decisions, the BIA did not err in denying that request as untimely. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). Although petitioners argue that the BIA should have exercised its <em>sua sponte </em>authority under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) to reconsider its prior decisions, this Court does not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s choice not to do so. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Petitioners also moved the BIA to reopen their deportation proceedings pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) on account of deteriorated conditions in Bangladesh. We deny the petitions for review of this motion to reopen to the extent that petitioners claimed that the Bangladesh National Party\u2019s (\u201cBNP\u201d) success in the October 2001 Bengladeshi national elections constituted changed conditions warranting reopening of their deportation proceedings. As the BIA indicated, petitioners had based their previous motion to reopen on this same claim and evidence. This claim of changed circumstances could not, therefore, meet the requirement that motions filed pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h) be premised on previously unavailable evidence. However, the BIA failed to acknowledge petitioners\u2019 new basis for changed conditions, which they supported by affidavits submitted with their motion: that the Rapid Action Battalion (\u201cRAB\u201d), created by the Bengladeshi government in 2004, came looking for Mohammed in October 2004. Therefore, we remand for the BIA to evaluate whether this threat establishes Mohammed\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for asylum or withholding and warrants reopening of petitioners\u2019 deportation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petitions for review are GRANTED, in part, the BIA\u2019s order is VACATED, in part, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings with respect to petitioners\u2019 claim that the threat posed by Bengladeshi officials in 2004 constituted changed conditions in Bangladesh warranting reopening of their deportation proceedings. The petitions for review are DENIED with respect to petitioners\u2019 request for reconsideration and reopening on other grounds. Petitioners\u2019 removal is STAYED until the BIA renders a new decision on their motion to reopen. Any pending request for oral argument in these petitions is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1). Respondent\u2019s motion for summary denial is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
