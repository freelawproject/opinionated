Clements now appeals the reasonableness of his sentence. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM Clements\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b292-20\">Clements was the used car sales manager at John Harvey Toyota/Lexus of Bossi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>er City, Louisiana (\u201cHarvey Toyota\u201d). Ricky Pharr, Clements\u2019s co-defendant, operated R <em>&amp; </em>R Wholesale, a used car wholesaler in Shreveport, Louisiana. Clements and Pharr devised and executed a scheme to defraud Harvey Toyota by \u201cselling\u201d thirty-nine Harvey Toyota vehicles to R &amp; R Wholesale.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a jury convicted Clements of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, mail fraud, interstate transportation of stolen motor vehicles, and money laundering, the district court incorrectly determined that Clements had a total offense level of twenty-three and a criminal history category of four, yielding a United States Sentencing Guidelines range of seventy to eighty-seven months of imprisonment. Consequently, the court sentenced Clements to eighty-four months in prison, three years of supervised release, and $589,200 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Clements timely appealed his sentence. In an unpublished decision, this Court vacated and remanded for re-sentencing upon finding that the district court miscalculated Clements\u2019s sentencing range. <em>United States v. Clements, </em>145 Fed.Appx. 33 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">On remand, pursuant to this Court\u2019s mandate, the district court reduced Clements\u2019s offense level to twenty-one, which yielded a sentencing range of fifty-seven to seventy-one months imprisonment. In open court, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">I\u2019ve always felt that there are three reasons for sentencing: one is to punish, one is to separate the [dangerous] from society, and the third, and one that\u2019s not given consideration anymore, is a message to the public at large. You know, you\u2019re being punished, and you\u2019re going to be punished regardless of whatever sentence I give. Deterrence, I\u2019ll give you, you probably have learned your lesson; you\u2019re probably not likely to do it again. But I\u2019m left with what it says to society if you don\u2019t get a substantial sentence but every teller making $1,000, $1,500 a month steals a lousy $1,000 and she gets a year and a half, two years, regardless of the reason for her [sic] stealing the money. And as I said, poor kids who never had a chance. You know, I guess we have gotten away from the idea that crimes against property are not important. Well, I disagree with that. Crimes against property are very important. And it\u2019s like casting a rock in a pool: It affects everything. It\u2019s going to affect people you don\u2019t even know. The people at the Toyota place will never trust again anybody to the degree they trusted you, and there\u2019s no way to get back at that. You can\u2019t unring that bell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\">It is not the intent of this Court to poke a stick in the Fifth Circuit\u2019s eye for reversing me. It is not the purpose of this Court to say \u201cI told you so\u201d in any way. I have considered everything that you have just said, everything that has been written. I have\u2014I believe you. I believe Ms. Hudsmith. Nevertheless, it is the judgment of this Court that the sentence that I imposed before is a correct one.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">Accordingly, the district court deviated from the Guidelines and sentenced Clem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ents to 84 months in prison, three years of supervised release, and $589,200 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">A. <em>The Sentencing Court Imposed a Non-Guideline Sentence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The threshold issue in this case is whether the sentencing court imposed a non-Guideline sentence or a sentence involving an upward departure from the Guidelines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the Government argues that Clements\u2019s sentence is an upward departure from the Guidelines, Clements contends that the district court imposed a non-Guideline sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Clements\u2019s sentence is a non-Guideline sentence. In <em>United States v. Smith, </em>this Court decided that the sentencing court imposed a non-Guideline sentence because \u201c[t]he court did not make reference to upwardly departing or utilizing an enhancement, nor did it refer to enhancement provisions of the Guidelines.\u201d 440 F.3d 704, 708 n. 3 (5th Cir.2006). First, like in <em>Smith, </em>the court did not make reference to upwardly departing or utilizing an enhancement, nor did it refer to enhancement provisions of the Guidelines. In addition, the Government\u2019s assertion that the district court could have upwardly departed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 is meritless. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 provides that \u201c[i]f reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, an upward departure may be warranted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. None of the district judge\u2019s comments indicate that the court sentenced Clements to eighty-four months imprisonment for that reason. Moreover, the district court expressly stated that deterrence was not a factor. Therefore, the district court imposed a non-Guideline sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">B. <em>Clements\u2019s Sentence is Reasonable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">We review a non-Guideline sentence\u2019s reasonableness for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Reinhart, </em>442 F.3d 857, 862 (5th Cir.2006)(finding that this Court\u2019s inquiry should be restricted \u201cto determining whether the trial judge overreached the discretionary sentencing authority afforded under <em>Booker\u201d). </em>Under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>this Court ultimately reviews a sentence for \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d 543 U.S. 220, 260, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). \u201cBoth a district court\u2019s post <em>-Booker </em>sentencing discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>and the reasonableness inquiry on appeal must be guided by the sentencing considerations set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 706. The sentencing court \u201cmust more thoroughly articulate its reasons when it imposes a non-Guideline sentence than when it imposes a sentence under authority of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707 (citing <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005)). The court\u2019s explanation \u201cshould be fact specific and include, for example, aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to personal characteristics of the defendant, his offense conduct, his criminal history, relevant conduct or other facts specific to the case at hand which led the court to conclude that the sentence imposed was fair and reasonable.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519. The lower court, however, \u201cneed not engage in \u2018robotic incantations that each statutory factor has been considered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Lamoreaux, </em>422 F.3d 750, 756 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In <em>Smith, </em>this Court agreed with the framework articulated by the Eighth Circuit in assessing the reasonableness of a court\u2019s statutory support. <em>Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708. \u201cA non-Guideline sentence unreasonably fails to reflect the statutory sentencing factors where it (1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1004 (8th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">We conclude that Clements\u2019s sentence reasonably reflects the statutory sentencing factors. The lower court\u2019s emphasis on the severity of crimes against property demonstrates the need for the sentence to reflect the offense\u2019s seriousness and to promote respect for the law. Additionally, the fact that the district court discounted punishment and deterrence in its analysis demonstrates that the court was guided by \u00a7 3553(a) considerations and engaged in a fact-specific analysis of how the sentence would affect this particular defendant. Moreover, the district court\u2019s comparison of Clements\u2019s offense to fraud committed by bank tellers and addicts illustrates that the sentencing court considered the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct. By juxtaposing Clements\u2019s situation to that of bank tellers and addicts, the judge focused on the nature and circumstances of the offense and Clements\u2019s own history and characteristics. Finally, the judge\u2019s allusion to the effect of Clements\u2019s offense on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Harvey Toyota, the victim, signifies the court\u2019s emphasis on facts specific to the case at hand, which led it to conclude that the sentence imposed was fair and reasonable. Hence, the district court did not abuse its discretion because Clements\u2019s sentence reasonably reflects the statutory sentencing factors with the requisite thoroughness.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Clements\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-8\">. Pharr gave Clements blank drafts which Clements used as evidence of vehicle sales. Based on the purported sales, Harvey Toyota would then pay various lien holders and financial institutions in order to receive the vehicles' titles. Pharr then paid Clements by check in exchange for the return of the drafts, the titles, and the cars.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-14\">. The sentencing court also contrasted Clements\u2019s \"well-to-do family\u201d background with that of other defendants \"dealing in pittances to support habits,\u201d and observed that those defendants are sent \u201caway for 15 and 20 and even 30 years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\">. This Court\u2019s jurisprudence recognizes three different types of sentences under the advisory Guidelines regime. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706 (5th Cir.2006). First, in cases where a sentencing court exercises its discretion to impose a sentence within the properly calculated Guidelines range, we will \"infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence ..., and it will be rare for a reviewing court to say such a sentence is 'unreasonable. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706-07 (quoting <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005)). Second, a district court may impose a sentence that includes an upward or downward departure as allowed by the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 707. A sentence supported by a departure is also a \"Guideline sentence\u201d because the court's authority to depart derives from the Guidelines themselves. <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519 n. 7. Finally, a court may impose a non-Guideline sentence. <em>Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 707. A non-Guideline sentence is one that is either higher or lower than the relevant Guideline sentence but is not based on a departure. <em>Id. </em>Before imposing a non-Guideline sentence, a sentencing court \"is still <em>required </em>to calculate the guideline range and consider it advisory.\u201d <em>United States v. Angeles-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d 742, 746 (5th Cir.2005) (emphasis in original). Therefore, if the court decides to impose a non-Guideline sentence, it should utilize the appropriate Guideline range as a \"frame of reference.\" <em>Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 707.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b295-6\">.
