Cotton, a state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction over his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint against Ray Burgess, the Chief of the Defuniak Springs Police Department, Officer Aaron Raffield, and Officer Greg Gandy. We conclude that Cotton\u2019s complaint is frivolous and thereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b988-23\">On 9 March 2003, Cotton was traveling with a passenger when Raffield and Gandy initiated a traffic stop due to his excessive speed. During the traffic stop, Cotton passed a field sobriety test, which Raffield administered. After being issued a citation for careless driving, Cotton was allowed to proceed. Shortly thereafter, Cotton was involved in an automobile accident, resulting in the death of his passenger and the driver of the other vehicle. Blood was drawn from Cotton at the scene, which revealed a .169 blood alcohol level and the presence of cocaine. Subsequently, Cotton was charged with and convicted of two counts of driving under the influence (\u201cDUI\u201d) and manslaughter. He was sentenced to a thirteen-year term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-24\">In his \u00a7 1983 complaint, Cotton alleged that Raffield and Gandy failed to carry out their duties of protecting the public and enforcing the laws when they did not arrest him for DUI, thereby causing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>contributing to the wrongful deaths of both victims and depriving him of his constitutional rights. Cotton also alleged that Burgess, whose duties as police chief included overseeing his department and training his officers, was liable for any violation, act, or omission committed by the department\u2019s officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">The district court found that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over Cotton\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint because his cause of action was so patently without merit as to justify the court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. The district court found that Raffield and Gandy acted appropriately and did not violate Cotton\u2019s constitutional rights by not arresting him after he passed a field sobriety test. Moreover, the district court noted that, even if the allegations against Raffield and Gandy had merit, Cotton\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against Burgess did not because they were improperly predicated on the theory of <em>respondeat superior.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">On appeal, Cotton argues that district court\u2019s finding that his claims were patently frivolous is erroneous, being contrary to the Constitution and clearly established federal law. He asserts that the defendants acted in a constitutionally \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201cconscience shocking\u201d manner by not arresting him when he was driving while intoxicated and under the influence of drugs. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7. Cotton also argues that the district court erred in failing to determine if supervisory liability was appropriate. Finally, he contends that, because he has brought suit under \u00a7 1983, the district court does have subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s jurisdictional decision de novo.\u201d <em>Barnett v. Bailey, </em>956 F.2d 1036, 1039 (11th Cir.1992). \u201cIn a given case, a federal district court must have at least one of three types of subject matter jurisdiction: (1) jurisdiction under a specific statutory grant; (2) federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331; or (3) diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a).\u201d <em>Baltin v. Alaron Trading Corp., </em>128 F.3d 1466, 1469 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">The Supreme Court \u201chas repeatedly held that the federal courts are without power to entertain claims otherwise within their jurisdiction if they are so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit, wholly insubstantial, obviously frivolous, plainly unsubstantial, or no longer open to discussion.\u201d <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 536-37, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 1378-79, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974) (citations and quotations omitted). Under this standard, \u201cfederal subject matter jurisdiction exists where the right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the Constitution and laws of the United States are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another.\u201d <em>Barnett, </em>956 F.2d at 1041 (quotations omitted). \u201cDismissal for want of jurisdiction is appropriate only if the federal claim is frivolous or a mere matter of form.\u201d <em>Davis v. Cluet, Peabody &amp; Co. ., </em>667 F.2d 1371, 1373 n. 7 (11th Cir.1982) (quotations omitted). For a \u00a7 1983 complaint to be successful, \u201ca plaintiff must show that he or she was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cIt is well established in this Circuit that supervisory officials are not hable under \u00a7 1983 for the unconstitutional acts of their subordinates on the basis of respondeat superior or vicarious liability.\u201d <em>Cottone v. Jenne, </em>326 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir.2003) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">A review of Cotton\u2019s complaint reveals that his claims are frivolous. Cotton is attempting to hold the defendants responsible for his own criminal behavior. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>is no allegation that resembles a constitutional violation. It is undisputed that, after stopping Cotton because he was driving at an excessive rate of speed, Raffield conducted a field sobriety test, which Cotton passed. Once the officers had completed their investigation and issued Cotton a citation for careless driving, there was no longer any reason, in the absence of probable cause, for them to continue detaining Cotton. Accordingly, Raffield and Gandy acted appropriately and did not violate Cotton\u2019s constitutional rights. Because Cotton\u2019s constitutional claims against Burgess are derivative of his claims against Raffield and Gandy, they are also frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AnsP\">Cotton appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for lack of jurisdiction over Cotton\u2019s \u00a7 1983 cause of action. We conclude that Cotton\u2019s claims are frivolous. AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
