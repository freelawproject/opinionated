Perry\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Perry has been informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-25\">In his revocation hearing, Perry admitted three violations of his supervised release conditions. On appeal, he does not contest the revocation or his conviction for contempt. Counsel suggests that the district court erred in sentencing Perry to thirteen months imprisonment, the high end of the guideline range applicable under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4 (2004), plus six months for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-26\">Before <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>we reviewed a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995). This Court has not yet decided whether, after <em>Booker, </em>the proper standard is reasonableness. However, Perry\u2019s revocation sentence was within the correctly calculated advisory guideline range and may be affirmed under either standard. Similarly, Perry\u2019s six-month contempt sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum and was reasonable given his outburst in the courtroom, during which he directed obscenities at the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that such a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
