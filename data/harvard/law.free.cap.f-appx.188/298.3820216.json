The district court upwardly deviated from Miranda-Echartea\u2019s guideline sentencing range and sentenced MirandaEchartea to 70 months of imprisonment and to a five-year period of supervised release. Miranda-Echartea appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Miranda-Echartea argues that the sentence was unreasonable because, even though the Guidelines are advisory after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court provided only a cursory explanation for the sentence and did not attempt to apply the factors mandated by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to the facts of the case. He asserts that two reasons the district court gave for Miranda-Echartea\u2019s sentence were insufficient to support a non-guideline sentence. Specifically, he contends that the district court\u2019s non-guideline sentence is unreasonable because it was based on a factor incorporated in the Guidelines and it disregarded the need to promote uniform sentences for defendants with similar records who have engaged in similar conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-15\">The district court calculated Miranda-Echartea\u2019s guideline sentence range, used that range as a frame of reference, and explained that the reasons for its upward deviation were \u201cthe need to deter future conduct and to sentence [MirandaEchartea] in a range that\u2019s proportionate with others who smuggle 5 kilos of meth into this country.\u201d This is the proper procedure for the district court to follow when imposing a non-guideline sentence. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-16\">In reaching its decision to make a non-guideline upward deviation, the district court set forth the following fact-specific factors: the importation of \u201c5 kilos of meth ... [was] highly unusual,\u201d Miranda-Echartea was not \u201cin the same category as people that bring over 5 kilos of coke or a hundred kilos of marijuana,\u201d and the need to \u201csentence [Miranda-Echartea] in a range that\u2019s proportionate with others who smuggle 5 kilos of meth into this country.\u201d These factors were proper to consider as they related to \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense,\u201d to \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct,\u201d and to the need for the sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(A), (a)(6); <em>see also Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 709. Because the district court\u2019s upward deviation was sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>ported by proper \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Miranda-Echartea has not shown that the district court\u2019s decision to make an upward deviation was unreasonable. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 710. Given the court\u2019s reasons for the upward deviation, the extent of the deviation was not unreasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Miranda-Echartea also contends that the statutes under which he was convicted are facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). In making this argument, Miranda-Echartea refers erroneously to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and (b). The Government argues that Miranda-Echartea lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 841(a) and (b). Although the Government is technically correct, Miranda-Echartea doubtless seeks to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960, not \u00a7 841(a) and (b), and his references to \u00a7 841(a) and (b) appear to be typographical errors. MirandaEchartea fails to correct the error in his reply brief and instead compounds the error by referring erroneously to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. In the interests of justice, we decline to dismiss the constitutional claims. Counsel should CAREFULLY REVIEW submissions to this court and should tailor arguments in a reply brief to the arguments made in the appellee\u2019s brief. The Government also asserts that the waiver provision in Miranda-Echartea\u2019s plea agreement precludes his attack on the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960. The waiver-of-appeal provision is construed against the Government as the drafter of the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Somner, </em>127 F.3d 405, 408 (5th Cir.1997). Because Miranda-Echartea\u2019s plea agreement does not specifically waive his right to attack the constitutionality of \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960, we conclude that the waiver provision does not preclude consideration of this issue. However, as MirandaEchartea acknowledges, his contention is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000). He raises the issue solely to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
