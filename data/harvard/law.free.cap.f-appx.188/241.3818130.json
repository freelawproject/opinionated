Mozee\u2019s claim for money damages on the basis that the defendants conspired not to protect him from the death threats of other inmates lacks a basis in law because Mozee was not physically attacked and does not allege physical injury. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 371 (5th Cir.2005); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e). Mozee is not entitled to injunctive relief on his failure-to-protect claim because he has been transferred to another unit and he has not shown a likelihood of future harm. <em>See City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95-109, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983); <em>Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Mozee\u2019s claim that the defendants failed to respond to his grievances does not implicate a constitutional right. <em>See Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 373-74. Likewise, Mozee\u2019s claim that he was entitled to protective custody fails because he has no constitutional right to a particular classification. <em>Whitley v. Hunt, </em>158 F.3d 882, 889 (5th Cir.1998), <em>abrogated in part on other grounds, Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001); <em>see also Neals v. Norwood, </em>59 F.3d 530, 533 (5th Cir.1995). Mozee\u2019s claim that the district court erred when it denied his motion for the appointment of counsel fails because his case did not involve exceptional circumstances. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). Nor was he entitled to expert witnesses at his hearing under <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">By failing to brief his claims that the defendants engaged in cruel and unusual punishment during a strip search, denied him access to the courts, and denied him food, Mozee has abandoned them. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">Because Mozee\u2019s appeal lacks any legal point arguable on its merits, it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The dismissal of Mozee\u2019s complaint by the district court counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the dismissal of this appeal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Mozee is warned that if he accumulates a third strike, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
