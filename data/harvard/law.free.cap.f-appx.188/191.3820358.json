Because our review of the record discloses that the Board\u2019s decision was based on substantial evidence and applied the proper standards, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Dunford concluded a 32-year career as a coal miner in February 1979. He filed his first claim for black lung benefits in August of that year. By Decision and Order dated October 1981, ALJ Nicodemo De Gregorio denied Dunford\u2019s claim. The Board affirmed this denial. <em>Dunford v. Jewell Ridge Coal Corp., </em>No. 81-2205-BLA (BRB Sept. 28, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">A claimant may file a new petition for modification within one year of the denial of the claimant\u2019s previous modification petition, <em>Betty B. Coal Co. v. Director, OWCP, </em>194 F.3d 491, 498 (4th Cir.1999); <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.310(a), and customary principles of finality do not apply to claims for black lung benefits, <em>Consolidation Coal Co. v. Borda, </em>171 F.3d 175, 180 (4th Cir.1999); <em>Jessee v. Director, OWCP, </em>5 F.3d 723, 725 (4th Cir.1993). Dunford took advantage of this lenity to file in April 1985 a new claim for benefits, which was treated as a request for modification. Almost five years later, in January 1990, ALJ John S. Patton issued a Decision and Order denying Dunford\u2019s request for modification. The Board and this Court affirmed ALJ Patton\u2019s decision. <em>See Dunford v. Jewell Ridge Coal Corp., </em>No. 92-2071, 1993 WL 343135 (4th Cir. Sept.3, 1993) (unpublished); <em>Dunford v. Jewell Ridge Coal Corp., </em>No. 90-645-BLA (BRB Jan. 28, 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"APh\">Dunford sought benefits again in December 1993 when he requested modification on the basis of \u201cnew evidence of a worsening medical condition.\u201d ALJ De Gregorio denied Dunford\u2019s modification request in May 1996, but the Board vacated his Decision and Order and remanded the case for further consideration. <em>See Dunford v. Jewell Ridge/See \u201cB\u201d Mining Co., </em>No. 96-1085-BLA (BRB May 16, 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">On remand, Dunford\u2019s case was reassigned to ALJ Anne B. Torkington. Like the ALJs before her, ALJ Torkington assessed plaintiffs claims under the \u201cinterim regulations\u201d of the Act, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 727.1 through 727.405. As the claimant, Dun-ford bore the initial burden of proving entitlement to an interim presumption that he is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis arising from his coal mine employment. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a); <em>Lane Hollow Coal Co. v. Director, OWCP, </em>137 F.3d 799, 803 (4th Cir.1998). Once Dunford established entitlement to the interim presumption, Sea \u201cB\u201d bore the burden of rebuttal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b); <em>Lane Hollow Coal Co., </em>137 F.3d at 803. Sea \u201cB\u201d could rebut the interim presumption by establishing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-12\">(1) the miner is doing his usual coal mine work or comparable and gainful work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-13\">(2) the miner is able to do his usual coal mine or comparable work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-14\">(3) the total disability of the miner did not arise in whole or in part out of his coal mine employment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-15\">(4) the miner does not have pneumoconiosis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-16\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-17\">ALJ Torkington denied Dunford\u2019s claim for benefits in a Decision and Order on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Remand issued in February 1998. ALJ Torkington found that while Dunford was entitled to the interim presumption, Sea \u201cB\u201d successfully rebutted that presumption pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b)(3) by proving that Dunford\u2019s respiratory impairment and disability did not arise in whole or in part from his coal mine employment. ALJ Torkington further found that Dunford did not suffer from pneumoconiosis, thus rebutting the presumption pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">ALJ Torkington based her rulings on the opinions of Sea \u201cB\u201d\u2019s expert physicians: Gregory J. Endres-Bercher, M.D., Kirk E. Hippensteel, M.D., J. Dale Sargent, M.D., and Gregory J. Fino, M.D. Each employer physician opined that Dun-ford did not have pneumoconiosis and that his employment in the coal mines did not contribute to his respiratory impairment. ALJ Torkington noted that Dr. Sargent examined Dunford on two occasions and reviewed his past medical history. ALJ Torkington further noted that Dr. Fino had the opportunity to review Dunford\u2019s entire medical record while Dunford\u2019s expert physician, Corrado Ugolini, M.D., did not review any of Dunford\u2019s pre-1988 medical records. It was during 1988 that Dun-ford underwent a lobectomy to remove a cancerous portion of his lung. ALJ Torkington found that Dunford did not show any respiratory impairment in the time period between his departure from coal mine employment in 1979 and his lung surgery in 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Additionally, ALJ Torkington found the opinions of Dunford\u2019s expert physicians, including Emory H. Robinette, M.D. and L. Dow Strader, M.D., to be unpersuasive and equivocal concerning the cause of Dunford\u2019s respiratory impairment. ALJ Torkington noted that another of Dun-ford\u2019s expert physicians, Dr. V.D. Modi, had diagnosed Dunford as suffering from disabling pneumoconiosis \u201cdespite blood gas and pulmonary function studies with values which exceed those set forth in the regulations indicating total disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">ALJ Torkington stated in her decision that Sea \u201cB\u201d \u2019s expert physicians, Drs. Fino, Sargent, Endres-Bercher, and Hippensteel, had excellent qualifications and possessed considerable experience and expertise. She found that these doctors \u201cpresented better reasoned and documented medical opinions\u201d than did Dunford\u2019s expert physicians. ALJ Torkington concluded that the evidence in the record demonstrated \u201ca slight improvement\u201d in Dunford\u2019s condition, rather than a deterioration.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">After the Board affirmed ALJ Torkington\u2019s Decision and Order on Remand denying Dunford\u2019s claim for benefits, <em>Dunford v. Jewell Ridge/Sea \u201cB\u201d Mining Co., </em>No. 98-0704-BLA (BRB Feb. 18, 1999), Dun-ford filed yet another request for modification of the denial of his claim. This time he found success. In October 2001, yet another ALJ, Alice M. Craft, issued a Decision and Order Awarding Benefits on Modification. In the course of ruling that Dunford was entitled to benefits beginning in June 1987, ALJ Craft found that ALJ Torkington made a mistake in fact<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>she found that Sea \u201cB\u201d had rebutted the interim presumption pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 727.203(b)(3) and (b)(4). Specifically, ALJ Craft determined that ALJ Torkington made a mistake in fact in finding rebuttal pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b)(3) because Sea \u201cB\u201d had failed to rule out the causal relationship between Dunford\u2019s total disability and his coal mine employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">ALJ Craft also found that ALJ Torkington made a mistake in fact by finding rebuttal under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b)(4) because Sea \u201cB\u201d had failed to establish that Dunford did not suffer from \u201clegal pneumoconiosis.\u201d ALJ Craft concluded that Sea \u201cB\u201d did not meet its burden of rebuttal because the opinions of Drs. Fino and Ugolini were in \u201cequipoise\u201d concerning the presence of \u201clegal pneumoconiosis.\u201d In the alternative, ALJ Craft found that ALJ Torkington made a mistake in fact by finding an absence of \u201clegal pneumoconiosis\u201d because employer expert physician Dr. Fino\u2019s opinion on the subject was \u201chostile\u201d to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Sea \u201cB\u201d appealed to the Board, which affirmed ALJ Craft\u2019s award of benefits to Dunford but vacated her finding concerning the commencement date of that award. <em>See Dunford v. Sea \u201cB\u201d Mining Coal Co., </em>No. 02-0161-BLA (BRB Oct. 30, 2002). On remand, ALJ Craft determined that Dunford was entitled to benefits beginning in August 1988. Sea \u201cB\u201d appealed to the Board, which affirmed ALJ Craft\u2019s Decision and Order on Remand. <em>See Dunford v. Sea \u201cB\u201d Mining Coal Co., </em>No. 03-0495-BLA (BRB Feb. 25, 2004). Sea \u201cB\u201d now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AoN\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">It is well established that our review of the Board\u2019s Decision and Orders is limited. <em>See Lewis Coal Co. v. Director, OWCP, </em>373 F.3d 570, 575 (4th Cir.2004). We conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the Board correctly found that the ALJ\u2019s factual findings were supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Consolidation Coal Co. v. Held, </em>314 F.3d 184, 186 (4th Cir.2002); <em>Scott v. Mason Coal Co., </em>289 F.3d 263, 267 (4th Cir.2002); <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203, 207 (4th Cir.2000). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.\u201d <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938); <em>see also Compton, </em>211 F.3d at 207-08; <em>Piney Mountain Coal Co. v. Mays, </em>176 F.3d 753, 756 (4th Cir.1999); <em>Milburn Colliery Co. v. Hicks, </em>138 F.3d 524, 528 (4th Cir.1998). Rather, it is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consol. Edison Co., </em>305 U.S. at 229, 59 S.Ct. 206; <em>see also Scott, </em>289 F.3d at 267; <em>Compton, </em>211 F.3d at 208; <em>Mays, </em>176 F.3d at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">In conducting our review of the ALJ\u2019s decision for substantial evidence, we must \u201cuphold decisions that rest within the realm of rationality.\u201d <em>Mays, </em>176 F.3d at 756. We may not reweigh the evidence, substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ, or set aside an inference merely because we find the opposite conclusion more reasonable or because we question the factual basis. <em>See id.; Lane v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>105 F.3d 166, 170 (4th Cir.1997); <em>Doss v. Director, OWCP, </em>53 F.3d 654, 659 (4th Cir.1995). We review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ALJ\u2019s findings to determine whether the ALJ considered all relevant evidence and sufficiently explained her rationale in crediting certain evidence. <em>Bill Branch Coal Corp. v. Sparks, </em>213 F.3d 186, 190 (4th Cir.2000); <em>Milburn Colliery Co., </em>138 F.3d at 528; <em>see Sterling Smokeless Coal Co. v. Akers, </em>131 F.3d 438, 439-40 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In particular, we must defer to the ALJ\u2019s evaluation of the proper weight to accord conflicting medical opinions. <em>Lane, </em>105 F.3d at 172; <em>Stiltner v. Island Creek Coal Co., </em>86 F.3d 337, 342 (4th Cir.1996). However, we review <em>de novo </em>the ALJ\u2019s and Board\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are rational and consistent with applicable law. <em>Milburn Colliery Co., </em>138 F.3d at 528; <em>see Held, </em>314 F.3d at 186; <em>Compton, </em>211 F.3d at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Sea \u201cB\u201d does not dispute in this appeal that Dunford established the interim presumption pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(2) by producing ventilatory studies which established the presence of a chronic respiratory or pulmonary impairment. Sea \u201cB\u201d instead argues that ALJ Craft erred when she ruled that ALJ Torkington made a \u201cmistake in fact\u201d in determining that Sea \u201cB\u201d had successfully rebutted the interim presumption pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 727.203(b)(3) and (b)(4). Sea \u201cB\u201d asserts, among other things, that ALJ Craft failed to consider all the relevant evidence in the record and that her findings are not supported by substantial evidence, are not rational, and are not in accordance with the applicable law. Sea \u201cB\u201d further contends that ALJ Craft incorrectly determined August 1988 to be the commencement date for Dunford\u2019s benefits. Sea \u201cB\u201d \u2019s arguments are unpersuasive.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">A. <em>Reiuttal of the Interim Presumption</em></p>\n<p id=\"ASB\">1. <em>Reiuttal under suisection 203(i)(3)</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_3\">Rebuttal of the interim presumption under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b)(3) is difficult. <em>Lane Hollow Coal Co., </em>137 F.3d at 804; <em>Grigg v. Director, OWCP, </em>28 F.3d 416, 418 (4th Cir.1994). To carry its burden of rebutting the presumption, Sea \u201cB\u201d was required to rule out the causal relationship between Dunford\u2019s total disability and his coal mine employment. <em>Borda, </em>171 F.3d at 184-85; <em>Lane Hollow Coal Co., </em>137 F.3d at 804; <em>Grigg, </em>28 F.3d at 418. Sea \u201cB\u201d could have accomplished this task with evidence proving either that Dunford \u201chas no respiratory or pulmonary impairment of any kind ... or that such impairment was not caused in whole or in part by his coal mine employment.\u201d <em>Borda, </em>171 F.3d at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">Substantial evidence supports ALJ Craft\u2019s determination that Sea \u201cB\u201d failed in this difficult task. As an initial matter, ALJ Craft understandably could not reconcile the various conflicting opinions of Sea \u201cB\u201d \u2019s expert physicians. In November 1979, employer expert physician Dr. Hippensteel questioned whether Dunford suffered from coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis and determined that he had only \u201cminimal pulmonary impairment.\u201d In a June 1980 deposition, Dr. Hippensteel testified that Dunford did not suffer from any pulmonary disability due to lung disease, regardless of its etiology. In June 1987, employer expert physician Dr. Endres-Bercher found no evidence of pulmonary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>impairment due to coal dust exposure, cigarette smoking, or \u201cany other etiologic factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Another employer expert physician, Dr. Fino, contradicted Drs. Hippensteel\u2019s and Endres-Bercher\u2019s conclusion that Dunford had no pulmonary impairment. In an April 1989 report, Dr. Fino diagnosed Dunford as suffering from both a \u201crestrictive\u201d and an \u201cobstructive\u201d respiratory impairment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dr. Fino determined that Dun-ford\u2019s restrictive impairment was caused by Dunford\u2019s lobectomy and not by exposure to coal dust.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Dr. Fino concluded that Dunford\u2019s \u201cmild obstructive ventilatory defect\u201d was not related to industrial bronchitis or coal dust inhalation because those conditions result in \u201cirreversible\u201d airway obstruction, whereas Dunford\u2019s condition showed signs of reversibility. While Dr. Fino was unsure whether Dun-ford\u2019s obstructive impairment was related to his prior history of smoking cigarettes, he concluded that Dunford\u2019s obstructive impairment \u201cmay very well be related to the development of asthma,\u201d which results in a reversible airway obstruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">A fourth employer expert physician also contradicted Drs. Hippensteel\u2019s and Endres-Bercher\u2019s conclusion that Dunford had no pulmonary impairment. In a May 1989 medical report, employer expert physician Dr. Sargent diagnosed Dunford as suffering from a \u201cmoderate\u201d ventilatory impairment, but attributed it to Dunford\u2019s previous lung surgery and not the result of coal dust exposure. In October 1994, Dr. Sargent concluded that Dunford now suffered from \u201cvery minimal, if any,\u201d respiratory impairment, which he attributed to Dunford\u2019s prior lung surgery. In a May 1995 deposition, Dr. Sargent testified that Dunford suffered from a \u201cmild resting hypoxemia\u201d respiratory impairment that resulted from Dunford\u2019s lobectomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">In a June 2000 medical report, employer expert physician Dr. Castle stated that there was no evidence that Dunford suffered from a restrictive respiratory impairment. However, Dr. Castle did diagnose Dunford as suffering from an \u201cobstructive\u201d respiratory impairment. Specifically, Dr. Castle opined that \u201cDunford may be permanently and totally disabled as a result of his mild, partially reversible airway obstruction.\u201d Dr. Castle determined that Dunford\u2019s obstructive impairment was most likely related to his asthmatic bronchitis and \u201ccontributed to somewhat\u201d by his prior history of smoking.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">In deposition testimony, Dr. Castle described Dunford\u2019s obstructive respiratory impairment as \u201ca mild significantly reversible respiratory impairment that is related to his previous tobacco smoking history and asthmatic bronchitis.\u201d Dr. Castle concluded that Dunford\u2019s obstructive impairment was not related to his coal dust exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">ALJ Craft discredited Dr. Castle\u2019s attribution of Dunford\u2019s cigarette smoking his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>tory as a partial cause of his obstructive respiratory impairment. ALJ Craft explained that she had \u201cdifficulty accepting\u201d Dr. Castle\u2019s explanation concerning the causation of the obstructive impairment because Dunford had ceased smoking tobacco 15 years before he quit his coal mine employment and removed himself from the accompanying exposure to coal dust. Because Sea \u201cB\u201d was unable to explain fully the cause of Dunford\u2019s obstructive impairment, ALJ Craft appropriately concluded that Sea \u201cB\u201d had failed to rule out the causal relationship between Dunford\u2019s total disability and his coal mine employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">ALJ Craft\u2019s conclusion is supported by the 1995 medical report of Dunford\u2019s expert physician, Dr. Ugolini. In his report, Dr. Ugolini noted that \u201cthe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is of the opinion, based on available scientific data, that coal mine dust causes obstructive lung disease, bronchitis with or without significant obstruction, and emphysema.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Dr. Ugolini opined that the \u201cnotion that coal dust produces only the classic restrictive pattern of lung disease is now obsolete, in light of the current epidemiological research.\u201d Dr. Ugolini stated that \u201c[c]umulative coal dust exposure\u201d in the amount suggested by Dun-ford\u2019s employment history is \u201cwell known to cause pulmonary impairment similar to the one found in Mr. Dunford.\u201d Dr. Ugolini concluded that while Dunford\u2019s \u201cremote\u201d smoking history was the \u201conly other exposure\u201d that could possibly have contributed to Dunford\u2019s obstructive lung disease, it was his opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Dunford\u2019s exposure to coal dust \u201csignificantly contributed\u201d to Dunford\u2019s obstructive impairment, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Dr. Ugolini\u2019s report and the internally contradictory opinions of Sea \u201cB\u201d \u2019s experts provide substantial evidence to support ALJ Craft\u2019s determination that Sea \u201cB\u201d did not rebut the interim presumption under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b)(3) because it could not show that Dunford had no respiratory or pulmonary impairment of any kind or that such impairment was not caused in whole or in part by his coal mine employment. <em>See Borda, </em>171 F.3d at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">2. <em>Rebuttal under subsection 203(b) (Ip)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Substantial evidence also supports ALJ Craft\u2019s determination that Sea \u201cB\u201d failed to rebut the interim presumption under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b)(4) by showing an absence of \u201clegal pneumoconiosis.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> ALJ Craft considered the conflicting opinions of Drs. Fino and Ugolini, both of whom addressed the issue of whether Dun-ford suffered from \u201clegal pneumoconiosis.\u201d ALJ Craft examined the physicians\u2019 curriculum vitae and found that employer ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>pert physician Dr. Fino\u2019s credentials did not entitle his opinions to any greater weight than those of Dunford\u2019s expert physician, Dr. Ugolini. ALJ Craft noted that the research publications of Dr. Fino did not appear to concern pneumoconiosis whereas Dr. Ugolini was associated with NIOSH when that organization conducted studies concerning the relationship between chronic lung disease and coal dust exposure. Because ALJ Craft found the physicians\u2019 opinions to be \u201cequally documented with reference to pertinent studies,\u201d she concluded that their opinions were, at best, in \u201cequipoise.\u201d ALJ Craft thus properly determined that Sea \u201cB\u201d had failed to carry its burden of rebutting the interim presumption pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In the alternative, ALJ Craft discredited certain of Dr. Fino\u2019s opinions that she determined to be \u201chostile\u201d to the Act. An ALJ may properly discount an expert physician\u2019s opinion as \u201chostile\u201d to the Act when the opinion is based on a premise that is fundamentally at odds with the statutory and regulatory scheme. <em>See Lewis Coal Co., </em>373 F.3d at 580; <em>Mays, </em>176 F.3d at 760 n. 7; <em>Lane, </em>105 F.3d at 173; <em>Warth v. S. Ohio Coal Co., </em>60 F.3d 173, 174 n. * (4th Cir.1995); <em>Thorn v. Itmann Coal Co., </em>3 F.3d 713, 719 (4th Cir.1993). Dr. Fino\u2019s opinion that Dunford does not suffer from legal pneumoconiosis was based on two premises that are hostile to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">First, Dr. Fino concluded in a June 1995 medical report that Dunford\u2019s obstructive impairment could not be attributed to coal dust inhalation because he did not have any ventilatory impairment when he left his employment in the mines in 1979. Dr. Fino stated that \u201c[i]f a miner has no functional impairment due to coal mine dust inhalation at the time he leaves the mines, then that worker will not develop a functional impairment due to coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis in the absence of further coal mine dust exposure.\u201d This premise directly conflicts with the Act\u2019s premise that coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis is a \u201clatent and progressive disease which may first become detectable only after the cessation of coal mine dust exposure.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Second, Dr. Fino opined that \u201cobstruction is not a clinically significant abnormality arising out of the inhalation of coal mine dust.\u201d Dr. Fino further stated, \u201c[cjertainly the epidemiologic data that is available at this time, and all of the epidemiologic research, has not documented a disabling respiratory abnormality of an obstructive nature arising out of coal mine dust exposure.\u201d Dr. Fino thus concluded that Dunford\u2019s obstructive impairment could not have been caused by his coal mine employment. This conclusion, however, conflicts with the Act\u2019s premise that an obstructive impairment can be caused by coal mine employment. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a)(2); <em>Stiltner, </em>86 F.3d at 341; <em>Warth, </em>60 F.3d at 174-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Because ALJ Craft properly found these two opinions to be hostile to the Act, she appropriately discredited Dr. Fino\u2019s opinion in her determination whether Sea \u201cB\u201d had proved that Dunford does not suffer from legal pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">B. <em>Reversibility of Pneumoconiosis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Contrary to Sea \u201cB\u201d \u2019s arguments, ALJ Craft properly considered the evidence of reversibility in the record. Employer expert physician Dr. Castle described Dunford\u2019s obstructive impairment as only \u201cpartially reversible\u201d in his medical report. Thus, Dunford\u2019s obstructive impairment was partially irreversible. As previously noted, ALJ Craft permissibly rejected Dr. Castle\u2019s opinion that Dun-ford\u2019s prior smoking history was a contributing cause of the obstructive impairment. Accordingly, the evidence in the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>supports ALJ Craft\u2019s conclusion that Sea \u201cB\u201d failed to rule out Dunford\u2019s coal mine employment as a contributing cause of Dunford\u2019s partially irreversible obstructive impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Further, ALJ Craft fully considered the results of Dunford\u2019s pulmonary function studies, which revealed indications of reversibility.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> ALJ Craft noted that Dun-ford achieved qualifying scores in the pulmonary function studies administered between August 1988 and January 1999.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> ALJ Craft further noted that Dunford\u2019s FEV1 scores improved after the administration of bronchodilators.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While this improvement suggests some reversibility of Dunford\u2019s impairment, Dunford still received qualifying FEV1 scores both before and after the administration of the bronchodilators.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Two minor exceptions to the qualifying scores occurred in August 1988 and October 1994, when Dun-ford achieved post-bronchodilator scores of 2.76 and 2.77, respectively. ALJ Craft rationally disregarded these two scores because they were close to the qualifying FEV1 score of 2.70.</p>\n<p id=\"AG\">ALJ Craft found that the opinions of most of the physicians who had diagnosed Dunford as suffering from a coal dust related disease supported the conclusion that Dunford\u2019s pre-bronchodilator FEV1 scores accurately reflected his capacity to perform in his coal mine employment. ALJ Craft further found Dunford\u2019s pulmonary function studies to be \u201cconsistently qualifying, with the rare and close exceptions described above.\u201d Accordingly, substantial evidence supports ALJ Craft\u2019s conclusion that the evidence in the record failed to rule out coal mine employment as a cause of Dunford\u2019s total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">C. <em>Start Date for Benefits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Substantial evidence also supports ALJ Craft\u2019s determination pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.503(b) that Dunford was entitled to benefits beginning in August 1988.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> She selected this date because it was the month of onset of his total disability due to pneumoconiosis. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.503(b). ALJ Craft found that all of Dunford\u2019s pulmonary function test results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>since that time, with the exception of the two \u201crare and close\u201d post-bronchodilator FEV1 scores described above, qualified Dunford for the rebuttable presumption, which Sea \u201cB\u201d had failed to rebut.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Further, ALJ Craft found that the \u201copinions of most of the physicians who diagnosed coal dust related disease support the conclusion that the pre-bronchodilator values accurately reflected Mr. Dun-ford\u2019s capacity to perform coal mine work.\u201d For example, in March 1987, a full year and one-half prior to Dunford\u2019s September 1988 surgery for lung cancer, one of Dun-ford\u2019s expert physicians, Dr. Modi, examined Dunford and diagnosed him as suffering from an \u201cinterstitial pulmonary fibrosis secondary to exposure to coal dust.\u201d Dr. Modi concluded that Dunford was \u201ctotally impaired and disabled due to coal dust inhalation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Similarly, in February 1989, Dunford\u2019s expert physician Dr. Robinette examined Dunford and diagnosed him as having \u201can obstructive airway disorder.\u201d Dr. Robinette stated that while Dunford\u2019s condition \u201cshows partial reversibility,\u201d he anticipated it to be a \u201cchronic and irreversible\u201d condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Dunford\u2019s expert physician Dr. Strader examined him in August 1993 and determined that he suffered from pneumoconiosis. Dr. Strader concluded that Dunford\u2019s condition \u201cprobably\u201d arose from his coal mine employment and that Dunford was \u201cprobably disabled from doing coal mine work.\u201d In a May 1995 medical report, Dunford\u2019s expert physician Dr. Ugolini also concluded that Dunford suffered from coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">After considering the medical opinions of Drs. Modi, Strader, Robinette, and Ugolini in conjunction with Dunford\u2019s pulmonary function test results, ALJ Craft concluded that \u201cthe record establishes that Mr. Dunford was totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis by the month of August 1988, when his pulmonary function tests first resulted in qualifying values.\u201d This determination was rational, supported by substantial evidence, and in accordance with the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">After considering the joint appendix, the briefs, and the arguments of counsel, we find no reversible error. We hold that ALJ Craft appropriately considered all the relevant evidence and that her award of benefits to Dunford on modification and her determination of the onset date of that award are supported by substantial evidence, rational, and in accordance with the law. We therefore affirm the Board\u2019s Decision and Orders affirming the award of benefits to Dunford. Sea \u201cB\u201d\u2019s petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\">.

FEV1 measures the amount of air a patient can exhale in one second using maximum effort, and is expressed in terms of liters per second.
