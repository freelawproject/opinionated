He argues that the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to orally recommend that he be sentenced at the low end of his guideline range. Torres has not shown a breach of the plea agreement, under plain-error review, given that the Government\u2019s recommendation was included in his presentence report. <em>See United States v. Reeves, </em>255 F.3d 208, 210 (5th Cir.2001). Moreover, contrary to Torres\u2019s assertions, the Government\u2019s failure to concur in his motion for a downward departure did not constitute an affirmative request for a specific sentence in contravention of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-22\">Torres also asserts that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are facially unconstitutional. The constitutional issue raised is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Torres contends that <em>Almsndarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Torres properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-25\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
