The district court found that Appellant failed to satisfy his burden on his discrimination claims arising under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d) and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\u201cADEA\u201d). We review the district court\u2019s order de novo, <em>Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., </em>26 F.3d 885, 888 (9th Cir.1994), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-21\">Appellant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA because there is no reasonable inference that GM\u2019s employment decision was based on Appellant\u2019s wife\u2019s disability. <em>See Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., </em>181 F.3d 1220, 1230-31 (11th Cir.1999). GM declined to hire Appellant before his wife became disabled, so there is no reasonable inference that her disability was a determining factor in GM\u2019s decision not to extend Appellant an offer of employment after she became ill.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>With respect to Appellant\u2019s claims under the ADEA, the district court properly determined that, while he successfully established a prima facie case of age discrimination, Appellant failed to satisfy his burden of demonstrating that GM\u2019s stated nondiscriminatory reason for not hiring him was a pretext. <em>See Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co., </em>232 F.3d 1271, 1281 (9th Cir.2000). GM stated that it did not hire Appellant because he did not have a college degree. GM\u2019s hiring practices throughout the relevant time period were consistent with its stated reason. Appellant has not presented sufficient evidence to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact, as to whether GM was more likely motivated by a discriminatory reason, or as to whether GM\u2019s stated reason is unworthy of belief. <em>See Cotton v. City of Alameda, </em>812 F.2d 1245, 1248 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b644-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
