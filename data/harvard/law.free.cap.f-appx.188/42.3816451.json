We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">As a preliminary matter, we dismiss Monika Shamo\u2019s and Mario Shamo\u2019s petition because it was not timely filed pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). We now review the merits of Vladimir\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). Nevertheless, \u201cthe fact that the [agency] has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application cannot insulate the decision from review.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). An adverse credibility determination must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus\u201d to the finding. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding sufficiently rested on the unexplained discrepancy between Vladimir\u2019s application, which said he was a <em>member </em>of the Democratic Party (\u201cDP\u201d) and his testimony at the hearing, in which Vladimir said he was the chair of his village chapter. This is significant because the background material reflects that officers of the DP may be persecuted, but not mere members. Vladimir further claimed that, because of his marriage, which joined two anti-Communist families, he was treated more harshly than the average DP member. But the IJ was not bound to accept that explanation, and did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">The IJ found further that Vladimir\u2019s travel between Albania and Greece undermined his credibility. The IJ was not obliged to accept Vladimir\u2019s explanation that Greece as a country is not receptive to \u201cfreedom of ideas, and especially Albanian ideas ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">Vladimir\u2019s claim for withholding of removal is waived by his failure to argue that claim in his brief to this Court. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). We have no jurisdiction to address his CAT claim because he failed to exhaust that basis of relief 17 before the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Gill v. INS, </em>420 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">For the foregoing reasons, No. 03-40257 is DENIED. No. 03-40257 is DENIED with respect to Vladimir\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief. No. 03-40263 is DISMISSED as untimely. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
