On appeal, he argues that the district court erred by failing explicitly to acknowledge that it had considered the sentencing factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and additionally imposed an unreasonable sentence. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">At the plea hearing, the court clarified that Gonzalez was charged with a misdemeanor and understood that he faced up to one year in prison. The government\u2019s factual statement, to which Gonzalez agreed, was that Gonzalez called his wife on December 5, 2004, and indicated that he and approximately 20 others were in a boat that was sinking at sea. Gonzalez gave his coordinates, and his wife contacted the U.S. Coast Guard, which responded and located Gonzalez\u2019s vessel. The vessel was found to contain 24 Cuban nationals, as well as 2 U.S. parolees, one of whom was Gonzalez. Gonzalez gave a statement, indicating that he had gone to Cuba to pick up the wife of one of the other defendants in the case, but, when they arrived in Cuba, a number of people had learned about the planned trip, and, despite Gonzalez\u2019s protests, these people boarded the vessel. Gonzalez admitted his guilt, and his plea was accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">The presentence investigation report (PSI) set Gonzalez\u2019s base offense level at 12, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(a)(2). A 6-level enhancement was added, pursuant to \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(2)(B), because Gonzalez had smuggled between 24 and 100 unlawful aliens. Another two levels were added because the offense involved the intentional or reckless creation of a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5). Next, two more levels were added because Gonzalez had used special skill\u2014boat driving\u2014to facilitate the commission of the offense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. Finally, Gonzalez received a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, for a total offense level of 19. With no prior criminal history, Gonzalez was placed in criminal history category I, which, at offense level 19, provided for a recommended sentencing range of 30 to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, the statutory maximum sentence was 12 months\u2019 imprisonment, and, therefore, the PSI indicated that the guideline range was 12 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">At the sentencing hearing, the court, without objection from the government, granted Gonzalez a three-level reduction because the offense was not committed for profit. The court also granted Gonzalez\u2019s objection to the six-level enhancement for the number of aliens involved, reducing the enhancement to only a three-level enhancement. At that point, Gonzalez indicated that, ultimately, he believed that his total offense level should be 10, which would provide for a sentencing range of 6 to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. As to Gonzalez\u2019s objection to the enhancement for reckless creation of a substantial risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>death or serious bodily injury, the court was apprehensive because there were not enough life vests on the boat for everyone who boarded, but sustained Gonzalez\u2019s objection anyway, apparently because the court did not believe that it would have an impact on the actual sentence imposed. Finally, as to the \u201cspecial skill\u201d enhancement, the court sustained Gonzalez\u2019s objection after being reassured that Gonzalez\u2019s offense level would remain at 6 to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Gonzalez then requested a sentence at the low end of the guideline range or lower, arguing that he had never had any contact with the criminal justice system since arriving in the United States in 1996 and had demonstrated an exemplary work record, using his electrical degree to start his own business. Gonzalez noted that his family was very close and suggested that he was eligible for a \u201cstraight probation sentence\u201d or a \u201clengthy term of home confinement coupled with community service,\u201d as his electrical services could be provided to needy charities. Finally, Gonzalez stated that the circumstances of his case\u2014 going to Cuba to pick up a relative and ending up with additional people boarding his boat contrary to his directions\u2014did not warrant a sentence of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The court then asked whether it was mistaken in having read, 2 weeks earlier, that some 30 people who had left Cuba still had not been located, and Gonzalez admitted that the court was correct. Gonzalez stated, however, that his case did not involve traveling to Cuba to retrieve 30 people in exchange for money, but instead involved him traveling to Cuba to pick up his nephew\u2019s wife. The court indicated that whether Gonzalez went to Cuba seeking a profit was beside the point, but, in any case, the sentencing range that Gonzalez requested was 6 to 12 months, and, in the court\u2019s opinion, any sentence that it imposed within that range would be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">Next, the court expressed that it was \u201ccurious\u201d as to why the government had chosen to charge Gonzalez with only a misdemeanor, given the number of people involved, because the court believed that it was \u201cinherently dangerous to engage in this type of activity and particularly so when you\u2019re bringing people without the proper safety equipment.\u201d The court clarified that it was not interpreting the guidelines, but just questioning \u201cfrom a common sense standpoint ... why the government charged this with a misdemeanor.\u201d The court subsequently sentenced Gonzalez to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory maximum and highest available guideline sentence. Gonzalez objected that the sentence was not reasonable under the circumstances of the case. The court responded that the sentence was \u201cwithin the guidelines,\u201d to which Gonzalez agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">On appeal, Gonzalez argues that he \u201cdid not receive a fair sentencing process or a reasonable sentence from the district court for the crime he committed.\u201d Gonzalez argues that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, gave undue weight to a newspaper article, and imposed an unreasonable statutory maximum sentence to a first-time offender. Specifically, Gonzalez argues that the district court was required to, at the very least, consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, not just the guidelines, and the district court\u2019s sentence here was unreasonable because it neglected to consider factors other than the guideline range. He further argues that a sentence within the guideline range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, and his 12-month sentence, which admittedly was within the guideline range, is unreasonable because: (1) nothing in the record shows that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before imposing a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>tence; (2) the court gave undue weight to an incident reported in the local press, at the expense of the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors; and (3) his criminal conduct demonstrated a lack of intent to do anything more than bring one person to the United States. Gonzalez notes that his codefendant also received a one-year sentence, but argues that his codefendant was more culpable because he actively recruited, planned, and financed the trip. Finally, he argues that his sentence was greater than necessary to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s sentencing goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Where a defendant challenges his overall sentence, we review for unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (holding that appellate courts review sentences for unreasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors). We have held that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). An acknowledgment that the district court has considered a defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is sufficient under <em>Booker. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">At the time of Gonzalez\u2019s sentencing on September 8, 2005, the Supreme Court had issued its ruling in <em>Booker, </em>rendering the guidelines advisory only, and, therefore, the district court, while required to consult and properly calculate the guideline range, was not bound by the recommended range of 6 to 12 months. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 259-60, 125 S.Ct. at 764-65 (excising the mandatory application of the guidelines); <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that, although the guidelines are advisory after <em>Booker, </em>the district court is still bound to consult them and accurately calculate the sentencing range). We have rejected the notion that a sentence within the guidelines is <em>per se </em>reasonable, although \u201cthe use of the Guidelines remains central to the sentencing process.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 787 (11th Cir.2005). We have further stated that, \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose, and when the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Turning first to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, a review of the sentencing transcript reveals that the district court did not, at any point, so much as mention or acknowledge that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors existed or that it had considered them. The only things explicitly referenced by the district court in this case were the guidelines and the PSI. Even during its pronouncement of the sentence, the court did not indicate whether it had considered other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. This does not appear to be in explicit compliance with our holding in <em>Scott </em>that a district court meets its post <em>-Booker </em>sentencing obligations by \u201cexplicitly\u201d acknowledging that it had considered a defendant\u2019s arguments at sentencing and that it had considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1330. It also does not stand on all fours with our decision in <em>Talley, </em>where we held that the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it stated on the record that \u201c[biased on all the facts and circumstances of this case, [it thought] that the guidelines do produce a fair and reasonable sentence considering the factors set forth in 18, section 3553(a)\u201d and proceeded to provide further explanation for its sentence. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>While we have not had occasion to consider the case where a district court altogether fails to mention that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, other circuits, such as the Second Circuit, have presumed, \u201cin the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise, that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the statutory factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2006). \u201cIn other words, no \u2018robotic incantations\u2019 are required to prove the fact of consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, as the First Circuit noted, \u201ca court\u2019s reasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the pre-sentence report with what the judge did.\u201d <em>United States v. Jimenez-Beltre, </em>440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir.2006). The Sixth Circuit similarly has held that a district court\u2019s failure explicitly to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is not error, absent some indication that the court affirmatively ignored the factors. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>436 F.3d 706, 708 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">We agree with the reasoning of our sister circuits and hold that district courts do not automatically err by explicitly failing to state that they have considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at some point during sentencing proceedings. In many cases, such as this one, as discussed below, the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing a sentence are clear from the record and in compliance with the statutory requirements of \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Absent an affirmative indication that the factors were not considered, we may presume that district courts are following the law. <em>See Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"AiD\">Turning to the instant case, the district court\u2019s questions and comments, as well as the arguments made by Gonzalez concerning the appropriate sentence, show that the court, whether explicitly or not, considered several \u00a7 3553(a) factors when determining an appropriate sentence. First, the court heard Gonzalez\u2019s argument that he was a first-time offender with no other encounters with the justice system and a rehable worker who had started his own electrical business. The court also heard evidence of Gonzalez\u2019s close family ties, and heard Gonzalez argue that he could be eligible for probation or home detention with community service. These two factors are covered under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as history and characteristics of the defendant, as well as the types of sentences available. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">However, the court was more concerned that the seriousness of the offense was being understated by both Gonzalez and the government, and explicitly questioned Gonzalez about a recent incident in which 30 Cubans left Cuba\u2014apparently by boat\u2014and had not been found. The court also found that, whether or not Gonzalez received an enhancement for reckless endangerment, his conduct was \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d and \u201cparticularly so when you\u2019re bringing people without the proper safety equipment,\u201d as Gonzalez had admitted. The seriousness of the offense is a permissible ground on which to base a sentence, as is deterrence of future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>While Gonzalez argued that he never intended to transport 25 people without an adequate number of life preservers, Gonzalez ignores the fact that he consciously decided to transport these people after they boarded his boat. Whether or not that was his intent when he traveled to Cuba is irrelevant\u2014as captain of the boat, he could have decided not to travel to Florida with the 25 additional passengers, but instead, he decided to make the trip, confronting a risk that the boat would not be able to make the trip. That risk materialized, and, according to the PSI, Gonzalez telephoned his wife when the boat began to take on water, and she contacted the Coast Guard, which managed to rescue all of the passengers just before the boat sank. On this record, we cannot say that the district court, which imposed the 12-month maximum sentence for a misdemeanor, fashioned an unreasonable sentence. <em>Cf. United States v. Eldick, </em>443 F.3d 783, 790 (11th Cir.2006) (affirming as reasonable a district court\u2019s imposition of consecutive statutory maximum sentences, in light of the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the district court\u2019s failure explicitly to mention that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was not error because the record sufficiently demonstrated that the court considered the PSI, as well as the arguments made by Gonzalez, and its questions and comments indicate that, explicitly or not, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors were applied. Moreover, we cannot say, based on this record, that Gonzalez\u2019s 12-month sentence was unreasonable. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-6\">. We do note, however, as did the Second Circuit, that district courts are encouraged to facilitate review by providing complete and detailed explanations regarding their sentencing decisions. <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 30 n. 8. Nothing in this opinion should be read as dispensing with the requirement that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors be discussed at sentencing. The failure to explicitly mention a specific factor, however, will not automatically be considered an error requiring a remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
