Martinez-Castelan was convicted in 2003 of a felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2) for making a false statement to the Federal Aviation Administration. The BIA held that such a conviction was a crime involving moral turpitude rendering him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Martinez-Castelan argues on appeal that the BIA\u2019s determination that his crime involved moral turpitude was in error. We apply a two-part standard of review to the BIA\u2019s conclusion that an alien has committed a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>Smalley v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 332, 335 (5th Cir.2003). \u201cFirst, we accord \u2018substantial deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the INA\u2019 and its definition of the phrase \u2018moral turpitude.\u2019 Second, we review <em>de novo </em>whether the elements of a state or federal crime fit the BIA\u2019s definition of a CIMT.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335-36 (citations omitted). The BIA\u2019s determination of what constitutes moral turpitude must be upheld if that determination is reasonable. <em>Hamdan v. INS, </em>98 F.3d 183, 185 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"Ans\">\u201cWhether a crime involves moral turpitude depends upon the inherent nature of the crime, as defined in the statute concerned, rather than the circumstances surrounding the particular transgression.\u201d <em>Pichardo v. INS, </em>104 F.3d 756, 759 (5th Cir.1997). Section 1001(a)(2) criminalizes the knowing and willful making of \u201cany materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation\u201d regarding \u201cany matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States.\u201d \u201cCrimes including dishonesty or lying as an essential element involve moral turpitude.\u201d <em>Omagah v. Ashcroft, </em>288 F.3d 254, 260 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>397 F.3d 1016, 1020 (7th Cir.2005); <em>Itani v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 1213, 1215 (11th Cir.2002). The BIA\u2019s determination that a violation of \u00a7 1001(a)(2) constitutes moral turpitude is reasonable. <em>See Hamdan, </em>98 F.3d at 185. Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
