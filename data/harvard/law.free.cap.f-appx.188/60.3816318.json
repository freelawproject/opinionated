Hladylowycz\u2019s decision denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yan Xiang Zhu, </em>No. A 78 296 624 (BIA Jan. 24, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 78 296 624 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 2, 2003). We assume that the parties are familiar with the facts, procedural history and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">When the BIA adopts and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yu Yin Yang v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d 84, 85 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, and reverses only if \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). Nevertheless, \u201cthe fact that the [agency] has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application cannot insulate the decision from review.\u201d Rams<em>ameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). An adverse credibility determination must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus\u201d to the finding, and must not be \u201cbased on speculation or conjecture.\u201d Seca<em>ida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The IJ found Zhu not credible for the following reasons: (1) the IJ found it implausible that Zhu was never fined for her refusal to appear for a birth control exam; (2) the IJ found it implausible that the authorities, when they finally caught Zhu, would test for pregnancy the way Zhu described, <em>i.e., </em>by first examining her physically before testing her urine; (3) Zhu failed to provide sufficient detail as to how she was able to escape from the exam; and (4) Zhu\u2019s father\u2019s letter, submitted as evidence, failed to mention Zhu\u2019s allegation that the authorities briefly detained Zhu\u2019s mother when Zhu refused to appear for an exam. The BIA, although it did not explicitly reject the IJ\u2019s second reason, mentioned only the other three reasons in its affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">We find that the IJ\u2019s reasons are insubstantial and, accordingly, remand. The IJ\u2019s first ground may be a valid reason for skepticism, but could not, standing alone, support an adverse credibility finding. The IJ\u2019s second reason is rank speculation. Neither we nor the IJ have the slightest idea how Chinese doctors perform pregnancy exams and, specifically, whether they might conduct a physical examination before taking a urine sample. The IJ\u2019s third reason is insignificant. It would not have been obvious to Zhu that she should describe this incident in greater detail, nor did the IJ or counsel for the Department of Homeland Security press her to elaborate. Finally, the IJ\u2019s fourth reason is invalid as well. It may have been obvious to the IJ that the authorities\u2019 detention of Zhu\u2019s <em>mother </em>was relevant to Zhu\u2019s asylum claim, but there is no reason why Zhu\u2019s father would have understood this, as Zhu himself explained when questioned about the \u201comission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">For the foregoing reasons, Zhu\u2019s petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings in accordance with this order. Having completed our review, Zhu\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
