Wiseman, Jr., Senior United States District Judge for the Middle District of Tennessee, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b463-12\">SUTTON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">Harmony Court, a skilled nursing facility located in Cincinnati, Ohio, contends that the Departmental Appeals Board of the United States Department of Health and Human Services mistakenly upheld an award of civil money penalties against Harmony Court for noncomplianee with multiple Medicare program-participation requirements. Because substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-15\">On November 5, 1999, a state agency, the Ohio Department of Health, completed a complaint survey of Harmony Court, which identified nine Medicare program-participation requirements that the facility had violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-16\">On December 15, 1999, the state agency performed a revisit survey and determined that Harmony Court was in substantial compliance as of December 10,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-17\">On January 19, 2000, after its annual survey of Harmony Court, the agency charged the facility with 23 violations of the Medicare program-participation requirements. On March 10, 2000, the agency performed a revisit survey and found six violations. And on April 15, 2000, the agency performed a(re)revisit survey and found the facility in substantial compliance as of March 26, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-18\">All of these visits considered, the agency cited Harmony Court for 29 violations that the agency was unwilling to waive. On the basis of these violations, it levied fines against the facility in the amount of $1,150 per day from November 5 to December 9, 1999, and $550 per day from January 19 to March 25, 2000\u2014a total of $77,100.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Harmony Court filed an administrative challenge to the f\u00edne. Perhaps recognizing that a finding of one violation may suffice to impose civil money penalties, <em>Beechwood, Sanitarium, </em>DAB No. 1824 (2002), the facility challenged the propriety of every violation. In reviewing the petition, the Administrative Law Judge, also mindful that one violation may suffice to uphold a penalty, analyzed a sampling of the violations. She concluded that the facility had failed to comply with 12 participation requirements\u2014with at least 1 violation per survey cycle\u2014and that the civil penalty was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The facility appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Departmental Appeals Board, challenging each violation addressed and upheld by the ALJ. The Board sustained all of the ALJ\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In reviewing the Board\u2019s imposition of civil money penalties, \u201c[o]ur standard of review is highly deferential.\u201d <em>Woodstock Care Ctr. v. Thompson, </em>363 F.3d 583, 588 (6th Cir.2003) (per curiam). \u201c \u2018The findings of the Secretary with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7a(e) (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Harmony Court first argues that the ALJ and the Board applied the wrong standard of review by placing the burden of persuasion on the facility under <em>Hillman Rehabilitation Ctr., </em>DAB No. 1611 (1997), <em>aff'd, Hillman Rehabilitation Ctr. v. United States, </em>No. 98-3789(GEB) (D.N.J. May 13, 1999). But as the facility has conceded, this contention could affect the outcome of this dispute only if the evidence were in equipoise. \u201cBecause the evidence is not in equipoise in this case, <em>Hillman </em>is not dispositive of the result here,\u201d <em>Batavia Nursing &amp; Convalescent Ctr. v. Thompson, </em>143 Fed. Appx. 664, 665 (6th Cir.2005), and we accordingly need not reach the validity of that administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">Harmony Court next argues that substantial evidence does not support the civil penalty for lack of compliance with the Medicare program-participation requirements. Like the ALJ and the Board, we need not address each and every violation. The Board specifically addressed, and upheld, 12 violations. We will limit our discussion to the substantial evidence that undergirds one example of each type of violation\u2014as organized by the regulation at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">1. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.15(g)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">This regulation requires a facility to \u201cprovide medically-related social services to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident.\u201d In applying this regulation, the ALJ found that Harmony Court did not conduct adequate interventions to stop Resident 105 from leaving the facility or to find him alternative living arrangements. Resident 105 abused alcohol, which created a significant risk of injury to himself and others\u2014particularly when he left the facility on weekends and returned intoxicated. As a result of these incidents, his doctor recommended that he not be permitted to leave the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">Substantial evidence supports a finding that this regulation was violated. For one, the facility frequently allowed Resident 105 to leave the facility\u2014despite his doctor\u2019s recommendation. For another, despite his abuse of alcohol, the facility\u2019s social-progress notes made scant ref<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>erence to his drinking binges or even to his having an alcohol problem. Though he returned to the facility drunk on November 17, 1999, and Harmony Court administered a blood-alcohol test at that point, his social-service records remained largely inattentive to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">2. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">This regulation requires a facility to \u201cprovide the necessary care and services to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychological well-being, in accordance with the comprehensive assessment and plan of care.\u201d In finding that the facility violated this regulation, the ALJ identified deficiencies in the care of three residents, premised on the credible testimony of the state survey- or. One resident, Resident 13, was in a geri-chair with a pelvic restraint and a worn pommel cushion on the chair. On one occasion, Resident 13\u2019s buttocks had slid so far forward in the chair that the pelvic restraint tightly wedged into her body folds. Both her positioning in the chair and the placement of the pelvic restraint caused reddening to her perineal area and her upper thighs. The pommel cushion was so worn that it did not prevent Resident 13 from sliding in her chair and ultimately sustaining injuries to her perineal area and upper thighs. Resident 13 actually suffered some injuries and was at risk of suffering more.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The facility did not explain why it did not have a sufficient number of pommel cushions in stock to replace Resident 13\u2019s worn cushion. Nor did it explain why it failed to order a specialized wheelchair for Resident 13. Instead, Harmony Court contends that Resident 13 \u201cwas small of stature, very demented, very agitated and could not sit still.\u201d Br. at 20. But these observations serve only to confirm that the resident needed more care, not less, and certainly not less care than what the state surveyor thought appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">3. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">This regulation says that a \u201cfacility must ensure that\u2014(1) A resident who enters the facility without pressure sores does not develop pressure sores unless the individual\u2019s clinical condition demonstrates that they were unavoidable; and (2) A resident having pressure sores receives necessary treatment and services to promote healing, prevent infection and prevent new sores from developing.\u201d The ALJ found that Resident 16 suffered from a Stage IV pressure sore on her coccyx. And after crediting the surveyor\u2019s testimony, the ALJ also found that Resident 16 did not receive preventative positioning or incontinence care for a three-and-a-half-hour period. During that time, the surveyor observed Resident 16 with a \u201c \u2018foul-smelling and urine-saturated incontinent brief with the time of 5:25 A.M. written on it and with the initials of a staff member from the previous shift.\u2019\u201d ALJ Op. at 19. Resident 16 did not have \u201ca pressure relief device on her chair, which is essential for [treatment of] a coccyx pressure sore.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">Without presenting any evidence or testimony to rebut the surveyor\u2019s observations, the facility merely argues that Resident 16 was at high risk for pressure sores. Even if one concedes that the pressure sores Resident 16 had were unavoidable, that does not demonstrate compliance with the prevention element of the regulation, which says that \u201c[a] resident having pressure sores [must] receive[] necessary treatment and services to promote healing, prevent infection and prevent new sores from developing.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(c)(2). On this record, substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Harmony Court failed to provide Resident 16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>with the proper standard of care required by the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">4. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Cited in both the November and January surveys, this regulation requires \u201c[a] resident who is incontinent of bladder [to] receive[] appropriate treatment and services to prevent urinary tract infections and to restore as much normal bladder function as possible.\u201d The ALJ found that the \u201cgreater weight of the evidence\u201d supported the surveyor\u2019s observations as well as the surveyor\u2019s conclusion that the facility \u201cput Resident 39 at risk for a urinary tract infection.\u201d ALJ Op. at 36. Specifically, when a nurse aide administered incontinence care to Resident 39, the survey- or observed the aide improperly clean her by wiping stool from the peri-rectal area toward the area of her urinary tract. Instead, the surveyor testified, the nurse aide should have \u201cturn[ed] the cloth to a clean area\u201d or should have gotten \u201ca different cloth.\u201d JA 1463.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Harmony Court argues that Resident 39 did not have a urinary tract infection and that the surveyor observed Resident 39 receiving incontinence care on just one occasion. But this response misses the point. Whether Resident 39 had a urinary tract infection or not, the point is that the nurse aide\u2019s care placed Resident 39 <em>at risk </em>of getting an infection because the aide did not provide \u201cappropriate treatment.\u201d <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">5. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">This regulation requires a facility to ensure that \u201c[a] resident who enters the facility without a limited range of motion does not experience reduction in range of motion unless the resident\u2019s clinical condition demonstrates that a reduction in range of motion is unavoidable.\u201d When Resident 18 arrived at Harmony Court, he did not have any range-of-motion limitations in his lower extremities. In just over three months, however, he developed limitations in both knees. His physician ordered the use of bilateral knee splints in an alternating four-hours-on, four-hours-off cycle. The surveyor observed Resident 18, without any knee splints, over a more than four-hour period. On the last day of the survey period, nine days after the physician\u2019s order, Harmony Court added the interventions.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">Harmony Court claims that Resident 18 was easily agitated and, on occasion, would refuse to take his pills. Harmony Court also argues that Resident 18 was bedridden and that knee splints would not have helped him since \u201c[h]e was not going anywhere.\u201d Br. at 29. But \u00a7 483.25(e)(1), not surprisingly, does not contain a diffieult-to-work-with exemption. Nor has the facility supported its sweeping generalization that the range of motion in the knees of bedridden individuals necessarily will decrease. Without any evidence to the contrary from Harmony Court, the Board acted well within its authority in upholding the conclusion that the facility\u2019s lack of compliance with the regulation worsened Resident 18\u2019s condition. As the ALJ noted, once \u201chis physician ... verified Resident 18\u2019s need for knee splints, the facility was obligated to apply them or, at least, to document why it had not done so.\u201d ALJ Op. at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">6. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">This regulation requires a facility to ensure that \u201c[t]he resident environment remains as free of accident hazards as is possible.\u201d The ALJ concluded that the state agency presented \u201ca prima facie case that [Harmony Court] was not in compliance with\u201d the regulation. ALJ Op. at 37. The facility failed to rebut the state agency\u2019s prima facie case because Harmony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Court did not rebut \u201cany of the observations testified to by the surveyors at the hearings, except to concede\u201d that some of them were trae, namely \u201cthat the janitor\u2019s closet was unlocked\u201d and there was a \u201cpotential for harm caused by the [accessibility of] hazardous materials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the facility \u201ccontained several rooms where dangerous substances were too accessible to [the facility's] residents and presented the potential for more than minimal harm, especially to [the facility\u2019s] residents on the behavioral unit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Harmony Court, again, argues that none of its residents was actually harmed by its alleged violations. And the facility, again, fails to recognize that actual harm is not required to impose a penalty; a threat of more-than-minimal harm suffices. The program-participation requirement charged Harmony Court to keep the \u201cresident environment ... as free of accident hazards as ... possible,\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h)(1), and substantial evidence supports the administrative conclusion that the facility did not comply with this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">7. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 483.25(h)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Cited in the November, January and March cycles, this regulation requires a facility to ensure that \u201c[e]aeh resident receives adequate supervision and assistance devices to prevent accidents.\u201d Resident 12\u2019s comprehensive assessment stated that she was \u201cdependent on two staff members for bed mobility, toileting, transfers and bathing.\u201d DAB Op. at 32. Notes from Harmony Court\u2019s nurses indicated that on one occasion, Resident 12 slid from her geri-chair and fell to the floor, injuring her forehead and nose. At the time of the accident, Resident 12 was in the bathroom with one nurse aide. \u201cThe aide told the surveyor that when she put a gait belt around Resident 12 and attempted to transfer her to a standing position, [Resident 12] slid forward and down in her gerichair.\u201d Id. The ALJ found that \u201c[t]he nurse aide was on the wrong side of the chair and could not get at the gait belt.\u201d ALJ Op. at 40. \u201cHad another staff member been present on the other side of the chair, the staff member could have intervened and prevented Resident 12\u2019s sliding off the geri-chair.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Harmony Court cannot claim that Resident 12 was not actually harmed in this instance. It instead argues that an occupational therapy assessment, conducted two weeks after Resident 12 fell, noted that only on those occasions when Resident 12 was in a state of heightened alertness and strength could a one-person transfer be used. Harmony Court, however, did not provide the ALJ with any evidence to establish the state of alertness of Resident 12 at the time of the accident. At the time of the accident, according to the evidence and the testimony of the surveyor, Harmony Court believed that Resident 12 required the assistance of two nurse aides for toileting and transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">For these reasons, we affirm the decision of the Departmental Appeals Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
