Thomas conditioned his guilty plea on his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress statements that were the product of an allegedly unlawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"A4x\">After an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge entered a thorough report with extensive factual findings. It concluded that the police had adequate cause, first to detain Thomas and then to arrest him at the scene. <em>See United States v. RojasMillan, </em>234 F.3d 464, 468-69 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that reasonable suspicion justifies an investigatory detention); <em>United States v. Valencia Amezcua, </em>278 F.3d 901, 906 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that police officers had probable cause to arrest a suspect where the facts suggest a \u201cfair probability\u201d that the suspect has committed a crime). The report was adopted by the district judge, and we have no reason to overturn it. The district court properly found that the police officers conducted a valid investigatory detention that ripened into probable cause to make an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b661-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir.
