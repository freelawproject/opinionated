Univ. of Massachusetts, </em>No. 1:02-CV-0674, 2006 WL 461224 (W.D.Mich.), for lack of jurisdiction. The University opposes and moves for an extension of time, until July 28, 2006, to file its brief. The court considers whether Baum\u2019s cross-appeal, 2006-1331, should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">Baum sued the University for breach of a licensing agreement and patent infringement. Shortly thereafter, the University filed a motion to dismiss alleging, among other things, sovereign immunity. In 2003, the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan denied the University\u2019s motion. Subsequently, the district court bifurcated the contract and patent claims. After trial on the contract issues, the University filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law renewing its claim of sovereign immunity and, in the alternative, seeking a new trial. The University also filed a motion to dismiss the patent claims on the basis of sovereign immunity. On February 24, 2006, the district court concluded that the University had waived its sovereign immunity defense to the patent and contract claims, but ordered a new trial limited to the amount of damages on the contract claims. The University appealed the order rejecting its sovereign immunity defense asserting that this court has jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine and citing <em>Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., </em>506 U.S. 139, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1992). Baum filed a notice of cross-appeal from the February 24, 2006 order in which Baum states: \u201cPlaintiffs are challenging the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals in defendant-appellant\u2019s principal appeal.... [T]his cross-appeal is being preserved in the event the Court of Appeals determines it has jurisdiction\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">As a threshold matter, Baum asserts that this court lacks jurisdiction on the basis that the University\u2019s appeal should have gone to the regional circuit \u201cbecause the appeal involves issues of Eleventh Amendment immunity and does not involve questions related to patents.\u201d We reject this argument as meritless. Baum\u2019s complaint raised patent claims and established the district court\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a). Thus, this case \u201carises under\u201d patent law and is within our jurisdiction; the fact that the trial court bifurcated the claims and the appeal involves only sovereign immunity issues is irrelevant. <em>See Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Sys., </em>535 U.S. 826, 830, 122 S.Ct. 1889, 153 L.Ed.2d 13 (2002) (\u201cThe well-pleaded-complaint rule has long governed whether a case \u2018arises under\u2019 federal law.... As \u2018appropriately adapted to \u00a7 1338(a),\u2019 the well-pleaded-complaint rule provides that whether a case \u2018arises under\u2019 patent law \u2018must be determined from\u2019 \u201d the complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">Next, Baum asserts that the University has \u201cwaived its right to interlocutory review\u201d by failing to appeal the district court\u2019s initial 2003 ruling on the sovereign immunity issue. Baum disagrees, asserting that it can successively raise the issue and appeal from a later ruling. We deem the better course is for the parties to present these arguments in the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-12\">Turning to Baum\u2019s cross-appeal, we conclude that it is not properly before the court. Baum was adversely affected by the district court\u2019s order of a new trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>However, that is an unappealable interlocutory order. <em>See Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, </em>449 U.S. 33, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980) (an order granting a new trial is interlocutory in nature and therefore not immediately appealable). Thus, the cross-appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">(1) Baum\u2019s motion to dismiss the University\u2019s appeal, 2006-1330, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">(2) Baum\u2019s appeal, 2006-1331, is dismissed</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs pertaining to 2006-1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">(4) The revised official caption for 2006-1330 is reflected above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">(5) The University\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file its brief is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">The brief is due July 28, 2006.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
