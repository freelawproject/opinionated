Based on Guerra\u2019s prior convictions, the district court sentenced him pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-21\">Guerra contends the district court plainly erred by finding his 1997 possession-of-heroin-with-intent-to-deliver conviction qualified as an ACCA predicate offense. He claims the Texas statute under which he was convicted broadly defined \u201cdeliver\u201d to include an offer to sell drugs\u2014conduct that did not qualify for the \u00a7 924(e) enhancement. Because the Government failed to prove the specifics of his conduct, Guerra contends it also faded to prove his offense was a qualifying ACCA predicate offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-22\">Because Guerra did <em>not </em>object in district court to the use of this 1997 conviction as an ACCA predicate offense, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>15 F.3d 408, 414-15 (5th Cir.1994). Guerra points to no precedent in which this, or any other, court has found that the Texas statute under which he was convicted encompassed conduct not constituting an ACCA predicate offense. Absent such precedent, Guerra cannot establish the district court\u2019s finding was error, much less plain (\u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d) error. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>406 F.3d 323, 330 (5th Cir.) (\u201cAbsent any precedent directly supporting [appellant\u2019s] contention, it cannot be said that the alleged error was \u2018plain\u2019 for purposes of our review.\u201d), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>denied, </em>-U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 207, 163 L.Ed.2d 278 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Guerra next contends the court erred by classifying his 1985 burglary-of-a-habitation conviction as a violent felony under the ACCA. This issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Silva, </em>957 F.2d 157, 161-62 (5th Cir.) (holding a Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation is a violent felony for ACCA purposes), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 887, 113 S.Ct. 250, 121 L.Ed.2d 182 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Guerra also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 924(e)(1)\u2019s treatment of violent felonies and serious drug offenses as sentencing factors rather than as elements of an offense, and asserts \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional facially and as applied because it does not require a \u201csubstantial\u201d effect on interstate commerce. As Guerra concedes, his assertions are foreclosed by circuit precedent; he raises them only to preserve them for further review. <em>See United States v. Stone, </em>306 F.3d 241, 243 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>United States v. Affleck, </em>861 F.2d 97, 99 (5th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>489 U.S. 1058, 109 S.Ct. 1325, 103 L.Ed.2d 593 (1989)); <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1150, 122 S.Ct. 1113, 151 L.Ed.2d 1007 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-23\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
