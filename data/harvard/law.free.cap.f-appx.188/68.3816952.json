In his habeas petition, Dickens challenges the calculation of his good conduct time (GCT) by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Because we conclude that Dickens\u2019 appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">Dickens is currently serving a federal sentence of 60 months imposed in 2005. The BOP projects Dickens\u2019 release date as August 14, 2006. The BOP\u2019s calculation of GCT is based on the time Dickens will actually serve in prison, not on the entire 60-month sentence imposed. Dickens disagrees with the BOP\u2019s calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">After administratively challenging the BOP\u2019s calculation, Dickens filed a \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition in the District Court. In his habeas petition, Dickens argues that the BOP\u2019s calculation of his GCT deprives him of the amount to which he is entitled by statute. The District Court rejected Dickens\u2019 argument and denied his habeas petition. Dickens appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">We will affirm the District Court\u2019s order. As the District Court correctly stated, we resolved this issue in <em>O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172 (3d Cir.2005), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1906, 164 L.Ed.2d 583 (2006). In <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>we held that the meaning of \u00a7 3624(b) is ambiguous and thus deferred to the BOP\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the statute. <em>See id. </em>at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-18\">In short, Dickens\u2019 appeal is controlled by <em>O\u2019Donald </em>and presents us with no substantial question. Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>Third Circuit L.A.R. 27.4, I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-13\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact. <em>See Ruggiano v. Reish, </em>307 F.3d 121, 126 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
