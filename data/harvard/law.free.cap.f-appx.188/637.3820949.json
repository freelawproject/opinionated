We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-25\">We review the denial of the motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Ray v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 582, 586 (9th Cir.2006). Aliens in deportation proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>ings have a due process right to counsel of their own choice, which includes a right to competent representation. <em>See id. </em>at 587. This applies to a nonlawyer posing as an attorney. <em>See Lopez v. INS, </em>184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir.1999). To prevail, Rovere-Bianco and Salios de Alba must show that their counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced them, that is, that they had a plausible ground for relief based on the record before the BIA. <em>See Ray, </em>439 F.3d at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The record did not demonstrate a plausible ground for relief. In their application, Rovere-Bianco and Salios de Alba stated that they requested asylum for economic reasons. This is not a ground for relief under the asylum statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). They claim in their motion to reopen that they fear persecution as members of a \u201cparticular social group,\u201d <em>see id., </em>of \u201cArgentineans who are perceived as having come from abroad.\u201d This is not a plausible ground for relief. \u201c[A] particular social group is one united by a voluntary association, including a former association, <em>or </em>by an innate characteristic that is so fundamental to the identities or consciences of its members that members either cannot or should not be required to change it,\u201d and such a group must be \u201cnarrowly defined.\u201d <em>Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). Argentineans who are perceived as having come from abroad share neither a voluntary association nor an innate characteristic, and the group is too broad to qualify as a \u201cparticularized social group\u201d under the statute. <em>See id. </em>at 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Rovere-Bianco and Salios de Alba have not demonstrated a plausible ground for relief, and their claim of ineffective assistance of counsel therefore fails. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b662-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir.
