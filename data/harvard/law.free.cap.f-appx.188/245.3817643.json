Finding that Poore was a career criminal, the district court sentenced him on each count to 262 months in prison and five years of supervised release, the terms to run concurrently-</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Poore appeals, arguing that his sentence, imposed after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Here, the district court fulfilled its duty to consider all of the \u00a7 3553 factors and sentenced Poore to 262 months of imprisonment, which was the lowest end of the sentencing guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). This sentence is within the properly calculated advisory guidelines range and is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006). There is no indication that the sentence imposed was unreasonable. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519.
