Ariz. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>972 F.2d 1012 (9th Cir.1992) (discussing consent decree). More than 16 months later, on January 21, 2005, Jeffrey James Faulkner filed a motion, purportedly under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), asking the court to reconsider its decision to vacate the <em>Hook </em>consent decree. The court denied the motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Faulkner was not individually a party to the consent decree. Nor was a class ever finally certified, apparently because no representative was timely designated by the plaintiffs, as required by a 1994 court order. Accordingly, although he benefit-ted from the terms of the consent decree, Faulkner was not a party to the judgment. Rule 60(b) provides that \u201cthe court may relieve a party\u201d from a final judgment; a nonparty cannot move for relief under Rule 60(b) except in \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d <em>Citibank Int\u2019l v. Collier-Traino, Inc., </em>809 F.2d 1438, 1440-41 (9th Cir.1987), which are not present here. Thus, Faulkner was not entitled to have the court revisit the dismissal of the <em>Hook </em>case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In the circumstances, the district court\u2019s decision to deny Faulkner\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the <em>Hook </em>consent decree must be</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b601-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir.
