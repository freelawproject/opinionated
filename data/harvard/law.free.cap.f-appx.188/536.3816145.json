After a hearing, the district court found the government had met its burden of establishing by a preponderance of evidence that Bryant suffers from a mental illness requiring treatment in a suitable facility. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4245(d) (burden of proof). Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude the district court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Eckerson, </em>299 F.3d 913, 914-15 (8th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-17\">Specifically, the government offered a June 2004 report prepared by mental health professionals who were involved with Bryant\u2019s care at the Federal Medical Center (FMC) in Rochester, Minnesota, where Bryant is confined. These FMC professionals diagnosed psychotic disorder, substance abuse (in remission), and antisocial personality traits; they opined that Bryant\u2019s symptoms would likely remit if he accepted appropriate psychiatric treatment, but it was highly unlikely he would accept such treatment of his own volition, and without it his symptoms could intensify; and they recommended Bryant\u2019s commitment under section 4245. The opinions of the FMC professionals supported the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-18\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-15\">. The Honorable John R. Tunheim, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable Franklin L.
