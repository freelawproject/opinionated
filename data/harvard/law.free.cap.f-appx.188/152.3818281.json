Anna alleged disability due to high blood pressure, headaches and general pain post-surgery. The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) ruled that Anna was not disabled prior to or on the last day of her disability insurance, December 31, 1988, within the meaning of the Act and thus denied her benefits. The district court affirmed. Because substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s finding, we also affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AM\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-15\">From 1965 on, Anna repaired, cleaned and serviced watches, an occupation requiring very little physical exertion. She alleged that she became disabled in 1982 due to right kidney damage, sustained while undergoing a total abdominal hysterectomy. After her surgery, she often complained of pain in the right side of her back and legs and lightheadedness. She had to he down daily due to intense headaches. Also after the surgery, Anna\u2019s blood pressure was \u201csky high,\u201d and her legs and ankles were swollen which imposed difficulty for standing or walking long distances. Anna took over-the-counter medications (such as Excedrin) for headaches and Inderal for high blood pressure. In 1991, Anna collapsed and, while she was in the hospital, doctors discovered a tumor in her left kidney and that her urethra had been sliced. She subsequently underwent dialysis, had a kidney transplant and eventually died in August 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-16\">In evaluating Anna\u2019s claim for disability benefits, the ALJ stated that notes recorded during Anna\u2019s post-operative doctor visits revealed that she was doing well and that her incision was well-healed. Based on these physician\u2019s notes and the claimant\u2019s own descriptions of her medical condition, the ALJ concluded that the record did not document any condition or complication that could be associated with the surgery performed in 1982. He accordingly concluded that Jolanta\u2019s testimony was not corroborated by either the objective evidence or the evidence of record. Because Anna was not impaired to an extent that significantly limited her ability to perform basic work-related activities, she did not have a severe impairment as required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>for a finding of disability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The reviewing court does not engage in fact finding, so \u201cthe findings of the Commissioner [ ] as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive ....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). There must be medical evidence to disprove a claimant\u2019s testimony as to pain. <em>Green v. Schweiker, </em>749 F.2d 1066, 1070 (3d Cir.1984). An ALJ must make specific findings when evaluating a claimant\u2019s subjective pain. <em>Hargenrader v. Califano, </em>575 F.2d 434 (3d Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The Social Security Act defines disability as an \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 390, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">An individual shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Pursuant to the regulations, the ALJ engages in a five-step sequential analysis when evaluating whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). The claimant bears the burden of proof on steps one through four; if the claimant establishes her disability according to the first four factors, then the burden shifts to the Commissioner to demonstrate that the claimant is capable of performing other work in the national economy in view of her age, education and work experience. <em>Morales v. Apfel, </em>225 F.3d 310, 315-16 (3d Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">In the present case, the ALJ engaged in the five-step sequential analysis, but concluded that the claimant did not establish a severe impairment as required by step two. The ALJ considered claimant\u2019s allegations of pain but was not able to validate those allegations with treatment notes and no symptoms were diagnosed as resulting complications from the hysterectomy surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">Although the ALJ must consider subjective evidence of pain and combination of impairments, the final conclusion must be based on specific factual findings in the record. <em>Green, </em>749 F.2d at 1071 (\u201cThere must be objective medical evidence of some condition that could reasonably produce pain.\u201d). Subjective symptoms of pain can be validated if observed and treated over time by a physician. <em>Dorf v. Bowen, </em>794 F.2d 896, 902 (3d Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">Although Jolanta testified that Anna did not return to her work after surgery in 1982, she failed to show that Anna was not able to return to work. Anna\u2019s medical records contradict Jolanta\u2019s claims because they show that Anna was discharged in good condition. Jolanta also claims that Anna\u2019s blood pressure was \u201csky high,\u201d a claim which directly contradicts Dr. Sheflin\u2019s, Anna\u2019s treating physician\u2019s, notes indicating that Anna\u2019s blood pressure was stable post-operatively and was never excessively elevated throughout his time as Anna\u2019s physician. Dr. Sheflin noted that Anna was \u201cdoing well\u201d and she took over-the-counter pain relievers for her headaches. The ALJ noted \u201cthat although Jolanta\u2019s testimony chronologically detailed the reasons for her mother\u2019s inability to work during the period in question, her testimony is not corroborated by other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>evidence of record. Such a result is consistent with <em>Green, </em>749 F.2d at 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The ALJ offered the following reasons for rejecting Jolanta\u2019s testimony with proper citations to the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">The record shows that in May 1981, eighteen months prior to the surgery, the claimant\u2019s blood pressure was elevated. On March 30, 1983, the claimant was placed on Inderal, a medication used to treat both hypertension and migraine-type headaches. While the record does not specify what this medication was used for, two months later, on May 3, 1983, her blood pressure was under control, and remained so for the remainder of the period under consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">The claimant alleges that she was well until she had the surgery on November 9, 1982. The record repeatedly shows that the claimant did well post-operatively. By November 29, 1982, Dr. Sheflin noted that her incision was healed and on December 6, 1982, he noted that the claimant was \u201cdoing well post-op[eratively] and her [vaginal] cuff was also \u201cwell healed.\u201d On December 27, 1982, her incision was \u201cwell healed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">Thereafter, the claimant complained of hot flashes and was placed on hormone replacement therapy. On January 3, 1983, Dr. Sheflin noted that the claimant was \u201cimproving only slowly\u201d. She was noted to have hemorrhoids and was treated [for] ... this condition. On January 31, 1983, two and a half months after surgery, Dr. Sheflin again noted that the claimant was \u201cdoing well\u201d.... On May 23, 1983 he noted that she was \u201cmuch improved.\u201d On June 6, 1983 office notes indicate that the claimant was \u201cdoing well;\u201d her blood pressure was normal and she wanted to discontinue medication for the headaches.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">The ALJ cited to Anna\u2019s medical records when he determined that claimant\u2019s allegations were unfounded because Anna\u2019s incision was \u201cwell healed,\u201d her blood pressure was stable at all times after surgery and her alleged intensive headaches did not impair her and were improved by over-the-counter drugs. There were other symptoms that the ALJ considered but the regulation prevents a finding of severe impairment absent a previous medical diagnosis that could reasonably produce such symptoms. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">Anna never returned to work. At step two, the impairment is severe if it limits the person\u2019s ability to do basic work activities; an impairment is not severe if it is a slight abnormality that has only a minimal effect on the claimant\u2019s ability to do basic work activities. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521; Soc. Sec. Ruling (\u201cSSR\u201d) 85-28; <em>Ferguson v. Schweiker, </em>765 F.2d 31, 33 n. 2 (3d Cir.1985). Prior to the last date she was insured for disability insurance, Anna complained of moodiness, tinnitus, hives, swelling of legs and varicosities. The record, however, failed to indicate Anna\u2019s doctors ever diagnosed her with an impairment that was likely to cause any of the symptoms she alleged. There was no medical evidence of any significant kidney disease prior to 1991. Finally, Dr. Sheflin did not diagnose Anna with any impairments of a debilitating nature from any time after her surgery until December 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">There are no medical records indicating that the slicing of Anna\u2019s right urethra caused her kidney disease. Records indicate that Anna\u2019s kidney tumor, dialysis and eventual kidney failure caused her death but none of it related back to her urethra. The finding of the sliced urethra was part of the examination process, not part of the diagnosis. SSR 83-20 requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>an ALJ to call a medical expert only when a patient\u2019s medical records lead to an ambiguous onset date. There are no medical records indicating any symptoms of claimant\u2019s kidney disease until 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Since the records did not indicate a diagnosis of any impairments that cause the alleged symptoms, the ALJ found that claimant failed her burden of proof and therefore denied her benefits. There is substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Jolanta insists that the Commissioner twice lost claimant\u2019s records and that this should be weighed heavily against the Commissioner\u2019s findings. The record on appeal does contain a note that indicated one of claimant\u2019s physicians, Dr. Panotes, had lost her records due to a flood. Anna saw Dr. Panotes beginning in 1982; unfortunately, Dr. Panotes could only produce notes taken from 1988. Counsel offers no reason why the ALJ could not rely on Dr. Sheflin\u2019s treatment notes for the same period. If medical evidence in the record does not refute the treating physician\u2019s opinion, the ALJ is bound by it. <em>Allen v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 37, 42 (3d Cir.1989). The ALJ properly relied on Dr. Sheflin\u2019s treatment notes and other evidence in the record because no other evidence presented by the claimant refutes Dr. Sheflin\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
