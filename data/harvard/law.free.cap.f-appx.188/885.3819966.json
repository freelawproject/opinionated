Potts claims his constitutional rights were violated because he was sentenced for drug quantities neither charged in the indictment nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Potts also claims he is actually innocent of the offense. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Potts\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241.\u201d <em>Skinner v. Wiley, </em>355 F.3d 1293, 1294 (11th Cir.2004). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence are brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). However, under limited circumstances, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>Id. </em>That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-9\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Accordingly, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. The savings clause only applies when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision establishes the prisoner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). We have held the constitutional rules announced in <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker </em>do not apply retroactively on collateral review. <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 867-68 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 312, 163 L.Ed.2d 269 (2005); <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">Potts is challenging the validity of his sentence, which should have been raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion, yet he admits he never filed one. The district court did not err in denying Potts\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition because the savings clause does not apply to his claim. He cannot meet the initial prong of the savings clause test in <em>Wofford </em>because his claim is based on Supreme Court decisions that we have expressly held are not retroactively applicable on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">Potts\u2019 contention that <em>Apprendi </em>should have been applied retroactively to his case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>because he raised an Apprendi-based claim in his first petition for writ of <em>certiorari </em>lacks merit because he did not raise his <em>Apprendi </em>claim on direct appeal. We do not examine the other prongs of the <em>Wofford </em>test because Potts must meet all three in order to proceed. Additionally, we do not examine Potts\u2019 actual innocence claim because a petitioner may not assert actual innocence until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause applies to his claim. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
