We affirmed the conviction, vacated the sentence, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Sehen, </em>139 Fed.Appx. 508 (4th Cir.2005) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-19\">On remand, the district court resentenced Sehen to an identical term of 121 months\u2019 imprisonment. Sehen again appeals, contending the district court\u2019s application of a sentencing enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon in connection with a drug offense, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) (2002), was clearly erroneous. Furthermore, Sehen contends the district court did not sufficiently articulate its consideration of the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-20\">The district court\u2019s enhancement of Sehen\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001). Under the sentencing guidelines, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>defendant receives a two-level increase to his base offense level under USSG \u00a7 2Dl.1(b)(1) if a dangerous weapon was possessed during the offense. This \u201cadjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 201.1(b)(1) comment. (n.3). The Government need not establish a perfect connection between the possession of the firearm and the commission of the drug offense before the enhancement may be made. <em>See McAllister, </em>272 F.3d at 234. Evidence of firearms in proximity to illegal drugs can support a conclusion that the firearms were possessed during the commission of the drug offense. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>128 F.3d 850, 852 (4th Cir.1997). Moreover, the enhancement does not \u201crequire[ ] proof of precisely concurrent acts, for example, gun in hand while in the act of storing drugs, drugs in hand while in the act of retrieving a gun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">After carefully reviewing the evidence, we find Sehen has failed to show that it is \u201cclearly improbable that the weapons were connected with\u201d his drug offense. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.7). Therefore, we conclude the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing enhancement was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Additionally, we find no merit to Sehen\u2019s contention concerning the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. A \u201cdistrict court need not explicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 632 (4th Cir.2006) (citation omitted); <em>see United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>Apr. 17, 2006 (No. 05-10474)). \u201c[A] sentence imposed within the properly calculated Guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 342-44. Based on these principles, we find the district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and Sehen fails to rebut the presumption that his sentence, which was imposed at the top of the properly calculated sentencing guidelines range, was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
