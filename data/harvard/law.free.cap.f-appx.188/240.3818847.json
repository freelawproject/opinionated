He contends that the sentence, which exceeded the guideline range of 262 to 327 months of imprisonment, was unreasonable. He argues that the district court failed to properly articulate reasons for the sentence and improperly considered his age in determining the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">We review the sentence for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). The district court considered the Sentencing Guidelines, the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and thoroughly articulated the reasons for imposing a non-Guidelines sentence in this case. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). A review of those reasons shows that the district court did not fail to account for a sentencing factor that should have received significant weight, did not give significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, nor was the sentence imposed the result of clear error in balancing the sentencing factors. <em>Id. </em>at 708. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
