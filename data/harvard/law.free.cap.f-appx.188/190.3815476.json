Lo contends that the Board and Immigration Judge erred in finding him ineligible for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-23\">\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Having conducted our review, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that Lo failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-24\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b214-16\"> Lo also challenges the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). As the Board found that any challenges to the denial of CAT were waived as they were not effectively raised on appeal from the Immigration Judge, we find that we may not consider them in the context of this petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (West 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
