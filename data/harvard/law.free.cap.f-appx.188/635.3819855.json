He challenges a 16-level enhancement for reentry after deportation subsequent to sustaining a felony conviction by arguing (1) that the evidence was not suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>cient to prove his attempted reentry was subsequent to deportation, or that he was an alien, and (2) that the District Court improperly relied on a prior conviction to enhance his statutory maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Contrary to Diaz\u2019s contention, the evidence of the Immigration Judge\u2019s December 2003, indecision concerning Diaz\u2019s citizenship due to an incomplete record does not help prove the Attorney General\u2019s consent to Diaz\u2019s presence in the United States, or vitiate the effect of Diaz\u2019s previous removals, exclusions, and/or deportations. <em>See United States v. Pina-Jaime, </em>332 F.3d 609 (9th Cir.2003). Therefore, the Diaz\u2019s illegal reentry to the United States on January 7, 2004, following his April 2002 deportation order, can be found to constitute an illegal reentry pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The Immigration and Naturalization Services (\u201cINS\u201d) has promulgated detailed regulations governing the process by which the Attorney General will consent to a deported alien reapplying for admission into the United States, including a five-year waiting period and submission of an 1-212 form. <em>Id. </em>at 611-12. We find that the evidence presented during the underlying trial was sufficient that the jury could reasonably conclude that Diaz never attempted to legally reenter the United States, and thus that his January 7, 2004 reentry was illegal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Diaz\u2019s contention that his admissions of alienage at previous immigration hearings are inadmissable fails because \u201cthe law does not entitle aliens to counsel at deportation hearings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera-Sillas, </em>417 F.3d 1014, 1017-18 (9th Cir.2005). \u201cA deportation proceeding is administrative in nature and is not accompanied by a right to counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The government\u2019s evidence\u2014of Diaz\u2019s prior deportation, of previous admissions of alien-age before an Immigration Judge, and testimony from another individual named \u201cRaul Diaz-Martinez\u201d that contradicted the Defendant\u2019s claims regarding the birth certificate\u2014are sufficient proof that Diaz was an alien under the standard set forth in <em>United States v. Sotelo, </em>109 F.3d 1446, 1449 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Diaz\u2019s argument that the District Court erred in issuing a 16-level enhancement also fails. The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed its holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>which states that \u201c[a]ny fact, <em>other than a prior conviction, </em>which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (emphasis added); <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>U.S. v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Here, the District Court\u2019s enhancement was not erroneous as it was based on Diaz\u2019s previous convictions, which remain cognizable under <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b659-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
