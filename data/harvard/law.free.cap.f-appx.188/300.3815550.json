The district court sentenced Roberts to concurrent terms of 100 months of imprisonment and concurrent terms of three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-18\">Roberts argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he knew of the characteristics of the sawed-off shotgun that prohibit its possession under \u00a7 5861(d). Because Roberts failed to move for a judgment of acquittal, his sufficiency challenge is reviewed only for a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>United States v. Avants, </em>367 F.3d 433, 449 (5th Cir.2004). Such a miscarriage of justice occurs when the record is \u201cdevoid of evidence of guilt or the evidence [is] so tenuous that a conviction is shocking.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-19\">The Government was required to prove that Roberts knew of the features of the weapon that made it a \u201cfirearm\u201d under \u00a7 5845(a), specifically, that it was a shotgun having an overall length of less than 26 inches or a barrel of less than 18 inches in length. <em>Staples v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 600, 619-20, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 128 L.Ed.2d 608 (1994); <em>United States v. Reyna, </em>130 F.3d 104, 109-10 (5th Cir.1997); \u00a7 5845(a). The shotgun was admitted into evidence and could be inspected by the jury. Its barrel was 10-1/2 inches long and its overall length was only 17 inches. Such characteristics are readily apparent and externally visible.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-20\">The record is not devoid of evidence of Roberts\u2019s guilt. Roberts\u2019s conviction does not constitute a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>See Staples, </em>511 U.S. at 616 n. 11, 114 S.Ct. 1793; <em>Reyna, </em>130 F.3d at 109 n. 6; <em>Avants, </em>367 F.3d at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
