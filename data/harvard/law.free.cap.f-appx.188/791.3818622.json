Gonzalez-Huerta, </em>403 F.3d 727, 731-32 (10th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 495, 163 L.Ed.2d 375 (2005). Because Defendant-Appellant Claudia Ivette Torres failed to object to this error during sentencing, we review only for plain error. Because Torres has not established that she is entitled to resentencing under a plain-error standard and because the district court did not otherwise abuse its discretion in imposing a f\u00edne, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">After a jury convicted Torres of possessing, with the intent to distribute, more than fifty kilograms of marijuana,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court sentenced her to forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment and imposed a $7,000 fine. On direct appeal, Torres challenges only the fine, arguing that 1) the district court committed non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error when, in imposing the fine, the court treated the sentencing guidelines as mandatory; and 2) the district court abused its discretion in imposing any fine at all because Torres has no ability to pay it. Having jurisdiction to consider this appeal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we reject both arguments and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"APP\">II. ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">A. Non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-15\">At the time the district court sentenced Torres, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(a) required the district court to \u201cimpose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant establishes that [s]he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That provision further provided that where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A38\">the defendant establishes that (l)[s]he is not able and, even with the use of a reasonable installment schedule, is not likely to become able to pay all or part of the fine required by the preceding provisions, or (2) imposition of a fine would unduly burden the defendant\u2019s dependents, the court shall impose a lesser fine or waive the fine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-16\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5E1.2(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-17\">Under the guidelines, Torres, whose offense level was twenty-two, was subject to a minimum fine of $7,500. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5E1.2(b), (c)(3) <em>&amp; </em>(4). Although the district court found that Torres had failed to meet her burden of proving that she was unable to pay <em>any </em>fine, the district court exercised its discretion to impose a fine below the guideline range, requiring Torres to pay only a $7,000 fine. In doing so, however, it is clear that the district court felt constrained by \u00a7 5E1.2\u2019s mandate to impose some sort of fine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court noted that it was \u201ctrying to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>with the guidelines;\u201d inquired first of the probation officer exactly how the court should handle the situation \u201cwhere I don\u2019t think she has assets to meet the guidelines minimum;\u201d and further noted that \u201cthe guidelines say that the Court shall impose a fine in all cases except where the defendant establishes he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.\u201d In light of these remarks, it is clear that the district court, in imposing a fine, treated the sentencing guidelines as mandatory. Doing so amounted to non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error. <em>See Gonzalez-Huerta, </em>403 F.3d at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Because Torres did not assert a <em>Booker </em>objection at sentencing,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we will review only for plain error. <em>See Gonzalez-Huerta, </em>403 F.3d at 732.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-5\">Under [plain-error review], before an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-7\"><em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (quotations, citations, alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AI9\">It is clear that the district court, in treating the guidelines as mandatory, committed plain error. <em>See Gonzalez-Huerta, </em>403 F.3d at 732; <em>see also United States v. Meyer, </em>427 F.3d 558, 560-61 (8th Cir.2005) (holding it is <em>Booker </em>error to impose a fine while treating the guidelines as mandatory). The Government concedes as much. We need not address the plain-error test\u2019s third prong, however, because Torres cannot meet that test\u2019s fourth prong. <em>See United States v. Herron, </em>432 F.3d 1127, 1140 (10th Cir.2005), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1895, 164 L.Ed.2d 579 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">Under the plain-error test\u2019s fourth prong, we \u201cmay exercise [our] discretion to notice a forfeited error ... only if ... the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Cotton, </em>535 U.S. at 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781 (quotations, citations, alterations omitted). This court \u201cwill not notice a non-constitutional [Booker ] error ... unless it is both particularly egregious and our failure to notice the error would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Yazzie, </em>407 F.3d 1139, 1146 (10th Cir.) (en banc) (quotation omitted; emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 303, 163 L.Ed.2d 263 (2005). Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>\u201cin most cases involving non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error the defendant will be unable to satisfy the final [plain-error] prong.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>431 F.3d 1234, 1240 (10th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1823, 164 L.Ed.2d 555 (2006). In considering whether to notice non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error, this court has considered the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">\u201c(a) a sentence increased substantially based on a <em>Booker </em>error; (b) a showing that the district court would most likely impose a significantly lighter sentence on remand; (c) a substantial lack of evidence to support the entire sentence the Guidelines required the district court to impose; (d) a showing that objective consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors warrants a departure from the sentence suggested by the Guidelines; or (e) other evidence peculiar to the defendant that demonstrates a complete breakdown in the sentencing process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-8\"><em>United States v. Buonocore, </em>416 F.3d 1124, 1134-35 (10th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Dowlin, </em>408 F.3d 647, 669, 671 (10th Cir.2005)) (alterations omitted); see <em>also United States v. Thomas, </em>410 F.3d 1235, 1248, 1249 (10th Cir.2005). In this case, Torres has failed to meet her burden under this fourth prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">There is no suggestion in the record that, if we remanded this case, the district court, now treating the guidelines as only advisory, would impose a lighter fine or no fine at all. <em>See Herron, </em>432 F.3d at 1140. Although the district court, in sentencing Torres, obviously felt constrained by the then-mandatory guidelines to impose some fine, the district court exercised its discretion to impose a fine below the suggested guideline range after implicitly finding that Torres could only pay $7,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">Further, although the Government did not bear the burden of proving that Torres could pay that amount, the record, nevertheless, contains evidence that she could. There was, then, evidence to support the fine imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">In addition, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) provides that a sentence should reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law and provide just punishment, as well as avoid sentencing disparity. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (a)(6). In this case, Torres makes no clear argument on appeal why it would be unjust to impose a fine on her, and no such reason is apparent to us from the record. <em>See United States v. Moreno-Trevino, </em>432 F.3d 1181, 1188 (10th Cir.2005). The guidelines reflect that, upon conviction, imposition of a fine is the national norm. There is no reason apparent from the record that would take this case outside the heartland of federal convictions generally and justify a deviation from this national norm. <em>See Williams, </em>431 F.3d at 1240. Therefore, Torres has failed to meet her burden of convincing us to notice the district court\u2019s non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">B. Other challenges to the imposition of a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-15\">In addition to her <em>Booker </em>argument, Torres also asserts that the district court abused its discretion in imposing any fine at all.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-16\">1. Standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-17\">This court reviews the imposition of a. fine for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number><em>States v. Deters, </em>184 F.3d 1253, 1258 (10th Cir.1999). Torres bears the burden of proving \u201cboth h[er] present and future inability to pay.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>314 F.3d at 1228. This court will \u201creject a district court\u2019s findings regarding an ability to pay a fine only if they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>136 F.3d 1388, 1398 (10th Cir.1998). Further, the district court is not required to make specific factual findings before imposing a fine, so long as \u201cthe record reflects the basis for the imposition of the fine.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Washington-Williams, </em>945 F.2d 325, 328 (10th Cir.1991) (noting \u201c \u00a7 5E1.2 merely requires that the record reflect the district court\u2019s consideration of the pertinent factors prior to imposing the fine\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">2. Analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">To avoid any fine under \u00a7 5E1.2, Torres had to prove that \u201c(1) [s]he is not able and, even with the use of a reasonable installment schedule, is not likely to become able to pay all or part of the fine required by the preceding provisions, or (2) imposition of a fine would unduly burden the defendant\u2019s dependents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5E1.2(e). Torres failed to make that showing. Instead, there is plenty of evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that Torres can pay some sort of fine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> First, according to her own testimony, she owns property in Mexico valued at $10,000.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Second, the record indicates that she possesses professional skills as a nurse\u2019s aide that give her the future ability to pay some sort of fine. Therefore, because there is evidence indicating that Torres has both the present and future ability to pay some fine,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">For these reasons, we reject Torres\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s imposition of a $7,000 fine and AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b816-15\"> This Order and Judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-9\">. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-10\">. The jury convicted Torres of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C), as well as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Those statutes make it \"unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally ... to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with the intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). At sentencing, Torres stipulated to possessing over sixty-four kilograms of marijuana. Based upon that amount, Torres\u2019s conviction subjected her to a statutory maximum twenty-year sentence and a $1,000,000 fine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b817-19\">. The district court applied the version of \u00a7 5E1.2 effective November 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b817-20\">. The fact that \u00a7 5El.2(e) provides a mechanism by which the district court can impose a fine less than the minimum fine called for by the guidelines, <em>see United States v. Brown, </em>314 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>F.3d 1216, 1228 (10th Cir.2003), does not mean that this guideline provision was discretionary even before <em>Booker. See United States v. Huber, </em>404 F.3d 1047, 1063 (8th Cir.2005) (noting guideline provisions addressing fines are <em>now </em>advisory in light of Booker); <em>see also United States v. Adams, </em>432 F.3d 1092, 1093, 1094 (9th Cir.2006) (rejecting argument that, prior to <em>Booker, </em>a fine under \u00a7 5E1.2 was discretionary; holding that clear meaning <em>of </em>\u00a7 5E1.2(a)'s language was that \u201cif a defendant has the means to pay the fine, the imposition of a fine is mandatory\u201d). Before the district court could deviate from the guidelines\u2019 fine range, it had to make additional findings; for example, the district court had to find that the defendant had shown she could not pay the minimum amount the guidelines required, and the court had to find the amount the defendant could pay. Absent those findings, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(a) required the district court to impose a fine within the guidelines' range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b818-17\">. Although the Supreme Court had not yet decided <em>Booker </em>at the time the district court sentenced Torres, she could have preserved her <em>Booker </em>error by raising an objection under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). <em>See United States v. Marshall, </em>432 F.3d 1157, 1160 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b819-10\">. On appeal, Torres does not specifically challenge the <em>amount </em>of the fine imposed, but only the fact that the district court imposed any fine at all. Therefore, Torres's argument that the district court erred in considering U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(d)'s factors is unavailing. Those factors are relevant in determining the <em>amount </em>of a fine to be imposed. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(d); <em>United States v. Foote, </em>413 F.3d 1240, 1252 (10th Cir.2005) (noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>\u00a7 5E1.2(d)'s factors inform the district court\u2019s decision as to what the amount of the fine should be); <em>see also United States v. Corace, </em>146 F.3d 51, 56 (2d Cir.1998). In any event, it is clear that the district court considered these factors before imposing the $7,000 fine. The evidence before the district court addressed these issues. <em>See United States v. Doyan, </em>909 F.2d 412, 415 (10th Cir.1990) (noting record suggested that district court gave appropriate consideration to defendant\u2019s \u201cspecific circumstances\" where the issue of his \"financial limitations ... was raised both in the presentence report and during the sentencing hearing\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\">. For this reason, we need not consider Torres\u2019s assertion that, because the PSR indicated that she could not pay a fine, the burden of proof should have shifted to the Government to prove that she could pay a fine. Torres also asserts that the district court had to explain why it rejected the PSR's recommendation against a fine. To the extent that this assertion is true, the district court\u2019s reasons are clear. In particular, the district court noted that the PSR credited what Torres\u2019s mother told the probation officer preparing the <em>PSR-\u2014that the mother, and not </em>Torres, owned the property in Mexico. The district court, however, was unwilling to credit this assertion over Torres\u2019s own testimony given at sentencing that she, and not her mother, owned the Mexican property. Furthermore, after sentencing, defense counsel apparently sent the district court a letter acknowledging that it was Torres, and not the mother, who actually bought the property in Mexico, using money her mother gave her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b820-15\">. Although Torres now disputes this, she can hardly fault the district court for <em>crediting </em>her testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b820-16\">. Again, Torres has not specifically challenged the amount of the fine imposed, but instead has argued that the district court abused its discretion in imposing any fine at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
