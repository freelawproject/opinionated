MercExchange, L.L.C., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1837, 164 L.Ed.2d 641 (2006). After holding that both the district court and this court failed to apply \u201cthe traditional four-factor framework that governs the award of injunctive relief,\u201d the Supreme Court vacated the judgment of this court \u201cso that the District Court may apply that framework in the first instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 126 S.Ct. 1837. The Court added that \u201cthe decision whether to grant or deny injunctive relief rests within the equitable discretion of the district courts, and that such discretion must be exercised consistent with the traditional principles of equity, in patent disputes no less than in other cases governed by such standards.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-19\">The Supreme Court\u2019s mandate indicates that the case is remanded to us so as to enable the district court to apply the proper framework for considering injunctive relief \u201cin the first instance.\u201d That directive is best honored by remanding this case to the district court without further proceedings in this court at this time. The district court\u2019s decision whether to grant or deny injunctive relief will, of course, be subject to further review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-21\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-22\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-23\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion of the United States Supreme Court in <em>eBay Inc. et al. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., </em>(2006).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
