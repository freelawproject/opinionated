On July 8, 2005, Mansoor filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition seeking to enjoin his removal. The district court transferred the action to this court under the authority of the Real ID Act. See Real ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 302-11 (May 11, 2005). The Real ID Act instructs district courts to transfer to the appropriate courts of appeals all \u00a7 2241 petitions challenging final orders of removal, deportation, or exclusion \u201cpending in a district court on the date of the enactment of the Act,\u201d May 11, 2005. 119 Stat. 231, 311. Because Mansoor\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition was not pending in the district court on May 11, 2005, the district court\u2019s transfer of the case to this court under the REAL ID Act was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-25\">We lack jurisdiction over the petition for review because it was not filed within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s order denying Mansoor\u2019s motion to reopen. See 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u00a7 1252(b)(1). Consequently, Mansoor\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
