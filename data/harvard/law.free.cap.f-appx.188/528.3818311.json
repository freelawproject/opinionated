Pree was indicted on one count of failing to file a tax return for the tax year 1994, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, and on two counts of filing false tax returns for the tax years 1995 and 1996, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1). A jury acquitted her of the failure-to-file charge but found her guilty on both counts of falsifying her two subsequent tax returns. The district court sentenced her to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of the range as recommended by the then-mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines, to be followed by one year of supervised release. Relying on Guidelines \u00a7 5E1.1, the court also ordered, as a condition of her supervised release, that Ms. Pree pay taxes owed'to the IRS in the amount of $38,852. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-20\">While Ms. Pree\u2019s first appeal to this court remained pending, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory. Retaining jurisdiction, we remanded Ms. Pree\u2019s case to ask whether the district court would have imposed the same condition of tax repayment upon Ms. Pree\u2019s supervised release had it understood the Guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory. <em>See United States v. Paladino, </em>401 F.3d 471, 483-84 (7th Cir.2005). In an order entered July 28, 2005, the district court replied that, were it required to resentence Ms. Pree, it would not have imposed the same condition of supervised release. Accordingly, pursuant to <em>Paladino, </em>we vacate Ms. Pree\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
