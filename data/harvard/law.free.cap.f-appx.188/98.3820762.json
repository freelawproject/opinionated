As we write primarily for the parties, who are familiar with the record, our recitation of the facts will be limited to those necessary to our determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">On June 21, 2002, Patrolman Sheehan of the Berlin Township, New Jersey, Police Department pulled Greene over for driving a car in excess of the posted speed limit. After discovering that Greene\u2019s driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration had been suspended, Patrolman Sheehan told Greene the car would be impounded. Greene asked the police to retrieve documents from the vehicle\u2019s glove compartment. A back-up officer opened the glove compartment and saw inside it, in plain view, a clear plastic bag with nine red plastic bags in turn containing a white, rock-like substance. Suspecting that the substance was an illegal drug, the officers placed Greene under arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A police dog alerted the officers to the scent of drugs both in the car\u2019s center console and on cash taken from Greene\u2019s pocket. From the center console, the police seized a loaded .45-caliber Glock semi-automatic pistol with its serial number scratched off, $8000 in cash, several cellular telephones, and mail addressed to Greene.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">Thereafter, Greene pled guilty in the District Court to a one-count indictment charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1)\u2014knowing possession of a firearm by a formerly convicted felon. In a written plea agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d), Greene stipulated that the applicable Sentencing Guideline for his knowing and willful possession of the gun was U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), under which the base offense level was at least 20 due to his prior conviction for a controlled-substanee offense. Further, Greene stipulated in the Agreement that the gun\u2019s serial number had been obliterated, subjecting him to a two-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4), and that he was entitled to a reduction of three sentencing levels for acceptance of responsibility (pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">The Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) adopted each of the Agreement\u2019s stipulations. The PSR also determined that Greene was subject to a four-level enhancement for possession of a firearm \u201cin connection with another felony offense\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), and calculated a Total Offense Level of 23. Greene both objected to this enhancement and moved for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 based upon claimed post-offense rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-15\">The District Court conducted a sentencing hearing on June 3, 2004. At the conclusion of the hearing, it issued an oral opinion stating that the Government had satisfied its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Greene was engaged in the felony of drug distribution when he was arrested on June 21, 2002 and possessed the .45 caliber pistol in connection with that felony. The Court found that Greene\u2019s Total Offense Level was 23 and, based upon an uncontested Criminal History Category of III, found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>that the applicable Guidelines range was 57 to 71 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">At the sentencing hearing, the District Court also heard argument regarding Greene\u2019s downward departure motion. The Court concluded that it had authority to grant Greene\u2019s requested departure. Nevertheless, it denied the departure, and instead determined that Greene\u2019s effort at rehabilitation after his arrest \u201cwarrants a sentence in the low end of the Guideline range,\u201d App. at 96. The court imposed a sentence of 57 months with a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Greene timely filed the present appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Greene makes three arguments on appeal: (1) that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the District Court plainly erred by sentencing him pursuant to an unconstitutional sentencing scheme, (2) that the District Court clearly erred by finding that Greene possessed a firearm in connection with the uncharged felony offense of drug distribution, and (3) that the District Court plainly erred by relying at sentencing upon the Judge\u2019s personal experience with drug distribution cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The Supreme Court in <em>Booker </em>held that the then-prevailing sentence scheme which mandated that sentencing judges apply the Sentencing Guidelines was unconstitutional. It is undisputed that the District Court, in sentencing Greene six months before the <em>Booker </em>decision, treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory. Greene is therefore entitled to resentencing. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 162, 165 (3d Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">On remand, the District Court will have the opportunity to address Greene\u2019s challenge to the finding of the connection between the firearm and drug distribution, a connection this court has previously recognized. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Russell, </em>134 F.3d 171, 183 (3d Cir.1998) (\u201c[G]uns are a tool of the drug trade.\u201d); <em>United States v. Adams, </em>759 F.2d 1099, 1108 (3d Cir.1985) (equating the gun with \u201cthe most commonly recognized narcotics paraphernalia\u201d); <em>see also, e.g., United States v. Perez, </em>280 F.3d 318, 342 (3d Cir.2002) (concluding that expert testimony discussing drug traffickers\u2019 use of cell phones and pagers to evade location by police investigators was properly admitted by the district court); <em>United States v. Ten Thousand Seven Hundred Dollars &amp; No Cents in United States Currency, </em>258 F.3d 215, 232 (3d Cir.2001) (observing \u201cthat the amount of money in claimants\u2019 possession ... constitute^] probative circumstantial evidence that the currency itself is connected to illicit narcotics transactions\u201d). The evidence in this case, the nine bags containing drugs in the glove compartment and $3,000 in cash alongside several cellular telephones in the center console, appears to fall within those precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">Accordingly, we will vacate Greene\u2019s sentence and remand this matter for re-sentencing consistent with <em>Booker. See generally United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324 (3d Cir.2006) (discussing standards for <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-12\">. A forensic examination later confirmed that the substance was cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\">. The Government argues that \"[t]o the extent that Greene seeks review of the District Court\u2019s discretionary denial of Greene\u2019s motion for a downward departure pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0, this Court is without jurisdiction to consider that claim.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 1 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)). In <em>Cooper, </em>we reaffirmed our <em>pre-Booker </em>precedent barring appellate review of district courts\u2019 \"discretionary decisions to deny departure, unless for allegation of legal error.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 332 (citing, inter alia, <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>536 U.S. 622, 626-28, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586 (2002)). Our vacation and remand of Greene\u2019s sentence affords him the opportunity to seek downward departure anew. We express no opinion on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
