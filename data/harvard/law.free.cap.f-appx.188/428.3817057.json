Sargus, Jr., United States Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b453-12\">BOYCE F. MARTIN, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">The defendant, Jimmy Melton, was charged with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, aiding and abetting the manufacture and attempt to manufacture methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), 846, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, aiding and abetting the possession of chemicals, equipment, products, and materials with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), 843(a)(6), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and aiding and abetting the possession of pseudoephedrine with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(c), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Melton pled guilty and was sentenced to a term of 120 months imprisonment. He now challenges his sentence by arguing that it was calculated based on unconstitutional judicial fact-finding and that it is unreasonable. We now affirm the defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">Melton pled guilty to count one of the indictment pursuant to a written plea agreement. In the written agreement, Melton waived his right to appeal his sentence. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the government agreed to amend the plea agreement to permit appeal of \u201cany <em>Booker </em>issues.\u201d At sentencing, the district court heard arguments regarding various enhancements, including one for possessing firearms, creating a risk to human life, being on probation, and committing a crime within two years after release from prior imprisonment. Thus, the district court calculated a criminal history catego<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>ry of III, and a base offense level of 31. The court applied a three point reduction for acceptance of responsibility, leading to an advisory guideline range of 97-121 months imprisonment. The statutory minimum to maximum range was five to forty years. The court then sentenced Melton to 120 months imprisonment and stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">[The sentencing range] is an enormous improvement over where Mr. Melton started. That\u2019s the range that\u2019s recommended; and the court\u2019s not bound by that range, but that\u2019s at least to be considered by the court....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">Mr. Melton, I have an advisory range of 97 to 121 months that I\u2019m not required to follow. I can go below it or above it, but that\u2019s the range that I\u2019m to start with.... Mr. Melton, you have gotten involved in a crime that is in this court\u2019s view about as serious a crime as one can participate in short of murder or armed robbery. In the drug genre, this is the most serious crime there is. Manufacturing or conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine is as bad as it gets because methamphetamine is the worst drug this country has faced, at least in my experience. It\u2019s horrendous, and the impact it has on society is just immeasurable. I see every day families broken up, parents lose their children, children lose their [parents], spouses lose then-husbands or wives because of methamphetamine. It is\u2014it is as bad as the bubonic plague. And Congress declared that it should be punished severely, and I think appropriately so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">Your range is 97 to 121 months; and while I\u2019m not required to follow that range, I\u2019m going to in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">You were very fortunate that you got a plea agreement in this case limiting the quantity of drugs. If you had not\u2014If the timing had not been such, you would have been facing somewhere in the range of thirty years in prison. But because of the uncertainty in the law, your lawyer managed to get a favorable plea agreement for you limiting the quantity of drugs. I\u2019m, therefore, going to sentence you to 120 months in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiZ\">I also want you to make restitution to the Drag Enforcement Administration in the amount of $3,007.25.... I\u2019m going to make you and all the other codefendants jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of this restitution....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2O\">Mr. Melton, I hope that you understand that you caught a real break in this case on the sentencing in that while 120 months is a long time, it\u2019s not nearly as long as 360 to life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">\n<em>A. Judicial Factfinding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">Before turning to the Sixth Amendment question, the government asserts that Melton may not appeal the calculation of his advisory guideline range. Despite this assertion, the government concedes that Melton may appeal any <em>Booker </em>issue, and \u201conly a reasonableness review of the sentence remains.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 22. This Court has held that to evaluate a sentence for reasonableness, it must first be determined whether the advisory guideline range was properly calculated. <em>United States v. McBride, </em>434 F.3d 470, 476 (6th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Mickelson, </em>433 F.3d 1050 (8th Cir.2006) (\u201cAs we recognized in <em>United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1002-03 (8th Cir.2005), calculation of the appropriate guideline sentence is only the first step in sentencing decisions under <em>Booker, </em>for the court must also consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before making its ultimate decision.\u201d)). Thus, the calculation of the advi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>sory guideline range is properly before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Melton claims now, as he did at sentencing, that <em>all </em>judicial factfinding is prohibited at sentencing and that the only facts that can be considered are those found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury or admitted by the defendant. In <em>United States v. Coffee, </em>this Court reiterated its \u201crecent admonition ... [that] <em>\u2018Booker </em>did not eliminate judicial factfinding\u2019 and that district courts \u2018must [ ] calculate the Guideline range as they would have done prior to Booker....\u201d 434 F.3d 887, 897-98 (6th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Stone, </em>432 F.3d 651, 654-55 (6th Cir.2005)); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>411 F.3d 675, 678 (6th Cir.2005) <em>\u201c(Booker </em>did not eliminate judicial fact-finding in sentencing in cases where a defendant plead[s] guilty.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Nguyen, </em>176 Fed.Appx. 634 (6th Cir.2006) (holding that \u201cjudicial fact-finding that is necessary to calculate an advisory Guidelines range comports with the Sixth Amendment\u201d and \u201cmust be based upon reliable information and supported by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d); <em>United States v. Pickett, </em>2006 WL 1208074 (6th Cir. May 3, 2006) (finding no Sixth Amendment violation because the district court did not use judicially found facts to sentence the defendant beyond the statutorily authorized maximum term).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The Second Circuit has likewise held that a sentencing court may find facts relevant to sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence so long as: (1) the court does not impose the sentence under the misconception that the Guidelines are mandatory; and (2) the sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum authorized by the jury verdict or facts admitted by the defendant. <em>United States v. Vaughn, </em>430 F.3d 518, 527 (2d Cir.2005). The Seventh Circuit has reached the same conclusion. <em>See United States v. Bryant, </em>420 F.3d 652, 656 (7th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Booker </em>and <em>post-Booker </em>cases do not \u201cforeclose judicial factfinding in the sentencing context, <em>nor </em>do they dictate that judges must find those facts beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). That is, <em>\u201cBooker </em>and its predecessors make clear that a Sixth Amendment problem emerges if judicial factfinding results in a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum, for example, or if such factfinding requires a particular sentence in the context of a mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme.\u201d <em>Id.; accord United States v. Trujillo-Terrazas, </em>405 F.3d 814, 818 (10th Cir.2005) (\u201cBy rendering the Guidelines discretionary, the [Supreme] Court saved the process of judicial factfinding from unconstitutionality under the Sixth Amendment.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Yeje-Cabrera, </em>430 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 330 (3d Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th <em>Cir.2005); United States v. Pirani, </em>406 F.3d 543, 551 n. 4 (8th Cir.2005) (en banc); <em>United States v. Dare, </em>425 F.3d 634, 642 (9th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Coles, </em>403 F.3d 764, 769 (D.C.Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">In this case, to apply the firearm enhancement in a conspiracy case, the government must demonstrate that the defendant or a member of the conspiracy \u201cpossessed the firearm and that the member\u2019s possession was reasonably foreseeable by other members in the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>344 F.3d 562, 565 (6th Cir.2003). Once the government demonstrates possession, the defendant can avoid the enhancement by showing that it was \u201cclearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565-67 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.1(b)(1), cmt. 3). In this case, the district court found that \u201cthere was an arsenal at this house,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>where the methamphetamine was being cooked. The district court then found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmU\">... it was some thirteen firearms scattered throughout the house. The court cannot find that these firearms were not related to the drug conspiracy, and it seems extremely likely that this arsenal was kept there to protect either the proceeds of the methamphetamine cook or the drugs themselves or perhaps the safety of the cookers. Based upon paragraph 8 in the plea agreement, the court finds that a firearm was possessed during this drug conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Melton did not contest the actual facts; rather, he merely asserted that the district court lacked the power to find facts. As discussed above,- the district court does have the power to engage in judicial fact-finding, and the enhancement here is established by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Likewise, the district court enhanced the defendant\u2019s sentence for substantial risk to human life. The court stated that it \u201ccan take notice that methamphetamine cooks are extremely hazardous, particularly in the quantities that we have in this case. The fact that the hazardous materials team arrived to clean up the mess is evidence that this was a hazardous situation because the hazmat team would not be needed were it not a substantial risk to human life.\u201d This enhancement is established by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Because the advisory guideline range was properly calculated, this Court now turns to the reasonableness of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\n<em>B. Reasonableness Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court held that the federal sentencing guidelines are now advisory. A district court must \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes set forth in [\u00a7 3553(a)(2) ].\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). This Court now reviews sentences for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>403 F.3d 373, 383 (6th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Foreman, </em>436 F.3d 638, 644 n. 1 (6th Cir.2006) (stating that reasonableness is the <em>appellate </em>standard of review). This Court has held that \u201cwe may conclude that a sentence is unreasonable when the district judge fails to \u2018consider\u2019 the applicable guidelines range or neglects to \u2018consider\u2019 the other factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and instead simply selects what the judge deems an appropriate sentence without such consideration.\u201d <em>Webb, </em>403 F.3d at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">In <em>United States v. Williams, </em>436 F.3d 706, 708 (6th Cir.2006), this Court determined that a sentence within a properly calculated advisory guideline range is afforded a presumption of reasonableness. Nevertheless, this \u201crebuttable presumption does not relieve the district court of the obligation to consider other relevant statutory factors or sufficiently articulate its reasoning so as to permit reasonable appellate review.\u201d <em>United States v. Morris, </em>448 F.3d 929, 931 (6th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>437 F.3d 550 (6th Cir.2006)); <em>see also Foreman, </em>436 F.3d at 644 (explaining that <em>\u201cWilliams </em>does not mean that a Guideline sentence will be found reasonable in the absence of evidence in the record that the district court considered all of the relevant section 3553(a) factors\u201d); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>408 F.3d 301, 305 (6th Cir.2005) (reaffirming that \u201cwe as an appellate court must still have the articulation of the reasons the district court reached the sentence ultimately imposed\u201d). Although this Court does not require \u201cthe ritual incantation of these factors to affirm a sentence,\u201d <em>Williams, </em>436 F.3d at 708-09, there must be \u201csufficient evidence in the record to <em>affirmatively demonstrate </em>the court\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>sideration\u201d of the relevant section 3553(a) factors, <em>McBride, 434 F.3d at 476 n. 3.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In this case, the district court properly calculated the advisory guideline range. The court then imposed a sentence at the at the top of that advisory range. The court provided a reasonable explanation for its sentence, much of which occurred while discussing the presentence report. During the actual imposition of the sentence, the district court touched on nearly every single section 3553(a) factor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, the district court discussed the nature and circumstances of the offense, including the large quantity of drugs, firearms, and danger involved. The court also considered Melton\u2019s characteristics, including his past criminal history. The court discussed the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense by describing the manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine \u201cas serious a crime as one can participate in short of murder and armed robbery\u201d and stated that \u201cit is as bad as the bubonic plague.\u201d The court discussed the need to protect the public from the defendant\u2019s crimes by discussing the effect methamphetamine has on American citizens and families. The district court acknowledged the other types of sentences <em>available\u2014i.e., </em>the court acknowledged that it could vary from the advisory range by going higher or lower, but chose to stay within the range in this case. The court also determined that based on the crime and the defendant\u2019s characteristics, he should not be housed in a minimum security facility. The court also discussed how fortunate the defendant was in this case that his plea agreement limited the drug quantity and that the defendant was truly eligible for a sentence of from thirty years up to life imprisonment. The court also discussed Congress\u2019s intent to impose harsh sentences for the defendant\u2019s crimes, and finally, the court considered the need to provide restitution and so ordered restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Moreover, on appeal, the defendant has failed to offer \u201cany explanation [] as to what factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) the district court should have considered, or how these factors would have made a difference in the sentence he received.\u201d <em>United States v. Christopher, </em>415 F.3d 590, 594 (6th Cir. 2005). Thus, we hold that the sentence is reasonable and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">For the reasons discussed above, we AFFIRM the sentence imposed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-6\">. The factors include the nature and circumstances of the offense and the characteristics of the offender; the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment; the kind of sentences available; the appropriate advisory guideline range; pertinent policy statement by the Sentencing Commission; the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and the need to provide restitution. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
