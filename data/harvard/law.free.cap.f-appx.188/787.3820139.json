Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <em>see United States v. Salazar, </em>149 F. App\u2019x 816 (10th Cir.2005). The government has now filed a motion under <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315 (10th Cir.2004), to enforce an appeal waiver included in Salazar\u2019s plea agreement. For reasons explained below, we grant the motion and dismiss the appeal accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Salazar pled guilty to distributing fifty grams or more of methamphetamine in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). His plea agreement recited that \u201c[e]xcept as set forth herein, defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives any right to appeal or collaterally attack any matter in connection with this prosecution and sentence.\u201d Plea Agreement at 5, para. 9 (filed March 29, 2004). It went on to state that he \u201cknowingly waives any right to appeal a sentence imposed which is within the guideline range determined appropriate by the court,\u201d i.e., that \u201che waives the right to appeal ... except to the extent, if any, the court departs upwards from the applicable sentencing guideline range determined by the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He expressly reserved a right to appeal, however, if he was sentenced as a career offender based on a determination that his \u201cprior conviction for involuntary [vehicular] manslaughter or either of the assault convictions arising out of the same vehicle accident is a crime of violence within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The issue here is whether this waiver encompasses the present appeal and satisfies the conditions for enforcement set out in <em>Hahn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">Under <em>Hahn, </em>we must consider \u201c(1) whether the disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights; (2) whether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights; and (3) whether enforcing the waiver would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d 359 F.3d at 1325. The miscarriage-of-justice prong requires the defendant to show (a) his sentence relied on an impermissible factor such as race; (b) ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with the negotiation of the appeal waiver rendered the waiver invalid; (c) his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum; or (d) his appeal waiver is otherwise unlawful. <em>Id. </em>at 1327. The government\u2019s motion addresses all of these factors, explaining why none of them undermines Salazar\u2019s appeal waiver. Upon review of the pertinent materials, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">Salazar\u2019s response to the government\u2019s motion raises an issue that jointly implicates the first two factors. He insists that the following statement made by the district court during the plea colloquy in ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>feet greatly expanded the range of matters he reasonably understood to fall outside the waiver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-4\">[U]nder the written plea agreement in paragraph 9 [which contains the appeal waiver and reservation language] you have waived your right to appeal the sentence that I impose <em>unless my sentence would be an illegal one </em>or unless I should make an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Doc. 70 at 7 (emphasis added). He argues that \u201c[s]ince the court clearly stated the defendant would be able to appeal an illegal sentence, ostensibly any illegal sentence, there is an ambiguity which occurred at the time of the explanation of the appellant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Opposition to Motion to Enforce Appeal Waiver at 4. Noting that ambiguities in such waivers are to be construed against the government, <em>see United States v. Porter, </em>405 F.3d 1136, 1142 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 550, 163 L.Ed.2d 466 (2005), Salazar apparently concludes (though he does not explicitly say) that he is free to appeal on the ground of any sentencing error that could be characterized as legal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Assuming that the court\u2019s mischaracterization of an appeal waiver could ere-ate a material ambiguity not present in the language of the waiver itself,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we conclude that the ambiguity suggested here would not in any event authorize Salazar\u2019s appeal. The court\u2019s reference to an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d could, at most, have reserved a very limited category of permissible appeals into which Salazar\u2019s appeal would not fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">We have repeatedly held that \u201cillegal sentence\u201d is not a catch-all term referring to any legal error in the imposition of sentence; rather, a sentence is illegal if it \u201c \u2018is ambiguous with respect to the time and manner in which it is to be served, is internally contradictory, omits a term required to be imposed by statute, is uncertain as to the substance of the sentence, or is a sentence which the judgment of conviction did not authorize.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Dougherty, </em>106 F.3d 1514, 1515 (10th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Wainwright, </em>938 F.2d 1096, 1098 (10th Cir.1991) (citation and further quotation omitted)); see <em>also United States v. Gonzalez-Huerta, </em>403 F.3d 727, 739 n. 10 (10th Cir.) (holding sentence, even if wrongfully imposed, was not illegal because it did not exceed statutory maximum), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 495, 163 L.Ed.2d 375 (2005); <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number><em>Brown, </em>316 F.3d 1151, 1160 n. 4 (10th Cir.2003) (same).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Salazar does not argue, nor do any of the materials submitted to us suggest, that his sentence is deficient in any such fundamental respect. His objection that his sentence was imposed \u201cin violation of law\u201d asserts nothing more than a generic claim of error insufficient to implicate the extremely limited waiver exception the court\u2019s reference to \u201cillegal sentence\u201d may have created. <em>Cf. Gonzalez-Huerta, </em>403 F.3d at 739 n. 10; <em>Brown, </em>316 F.3d at 1160 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Turning to the remainder of the <em>Hahn </em>test, the government contends that there are no grounds to doubt, in more general fashion, the knowing and voluntary nature of Salazar\u2019s plea and associated appeal waiver, and Salazar has not disputed the point. Moreover, we have reviewed the primary record sources relating to this issue\u2014the language of the plea agreement and the Rule 11 colloquy at the plea hearing, <em>see Hahn, </em>359 F.3d at 1325\u2014and agree with the government that they do not reflect any deficiencies that would invalidate the appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">We also discern no basis upon which to find a miscarriage of justice. There is nothing in the record, and nothing suggested by Salazar outside the record, to indicate that an impermissible sentencing factor was involved. The sentence imposed was within the statutory maximum. There has been no suggestion that counsel was ineffective in any way with respect to the plea and associated waiver. The only remaining basis for finding a miscarriage of justice, i.e., that the waiver was \u201cotherwise unlawful,\u201d requires the demonstration of an error that \u201c \u2018seriously affeet[ed] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hahn, </em>359 F.3d at 1329 (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). No potential error of that magnitude has been suggested or is otherwise evident here.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">The government\u2019s motion to enforce the appeal waiver and dismiss the appeal is GRANTED. The appeal is DISMISSED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b813-8\">This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-13\">. When the district court found Salazar to be a career offender based on the manslaughter conviction, he appealed that determination and also challenged his sentence under <em>Booker. </em>We affirmed the career-offender ruling but vacated and remanded for resentencing under a non-mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines as prescribed by <em>Booker. See Salazar, </em>149 F. App\u2019x at 818-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b814-9\">. The government notes that Salazar has broadly designated the issue to be raised on appeal as whether his sentence \" \u2018was in violation of law.\u2019 \u201d Appellee's Motion to Enforce Appeal Waiver at 7 (quoting Docketing Statement at 4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b814-10\">. This appears to be an unsettled question. We have held that statements made by the court <em>at sentencing </em>cannot overcome the plain language of an appeal waiver. <em>United States v. Arevalo-Jimenez, </em>372 F.3d 1204, 1206-07 (10th Cir.2004). Our emphasis on the fact that such statements were made \"after the appeal waiver was signed and the guilty plea was entered,\" <em>id. </em>at 1206, suggests that a court\u2019s mischaracterization of an appeal waiver might create an ambiguity if expressed during the plea proceedings, but we have not yet conclusively so held. At least one other circuit in accord with <em>Arevalo-Jimenez </em>has noted the same distinction while specifically leaving the effect of erroneous statements made at the plea proceedings an open question. <em>United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 891 n. 5 (8th Cir.2003). We note that it is also not clear whether the principle that ambiguities be construed against the government, as drafter of the plea agreement, would apply to ambiguities created by statements from the bench.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b814-15\">. We have also recognized that an unconstitutional sentence is \"illegal.\u201d <em>See United States v. Groves, </em>369 F.3d 1178, 1182 (10th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b815-7\">. While we look to the defendant\u2019s understanding of his plea agreement here, that understanding must be <em>reasonable. United States v. Chavez-Salais, </em>337 F.3d 1170, 1172 (10th Cir.2003). Given the established meaning of \"illegal sentence,\u201d Salazar cannot reasonably have understood this reference as creating the broad exception he now seeks to invoke. Indeed, his aberrant gloss on the term would gut the bargain struck by the government in the plea agreement and render superfluous his own express reservation of a right to appeal the crime-of-violence determination, which, as an issue of law, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Moore, </em>401 F.3d 1220, 1225 (10th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>113 F.3d 1528, 1532-33 (10th Cir.1997), would be appealable in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
