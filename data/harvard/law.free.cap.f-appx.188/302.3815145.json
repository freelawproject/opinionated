Momin argues that the BIA abused its discretion and violated his due process rights when it denied his motion to reopen because the BIA ignored evidence submitted by Momin that country conditions in Pakistan made it unsafe for him to bring his family to that country.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Momin\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal are grounded in the treatment he fears his family would receive because of his interfaith, interracial marriage. Momin has failed to demonstrate that the evidence he submitted to the BIA could not have been discovered earlier and presented to the immigration judge during the deportation proceedings. He thus has not shown that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen. <em>See Ogbemudia v. INS, </em>988 F.2d 595, 600 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Accordingly, Momin\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
