DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AxU\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\"><em>\u201cWe </em>review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning, and we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s. To the extent the IJ\u2019s decision was based upon a legal determination, we review the IJ\u2019s decision de novo. <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). We review the IJ\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence standard, and \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record eonsidered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (citations omitted). \u201cUnder this highly deferential standard of review, the IJ\u2019s decision can be reversed only if the evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230 (quotations and citations omitted). The IJ\u2019s credibility determination is also reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and this Court does \u201cnot substitute its judgment for that of the IJ with respect to its credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">B. <em>Asylum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). However, the applicant must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within one year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States unless the alien can show (1) changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or (2) extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within one year. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (D). Courts do not have jurisdiction to review a determination of the Attorney General as to the timeliness of an asylum application or the existence of changed or extraordinary circumstances. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>see also Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (holding we continue to lack jurisdiction over this determination after the enactment of the Real ID Act of 2005). Here, the IJ found Palacio failed to show extraordinary cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>cumstances excusing the late filing of his asylum application, and we do not have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination. Thus, we dismiss his petition as to the asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">C. <em>Withholding of Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">The INA provides \u201cthe Attorney General may not remove an alien to a country if the Attorney General decides that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The applicant bears the burden of demonstrating \u201cthat it is more likely than not [h]e will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to [his] country.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232 (quotations and citation omitted). This burden of proof for withholding of removal is more stringent than the burden for asylum. <em>Id. </em>Thus, if an applicant is unable to meet the well-founded fear standard for asylum,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he is generally precluded from qualifying for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 1232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">An adverse credibility finding can be fatal to an applicant\u2019s asylum claim if the applicant fails to corroborate his testimony. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). An adverse credibility finding, however, \u201cdoes not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Once the IJ makes an adverse credibility determination, the burden is on the applicant to show the determination was not based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Afo\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. The IJ presented specific, cogent reasons for his finding that Palacio was not a credible witness, pointing to the discrepancy between Palacio\u2019s testimony and the police report submitted in support of his application. Palacio testified the writer of the letter he received at his parents\u2019 house stated he was from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia Fifth Front, the same group Palacio claimed was threatening him based on his work with the youth in his area. The police report, however, stated Palacio reported the letter was related to an incident in which a group of guerillas stole Palacio\u2019s motorcycle, and Palacio believed he was being threatened because he reported the incident. Palacio also testified that, after the incident with the letter on February 3, 1999, nothing else happened. The police report, however, stated Palacio received a threatening phone call after receiving the letter. Palacio attempted to explain the discrepancy by stating he did not go into the detail with the police because of the guerillas in the region. This statement does not explain the discrepancy, however, because Palacio accused the guerillas of making the threats in the police report, but for a different reason\u2014because he reported the theft of his motorcycle. Further, Palacio\u2019s father later filed a police complaint, in which he stated Palacio was a victim of threats because of the motorcycle incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">Additionally, the IJ\u2019s finding that Palacio\u2019s testimony was vague and lacked specific detail is also supported by substantial evidence. For instance, Palacio could not recall the full names of some of his Community Action Board (CAB) colleagues. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>Further, he gave little detail about the particular activities he organized for the youth. Also, when questioned about certain details related to either his political work or the threats, Palacio did not answer the question and had to be asked more than once before he provided an answer and often did not provide specific dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Next, Palacio did not produce sufficient corroborating evidence to meet his burden of proof for his withholding of removal claim. Palacio asserts the BIA erred by affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal without considering the documentary evidence. Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision, and Palacio does not assert the IJ failed to consider the documents he submitted in support of his application. In fact, the IJ found the documentary evidence did not support Palacio\u2019s claim he was persecuted because of his CAB work as Palacio presented no verification of his membership or work with that group and did not provide a satisfactory explanation for his failure to submit such documentation. The only other relevant evidence submitted by Palacio was the police documents related to his and his father\u2019s complaints, and evidence verifying his membership in the United Liberal Movement (ULM). The IJ discounted the police documents for the reasons discussed above and did not express any doubt as to the ULM membership. This documentary evidence, however, was insufficient to meet his burden of showing it was more likely than not he would be persecuted if he returned to Colombia. Further, Palacio\u2019s explanation that he did not obtain evidence of his CAB membership because the man who was president at that time had since died did not compel a reasonable trier of fact to conclude corroborating evidence was unavailable. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4). Thus, the IJ did not err by requiring Palacio to produce additional corroborating evidence in order to sustain his burden of proof for his withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">We do not have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s finding that Palacio failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimeliness of his asylum application, and we dismiss the petition as to asylum. Additionally, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Palacio is not entitled to withholding of removal and we deny the petition as to withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-9\">. Palacio is the primary applicant. His wife, Maria Edith Bej ara\u00f1o, is a derivative applicant and relies on Palacio's asylum application. Accordingly, we will refer to Palacio and his claims for relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b944-14\">. Because Palacio\u2019s brief challenges only the denial of asylum and withholding of removal, he has abandoned his claim for CAT relief. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b945-8\">. To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must establish, with specific and credible evidence, (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \"well-founded fear\u201d the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230-31.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
