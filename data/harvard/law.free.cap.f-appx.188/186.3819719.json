Alston was sentenced to life imprisonment, and he timely appealed. The sole issue Alston asserts on appeal is a challenge to the manner in which the jury was selected. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">Alston, who is African-American, contends the Government exercised its peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). During jury selection, the Government exercised two of its six peremptory strikes against African-American venire persons. Alston raised a <em>Batson </em>challenge, and the district court required the Government to offer a race-neutral explanation for the strikes. The Government explained that it had stricken these two individuals because they were \u201cvery young\u201d and noted that it had exercised strikes against other non-African-American venire persons because of their young age. Additionally, the Government pointed out that it had not exercised strikes against older African-American venire persons. The district court determined that the Government\u2019s reason was not pretextual as it was \u201cborne out\u201d by other strikes the Government had exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">Generally, a <em>Batson </em>challenge consists of three steps: (1) the defendant makes out a prima facie case of discrimination; (2) the Government offers a race-neutral explanation; and (3) the trial court decides whether the defendant has carried his burden and proved purposeful discrimination. <em>Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 767-68, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995). \u201cOnce a prosecutor has offered a race-neutral explanation for the peremptory challenges and the trial court has ruled on the ultimate question of intentional discrimination, the preliminary issue of whether the defendant had made a prima facie showing becomes moot.\u201d <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 359, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991). Because that is the posture of this appeal, we begin our analysis with the second step in the <em>Batson </em>inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">The second step requires the Government to proffer a race-neutral explanation for its strikes. The proffered reason \u201cneed not be worthy of belief or related to the issues to be tried or to the prospective juror\u2019s ability to provide acceptable jury service.\u201d <em>Jones v. Plaster, </em>57 F.3d 417, 420 (4th Cir.1995). All that is required is that the reason be race-neutral. <em>See Purkett, </em>514 U.S. at 768, 115 S.Ct. 1769. The Government\u2019s proffered explanation clearly satisfies this step.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>For the third step in the inquiry, we review for clear error the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant failed to carry his burden to prove purposeful discrimination. <em>Jones, </em>57 F.3d at 421. Great deference is given the trial court\u2019s finding as resolution of the issue rests largely on credibility determinations. <em>Id. </em>Because age is an acceptable race-neutral explanation, <em>see United States v. Grimmond, </em>137 F.3d 823, 834 (4th Cir.1998), and Alston has failed to establish that the Government\u2019s explanation was pretextual, we conclude the district court did not clearly err in denying Alston\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Alston\u2019s convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
