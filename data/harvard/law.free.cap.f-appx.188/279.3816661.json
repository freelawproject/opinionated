That Order was issued after the court conducted a hearing on Wilcher\u2019s <em>pro se </em>filing styled \u201cMotion To Drop All Remaining Appeals And To Allow The State To Immediately Proceed With Petitioner\u2019s Execution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">At the hearing, Wilcher explained that he had not terminated Counsel\u2019s representation because he (Wilcher) understood that doing so would prolong the appellate proceedings that he desired to end. Counsel for Wilcher is before us to appeal the district court\u2019s finding that Wilcher is mentally competent to voluntarily dismiss his habeas petition and submit to being executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-16\">While this application was pending before us, counsel for Wilcher filed a pleading\u2014after hours on Friday, July 7, 2006\u2014 styled Petitioner\u2019s Motion To Reinstate Appeals and Stay Execution, and accompanied by Wilcher\u2019s bare-bones affidavit signed and notarized the same day. This latest filing begins \u201cPetitioner-Appellant Bobby Wilcher hereby withdraws his <em>pro se </em>motion to terminate all appeals .... \u201d Yet, Counsel has filed no motion for Wilcher in this court for authority to \u201cwithdraw\u201d Wilcher\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion that was filed in and granted by the district court, and has cited no authority for this court to allow withdrawal of the motion (or vacatur of the Order granting it, which is before us on application for COA filed against Petitioner\u2019s earlier-stated wishes). This sudden about-face strikes us as nothing more than an Eleventh-hour death row plea for mercy finally elicited from Wilcher by Counsel; the accompanying affidavit states only a conclusional flip-flop by Wilcher, who had cogently and voluntarily testified at length in the district court hearing only weeks earlier that enough was enough, and that he wished to abandon all appeals and submit to execution forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-17\">Having carefully reviewed counsel\u2019s application and supporting documents, the State\u2019s response, the transcript of the hearing in the district court, and the district court\u2019s Order, we conclude that the district court committed no error, and that reasonable jurists would not disagree with the propriety of that court\u2019s Order. We therefore deny the application for COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The long-established legal standard concerning the competency of a death row inmate to abandon further appeals of his sentence is \u201cwhether he has capacity to appreciate his position and make a rational choice with respect to continuing or abandoning further litigation or on the other hand whether he is suffering from a mental disease, disorder, or defect which may substantially affect his capacity in the premises.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have held that \u201ca habeas court must conduct an inquiry into the defendant\u2019s mental capacity ... if the evidence raises a bona fide doubt as to his competency,\u201d noting that \u201cthe extent and severity of the petitioner\u2019s history of mental health problems which have been brought to the court\u2019s attention influence the breadth and depth of the competency inquiry required.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The district court entered its finding of Wilcher\u2019s mental competency under the <em>Rees </em>standard after extensively questioning him in person in open court, observing his demeanor, and reviewing past mental examinations. We are satisfied that the inquiry conducted by the district court was constitutionally sufficient, as the evidence presented to the court did not raise a bona fide doubt as to Wilcher\u2019s competency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There was not, for example, evidence of a long history of uncontrolled mental health problems,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Wilcher was physically present at the hearing and was personally examined in depth by the district court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">That able and persuasive Counsel was finally successful in convincing Wilcher to do an about-face scant days before his requested execution is not surprising\u2014 but is without authority under applicable law and is to no avail.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">We therefore DENY Petitioner\u2019s motions for stay of execution, DISMISS his request to reinstate his appeals, and DENY his application for COA to appeal the district court\u2019s Order dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

Although Wilcher has been prescribed Tegretol as treatment for bipolar disorder, the district court implicitly found that his condition is stabilized and under control.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b305-17\">. In <em>Mata, </em>we reversed the district court\u2019s order dismissing the petition for habeas corpus because the evidence presented to the court included thirty years of documented mental health problems, repeated suicide attempts, numerous hunger strikes, and the district court neither ordered an expert psychological examination nor conducted its own examination. 210 F.3d at 331.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b305-18\">. We note that Counsel did not present Wilcher\u2019s change of heart as, for example, a successive application for a writ of habeas corpus; but even that would fail to meet the applicable standard. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) (claim that was not previously presented shall be dismissed unless it relies on a new rule of constitutional law or is predicated on newly-discovered facts demonstrating actual innocence).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
