Webb, Jr., under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1000-1461. We think the district court erred in applying the statute, and, therefore, we REVERSE.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">In late 2002, Edward J. Webb, Jr., was diagnosed with advanced multiple myeloma, a hematologic cancer of the plasma cells. At the time, Webb was an attorney with Hunter, Smith, and Davis, LLP, and was a beneficiary under the law firm\u2019s group health insurance policy, which was issued by Cariten Insurance Company. During the time in question, there were two Benefit Plans in effect, one entered into on October 1, 2002, and a second one entered into on October 1, 2008. It is conceded that administration of the plans was governed by ERISA. Hunter, Smith, and Davis, LLP, was listed as the \u201cPlan Sponsor\u201d in the October 1, 2002, Plan and as the \u201cPlan Sponsor and Administrator\u201d in the October 1, 2003, Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-15\">Webb was initially treated by Dr. Alan Forbush, an internist designated by Cariten. Dr. Forbush referred Webb to a Cariten-approved oncologist, Dr. Koyamangalath Krishnan, who recommended that Webb be treated at the Arkansas Cancer Research Center (ACRC) at the University of Arkansas. ACRC, however, was not a designated service provider in Cariten\u2019s \u201cnetwork\u201d of providers. Cariten determined that the services Webb needed for treatment of his illness were available at the Thompson Cancer Survival Center (TCSC) in Knoxville, Tennessee, a Caritenparticipating or \u201cin-network\u201d provider facility. Consequently, Cariten advised Webb in January 2003, that it would not pay in-network rates for treatment at ACRC. A request for Cariten to reconsider this decision, which included a letter from Dr. Krishnan describing ACRC as Webb\u2019s \u201cbest chance,\u201d was denied. Despite Cariten\u2019s refusal to pay for Webb\u2019s treatment at ACRC at in-network rates, Webb decided that he would go to ACRC for part of his treatment anyway. Cariten agreed to pay for Webb\u2019s treatment at ACRC at the substantially lower \u201cout-of-network\u201d rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-16\">A number of parties contacted Cariten over the following months attempting to persuade the company to enter into negotiations with ACRC for the cost of Webb\u2019s treatment. Several individuals, purporting to act on Webb\u2019s behalf, requested information from Cariten regarding the compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>ny\u2019s fee schedules. Cariten, however, did not provide such information and did not enter into negotiations with ACRC. In December 2003, the company received a letter from Anthony Seaton, an attorney for Webb, threatening legal action to obtain the requested fee schedule information and other relief. Cariten offered to release the information providing Webb first fill out a form recognizing Seaton as his representative and a form authorizing the release. Webb completed the forms and sent them to Cariten, whose counsel then sent a letter to Seaton detailing the \u201cfee schedule rates.\u201d Cariten continued its refusal to pay for Webb\u2019s ACRC treatment at in-network rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">On February 27, 2004, Webb filed an ERISA lawsuit against Cariten in federal district court. He sought \u201cto recover benefits due to him under ... [his employer\u2019s health benefit] plan,\u201d according to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). He also requested statutory penalties on the theory that Cariten had violated 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(c) when it refused for several months to provide requested fee schedule information. At a hearing on Cariten\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, the district court found that there was no evidence that Webb was unable to receive the treatment he needed at TCSC, only that ACRC was better and even a \u201cpremier\u201d facility. On this basis, the district court concluded that Cariten\u2019s decision not to pay for Webb\u2019s treatment at ACRC at in-network rates was not \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d in terms of the Benefit Plan. The court then observed that had Cariten been open to the idea, it was likely that ACRC would have taken Webb as a patient and charged Cariten the same amount of money that TCSC would have charged, that is, in-network rates. The court then held that Cariten\u2019s refusal to <em>enter into negotiations </em>with ACRC was \u201cunreasonable and even inhumane.\u201d Warming to the subject, the court, as though pressing the parties to settle their dispute, ordered Cariten to begin negotiations with ACRC immediately and to pay ACRC the lesser of its charges for Webb\u2019s treatment and the amount Cariten would have paid TCSC for the same treatments. The court then referred the case to a magistrate judge with instructions to recommend appropriate sanctions and attorney fees against Cariten. On the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, the district court assessed a $12,550 statutory penalty against Cariten for a violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(c)(1)\u2014failure of a plan administrator to respond to a request for information\u2014and $54,000 in attorney fees under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g). The district court incorporated all the foregoing into a judgment which Cariten has appealed. The company challenges the district court\u2019s order requiring the insurer \u201cnegotiate\u201d with ACRC and pay for Webb\u2019s treatment according to the district court\u2019s formula. It claims that such \u201crelief\u2019 is not authorized by Webb\u2019s ERISA-governed health plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">When interpreting ERISA plans, \u201cfederal courts apply \u2018general rules\u2019 of contract law as part of the federal common law.\u201d <em>Cassidy v. Akzo Nobel Salt, Inc., </em>308 F.3d 613, 615 (6th Cir.2002). These general rules of contract law dictate that a court should \u201cgive[] effect to the unambiguous terms of the contract.\u201d <em>Univ. Hosps. of Clev. v. South Lorain Merchants Ass\u2019n, </em>441 F.3d 430, 437 (6th Cir.2006). The October 1, 2002, ERISA Plan, which was in effect when Cariten made its January 2003 benefit determination on Webb\u2019s claim, gave the insurer no discretionary authority to grant or deny benefits. Accordingly, we review Cariten\u2019s determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>tion <em>de novo. Evans v. Unumprovident Corp., </em>434 F.3d 866, 875-76 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Cariten argues that the district court\u2019s decision ordering Cariten to negotiate with ACRC and fixing the formula for payment of ACRC\u2019s charges granted Webb relief not authorized under the Benefit Plan because \u201c[t]he Plan nowhere requires Cariten to pay in-Network benefits for Out-of-Network treatment,\u201d nor does it require Cariten to negotiate with out-of-network facilities. Before fashioning its equitable remedy, the district court correctly held that there is no contractual obligation under the Plan requiring Cariten to pay ACRC at in-network rates. And we hold that there is nothing in the Plan requiring Cariten to negotiate with ACRC. In fact, the Plan clearly defines \u201cparticipating\u201d and \u201cnon-participating\u201d providers and spells out \u201cin-network\u201d and \u201cout-of-network\u201d benefits. We note that there is no evidence in the record that TCSC was unable to provide the treatment Webb needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Webb nonetheless argues that it was \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d for Cariten to deny benefit payments to ACRC at in-network rates. He claims he had little choice but to go to ACRC for the best available treatment because he was faced with \u201clife or death.\u201d While Webb\u2019s decision to seek treatment immediately at what he believed to be the \u201cpremier\u201d cancer treatment facility is understandable, it did not obligate Cariten, either under the law of contracts or ERISA, to pay for Webb\u2019s treatment at rates not agreed to by Cariten in the insurance contract, especially when the same treatment was offered by a participating provider at rates Cariten was obligated to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The district court\u2019s order directing Cariten to enter into negotiations with ACRC and to pay ACRC amounts in excess of what the Benefit Plan required, was not authorized by the ERISA plan and was beyond the court\u2019s authority. The judgment must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Further, Cariten\u2019s failure to respond to requests for information should not have resulted in an award of statutory penalties under ERISA. District courts have discretion under ERISA to award limited statutory penalties against a plan \u201cadministrator,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(c)(1), but not others. <em>See Caffey v. UNUM Life Ins. Co., </em>302 F.3d 576, 584-85 (6th Cir.2002). ERISA further provides that the plan administrator is the one \u201cspecifically so designated by the terms of the instrument under which the Plan is operated\u201d or, if no \u201cadministrator is ... so designated,\u201d the administrator is the \u201cplan sponsor.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(16)(A)(i)-(ii). The October 1, 2003, Benefit Plan identifies Hunter, Smith, and Davis, LLP, Webb\u2019s employer, as the \u201cPlan Sponsor and Administrator.\u201d The October 1, 2002, Benefit Plan is silent as to the identity of the plan administrator, but identifies Hunter, Smith, and Davis, LLP, as the \u201cPlan Sponsor.\u201d Under both plans, then, the law firm, not Cariten, was the plan administrator. <em>See Caffey, </em>302 F.3d at 585. Webb\u2019s argument and the district court\u2019s conclusion that Cariten should be \u201cconsidered\u201d the plan administrator because Cariten had access to the relevant information is mistaken. ERISA does not recognize a putative plan administrator especially when a statutory administrator has been named in the plan document and statutory penalties may be awarded, if at all, only against the \u201creal\u201d plan administrator. Cariten was not the \u201cadministrator\u201d of the Benefit Plan and, as we have held before, \u201can insurance company, which is not a plan administrator, cannot be liable for statutory damages for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>failure to comply with an information request.\u201d Caf<em>fey, </em>302 F.3d at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Lastly, we note that the district court\u2019s award of attorney fees was an abuse of discretion. Historically, we have reviewed attorney fees awarded under ERISA according to the multi-factor test laid out in <em>Maurer v. Joy Technologies, Inc., </em>212 F.3d 907, 919 (6th Cir.2000), but we have also held that it is always \u2018\u201can abuse of discretion for the district court to award attorney\u2019s fees to a losing party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cattin v. General Motors Corp., </em>955 F.2d 416, 427 (6th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>Bittner v. Sadoff &amp; Rudoy Indus., </em>728 F.2d 820, 829 (7th Cir.1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">For the above reasons, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s judgment awarding <em>relief </em>to Webb, as well as the decision ordering Cariten to pay statutory penalties and attorney fees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
