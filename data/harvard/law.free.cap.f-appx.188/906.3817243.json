No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Barker first argues that the district erred in denying him a minor role reduction, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He asserts that he was less culpable than the other persons found on the \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat, which was carrying 1,759 kilograms of cocaine, because he only operated the boat\u2019s engines, did not take custody of the cocaine on the boat, had no ownership interest in the smuggled drugs, and did not plan the drug smuggling operation. Barker also contends that the small fee he received for his participation\u2014$1,300\u2014indicates that he played a minor role in the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s determinations about a defendant\u2019s role in an offense. <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>289 F.3d 1339, 1348 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cThe defendant has the burden of establishing his role by a preponderance of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 8B1.2(b), \u201c[a] defendant warrants a two-level reduction for playing a minor role in an offense if he is less culpable than most other participants, although his role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Sentencing courts should consider two elements when determining a defendant\u2019s role in an offense: \u201cfirst, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 940 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"Avq-\">The district court committed no clear error in determining that Barker\u2019s role in the offense was more than minor. About the first element, Barker\u2019s sentence was based only on the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable at sentencing: the 1,759 kilograms of cocaine seized from the \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat. Barker admitted that he operated the boat\u2019s engines and that he was paid $1,300 for his work. And the district court correctly pointed to the large drug quantity in denying Barker a minor role reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 943 (noting that, in the drug courier context, the amount of drugs is a \u201cmaterial consideration\u201d in assessing defendant\u2019s role in his relevant conduct). About the second element, Barker was one of only five crew members on the \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat, which was carrying a large amount of cocaine. Barker has not established that he was less culpable than the other crew members. We see no clear error in the district court\u2019s refusal to apply a minor role reduction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">Barker next argues that his sentence was unreasonable under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He contends that, in determining his sentence, the district court should have considered the small role he played in the offense, his lack of prior criminal history, and other personal circumstances, including his limited education, the extent to which he financially supported his immediate family, and his wife\u2019s poor health.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Barker was sentenced after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker, </em>and we review Barker\u2019s sentence for reasonableness in the light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-46 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">We conclude that Barker\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court correctly calculated Barker\u2019s Guideline imprisonment range as 135-168 months; and the court sentenced Barker to the lowest point of his Guideline range. In sentencing Barker, the district court noted the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, commenting in particular on the quantity of drugs involved. Nothing in the record convinces us that Barker\u2019s sentence was unreasonable in the light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-8\">. On appeal Barker also argues for the first time that he was entitled to a minimal role reduction under \u00a7 3B 1.2(a). Because we conclude that the district court did not err in refusing to apply a minor role reduction, we reject Barker\u2019s argument about receiving no minimal role reduction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b931-14\">. Barker does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of his Guideline range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b932-17\">. The government asserts that we lack jurisdiction to review a sentence, such as Barker\u2019s, which is within a correctly calculated Guideline range. We previously have rejected the government\u2019s position; and we have jurisdiction to consider Barker's claim about the reasonableness of his sentence. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1321-22 (11th Cir.2006)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
