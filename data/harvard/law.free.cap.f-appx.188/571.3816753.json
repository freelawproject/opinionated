Hughes appeals his sentence, imposed following his guilty plea to three counts of securities fraud and one count of criminal contempt. The sentencing preceded the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The sentence was thus imposed at a time when the district court understandably believed the Sentencing Guidelines to be mandatory. <em>Booker </em>held otherwise, though. <em>See United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). Since the sentence was based upon facts found by the judge rather than by a jury, and since the original sentencing judge is no longer available, due to Judge Manella\u2019s resignation from the district court, the sentence must be vacated and the case remanded for a full resentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Sanders, </em>421 F.3d 1044, 1052 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b596-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
