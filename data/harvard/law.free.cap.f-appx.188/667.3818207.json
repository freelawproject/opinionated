We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Saville worked for International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) as a senior customer <em>engineer. He </em>was \u201cprimarily responsible for the post sale maintenance of IBM equipment in customer accounts,\u201d which required that he provide \u201ctechnical assistance and advice to less experienced personnel\u201d and \u201cdevelop[ ] positive relationships with customer management and staff.\u201d Aplt.App. at 275. \u201cSaville was not a perfect employee,\u201d however, as he had problems mentoring and communicating with his peers. Aplt. Br. at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">In 1997, Vickie Fullmer became Saville\u2019s supervisor. Toward the end of the year, Saville began voicing his concerns that IBM\u2019s \u201ccrackdown on overtime was leading his peers to work overtime without recording it and without being paid for it,\u201d creating a morale problem. <em>Id. </em>at 11; <em>see also </em>Aplt.App. at 75A. In July 1998, Fullmer met with Saville <em>for </em>an interim performance evaluation after some of Saville\u2019s peers complained that he was difficult to work with and a customer complained of disparaging treatment. Aplt.App. at 142-43, 205. During the meeting, Fullmer revealed some of the complaints and accused Saville of having a \u201cbad attitude.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88-89. Afterward, Saville submitted a \u201cSpeak Up\u201d e-mail to IBM\u2019s human resources department, accusing Fullmer of \u201cdropping my performance\u201d rating because Saville\u2019s group had criticized her leadership in a survey. Aplee. SuppApp. at 192; <em>see also </em>Aplt. Br. at 13. In the email, Saville admitted, \u201cI think I do have an attitude problem as a result of some of my manager\u2019s action and lack of action .... \u201d Aplee. Supp.App. at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">In September 1998, Saville met with Fullmer\u2019s supervisor, Brian Myers, and told him that some customer engineers were \u201cgrumbling about working overtime and not recording it and getting paid for it because of how it\u2019s being micro-managed.\u201d ApltApp. at 106. Saville further complained that Fullmer\u2019s leadership negatively affected morale. Following an investigation, Myers told Saville that \u201chis attitude, leadership, mentoring and support for Ms. Fullmer were unacceptable and that his attitude problem was causing customer complaints.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>149. Saville was given the option of being placed on a performance improvement plan or retiring from IBM with a severance package.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>During an October 5, 1998 meeting, Fullmer told Saville that the improvement plan would be thirty days long, <em>id. </em>at 121, that it would gage performance, leadership, peer support, management support, teamwork and customer satisfaction, <em>id. </em>at 128, and that if she received one complaint he would fail the plan and be fired, <em>id. </em>at 121. Saville was given thirty days to decide which option to choose. <em>Id. </em>at 123. On October 30, 1998, Saville notified IBM that he chose retirement, effective the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In August 2000, Saville sued IBM under the FLSA, alleging that he was constructively discharged for \u201cvoicing] his concerns regarding IBM\u2019s practices in recording and paying overtime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. The district court granted IBM summary judgment, ruling, among other things, that Saville suffered no adverse employment action. Saville appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">I. Summary Judgment Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). An issue is not \u201cgenuine,\u201d and summary judgment will be warranted, if no reasonable jury viewing the evidence could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). We review \u201ca grant of summary judgment de novo with an examination of the record and all reasonable inferences that might be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Palladium Music, Inc. v. EatSleepMusic, Inc., </em>398 F.3d 1193, 1196 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">II. The FLSA</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">Among other things, the FLSA prohibits employers from \u201cdischarging] or in any other manner discriminating] against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint ... under or related to [the FLSA].\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a)(3). This \u201csection protects conduct based on a good faith, although unproven, belief that the employer\u2019s conduct is illegal,\u201d and \u201capplies to the unofficial assertion of rights through complaints at work.\u201d <em>Love v. RE/MAX of Am., Inc., </em>738 F.2d 383, 387 (10th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">We analyze FLSA-retaliation claims under the burden-shifting framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Pacheco v. Whiting Farms, Inc., </em>365 F.3d 1199, 1206 (10th Cir.2004). Under that framework, the employee must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation. <em>Id. </em>If the employee succeeds, the employer must offer a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse employment action. <em>Id. </em>Then, \u201cthe burden shifts back to the employee to show [that] genuine issues of material fact exist regarding whether the employer\u2019s proffered reason is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1207. We conclude that Saville\u2019s retaliation case fails at the framework\u2019s initial stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">An employee cannot establish a prima facie case of retaliation without an adverse employment action. <em>See id. </em>at 1206. Saville\u2019s retirement from IBM would qualify as an adverse action only if IBM deliberately made or allowed Saville\u2019s working conditions to become so intolerable that he had no other choice but to retire. <em>See MacKenzie v. City &amp; County of Denver, </em>414 F.3d 1266, 1281 (10th Cir.2005). In other words, Saville\u2019s retire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>ment would have to amount to a constructive discharge, and would depend upon whether a reasonable person would view the conditions at IBM as intolerable, not upon Saville\u2019s subjective view of those conditions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Saville argues that a triable issue of fact exists as to whether a reasonable person would have chosen retirement over the performance improvement plan, because (1) he had received a negative interim evaluation; (2) his complaints against Fullmer were not seriously considered, and instead, he was accused of being the problem; (3) Myers told him, during their September 1998 meeting, \u201cI want you out\u201d of IBM, Aplt.App. at 118 (quotation omitted);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (4) Myers said the duration of the improvement plan would be ninety days, but Fullmer shortened it to thirty days, \u201cdid not put anything on paper,\u201d and said one complaint would result in termination, Aplt. Br. at 39.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with the district court that no reasonable jury could find these conditions so intolerable as to render Saville\u2019s retirement involuntary. The inquiry is not whether the conditions at IBM were \u201cdifficult or unpleasant,\u201d but whether, at the time of Saville\u2019s retirement, IBM did not allow him \u201cthe opportunity to make a free choice regarding his employment relationship.\u201d <em>Exum v. U.S. Olympic Comm., </em>389 F.3d 1130, 1135 (10th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). Other courts have held \u201cthat criticism in performance reviews and institution of performance improvement plans, alone, do not constitute objectively intolerable conditions.\u201d <em>Agnew v. BASF Corp., </em>286 F.3d 307, 310 (6th Cir.2002); <em>accord Givens v. Cingular Wireless, </em>396 F.3d 998, 998 (8th Cir.2005). We agree. <em>Cf. Lybrook v. Members of Farmington Mun. Schs. Bd. of Educ., </em>232 F.3d 1334, 1339 (10th Cir.2000) (placing employee on a professional development plan and requiring employee to meet weekly with her superior was not an adverse employment action in her First Amendment retaliation case). Furthermore, we have previously indicated that an employer\u2019s offer of an alternative to quitting is not consistent with constructive discharge. <em>See, e.g., Exum, </em>389 F.3d at 1136. Saville could have remained at IBM and undertaken the performance improvement plan. Indeed, Saville testified at deposition that he had placed at least six subordinates on ninety-day improvement plans and they all succeeded, although some \u201cfell off\u2019 afterward. ApltApp. at 127.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Final<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>ly, Saville was given thirty days in which to consider remaining with IBM and was verbally notified of the criteria under which he would be judged if he elected to remain. The totality of the circumstances indicates, as a matter of law, that Saville\u2019s retirement was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b692-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would <em>not </em>materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-5\">. Saville ignores the full extent of Myers' remarks. At his deposition, <em>Saville </em>testified that Myers said, \" 1 want you to leave IBM. Well, you can accept the [performance improvement plan].\u2019 \u201d Aplt.App. at 118. In any event, an employer\u2019s subjective intentions regarding the employee have no bearing on whether there was a constructive discharge. <em>Baca v. Sklar, </em>398 F.3d 1210, 1216 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-6\">. Saville also states that Fullmer and Myers \"transformed [a] customer\u2019s failure [to perform its obligations] into a customer complaint against Mr. Saville.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 38. But Saville fails to cite any part of the record showing such a transformation. Indeed, the customer submitted an affidavit testifying that it had asked IBM to remove Saville from a project because he \"was obnoxious and acted inappropriately\u201d and \u201cwas not treating us properly and with respect.\u201d Aplt.App. at 205.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b694-10\">. We are not persuaded by Saville\u2019s summary contention that a thirty-day plan is somehow more onerous than a ninety-day plan. Nor do we attribute any weight to Saville\u2019s assertion that, if he had chosen the improvement plan, he would have remained subject to termination \"a year or more after the successful completion of the plan\u201d if he violated any of the plan\u2019s criteria, Aplt. Br. at 35. Mere speculation is insufficient to withstand summary judgment. <em>Setliff v. Mem\u2019l Hosp. of Sheridan County, </em>850 F.2d 1384, 1393 (10th Cir.1988); <em>see also Agnew, </em>286 F.3d at 310 (\u201cAn employee who quits a job in apprehension that <em>conditions may </em>deteriorate later is not constructively discharged. Instead, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>employee is obliged not to assume the worst, and not to jump to conclusions too fast.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
