Morales argues that the district court erred in allowing the Government to supplement the record on remand with certified copies of documents proving that his prior conviction for burglary of a habitation was a crime of violence that warranted the 16-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). He also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-22\">At Morales\u2019s sentencing, defense counsel challenged the lack of evidence presented by the Government to establish that his conviction for a burglary of a habitation constituted a \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) crime of violence. At the re-sentencing, defense counsel challenged the Government\u2019s failure to admit into evidence, at the original sentencing hearing, the documents necessary to establish the fact of Morales\u2019s prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-23\">Morales does not challenge the accuracy of the documents provided to defense counsel at the original sentencing, nor does he argue that his burglary conviction does not warrant the \u00a7 2 L1.2(b) (1) (A) (ii) increase. The Government\u2019s failure to formally introduce certified copies of the indictment and commitment order was not reversible error. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>367 F.3d 274, 276-77 (5th Cir.2004). The district court did not err by allowing the Government to respond to defense counsel\u2019s objection at the re-sentencing by admitting evidence in support of its position. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-24\">Morales\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Morales contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S., 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Morales properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Because Morales has shown no error in the judgment of the district court, that judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
