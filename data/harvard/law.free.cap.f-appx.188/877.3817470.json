He alleged that the defendants, acting under color of law at the Bullock County Jail, used excessive force upon him by exposing him to large concentrations of tear gas and pepper gas while he was confined in his cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-24\">At trial, Lee requested the court to instruct the jury that they could find the defendants liable if they \u201cintentionally committed or were deliberately indifferent to acts that violated the Plaintiffs constitutional right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d The court, however, gave the Eleventh Circuit pattern instruction that instructed the jury that they could find for the plaintiff only if the defendants acted \u201cmaliciously and sadistically to cause harm\u201d to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury found for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-25\">The sole issue on appeal is whether this instruction was correct. Lee argues that the \u201cheightened requirement of \u2018sadistic and malicious intent\u2019 applies only to exigent circumstances where deadly force is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>necessary to control a violent situation.\u201d We review the jury instruction given for an abuse of discretion. <em>Johnson v. Breeden, </em>280 F.3d 1308 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Lee argues that the jury was incorrectly instructed that they must find that the officers acted maliciously and with sadistic intent in order for him to prevail. He argues that the Supreme Court in <em>Whitley </em>limited this \u201cheightened intent requirement\u201d for excessive force claims to cases involving exigent circumstances, such as a prison riot. <em>See Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">This is not the law. In <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 6, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992), the Supreme Court held that <em>all </em>claims of excessive force, regardless of exigency, are to be judged by \u201cwhether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\u201d We specifically noted in <em>Campbell v. Sikes, </em>169 F.3d 1353, 1374-75 (11th Cir.1999), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZX1\">[I]n <em>Hudson, </em>the Supreme Court extended <em>Whitley\u2019s </em>holding outside the prison-riot context and applied the same heightened intent requirement to force used as a prophylactic, preventive measure. The <em>Hudson </em>Court held that \u201cwhenever prison officials stand accused of using excessive physical force in violation of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, the core judicial inquiry is that set out in <em>Whitley: </em>whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">169 F.3d at 1374 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Since this is exactly what the district court instructed the jury that they must find, Lee\u2019s allegation of error in this regard is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-17\">. Lee sought to graft his proposed language onto the pattern jury instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
