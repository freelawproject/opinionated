He was also ordered to pay restitution of $4,720.00 and a special assessment of $100.00. Brooks filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed lawyer has filed a motion to withdraw and a supporting brief representing that he cannot discern a non-frivolous issue to argue on appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In particular, counsel states that the district court \u201cmade no error\u201d at sentencing with respect to factfinding or the application of the advisory sentencing guidelines. Brooks has filed a response. <em>See </em>Cir. R. 51(b). Although counsel\u2019s assessment of the sentencing proceeding is not wholly accurate, he is correct that an appeal would be frivolous, and we will therefore grant the motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">In calculating Brooks\u2019s imprisonment range, the district court began with a base offense level of 20, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(a), and added two offense levels for taking property from a \u201cfinancial institution,\u201d <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(l), and another level because the amount stolen exceeded $10,000, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7). Over Brooks\u2019s objection, the district court then added two levels because Brooks\u2019s cohort, Marvin Landfair, threatened to kill anyone who moved during the robbery, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F), and two more for obstruction of justice and perjury, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 &amp; cmt. n. 4(b), because Brooks had lied to investigators and the court about Landfair\u2019s participation in the crime. Finally, the district court granted Brooks a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. The court\u2019s calculations resulted in a total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>offense level of 24. However, the court went on to find that Brooks is a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. His original base offense level was therefore supplanted; it instead became 32. After the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, the total offense level of 29 and the required criminal history category of VI yielded a guidelines imprisonment range of 151 to 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Brooks had objected to a number of the Chapter Two adjustments for specific offense characteristics that were recommended in the presentence investigation report. He renews those objections in his Rule 5103) submission. An appeal based upon the application of any of these adjustments would be frivolous, however, because the district court\u2019s conclusion that Brooks is a career offender rendered the Chapter Two adjustments irrelevant. Section 4B1.1 prescribed his offense level without regard for any specific offense characteristics. Nevertheless, counsel passed over the district court\u2019s calculations too casually. We have identified an error that would have justified denying counsel\u2019s motion were it not for the operation of the career-offender guideline, and we find it worthwhile to explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Brooks objected to the probation officer\u2019s recommendation that he receive a two\u2014level increase because the bank robbery involved an express threat of death. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F). He opposed the adjustment because he insisted that he never knew Mayfair threatened anyone, but at the sentencing hearing the district court stated that the adjustment nonetheless applied because \u201cthe fact that the defendant didn\u2019t hear a threat that was made is no excuse.\u201d And in its written resolution of Brooks\u2019s objections, the court elaborated, correctly, that Brooks was responsible for Landfair\u2019s death threat if it was a reasonably foreseeable act committed in furtherance of their jointly undertaken criminal activity. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). But rather than evaluate whether Brooks reasonably could have anticipated Mayfair\u2019s threat, the district reasoned simply that a death threat \u201cfalls into the category of reasonably foreseeable conduct\u201d during a bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">In a similar case, we held that a sentencing court committed clear error in failing to identify facts from the <em>particular </em>case to support its decision that a codefendant\u2019s use of a gun during a bank robbery was reasonably foreseeable to the driver of the getaway car. <em>See United States v. Atwater, </em>272 F.3d 511, 512 (7th Cir.2001). We faulted the district court for considering it \u201ca given\u201d that a gun would be used instead of applying a more discriminating analysis to the particular facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 512-13. Although the nature of the offense is relevant, we could not uphold application of the adjustment in <em>Atwater </em>because the court lacked evidence concerning \u201chow frequently guns are used in bank robberies\u201d and \u201cgreatly exaggerated that frequency and having done so neglected the particulars of the case.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 513-14. Likewise in Brooks\u2019s case the district court relied solely on the nature of bank robberies in general to conclude that a death threat was reasonably foreseeable. Therefore, Brooks could have argued that the district court erred in its application of \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">As we have noted already, however, the argument would have been unavailing in this case because none of the Chapter Two adjustments had any bearing on Brooks\u2019s sentence because he is a career offender. Counsel has identified no potential argument with respect to that determination, pointing out that Brooks did not contest any of the predicate offenses in the district court. Brooks proposes arguing that \u00a7 4B.1.1 was erroneously applied because the facts underlying his prior convictions were not presented to a jury, but we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>have repeatedly rejected this contention. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>417 F.3d 780, 788 (7th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Blake, </em>415 F.3d 625, 629 (7th Cir.2005). The sentence is therefore presumed reasonable because it falls -within a properly calculated range, <em>see United States v. Mykytiuk, </em>415 F.3d 606, 608 (7th Cir.2005), and neither counsel nor Brooks raises any plausible basis on which the presumption might be rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Finally, Brooks seeks to raise a claim that his trial counsel was ineffective, but such claims are best raised in motions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is Granted, and the appeal is Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
