Rios argues that the district court violated his due process rights when it upwardly departed without stating on the record that aggravating or mitigating circumstances were present that had not been considered by the Sentencing Commission when it formulated the Guidelines. Rios argues, alternatively, that if <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applies, the upward departure was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Rios fails to meet his burden of showing that the district court\u2019s post <em>Booker, </em>non-guidelines sentence, which was an upward deviation from the guidelines range of imprisonment, was error, plain or otherwise. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 434-36 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707-10 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
