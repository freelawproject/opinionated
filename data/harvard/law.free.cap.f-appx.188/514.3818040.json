PITTMAN, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b538-12\">No. 03-1812.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b538-13\">United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b538-14\">Submitted June 30, 2006.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b538-15\">Decided July 24, 2006.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-17\">Stephen B.

ILANA DIAMOND ROVNER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b538-20\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-21\">This case is on appeal from a limited remand from our court pursuant to <em>United States v. Paladino, </em>401 F.3d 471, 483-84 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>(7th Cir.2005). The district court has now determined that it would impose the same sentence if we were to vacate the judgment and remand for re-sentencing even in light of the advisory nature of the Guidelines. We must therefore determine whether the sentence is reasonable. If it is, then any Sixth Amendment violation in the sentencing process did not affect Pittman\u2019s substantial rights and thus did not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The parties have had the opportunity to file arguments concerning the appropriate disposition of the appeal in light of the district court\u2019s decision but no objections have been raised to the district court\u2019s determination. Pittman\u2019s sentence is within the Guideline range, and therefore we must presume that the sentence is reasonable. <em>United States v. Mykytiuk, </em>415 F.3d 606, 608 (7th Cir.2005). A defendant may rebut that presumption by demonstrating that his sentence is unreasonable in light of the factors identified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The district court\u2019s order reveals that the court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and that it properly applied those factors in determining that it would give the same sentence. There are no apparent errors in the court\u2019s consideration of those factors, nor does Pittman raise any argument to this court that the sentence is unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
