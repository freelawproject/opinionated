Medtronic AVE, Inc., </em>194 F.Supp.2d 323 (D.Del.2002). In the underlying litigation, appellant Cordis Corporation sued several defendants, alleging infringement of several of Cordis\u2019s patents. The only portion of that case that is relevant to the present appeal is Cordis\u2019s claim that Boston Scientific Corporation infringed U.S. Patent No. 5,879,370 (\u201cthe \u2019370 patent\u201d), which is directed to stents used in the treatment of coronary artery disease. Dr. Robert Fischell and his two sons are the named inventors, but Cordis has acquired all the rights to the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">The district court held a jury trial on the questions of infringement and invalidity. The jury found that Boston Scientific\u2019s accused stents literally infringed the \u2019370 patent and that the patent was not invalid. The jury concluded, however, that under the reverse doctrine of equivalents Boston Scientific was not liable for the infringement. Both parties moved for judgment as a matter of law. The district court overturned the jury\u2019s verdict of literal infringement, denied Cordis\u2019s challenge to the jury\u2019s verdict on the reverse doctrine of equivalents as moot, and upheld the jury\u2019s verdict that the patent was not invalid. The district court also held a bench trial on the question of unenforceability, after which the court held the \u2019370 patent unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-14\">Cordis appeals from the portions of the judgment relating to literal infringement, the reverse doctrine of equivalents, and unenforceability. Because we <em>remand </em>for more specific findings on the issue of unenforeeability, we decline to reach the issues of literal infringement and the reverse doctrine of equivalents. Boston Scientific cross-appeals from the portion of the judgment holding the \u2019370 patent not invalid. We <em>affirm </em>that portion of the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-16\">Cordis challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that the patentees engaged in inequitable conduct during the prosecution of U.S. Patent No. 5,643,312 (\u201cthe \u2019312 patent\u201d) that rendered the \u2019370 patent unenforceable. The \u2019370 patent issued from an application that was a continuation in part of the application that issued as the \u2019312 patent. The inequitable conduct charge stems from the applicants\u2019 failure to cite a prior art patent to Hillstead during the prosecution of the \u2019312 patent. The Hillstead reference first came to light when it was cited in a European search report in the spring of 1995. At that time, Dr. Fischell was handling the prosecution of the U.S. application himself, and his attorney, Morton Rosenberg, was handling the prosecution of a foreign counterpart application. The European search report was therefore sent to Mr. Rosenberg. That report identified four references, incluMg Hillstead, as \u201cparticularly relevant if combined with another.\u201d The report also listed a fifth reference as \u201cparticularly relevant if taken alone.\u201d Mr. Rosenberg obtained copies of the five cited references, and in July 1995 he forwarded to Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>Fischell a copy of the search report with the references attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Mr. Rosenberg took over the prosecution of the U.S. application in the spring of 1996. The Hillstead reference was never cited to the Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) during the prosecution of that application, which issued as the \u2019312 patent in July 1997. The continuation-in-part application that led to the \u2019370 patent was filed in May 1997. In May 1998, after discussions with Cordis regarding the Hill-stead reference, Dr. Fischell filed an information disclosure in the prosecution of the \u2019370 patent that listed Hillstead along with 60 other references. The information disclosure did not highlight the potential relevance of Hillstead.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Although we agree with the district court that the Hillstead reference was material, we conclude that the district court\u2019s findings of fact with respect to intent to deceive are not sufficiently specific to enable us to review the district court\u2019s legal ruling on that issue. We therefore remand to the district court for supplemental findings on several factual questions pertinent to the issue of inequitable conduct. <em>See Purdue Pharma L.P. v. Endo Pharms. Inc., </em>438 F.3d 1123, 1135 (Fed.Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">Cordis first argues that the Hill-stead reference was, at most, cumulative of a prior art patent to Inoue, which was disclosed to the examiner in the \u2019312 patent prosecution, and therefore that the Hillstead reference was immaterial. In Cordis\u2019s view, the district court erred in finding that the Hillstead patent was the only prior art reference in the record that disclosed undulating longitudinal structures connecting the segments of the stent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cordis argues that the Inoue patent has undulating longitudinal structures and that the examiner\u2019s rejection of original claim 8 of the \u2019312 patent as anticipated by Inoue verifies that fact. We disagree. Contrary to Cordis\u2019s argument, Dr. Fischell specifically distinguished Inoue by arguing that it lacked undulating longitudinal structures. With respect to amended claims 26 and 27, Dr. Fischell argued to the PTO that \u201cneither Inoue nor any other prior art known to the Applicants teaches this specific undulating longitudinal structure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">In support of its immateriality argument, Cordis also points to the fact that the examiner eventually found the \u2019370 patent to be patentable over Hillstead. However, that fact is not dispositive with respect to materiality. The test for materiality is whether \u201ca reasonable examiner would have considered such prior art important in deciding whether to allow the parent application.\u201d <em>Digital Control, Inc. v. Charles Mach. Works, </em>437 F.3d 1309, 1314-16 (Fed.Cir.2006). Here, the district court concluded that Hillstead was the only reference that disclosed undulating longitudinal structures, a feature that was increasingly emphasized during the course of the prosecutions of the \u2019312 and \u2019370 patents. Indeed, the evidence showed that by May 1998 Dr. Fischell\u2019s and Cordis\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>patentability concerns focused on the Hill-stead reference and its undulating longitudinal structures. Thus, the evidence of record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that a reasonable examiner would have considered Hillstead important in deciding whether to allow the \u2019312 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Cordis also challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion with respect to intent to deceive. To be guilty of inequitable conduct</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-7\">one must have intended to act inequitably. Thus, one who alleges a \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d form of inequitable conduct must offer clear and convincing proof of: (1) prior art or information that is material; (2) knowledge chargeable to applicant [or the attorney who prosecuted the application] of that prior art or information and of its materiality; and (3) failure of the applicant to disclose the art or information resulting from an intent to mislead the PTO.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\"><em>FMC Corp. v. Manitowoc Co., </em>835 F.2d 1411, 1415 (Fed.Cir.1987). In a case involving the omission of a material reference in the applicant\u2019s submissions to the PTO, there ordinarily must be \u201cclear and convincing evidence that the applicant made a deliberate decision to withhold a known material reference.\u201d <em>Digital Control, </em>437 F.3d at 1318, quoting <em>Baxter Int'l Inc. v. McGaw, Inc., </em>149 F.3d 1321, 1329 (Fed.Cir.1998). An applicant therefore \u201cmust be chargeable with knowledge of the existence of the prior art or information, for it is impossible to disclose the unknown.\u201d <em>FMC Corp. v. Manitowoc Co., </em>835 F.2d at 1415.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">Although as a general rule a party has no affirmative duty to search for relevant prior art, this court has stated that \u201cone should not be able to cultivate ignorance, or disregard numerous warnings that material information or prior art may exist, merely to avoid actual knowledge of that information or prior art.\u201d <em>FMC Corp. v. Hennessy Indus., Inc., </em>836 F.2d 521, 526 n. 6 (Fed.Cir.1987); <em>see also Brasseler, U.S.A., I, L.P. v. Stryker Sales Corp., </em>267 F.3d 1370, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2001) (\u201cWhere an applicant knows of information the materiality of which may so readily be determined, he or she cannot intentionally avoid learning of its materiality, even through gross negligence; in such cases the district court may find that the applicant should have known of the materiality of the information.\u201d). Thus, no duty to inquire arises unless the applicant or the prosecuting attorney \u201cis on notice of the likelihood that specific, relevant, material information exists and should be disclosed.\u201d <em>Brasseler, </em>267 F.3d at 1383. In such a case, the applicant or prosecuting attorney is not free to choose \u201cnot to investigate the facts necessary to determine the materiality of the [reference] in an effort to avoid complying with their duty to disclose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1382.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">In this case, Boston Scientific has advanced several alternative theories in support of its assertion that the Hillstead reference was withheld with deceptive intent. Its primary argument is that Dr. Fischell actually looked at the Hillstead reference in July 1995\u2014and therefore learned that Hillstead contained undulating longitudinal structures\u2014when Mr. Rosenberg sent him a copy of the reference. Alternatively, Boston Scientific argues, Mr. Rosenberg admitted that he at least \u201cscanned\u201d the Hillstead reference in the summer of 1995. Therefore, according to Boston Scientific, Mr. Rosenberg had a duty to disclose the Hillstead reference because he must have known from the drawings in the Hillstead patent that it disclosed undulating longitudinal structures. Finally, Boston Scientific advances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>the theory that, even if Dr. Fischell did not actually look at the Hillstead reference in July 1995, the European search report put him on notice of the materiality of the Hillstead reference and he intentionally avoided learning of its contents. The district court\u2019s written opinion alludes to Boston Scientific\u2019s third theory, noting that the \u201cpatentees purposefully neglected their responsibility of candor to the PTO by \u2018putting their heads in the sand\u2019 regarding prior art.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">It is unclear to us precisely what the district court has found with regard to Dr. Fischell\u2019s and Mr. Rosenberg\u2019s knowledge. In particular, we are uncertain whether the district court faulted Dr. Fischell merely for failing to conduct a prior art search, or whether the district court faulted Dr. Fischell for \u201ccultivating] ignorance\u201d with respect to the Hillstead reference. <em>FMC Corp. v. Hennessy Indus., Inc., </em>836 F.2d at 526 n. 6. The district court stated in its opinion that \u201cDr. Fischell and Mr. Rosenberg testified that they did not look at the Hillstead patent until April 1998, despite both having copies of said reference in their respective files since at least July 1995.\u201d It is not clear, however, whether or to what extent the district court credited that testimony, or whether the court found the testimony not credible in light of other, contrary evidence at trial that could provide a basis for a finding of deceptive intent. Because the district court\u2019s factual findings are critical to the process of review of the inequitable conduct issue, we remand for the purpose of enabling the district court to provide more specific findings as to the state of knowledge of Dr. Fischell and Mr. Rosenberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">The court should address whether, in addition to reading the July 1995 letter from Mr. Rosenberg, Dr. Fischell read the accompanying search report, which referred to various prior art patents, including the Hillstead patent, and whether Dr. Fischell read the Hillstead patent at that time. In this regard, the trial court\u2019s statement that \u201cthe patentees purposefully neglected their responsibility of candor to the PTO by \u2018putting their heads in the sand\u2019 regarding prior art\u201d needs elaboration. In particular, the court should explain whether that statement embodies findings that Dr. Fischell knew of the Hill-stead patent and, knowing that the Hill-stead patent contained information that was likely material to the patentability of the \u2019312 application, purposefully avoided obtaining knowledge of the details of that patent. The court should also determine whether its finding of inequitable conduct is based to any degree on the conduct of Mr. Rosenberg and, if so, what state of knowledge the court finds him to have had as to the existence and materiality of the Hillstead reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">Even if the \u2019312 patent was obtained by inequitable conduct, that conduct does not necessarily render the \u2019370 patent unenforceable. Because there was no separate inequitable conduct found during the prosecution of the \u2019370 patent, the \u2019370 patent can be held unenforceable only if the inequitable conduct during the prosecution of the \u2019312 patent tainted the prosecution of the \u2019370 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">The principle that conduct pertaining to one patent can taint another patent can be traced back at least to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Keystone Driller Co. v. General Excavator Co., </em>290 U.S. 240, 54 S.Ct. 146, 78 L.Ed. 293 (1933). We have applied that principle in a variety of contexts. <em>See, e.g., Agfa Corp. v. Creo Prods. Inc., </em>451 F.3d 1366 (Fed.Cir.2006) (continuation patent unenforceable based on inequitable conduct found in the prosecution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>the parent application); <em>Consol. Aluminum Corp. v. Foseco Int\u2019l Ltd., </em>910 F.2d 804, 812 (Fed.Cir.1990) (\u201cConsolidated\u2019s concealment of the [best mode] from the \u2019917 patent permeated the prosecution of the other patents-in-suit [which descended from the \u2019917 patent] and renders them unenforceable.\u201d); <em>Driscoll v. Cebalo, </em>731 F.2d 878, 885 (Fed.Cir.1984) (an applicant who \u201chas withheld from the PTO prior art material to a claim in a parent application should not be exculpated simply because, by fortuitous circumstances, the PTO has not reached the stage of allowing claims in a continuing application.\u201d). The relevant inquiry is whether the \u201cinequitable conduct in prosecuting the [parent] patent had immediate and necessary relation to the ... enforcement of the [child] patents.\u201d <em>Consol. Aluminum, </em>910 F.2d at 810-11.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">On this issue, as on the question of intent, our reviewing process would benefit from further elaboration of the district court\u2019s findings. In the portion of its opinion addressing inequitable conduct, the district court made the following statements regarding the taint issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-6\">[T]he submission to the PTO of the Hill-stead patent during the \u2019370 patent prosecution has no bearing on whether the \u2019312 patentees acted with deceptive intent during the \u2019312 prosecution. The court finds that the \u2019370 prosecution is tainted by the lack of candor exhibited during the \u2019312 prosecution, since the Hillstead patent was submitted along with sixty other references and never addressed by the patentees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">Although the district court stated that the inequitable conduct in connection with the \u2019312 patent tainted the \u2019370 patent, the court did not explain how the earlier inequitable conduct affected the later prosecution, other than to suggest that the effect of the earlier inequitable conduct was not purged, because the Hillstead reference was \u201cnever addressed by the patentees\u201d and because it was disclosed in the second prosecution \u201calong with sixty other references.\u201d On remand, the court should specify its reasoning in sufficient detail to make clear the grounds for its conclusion that the nondisclosure in connection with the \u2019312 patent prosecution carried over to the \u2019370 prosecution. In so doing, the court should address the parties\u2019 arguments as to whether the disclosure of the Hillstead patent \u201ccured\u201d any inequitable conduct in the \u2019312 prosecution, or whether, in light of the context in which the Hillstead patent was disclosed and the applicant\u2019s characterization of the prior art, that disclosure failed to cure the taint. <em>See Rohm &amp; Haas Co. v. Crystal Chem. Co., </em>722 F.2d 1556, 1572-73 (Fed.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">In its cross-appeal, Boston Scientific argues that claim 25 of the \u2019370 patent, which was added as an amendment during prosecution, is invalid for lack of a sufficient written description. Boston Scientific contends that, although claim 25 is broadly directed to using undulating longitudinal structures without reference to any particular type of stent, the \u2019370 patent discloses only the use of ring stents and teaches away from using stents not made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>of rings. In support of its argument, Boston Scientific primarily relies on <em>Tronzo v. Biomet, Inc., </em>156 F.3d 1154 (Fed.Cir.1998). We disagree with Boston Scientific\u2019s argument on the written description issue, and we uphold the jury\u2019s verdict that claim 25 is not invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Boston Scientific views the written description issue in this case as indistinguishable from the issue we faced in <em>Tronzo. </em>The patent at issue in <em>Tronzo </em>pertained to an artificial hip socket that included cup implants. The specification described the cups as \u201cconical\u201d in shape. The only references in the specification to other shapes were references to prior art that the patent distinguished as inferior. Moreover, the specification touted the conical shape as a key feature of the invention. <em>See Tronzo, </em>156 F.3d at 1159 (\u201cAnother extremely important aspect of the present device resides in the configuration of the acetabular cup as a trapezoid or a portion of a truncated cone.\u201d). We noted that \u201c[s]uch statements make clear that the \u2019589 patent discloses <em>only </em>conical shaped cups and nothing broader.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because we concluded that nothing in the patent\u2019s specification \u201csuggested] that shapes other than conical are necessarily a part of the disclosure,\u201d we held that the written description was insufficient to support amended claims that were directed broadly to generically shaped cups. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">We see critical differences between this case and <em>Tronzo. </em>Because the written description in <em>Tronzo </em>did not expressly disclose non-conical shaped cups, the question was whether a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the patent to disclose non-conical shaped cups. In the present case, there is no doubt that the \u2019370 patent discloses undulating longitudinal sections (touted for their ability to enhance stent flexibility) <em>and </em>ring shaped stent structures (touted for their ability to enhance stent strength). <em>See </em>\u2019370 patent, col. 1,11. 56-58 (\u201c[A]n object of this invention is to provide a stent having maximum hoop strength by the employment of closed, generally circular structures which are in fact rings.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at col. 3, 11. 46-50 (\u201cA stent such as stent 10 could have two or more undulating longitudinals. Such a stent would bend more easily during insertion into a vessel and would be more readily adaptable for placement in curved vessels such as some coronary arteries.\u201d). Thus, the written description dispute in this case boils down to whether the disclosure supports the use of undulating longitudinal structures in conjunction with stents that are not made of ring-shaped structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">We have held that when a patent includes two inventive components, particular claims may be directed to one of those inventive components and not to the other. <em>See, e.g., Resonate Inc. v. Alteon Websystems, Inc., </em>338 F.3d 1360, 1367 (Fed.Cir. 2003) (\u201c[W]hen the written description sets out two different problems present in the prior art, is it necessary that the invention claimed, and thus each and every claim in the patent, address both problems? We conclude that on the record in this case, the answer is no.\u201d); <em>Honeywell Inc. v. Victor Co. of Japan, Ltd., </em>298 F.3d 1317, 1326 (Fed.Cir.2002) (\u201cThe fact that the patentee chose to include language in claim 1 relating to only one. of the two cited prior art problems is persuasive evidence that the claim does not require the solution of both problems.\u201d). In this case, nothing in the patent suggests that the benefits of undulating sections are tied in any way to ring stents. To the contrary, Cordis\u2019s expert testified that the undulating longitudinal structures disclosed in the \u2019370 patent could \u201cclearly\u201d be used in conjunction with non-ring stents. Although such an embodiment would lack the strength-enhancing characteristics of ring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>stents, the undulating longitudinal structures would still enhance the stent\u2019s flexibility, as disclosed in the patent\u2019s specification. In light of the disclosure in the specification and the unrebutted testimony from Cordis\u2019s expert, we hold that the jury\u2019s conclusion that the written description requirement was satisfied is supported by substantial evidence. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Boston Scientific\u2019s motion for JMOL on the written description issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Each party shall bear its own costs for this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">. Cordis also contends that the district court erred by finding that Dr. Fischell distinguished certain other prior art as not having \u201cundulating longitudinals.\u201d However, the evidence of record supports the district court's finding in that regard. In the relevant portion of the prosecution history, Dr. Fischell explicitly distinguished three prior art referenees on the ground that \"[n]one of these references provide for the undulating sections of each longitudinal.\u201d Dr. Fischell acknowledged that a fourth reference\u2014the Lam reference\u2014disclosed \"undulating structures,\u201d but he went on to distinguish Lam on the ground that its undulating sections were not longitudinal structures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">. This court\u2019s statement in <em>Pharmacia Corp. v. Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., </em>417 F.3d 1369, 1375 (Fed.Cir.2005), that \"this court\u2019s inequitable conduct cases do not extend inequitable conduct in one patent to another patent that was not acquired through culpable conduct\u201d does not undermine the principle established in <em>Keystone Driller. </em>In light of its context, we interpret that statement as standing for the proposition that related patents do not <em>necessarily </em>rise and fall together, not for the proposition that inequitable conduct in the prosecution of one patent can never taint a separate patent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
