We deny the petition. <em>See Eta-Ndu v. Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 977, 982-83 (8th Cir.2005) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-18\">When an asylum decision is based on an adverse credibility finding, as it was in this case, we generally defer to the IJ if the credibility finding is supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons for disbelief.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 982. Upon careful review, we conclude that the IJ provided such reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-20\">We also conclude that Malaj failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Kondakova v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 792, 798 (8th Cir.2004) (applicant must genuinely fear persecution and offer credible, specific evidence that reasonable person in her position would fear persecution if returned), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1053, 125 S.Ct. 894, 160 L.Ed.2d 775 (2005). Malaj\u2019s asylum claim thus fails, and her claim for withholding of removal\u2014 which carries a more stringent burden of proof\u2014necessarily fails as well. <em>See Eta-Ndu, </em>411 F.3d at 986. To the extent her CAT claim is renewable, we agree with the BIA that Malaj presented no separate facts supporting CAT relief. <em>See Rodriguez v. Gonzales, </em>441 F.3d 593, 595 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-21\">Malaj\u2019s remaining arguments provide no basis for granting her petition for review, and accordingly we deny it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
