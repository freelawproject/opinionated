Swartz, is a 66-year old woman with significant physical and mental impairments. The present appeal concerns her application for Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits for the period from September 1992, when she was last employed, through December 31, 1997, when her \u201cinsured status\u201d expired.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An administrative law judge ruled that she was not entitled to any benefits because during that time she had the \u201cresidual functional capacity\u201d to perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence. We REVERSE and REMAND for further proceedings in accordance with the following opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">I. LEGAL STANDARDS</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">In order to qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits, Swartz must have been \u201cdisabled\u201d during the period of her disability insurance coverage. In this context, a disability is defined as \u201can inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or that has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). Federal regulations establish a five-part sequential evaluation process for determining when a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). As soon as a determination of disabled or not disabled can be made, the evaluation process ends. <em>Id. </em>In order, the five steps are: (1) if the claimant is \u201cdoing substantial gainful activity,\u201d he or she is \u201cnot disabled\u201d; (2) if the claimant does \u201cnot have a severe medically determinable physical or mental impairment that meets the duration requirement ... or a combination of impairments that is severe and meets the duration requirement,\u201d the claimant is \u201cnot disabled\u201d; (3) if the claimant has a severe impairment and the \u201cmedical severity\u201d of the claimant\u2019s impairment(s) \u201cmeets or equals\u201d a listed impairment, the claimant is \u201cdisabled\u201d; (4) if the \u201cmedical severity\u201d does not meet or equal a listed impairment, the claimant\u2019s \u201cresidual functional capacity\u201d is assessed and if the claimant can do his or her \u201cpast relevant work,\u201d the claimant is \u201cnot disabled\u201d; and (5) if the claimant cannot do his or her \u201cpast relevant work,\u201d but has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the residual functional capacity, taking into account the claimant\u2019s \u201cage, education, and work experience\u201d to \u201cmake an adjustment to other work,\u201d the claimant is \u201cnot disabled.\u201d Id. \u201cResidual functional capacity\u201d is defined as \u201cthe most that [an individual] can still do despite [his or her] limitations.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">II. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Agnes Swartz was born in 1940. According to her sister, Eunice Good, Swartz suffered from childhood encephalitis. As a result, Good says, Swartz has \u201calways had difficulty with learning new skills and problem solving,\u201d \u201chas difficulty retaining information and cannot follow through on more complex instructions,\u201d and \u201cis easily confused and frustrated with many domestic tasks,\u201d \u201ccan do housecleaning, but cannot cook and plan a meal,\u201d \u201crequires some level of support in her home environment,\u201d and \u201c[o]utside of her home environment she is easily overwhelmed.\u201d AR 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Swartz graduated from high school, but with a very mediocre academic record. She then worked for a number of years as a nurse\u2019s aide for various employers. During her entire adulthood, Swartz never lived alone, residing with either her parents, now deceased, and/or one or more of her sisters.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">In June 1992, Swartz started work as a nurse\u2019s aide at a long-term care facility. After a 90-day probationary period, she received performance evaluations from her direct supervisor and from the director of nursing at the facility, Jane Henderson. AR 405-07. Her direct supervisor rated her performance on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 1 being outstanding, 2 being very good, 3 being satisfactory, 4 being needs improvement, and 5 being unsatisfactory) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">Job Knowledge 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">Productivity 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">Quality 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">Relationships with Others 5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-13\">Dependability 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-14\">Work Habits 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-15\">Initiative 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-16\">Acceptance of Supervision and Directions 4</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">She also commented that Swartz \u201c[n]eeds lots of improvement\u2014needs to communicate\u201d in her relationships to others and rated Swartz\u2019s overall performance as \u201cneeds improvement,\u201d especially Swartz\u2019s ability to communicate with families and associates and to complete tasks in a timely manner. AR 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-18\">Henderson\u2019s evaluation similarly stated that Swartz\u2019s work performance \u201cneed[ed] improvement,\u201d identifying the \u201cprimary areas requiring improvement\u201d as Swartz\u2019s \u201cability to communicate satisfactorily with residents, families and other staff members,\u201d her \u201cability to complete [her] assigned responsibilities in a more timely manner,\u201d and her \u201climited availability for work\u201d as a part-time employee. AR 407. Henderson recommended an additional 60-day probationary period for Swartz. Instead of consenting to an extension of her probationary period, Swartz quit. She has not worked since.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-19\">According to Swartz, she has always had problems keeping up with the work at her jobs, although she would often \u201cwork extra\u201d to get it all done. AR 37-38. And according to Dolores Swartz, Swartz\u2019s sister-in-law and a nurse, who both knows Swartz personally and has occasionally worked with her, Swartz \u201ctried very hard, did very good work but it was slow work.\u201d AR 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-20\">Between the time she ceased working and December 31, 1997, the end of the insured period, Swartz never saw a psychiatrist or sought any other form of mental health treatment. However, she did have significant contact during that time with her family physician, Dr. Michael Wagner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>who subsequently offered his perspective on \u201csome of Agnes\u2019 emotional/cognitive problems\u201d prior to December 31, 1997. In Dr. Wagner\u2019s opinion, Swartz had suffered from a number of mental health problems for her entire life. In a written statement, dated December 3, 2002, Dr. Wagner explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\">In the office I have been treating her for nine years now, she always presented with a flat affect. She typically comes in with a relative to the appointments. When she was living with her sister Leona, she would accompany her during the examination. This is so her sister would have a handle on what advice I have given to Agnes due to the problems that Agnes has understanding what I have told her. <em>Agnes has always been slow to respond to questions. </em>She needs to think about the question before she responds. She appears to have low self-esteem. She can become easily upset.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">\n<em>From a mental/cognitive standpoint, she just appears like she is not up to speed. By analogy, if she were in school, she would probably need to be in a Special Education class.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">\n<em>... Based upon treating Agnes since 1993, the problems that I have described appear to be something that she has had all her life.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">AR 408 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">In July 2001, Dr. George Pestrue, from the Michigan Disability Determination Service, began his evaluation of Swartz\u2019s mental health. Based on a face-to-face evaluation and other testing information, Dr. Pestrue preliminarily concluded that Swartz \u201cappeared to have significant cognitive deficits.\u201d AR 243-250. Dr. Pestrue then conducted further face-to-face testing, testing her IQ at 72, her reading level at 5th grade, her spelling ability at 6th grade, her math skills at 4th grade and her overall mental age at 11 years, 9 months. Describing \u201cher combined cognitive/verbal and visual-motor skills\u201d as \u201cin the borderline defective range, he diagnosed Swartz as having \u201cBorderline Intellectual Functioning.\u201d AR 267-28. After further face-to-face testing, Dr. Pestrue concluded that Swartz\u2019s \u201cmemory skills varied from the defective range to the normal range,\u201d with \u201cmost of her combined memory skills\u201d falling \u201cin the borderline range.\u201d AR 284-86. As a result, he added \u201cBorderline Memory Functioning\u201d and \u201cDependent Personality Disorder\u201d to his diagnosis of Swartz\u2019s conditions. In summary, Dr. Pestrue explained his diagnoses as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">This examiner has seen this client on three occasions. He saw her for a complete mental status examination on 25 July 2001, for intelligence testing on 12 September 2001 and for this memory examination. It has become apparent that she is suffering from a severe dependent personality disorder which was not noted by this examiner in previous reports. It has become more apparent recently because her sister with whom she has been living is getting married and will leave the home. This means that the client will be left alone in the home. This is causing her a great amount of stress. She is uncertain how she will exist without her sister to rely on. This diagnoses is now being included along with the previous diagnoses of major depression and borderline intellectual functioning. <em>All of these problems appear to be long standing. All of them have been present since her childhood.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-11\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">In November 2002, Dr. Pestrue completed a Mental Residual Functional Capacity Assessment of Swartz. AR 409-410 (Nov. 25, 2002). He assessed her as \u201cmarkedly limited\u201d in her \u201cability to understand and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>remember detailed instructions,\u201d her \u201cability to carry out detailed instructions,\u201d her \u201cability to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods,\u201d her \u201cability to perform activities within a schedule, maintain regular attendance, and be punctual within customary tolerances,\u201d her \u201cability to interact appropriately with the general public,\u201d her \u201cability to ask simple questions or request assistance,\u201d her \u201cability to set realistic goals or make plans independently of others,\u201d and her \u201cability to accept instructions and respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors.\u201d AR 409-10. He assessed her as \u201cmoderately limited\u201d in her \u201cability to remember locations and work-like procedures,\u201d her \u201cability to sustain an ordinary routine without supervision,\u201d her \u201cability to make simple work-related decisions,\u201d her \u201cability to respond appropriately to change in the work setting,\u201d and her \u201cability to be aware of normal hazards and take appropriate precautions. <em>Id. </em>Finally, he assessed her as \u201cnot significantly limited\u201d in her \u201cability to carry out simple, one or two-step instructions,\u201d and in her \u201cability to work in coordination with or proximity to others without being distracted by them.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Swartz had Social Security Disability Insurance coverage from the time she ceased working in 1992 until December 81, 1997. She has filed two applications seeking benefits under that coverage. Her first application, filed on November 8, 1994 (the \u201c1994 application\u201d), was denied on January 4, 1995. Swartz, who was not represented by counsel at the time, did not appeal. She filed a second application on April 17, 2001 (the \u201c2001 application\u201d), claiming that she was disabled from September 1992 through December 31, 1997 due to certain mental disabilities.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the denial of the 1994 application barred her from recovering benefits for the earlier part of the insured- period, Swartz also sought to reopen her 1994 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">On December 3, 2002, an Administrative Law Judge held a hearing at which Swartz testified and presented other evidence in support of her application. In addition to the evidence previously described, the record includes the opinions of two non-treating physicians, Dr. Arthur Dundon and Dr. Robert L. Newhouse, each of whom reviewed Swartz\u2019s file and completed a Psychiatric Review and a Mental Residual Functional Capacity Assessment, and the testimony of a vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">Dr. Dundon reviewed Swartz\u2019s file and prepared his reports in August and October of 2001. He concluded that Swartz suffered from \u201cborderline intellectual functioning,\u201d a \u201cmedically determinable impairment,\u201d but not an impairment that satisfied the diagnostic criteria for an \u201cOrganic Mental Disorder.\u201d AR 253-266. In his Psychiatric Review, on a scale of none to extreme, he rated as \u201cmoderate\u201d Swartz\u2019s \u201cdegree of limitation\u201d for \u201cdifficulties in maintaining social functioning\u201d and for \u201cdifficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In his Mental Residual Functional Capacity Assessment, he rated Swartz as \u201cmoderately limited\u201d in \u201cthe ability to understand and remember very short and simple instructions,\u201d \u201cthe ability to carry out detailed instructions,\u201d the ability to sustain an ordinary routine without special supervision,\u201d \u201cthe ability to interact appropriately with the general public,\u201d and \u201cthe ability to get along with coworkers or peers without distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>but markedly limited in nothing. AR 269-72. He found that Swartz \u201ccould not understand/remember/carry out complex technical instructions on a sustained basis,\u201d \u201cwould have some problems maintaining attention and concentration on a sustained basis,\u201d and \u201cwould not work well in large groups or with public,\u201d but his ultimate conclusion was that Swartz \u201ccould adapt,\u201d and \u201cretains ability to do simple tasks on a sustained basis.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Dr. Newhouse completed his \u201cPsychiatric Review\u201d and \u201cMental Residual Functional Capacity Assessment\u201d in March 2002. He diagnosed Swartz as suffering from an \u201cOrganic Mental Disorder,\u201d a \u201clisted\u201d impairment, AR 385, and a \u201cPersonality Disorder,\u201d another \u201clisted\u201d impairment, AR 391. In his opinion, Swartz had a \u201cmarked\u201d degree of limitation in \u201cRestrictions of Activities of Daily Living,\u201d and a \u201cmoderate\u201d degree of limitation in \u201cDifficulties in Maintaining Social Functioning\u201d and \u201cDifficulties in Maintaining Concentration, Persistence, or Pace.\u201d AR 394. He also found her \u201cmarkedly limited\u201d in her \u201cability to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods,\u201d and her \u201cability to complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms and to perform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods,\u201d and \u201cmoderately limited\u201d in her \u201cability to understand and remember detailed instructions,\u201d her \u201cability to carry out detailed instructions,\u201d her \u201cability to perform activities within a schedule, maintain regular attendance, and be punctual within customary tolerances,\u201d and her \u201cability to work in coordination or proximity to others without being distracted by them.\u201d AR 398-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The vocational expert, Judith Findora, testified that an hypothetical individual \u201cwith the same age and educational background\u201d as Swartz and with \u201cnon-exertional limitations of no acute vision required, no complex tasks, define that as one and two step only, simple, rote tasks,\u201d \u201c[n]o hourly quotas, as in [an] assembly line type job,\u201d and \u201c[n]o dealing -with the general public, minimal work activity interaction with coworkers, minimal supervision\u201d would not be able to do Swartz\u2019s past work as a nurse\u2019s aide, but that there would be jobs in the region compatible with these limitations, including in the medium exertion category the job of janitor and in the light exertion category the job of housekeeper. However, she testified, if that same hypothetical individual also had either \u201c[n]o useful ability to complete a normal work load within the prescribed daily schedule,\u201d \u201c[n]o ability to deal with supervision,\u201d an \u201cinability to follow directions,\u201d \u201can inability to relate to coworkers or supervisors, problems that would arise at the work place,\u201d or was unable to \u201cmeet acceptable productivity,\u201d that individual would not be able to obtain \u201ccompetitive employment.\u201d AR 53-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">On February 12, 2003, the administrative law judge issued a written opinion denying Swartz\u2019s 2001 application. Applying the five-step test, the ALJ concluded (1) that Swartz was not performing substantial gainful work; (2) that Swartz had a severe impairment of \u201corganic mental disorder\u201d; (3) that Swartz would not be presumed disabled because her \u201corganic mental disorder\u201d did not meet or equal a listed impairment; (4) that Swartz\u2019s impairments would have prevented her from doing her past relevant work (as a nurse\u2019s aide); but (5) that Swartz retained the residual functional capacity to perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy. Specifically, the ALJ concluded that Swartz, during the insured period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADb\">retained the residual functional capacity to perform work that did not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>acute vision, complex tasks involving more than 1 or 2 step tasks, hourly quotas in assembly line type work, dealing with the general public, more than minimal supervision, and more than minimal work interaction with co-workers</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayp\">AR 22. Taking into consideration Swartz\u2019s age, education, and past relevant work experience, the ALJ then concluded that even though Swartz could not perform her past relevant work as a nurse\u2019s aide and \u201cha[d] no transferable skills,\u201d there were a \u201csignificant number of jobs in the national economy that she could perform,\u201d such as work as a janitor or housekeeper. Accordingly, the ALJ concluded, Swartz was \u201cnot disabled\u201d during the relevant time period and not entitled to benefits. AR 21, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The ALJ also ruled that Swartz was not entitled to have her earlier case reopened because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">[she] was able to pursue an appeal but failed to do so. Her new application was not filed until April 17, 2001, which is more than 4 years after the date of the prior unfavorable decision. Thus, the prior decision is beyond the period during which it could be reopened for good cause, such as new and material evidence. There is no exception in this case to allow reopening after 4 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkY\">AR 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Swartz timely sought review of the ALJ\u2019s decision by the Appeals Council for the Social Security Administration on the ground that \u201cthe decision is against the weight of the evidence.\u201d On April 14, 2003, the Appeals Council summarily denied Swartz\u2019s request for review, rendering the ALJ\u2019s decision the \u201cfinal decision of the Commissioner of Social Security\u201d in the case. AR 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">On July 1, 2003, Swartz filed a complaint in federal district court against the Commissioner of Social Security, challenging the Social Security Administration\u2019s denial of her 2001 application for disability insurance benefits and refusal to reopen her 1994 application. The Commissioner filed a motion for summary judgment; Swartz filed a motion to remand for reconsideration. The district court referred both motions to a magistrate for a report and recommendation. On June 21, 2004, the magistrate recommended that the district court deny Swartz\u2019s motion to remand and grant the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Overruling Swartz\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation. Swartz then filed the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">On appeal, Swartz challenges the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that she was not disabled during the relevant time period and his refusal to reopen her 1994 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">The court applies a substantial evidence standard in reviewing the administrative denial of Social Security disability benefits. <em>See Cutlip v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>25 F.3d 284, 286 (6th Cir.1994). \u201cSubstantial evidence is that which is greater than a scintilla but less than a preponderance. In essence, substantial evidence is \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>980 F.2d 1066, 1070 (6th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">B. ALJ\u2019s Ruling that Swartz was \u201cNot Disabled\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">Swartz argues that the ALJ\u2019s ruling that she was not disabled before December 31, 1997 is not supported by substantial evidence because: (1) in determining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Swartz suffered from any severe impairments (step two of the analysis), the ALJ erroneously identified Swartz\u2019s only severe impairment as \u201cOrganic Mental Disorder,\u201d instead of also including her \u201cBorderline Intellectual Functioning\u201d and \u201cDependent Personality Disorder\u201d; and (2) in assessing Swartz\u2019s \u201cresidual functional capacity\u201d (step five of the analysis), the ALJ ignored Swartz\u2019s 1992 negative work performance evaluation, mistakenly believing that it had been completed post-1997, and otherwise failed to account for evidence that she would have been unable to keep up with the pace at any job, not merely a job with hourly quotas.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Even assuming that the ALJ erred by not including \u201cBorderline Intellectual Functioning\u201d and \u201cDependent Personality Disorder\u201d as additional severe impairments in step two of its analysis, the error is harmless as long as the ALJ found at least one severe impairment and continued the sequential analysis and ultimately addressed all of the claimant\u2019s impairments in determining her residual functional capacity. <em>See Maziarz v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., </em>837 F.2d 240, 244 (6th Cir.1987). Thus, the critical issue on appeal is simply whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Swartz, during the insured period, retained the residual functional capacity to perform 1-2 step jobs not involving interaction with the public, more than minimal supervision, more than minimal interaction with co-workers, or hourly quotas.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In determining Swartz\u2019s \u201cresidual functional capacity,\u201d the ALJ analyzed the evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">The claimant testified that she was unable to work during the period at issue due to ... and other mental problems. However, the medical reports and other evidence fail to demonstrate disabling ... mental problems on or before the date last insured of December 31, 1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">... On December 4, 1997, the only complaint [in a visit to her primary treating physician, Dr. Wagner] was of sinus problems. Thus, at a treatment visit shortly before the date last insured of December 31,1997, the claimant was not reporting any ... mental problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">The evidence of record also demonstrates that the claimant did not report severe mental problems until 2001, well after the date last insured. The claimant underwent a psychological evaluation at the expense of the Social Security Administration on July 25, 2001. This is the first time she was diagnosed to have major depression....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">... Regarding other mental problems, IQ testing on September 12, 2001 showed a verbal IQ of 73, a performance IQ of 76, and a full scale IQ of 72. These scores are indicative of intelligence in the borderline range. Memory testing ... in January 2002 showed the claimant\u2019s memory was also in the range of borderline impairment. Dr. Wagner stated in a report dated December 3, 2002, that he has treated the claimant for 9 years and has noticed indications of mental slowness during that time. There is, however, no IQ testing or evidence showing a diagnosis of an organic mental disorder prior to the recent testing. The claimant was able to obtain a high school degree and was not in special education. She was able to work at a semi-skilled job as a nurse\u2019s aide for many years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-11\">Dr. Wagner also stated that, during the 9 years he has treated the claimant, she has been able to handle performing normal daily activities....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Opinions of record concerning the claimant\u2019s capacity to work have been considered in making this determination....

However, this report is based on observations for the period of May 11, 1992 through September 1, 1992. Thus, it pertains to a period well after the date last insured and after the claimant\u2019s severe depression began in 2001. Therefore, this opinion is not entitled to significant weight regarding an assessment of the claimant\u2019s condition on or before December 31,1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">A treating physician, Dr. Pestrue, submitted a mental residual functional capacity assessment indicating that the claimant has marked limitations on her ability to work. However, the report was completed in November 2002 and is based on treatment dating back only to September 2001. Again, such an opinion cannot be given significant weight regarding the period on or before the date last insured of December 31, 1997. A psychiatrist from the State Agency [Dr. Dundon] reviewed the evidence of record from October 2001 and found the claimant able to do simple job tasks.... It was only on March 15, 2002, when [the more recent psychological] records were in the file that a psychiatrist from the State Agency [Dr. Newhouse] found the claimant unable to perform even simple job tasks. The undersigned is in agreement with the State Agency psychiatrists in finding the claimant able to perform simple job tasks, prior to the beginning of her severe depression in 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">... All of the evidence regarding mental conditions dates from 3 to 4 years after the date last insured</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMr\">AR 17-20 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">The ALJ\u2019s analysis includes one clear (and conceded) error: he dismissed as irrelevant Swartz\u2019s negative work performance evaluations from September 1992 on the ground that they were completed \u201cwell after the date last insured and after the claimant\u2019s severe depression began in 2001.\u201d Swartz contends that the 1992 work performance evaluations are significant because they corroborate the more recent opinions of her treating physicians, Dr. Pestrue and Dr. Wagner, and one of the non-treating physicians, Dr. New-house, that notwithstanding more recent mental health issues, <em>e .g. </em>depression, she has suffered from other disabling mental health problems her entire life. Thus, Swartz argues, substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s determination that during the insured period she had the residual functional capacity to perform simple one to two step jobs as long as there were no hourly quotas; rather, the evidence shows that she would have had difficulty keeping up with the work pace at any job.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Although the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test is not overly demanding, we conclude that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Swartz retained the residual functional capacity to perform simple one to two step jobs as long as there were no hourly quotas. The ALJ\u2019s analysis reflects one clear error\u2014the ALJ\u2019s belief that the 1992 evaluations dat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ed from after the insured period\u2014and fails to explain why no weight is given to the several medical opinions that Swartz\u2019s problems are life-long conditions. In essence, the ALJ accepts the opinion of one non-treating physician (Dr. Dundon) over the opinions of two treating physicians (one of whom had Swartz as a patient during the insured period, Dr. Wagner, and one of whom treated her mental health issues, Dr. Pestrue) and one other non-treating physician (Dr. Newhouse). The ALJ discounted Dr. Pestrue\u2019s opinion because he only began treating Swartz in 2001, and he discounted Dr. Newhouse\u2019s opinion because he reviewed Swartz\u2019s file only after Dr. Pestrue\u2019s diagnoses had been added to it, but he never acknowledges Dr. Pestrue\u2019s opinion that all of the conditions he identified were likely to have been life-long problems. The ALJ\u2019s analysis also relies in part on the fact that Swartz did not seek any mental health help when she visited Dr. Wagner in December 1997, without explaining why she would have sought such help from her family physician. The ALJ\u2019s analysis also completely ignores Dr. Wagner\u2019s, Swartz\u2019s sister\u2019s and Swartz\u2019s sister-in-law\u2019s shared opinion that Swartz has always been slow.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Without deciding whether Swartz would have had difficulty keeping up with the work pace at any job, as she contends, we hold that the AL J\u2019s assessment of Swartz\u2019s residual functional capacity is not supported by substantial evidence because it ignores, without any persuasive justification, all of the evidence in the record that Swartz\u2019s organic mental disorder, borderline intellectual functioning, and severe personality disorder were lifelong conditions, arguably requiring a greater pace limitation in Swartz\u2019s residual functional capacity. We will remand in order to permit the ALJ in the first instance to decide whether an error-free assessment of the evidence alters his residual functional capacity assessment and, if so, to reassess whether with that additional limitation Swartz would have been able to perform any job during the insured period.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">C. Denial of Motion to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Swartz contends that the ALJ erred in refusing to reopen her 1994 application. Generally, federal courts lack jurisdiction to review an administrative decision not to reopen a previous claim for benefits. <em>See Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 107-09, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977). The only exception to this rule is \u201cwhere the Secretary\u2019s denial of a petition to reopen is challenged on constitutional grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109, 97 S.Ct. 980. Here, Swartz raises a constitutional issue, contending that the denial of her motion to reopen her 1994 application deprives her of due process because at the time her 1994 application was denied, in 1995, her mental disabilities prevented her from understanding and pursuing her administrative remedies. Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction to consider whether the ALJ properly denied Swartz\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The ALJ denied the motion to reopen on the ground that it was out of time and that \u201cthe medical reports and other evidence fail to demonstrate ... mental problems on or before the date last insured of December 31, 1997\u201d that rendered Swartz unable to file a timely appeal. The question on appeal is whether the ALJ\u2019s finding that Swartz had the capacity to file a timely appeal is supported by substantial evidence. Again, the ALJ\u2019s error in ignoring the 1992 work evaluations coupled with the failure to account for the medical opinions that many of Swartz\u2019s mental problems were lifelong conditions lead us to conclude that the finding is not supported by substantial evidence and that a remand for further consideration is required. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Thus, we will remand in order to permit the ALJ in the first instance to decide whether an error-free assessment of the evidence supports reopening. If the ALJ so concludes, then the fact that Swartz did not seek this relief within four years of the initial denial will not matter. <em>See </em>Social Security Rule 95-1 (a request to extend the time for seeking review will be granted where the claimant has \u201cestablishe[d] that he or she lacked the mental capacity to understand the procedures for requesting review\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ae9\">For the reasons stated in the foregoing opinion, the decision of the district court granting summary judgment to the defendant-appellee and denying the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motion to remand is REVERSED, and this matter is REMANDED to the district court with instructions to remand to the Social Security Administration to reconsider its denial of Swartz\u2019s 2001 application for benefits and motion to reopen her 1994 application for benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-16\">. On December 1, 2001, Swartz began receiving Supplemental Security Income disability benefits, a benefit that is not dependent on proof of \"insured status.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b389-7\">. Swartz also claimed to have been disabled by physical health problems and depression. However, the ALJ concluded that neither rendered Swartz disabled prior to December 31, 1997, and Swartz did not appeal that aspect of the AU's decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
