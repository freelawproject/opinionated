On appeal, he argues that the district court erred by finding that one of his prior Florida state convictions for possession of a concealed weapon a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of sentencing him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 because the factual circumstances underlying that conviction did not pose a \u201cserious risk of physical injury to another.\u201d For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">According to the undisputed facts in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Williams was contacted by a confidential informant who asked to purchase 1.5 ounces of powder cocaine from Williams. The Cl eventually purchased 26 grams of powder cocaine from Williams while police monitored the sale electronically. On March 29, 2005, a search warrant was served at Williams\u2019s apartment, and police seized one gram of marijuana, a total of one gram of crack cocaine, and 2.6 grams of powder cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Counts 1 and 2 of the indictment were grouped together for sentencing purposes, and, based on total drug quantity, Williams\u2019s base offense level was set at 18, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(ll). Williams, however, was found to have two prior Florida state convictions for carrying a concealed weapon, which the PSI further found constituted two prior crimes of violence, requiring that Williams be sentenced as a career offender within the definition of \u00a7 4B1.2, and, thus, his base offense level was set at 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(C). Williams received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b) for a total offense level of 29. Williams was assessed nine criminal history points, but based on his career offender status, his criminal history category was set at VI. Based on the above calculations, the PSI found an advisory sentencing range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">Williams lodged two objections to the PSI, only one of which is relevant to the present appeal. He objected that one of his two prior Florida state convictions for carrying a concealed firearm should not be considered a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, and, therefore his offense level was incorrectly calculated. Williams argued that for the offense to count as a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d it had to \u201cpresent a serious potential risk of physical injury,\u201d and because one of his two convictions for carrying a concealed weapon did not pose a risk of injury to anyone, it should not be counted.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">At the sentencing hearing, Williams reiterated his objection to the calculation of his offense level based on one of his prior convictions for carrying a concealed weapon. He did not contest that he had two convictions for carrying a concealed firearm, but argued that the factual basis for one of those convictions did not meet the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because the circumstances of the crime\u2014involving a traffic stop where police found a firearm under the passenger seat of the car Williams was driving\u2014did not involve a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>\u201cserious potential risk of injury to anyone.\u201d The court found that the determination of whether a particular conviction for carrying a concealed weapon posed a risk of physical injury should not be done on a case-by-case basis, and, thus overruled Williams\u2019s objection and found that carrying a concealed weapon constituted a crime of violence. The court then sentenced Williams to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of the recommended sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Acknowledging that we have already ruled, in <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir.1998), that carrying a concealed firearm is considered a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d Williams argues that the <em>Gilbert </em>decision should be reconsidered insofar as it creates a <em>per se </em>rule that carrying a concealed weapon is always a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d In support of his argument, Williams argues that there should be no <em>per se </em>rule that categorically includes or excludes certain crimes as crimes of violence, and suggests a more studied approach using the facts involved in the underlying offense to determine whether a crime truly meets the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as envisioned by the Sentencing Guidelines. Williams notes that there is a split among circuits as to whether or not courts should conduct any inquiry regarding facts underlying a conviction, but argues that this Court\u2019s \u201cstiff reading of the guidelines,\u201d prohibiting any examination of facts behind a prior conviction, is not compelled by the guidelines or any other relevant law. While admitting that <em>Gilbert </em>did not establish any exception to a <em>per se </em>rule, Williams argues that a <em>per se </em>rule is incorrect and that we should rehear the issue <em>en banc </em>to establish a rule that permits district courts to look at the \u201cactual \u2018conduct of which the defendant was convicted\u2019 in the prior offense\u201d by \u201cexamining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented,\u201d quoting <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). Alternatively, Williams argues that <em>Gilbert </em>was wrongly decided even if a <em>per se </em>rule is followed, citing a circuit conflict and arguing that <em>Gilbert </em>is difficult to reconcile with a line of this Court\u2019s cases holding that possession of a firearm by a convicted felon does not constitute a crime of violence. Williams further argues that the facts surrounding his conviction\u2014involving the discovery of a firearm under the passenger seat of his car during a routine traffic stop\u2014imply only the possibility, not the actual risk, of physical force as required to make the crime a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Thus, Williams requests that an exception be added to the <em>per se </em>rule, or, alternatively, that this Court reconsider and overrule <em>Gilbert en banc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">We review a district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, 847 (11th Cir.1998). A district court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines are reviewed <em>de novo. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d at 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Under \u00a7 4B1.2, \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-8\">[A]ny offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l)-(2). The Commentary further clarifies that \u201ccrime of violence\u201d includes conduct that, by its very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>nature, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, comment. (n.1). When deciding whether an offense constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d \u201cthe offense of conviction (ie., the conduct of which the defendant was convicted) is the focus of the inquiry.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">In <em>Gilbert, </em>we held that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon under Florida law fit the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a) because \u201ccarrying a concealed weapon is conduct that poses a serious potential risk of injury.\u201d <em>Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d at 1372. More recently, in <em>United States v. Adams, </em>we reiterated our holding in <em>Gilbert </em>that the crime of carrying a concealed weapon constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of the career offender provisions found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1, 4B1.2. <em>United States v. Adams, </em>316 F.3d 1196, 1197 (11th Cir.2003). We explicitly noted that, while the defendant there (as here) objected that his concealed weapons offenses were not \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d his objection was contrary to the holding in <em>Gilbert </em>and would not be revisited. <em>Id. </em>at 1197 n.1. The Court emphasized that \u201c[t]he law of this circuit is \u2018emphatic\u2019 that only the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc </em>can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d <em>Id. citing Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Notwithstanding a dissenting judge\u2019s suggestion that we hold an <em>en banc </em>hearing in <em>Adams </em>in light of a circuit split on the issue of whether carrying a concealed weapon constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d we declined to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 1201-03 (Propst, J. dissenting);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Adams, </em>62 Fed.Appx. 923 (11th Cir.2003) (table) (denying motion for an <em>en banc </em>rehearing). Furthermore, in a recent unpublished opinion cited by both parties in their briefs, we reaffirmed the holdings in <em>Gilbert </em>and <em>Adams </em>and neither this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>nor the Supreme Court wished to revisit the issue. <em>See United States v. Price, </em>132 Fed.Appx. 341, 343 (11th Cir.) (unpublished), <em>rehearing en banc denied </em>159 Fed.Appx. 986 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 775, 163 L.Ed.2d 600 (2005). Thus, to date, neither an <em>en banc </em>panel of this Court nor the Supreme Court has overruled our holdings in <em>Gilbert </em>and <em>Adams. </em>Accordingly, a conviction for carrying a concealed firearm remains a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, and a three-judge panel cannot overrule those holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">We note that Williams also suggests that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Shepard </em>supports his argument that district courts should be able to look behind the fact of the prior conviction to examine the facts and circumstances for evidence that, in actuality, the crime truly poses a substantial risk of physical harm to others. Williams misinterprets <em>Shepard\u2019s </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">In <em>Shepard, </em>the Supreme Court addressed whether a court could use police reports or complaint applications to establish whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction for burglary qualified as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 15, 125 S.Ct. at 1257. The ACCA made burglary a \u201cviolent felony\u201d only if the burglary was a \u201cgeneric\u201d one\u2014that is, was committed in a building or enclosed space as opposed to a boat or a vehicle. <em>Id. </em>Previously, the Court had held that, where a state statute defined burglary broadly to include more than \u201cgeneric\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>burglaries (\u201cnon-generic\u201d burglary statutes), a district court, for purposes of determining whether a non-generic burglary qualified as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA, should normally look \u201conly to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, 125 S.Ct. at 1257-58, quoting <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2160, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). However, if the indictment or information and jury instructions showed that the defendant was charged only with burglary of a building, and the jury necessarily had to find entry of a building, then the conviction might qualify as a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 17, 125 S.Ct. at 1258. The Court in <em>Shepard </em>ultimately rejected the use of police reports or complaint applications to make such a finding and held that a district court\u2019s inquiry to determine whether a plea of guilty to a non-generic statute necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense is limited \u201cto the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 125 S.Ct. at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">First, in this case Williams is not arguing that the district court used some improper document or method to find the elements of his offense or to conclude that he committed a crime of violence. Indeed, he admitted to his prior conviction, but asked that the district court go beyond the mere elements of the offense and language of the statute to find additional facts that might lead to a conclusion that, despite this Court\u2019s precedent, the facts of Williams\u2019s offense would take it outside the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Assuming without deciding that <em>Shepard </em>applies to career offender determinations, we conclude that nothing in <em>Shepard </em>countenances the result Williams proposes above. Florida\u2019s carrying a concealed weapon statute previously was discussed by this Court in <em>United States v. Hall, </em>77 F.3d 398, 402 n. 4 (11th Cir.1996), which held that carrying a concealed firearm qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. In <em>Hall, </em>we found that, in Florida, \u201ccarrying a concealed weapon requires the weapon to be (1) on or about the person, and (2) hidden from the ordinary sight of another person.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.01. We then distinguished carrying a concealed firearm from, for example, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, because carrying a concealed firearm required that the firearm be found \u201con or about the person,\u201d making the firearm readily available for use upon another person, while simple possession of a firearm by a convicted felon did not require that the firearm be anywhere near the person illegally possessing it. <em>Id. </em>at 401-02, n. 4. Our decision in <em>Gilbert </em>relied on <em>Hall </em>and extended its reasoning to hold that carrying a concealed firearm also qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d at 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Accordingly, unlike in <em>Shepard, </em>there is no ambiguity in whether Florida\u2019s carrying a concealed firearm statute qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d or, for that matter, a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and, therefore, under our precedent, the fact of Williams\u2019s conviction for carrying a concealed firearm was sufficient to support the district court\u2019s guidelines calculations. <em>Cf. United States v. Owens, </em>447 F.3d 1345, 1347 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that a prior conviction for possession of an unregistered firearm qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2 and concluding that there was no ambiguity on the face of the defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction that would require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>a district court to look into additional facts other than the fact of the conviction itself).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that Williams\u2019s conviction for carrying a concealed firearm qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of calculating his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-7\">. Honorable Robert B.
