The district court sentenced Esparza to seventy-seven months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Esparza filed a timely notice of appeal, and his counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious issues for appeal but requesting that we review the reasonableness of the sentence imposed by the district court. Although notified of his right to do so, Esparza did not file a pro se supplemental brief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-23\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court is no longer bound by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>sentencing range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines, which are now advisory. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). In determining a sentence post<em>-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are required to consider the correctly calculated guideline range and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Here, the district court correctly calculated Esparza\u2019s total offense level to be twenty-one and his criminal history category to be VI. Based on these calculations, the sentencing guidelines provided for a range of 77 to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>Ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table). Treating the sentencing guidelines as advisory and consulting the applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court sentenced Esparza at the bottom of this range, well below the statutory maximum penalty of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 (2000). Esparza has not rebutted the presumption that the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S., 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Esparza\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Esparza, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Esparza requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Esparza.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-14\">. The district court sentenced Esparza to a concurrent eighteen-month sentence resulting from the revocation of Esparza\u2019s supervised release from a 2002 conviction for possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5)(A) (2000). Esparza did not appeal the revocation or the resulting sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-26\">. Although Esparza challenged counsel\u2019s effectiveness in his notice of appeal, that claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>is more properly raised in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
