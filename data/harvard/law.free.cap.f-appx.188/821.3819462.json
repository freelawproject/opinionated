Sholl, United States Attorney\u2019s Office, Tampa, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b845-12\">Ryan Thomas Truskoski, Orlando, FL, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b845-14\">Before ANDERSON, BIRCH and DUBINA, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b845-15\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b845-16\">Appellant Terrence Dubose appeals the 240-month sentence imposed following his guilty plea to conspiracy with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(l)(A)(in), 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-17\">On appeal, Dubose argues that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), was incorrectly decided and that his prior convictions, which the district court used to apply a career offender enhancement, should have been alleged in the indictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-18\">Dubose\u2019s position is precluded by our many decisions attesting to the continued validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres. See United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cAs we have said several times, unless and until the Supreme Court specifically overrules <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we will continue to follow it.\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in using Dubose\u2019s prior convictions, which were not charged in his indictment, to apply a career offender enhancement to his offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-19\">Dubose further argues on appeal that the district court erred by failing to attach anything to the PSI as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(3)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-20\">We review <em>de novo </em>legal questions concerning the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>United States v. Noel, </em>231 F.3d 833, 836 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-21\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(3) provides that a sentencing court \u201cmust\u2014for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter\u2014rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary ... and must append a copy of the court\u2019s determinations under this rule to any copy of the presentence report made available to the Bureau of Prisons.\u201d <em>Fed.R.Crim.P. </em>32(i)(3)(B), (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-22\">The record here demonstrates that the district court did not attach a written statement of its determinations to the presentence report. \u201cThe failure of the district court to append a written record of its findings is a ministerial matter, however, which can be remedied on remand without resentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Kramer, </em>943 F.2d 1543, 1553 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-23\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Dubose\u2019s sentence, but remand the case to the district court for the limited purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>attaching a copy of the sentencing hearing transcript to the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">AFFIRMED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
