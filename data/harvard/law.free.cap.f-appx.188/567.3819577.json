INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-18\">Petitioners entered the United States before April 1, 1997. Thus, the one-year period of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) within which to file for asylum runs from April 1, 1997. <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001). Petitioners\u2019 application was not filed until January 2002. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of asylum eligibility. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-19\">For withholding (or \u201crestriction\u201d) of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A), we apply a more stringent standard than for asylum. <em>See, e.g., Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003) (reit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>erating that withholding of removal requires a \u201cclear probability\u201d of persecution and is \u201cmore stringent\u201d than the asylum standard). It must be \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that Petitioners would face persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 888 (9th Cir.2001). Review is for \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). To grant relief, the evidence must be \u201ccompelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Here, the administrative record does not compel the conclusion that Mari-no-Martinez\u2019s death was on account of political opinion. The evidence is either (1) the perpetrators were unknown, or (2) they were the losers in the mayoral election and were rivals in the same political party as Marino-Martinez. No evidence indicated the killing was, even in part, because of his opinions. Even though Marino-Martinez was a \u201cpolitician,\u201d nothing indicates he was killed by the government, or a group the government could not control, on account of his political opinion. <em>See Molina-Morales v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[t]he mere fact that [the persecutor] was a politician does not compel a conclusion that [petitioner] was persecuted on account of any political opinion his persecutors imputed to him\u201d). \u201cPurely personal retribution is ... not persecution on account of political opinion.\u201d <em>Grava v. INS, </em>205 F.3d 1177, 1181 n. 3 (9th Cir.2000); <em>see also Zayas-Marini v. INS, </em>785 F.2d 801, 806 (9th Cir.1986) (finding death threats grounded only in personal animosity insufficient to qualify for asylum or withholding of deportation).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Nor does the record compel the conclusion that Salgado fled persecution. The killing of Marino-Martinez occurred in 1988\u2014two years <em>after </em>Salgado entered the United States, and 16 years before the BIA denied relief. Despite the killing and other threats, Salgado\u2019s family remained in Mexico in the same residence until 1991. Marino-Martinez\u2019s wife remained in the same residence in Mexico for 13 years before she died in Mexico of natural causes. The testimony that family members remained safely in Mexico long after the killing is inconsistent with fears of persecution. <em>See Cuadras v. INS, </em>910 F.2d 567, 571 (9th Cir.1990) (reasoning that persecution fears are undercut when family members continue to reside in the country); <em>Hakeem, </em>273 F.3d at 816 (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s claim of persecution upon return is weakened, even undercut, when similarly-situated family members continue to live in the country without incident ....\u201d) (citation omitted). And Salgado acknowledged several times on his application and at his hearing that he entered the United States for economic reasons (not to flee persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Petitioners also argue the BIA denied them due process by considering, and then denying, relief under the CAT. They argue the IJ did not address the CAT, and the BIA therefore erred in denying CAT relief. The argument fails because (1) the IJ did indicate at a pre-hearing proceeding that the CAT would be addressed, (2) the IJ did address it in his decision, and (3) Petitioners specifically raised CAT relief in their brief on appeal to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">On the merits, CAT relief requires, among other things, that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that a petitioner would be tortured if returned to his or her country. There must be \u201csubstantial grounds for believing that [a petitioner] would be in danger of being subjected to torture.\u201d <em>Al-Saher v. INS, </em>268 F.3d 1143, 1146 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). The record here does not meet that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>standard. There is little, if any, evidence that Marino-Martinez\u2019s killing was by a public official, nor that Salgado would therefore be similarly threatened 16 years later by such an official if he returned to Mexico. <em>See Azanor v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1013, 1019 (9th Cir.2004) (reiterating that torture must be \u201cby or at the instigation of or with the <em>consent or acquiescence </em>of a public official\u201d) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1)) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b592-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-20\">.
