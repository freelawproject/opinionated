We affirm in part, reverse in part, vacate the sentence, and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-22\">Appellant argues that the admission at trial of out-of-court statements made by his wife violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). Appellant\u2019s wife was tried and convicted at the same trial for conspiracy to import heroin, but she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>did not testify. Some of her statements were offered as false exculpatory statements that showed consciousness of guilt and evidenced the existence of the conspiracy. The admission of those nonhearsay statements did not violate the Confrontation Clause. <em>See Tennessee v. Street, </em>471 U.S. 409, 414, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 85 L.Ed.2d 425 (1985). Other statements were offered for their truth, but they concerned matters that were not in dispute, and therefore, their admission was not problematic. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hoac, </em>990 F.2d 1099, 1105 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Appellant also argues that if his wife\u2019s false statements were admitted only to show consciousness of guilt, the district court erred by not giving a limiting instruction to the jury. However, no instruction was required, because the statements were admissible as to both Appellant and his wife. <em>See Anderson v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 211, 219-20, 94 S.Ct. 2253, 41 L.Ed.2d 20 (1974); <em>United States v. Hackett, </em>638 F.2d 1179, 1186-87 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 1001, 101 S.Ct. 1709, 68 L.Ed.2d 203 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The next issue is whether the trial court erred at sentencing by imposing an obstruction of justice enhancement without making sufficient findings on the record. Any error that may have been committed was harmless because Appellant received the same sentence as his wife, who was convicted of similar conduct but was not found to have obstructed justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Finally, Appellant contends that the district court erred by imposing an unreasonably long sentence. In light of this court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>United States v. Zavala, </em>443 F.3d 1165 (9th Cir.2006), and <em>United States v. Diaz-Argueta, </em>447 F.3d 1167 (9th Cir.2006), Appellant\u2019s sentence is vacated and his case is remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">The decision below is AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART. Appellant\u2019s sentence is VACATED and this matter is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b597-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
