Hicks, </em>389 F.3d 514, 526 (5th Cir.2004). Review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a warrant is limited to 1) whether the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies, and 2) whether the warrant was supported by probable cause. <em>United States v. Alix, </em>86 F.3d 429, 435 (5th Cir.1996). We affirm for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">1. Owens\u2019 core argument is that the affidavits supporting the search warrant qualify as bare-bones because they were based on insufficient and unreliable information \u201cfrom a confidential informant.\u201d This argument fails because 1) Owens ignores the fact that Justus\u2019 identity was not confidential; to the contrary, her name is used repeatedly on the statement of \u201cUnderlying Facts and Circumstances\u201d and 2) the reliability of an informant who is identified as a victim-witness to a crime, rather than a professional informant, need not be established in the officer\u2019s affidavit. <em>United States v. Payne, </em>341 F.3d 393, 401 (5th Cir.2003) (citing <em>United States v. Bell, </em>457 F.2d 1231, 1238 (5th Cir.1972)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">2. In their statement of \u201cUnderlying Facts and Circumstances,\u201d the affiant police officers explained in detail as to how Justus came to be in Owens\u2019 apartment and what she saw therein. Accordingly, the affidavits were in no sense bare-bones and the good-faith exception applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
