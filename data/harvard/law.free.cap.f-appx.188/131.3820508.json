Pursuant to the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines, Taylor\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines range was 292-365 months. The District Court granted the Government\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on Taylor\u2019s cooperation with the Government and sentenced Taylor to 196 months. He now appeals from that sentence, arguing that he was sentenced in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-22\">The Government contends that we do not have jurisdiction over this appeal. The Government notes that Taylor\u2019s plea agreement provided for a waiver of \u201call rights to appeal or collaterally attack the defendant\u2019s conviction, sentence, or any other matter relating to this prosecution....[T]he defendant may file a direct appeal but may raise only claims that: 1. the defendant\u2019s sentence exceeds the statutory maximum; or 2. the sentencing judge erroneously departed upward from the otherwise applicable sentencing guideline range.\u201d App. at 59-60. The Government argues that Taylor waived his right to appeal his sentence pursuant to <em>Booker. </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-24\">In <em>United States v. Lockett, </em>406 F.3d 207 (3d Cir.2005), Lockett attempted to appeal his sentence pursuant to <em>Booker, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>notwithstanding his plea agreement, in which he waived his right to appeal his sentence. Like the plea agreement at issue here, Lockett\u2019s plea agreement provided exceptions to his waiver of his right to appeal his sentence, which included \u201can appeal based on a claim that the defendant\u2019s sentence exceeded the statutory maximum,\u201d and an appeal \u201cbased on a claim that the sentencing judge erroneously departed upwards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210. We held that the defendant had waived his right to appeal his sentence under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">A valid waiver of appeal deprives this court of jurisdiction over the appeal. See <em>United States v. Khattak, </em>273 F.3d 557, 563 (3d Cir.2001). Because Taylor has not challenged the validity of the waiver, we find that the waiver deprives us of jurisdiction over his appeal of his sentence pursuant to <em>Booker. </em>We therefore dismiss his appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-14\">. As we noted at the outset, Taylor received a substantial benefit from the plea agreement, as the Government filed a motion pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), which the District Court granted, thereby reducing Taylor\u2019s imprisonment term by almost 100 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
