We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-19\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 158 (2d Cir.2004). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). Nevertheless, \u201cthe fact that the [agency] has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application cannot insulate the decision from review.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). An adverse credibility determination must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus\u201d to the finding. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-21\">Here, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence. Although the IJ correctly stated that the abortion certificate and letter provided by Lin had not been formally authenticated, an IJ is not permitted to reject an asylum-seeker\u2019s documents based solely on a failure to authenticate. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 404-05 (2d Cir.2005). Furthermore, even though the household registration entered into evidence did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>bear Lin\u2019s \u201cCitizen No.,\u201d it did indicate Lin\u2019s gender, date of birth, relationship to the head of the household, type of household, place of birth, native place, workplace, occupation, nationality, and the amount of time that Lin had lived at his address in China\u2014all factors which, contrary to the IJ\u2019s finding, tied the household registry entry to Lin, himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">The IJ further erred in his assessment of Lin\u2019s sincerity. The IJ found Lin insincere, citing, <em>inter alia, </em>certain implausible aspects of Lin\u2019s story. As the IJ acknowledges, however, certain of his conclusions were speculative. On remand, the IJ must provide sufficient reasons for any credibility findings to permit us to conclude that they are not based on either \u201ca misstatement of the facts in the record nor bald speculation or caprice.\u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Finally, the IJ noted a discrepancy within Lin\u2019s testimony as related to his notarial certificate, which was dated April 2002, before he stated that he had left China, even though he testified that his family had gotten the certificate upon the advice of Lin\u2019s lawyer in the United States. Although the record does substantiate this discrepancy, remand is still necessary because it is not clear the agency would reach the same conclusion based on this one discrepancy. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 161 (2d Cir.2006). Because the flawed adverse credibility finding was the basis for the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum, withholding, and CAT relief, all three claims must be reconsidered on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Accordingly, Lin\u2019s petition for review is GRANTED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
