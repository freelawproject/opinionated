Reasoner leased an apartment from the Housing Authority, and in January 2005, the Housing Authority informed Reasoner that she would be required to vacate the premises. After receiving the notice to vacate, Reasoner initiated suit in federal district court, alleging that her eviction was based on discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-19\">After Reasoner\u2019s suit was filed, the Housing Authority initiated eviction proceedings in Texas Justice Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a short trial, a jury found in favor of the Housing Authority, and the court entered judgment in its favor. Following that judgment, the Housing Authority moved for dismissal of Reasoner\u2019s federal suit, invoking both the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and <em>res judicata. </em>The district court concluded that Reasoner\u2019s claims were barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and dismissed the suit. The court did not address the application of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-20\">Reasoner argues that the district court\u2019s application of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is in error, relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision restricting the scope of the doctrine in <em>Exxon Mobil v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). The Housing Authority concedes on appeal that the <em>Exxon Mobil </em>decision precludes the application of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine in this case, but argues that this court should affirm the dismissal based on <em>res judicata. </em>The district court, however, did not address this argument, and we decline to do so in the first instance. The judgment of the district court is REVERSED, and the case REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-21\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-16\">. Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b306-17\">. The jurisdiction of the Texas Justice Court is subject to several limits, including, <em>inter alia, </em>only those civil matters in which the amount in controversy is $5,000 or less. <em>See </em>Tex. Gov.Code \u00a7 27.031. Moreover, the <em>res judicata </em>effect of a judgment of a Justice Court is limited by statute. <em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 31.004, 31.005; <em>Brown v. Henderson, </em>941 S.W.2d 190, 192 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1996, no writ).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
