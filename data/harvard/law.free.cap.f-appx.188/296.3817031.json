Santiago-Lugo is serving a sentence of life imprisonment for convictions from 1996, in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, of a serious drug-trafficking conspiracy, a continuing criminal enterprise count, and other offenses. At the time Santiago-Lugo filed his Rule 60(b) motion, the district court in the Western District of Louisiana, where he is currently confined, had already transferred the case to the First Circuit Court of Appeals for consideration whether he should be authorized to file what amounted to a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, and the First Circuit had denied such authorization. We must examine our own jurisdiction, <em>see United States v. Johnston, </em>258 F.3d 361, 363 (5th Cir.2001), and we have \u201cinherent jurisdiction to examine the jurisdiction of district court courts within [this] circuit.\u201d <em>In re Transtexas Gas Corp., </em>303 F.3d 571, 576-77 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">We have expressed \u201cgrave doubt\u201d that a district court had jurisdiction to \u201cclarify,\u201d pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(a), a two-year-old order by which it had granted a motion by defendant corporations to transfer a plaintiffs diversity action to a federal district court in New York. <em>See In re Galiardi, </em>745 F.2d 335, 337 (5th Cir.1984); <em>see also In re Southwestern Mobile Homes, Inc., </em>317 F.2d 65, 66 (5th Cir.1963) (expressing doubt about this court\u2019s \u201cpower to compel\u201d a federal district judge in Texas to vacate his order transferring an action to another district). Sister circuits have held that \u201cwhen a transfer of a case has been completed, the transferor court\u2014and the appellate court that has jurisdiction over it\u2014lose all jurisdiction over the case.\u201d <em>See, e.g., In re United States, </em>273 F.3d 380, 383 (3d Cir.2001) (and citations therein). This is especially true where, as here, the transferee court has proceeded with the transferred case. <em>See id. </em>at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">Given that the First Circuit had already disposed of Santiago-Lugo\u2019s transferred case, the district court lacked jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>to consider the case thereafter. Even if that were not so, the appeal from the denial of rule 60(b) is frivolous. Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
