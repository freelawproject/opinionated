Plaintiff-Appellant Tommy Seever argues that the administrative law judge (ALJ) failed to discuss certain medical evidence and include various restrictions in his Residual Functional Capacity (RFC) determination. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-18\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b773-19\">Seever worked as construction carpenter. In 1998, while carrying a large pipe with a co-worker, Seever sustained a \u201csevere jolting injury to his neck and back\u201d when the co-worker dropped his end of the pipe. ApltApp. at 289. Seever was subsequently diagnosed with multiple cervical and lumbar disc herniations, radiculopathy, bone spurs, cervical spondylosis, and severe degenerative disc disease. Seever underwent seven operations to correct the problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-20\">On April 2, 2002, two months after his last operation, surgeon Mark Hayes opined that Seever</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-21\">is doing really well ... and he is ready to be release[d] to return to work. He is going to work back as a carpenter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-22\">... [H]e said he was feeling a whole lot better. He still has some pain and he is learning how to live with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-23\">Aplt.App. at 310. But three weeks later, Seever reported to Richard Hastings, D.O., during a workers\u2019 compensation eval<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>uation, that he was experiencing intense pain and was unable to perform carpentry work for a full day. Dr. Hastings reviewed Seever\u2019s medical history, conducted a physical examination, and found that Seever, \u201cwhose entire adult work activities have been that of heavy manual labor[,] is currently 100% permanently totally disabled and economically unemployable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300. Dr. Hastings attributed Seever\u2019s total disability to a 49% impairment due to lumbar injury, 47% impairment due to cervical injury, and 3% impairment \u201cdue to psychological overlay and clinical depression.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300. But despite those findings, Dr. Hastings recommended that Seever undergo a \u201cfull functional capacity evaluation\u201d and thereafter be assessed by a \u201cvocational rehabilitative training specialist ... to determine whether or not there are any job activities that [Seever] could reasonably be expected to perform.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">In June 2002, Seever applied for disability benefits. A psychiatric consultant reviewed Seever\u2019s file and concluded that \u201cdepression [secondary to] chronic pain,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 355, only mildly limited Seever\u2019s daily activities, social functioning, and \u201c[c]oncentration, [persistence, or [p]ace,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 353. And one of Seever\u2019s orthopedic physicians, Jeff Gibson, D.O., submitted a mental status form, opining that Seever\u2019s \u201cproblems appear to be physical,\u201d and that he should be able to complete tasks as instructed and \u201crespond well to supervision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303. Seever\u2019s application was denied initially and upon reconsideration. Seever requested a hearing before an ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">On October 1, 2003, Seever was interviewed and tested by clinical psychologist John Hickman. In a disability evaluation report, Dr. Hickman indicated that Seever described \u201ca severe degree of anxiety and depression,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 371, which was consistent with certain test results. And although Seever\u2019s score on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 was shared by individuals who \u201care severely and chronically maladjusted,\u201d Seever\u2019s score also indicated that he \u201cwas presenting himself in a negative light and may have been over reporting his difficulties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Dr. Hickman concluded that \u201cthe stress of [Seever\u2019s] cervical and lumbar surgery and residual pain and physical limitations have taxed his psychological coping abilities but have yet to disrupt his cognitive functioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372. Two days later, Dr. Hickman filled-out a medical source statement form, opining that Seever was only slightly limited in his abilities to understand, remember, and carry-out detailed instructions, and was not impaired at all in his abilities to understand, remember, and carry-out short, simple instructions or to \u201cmake judgements on simple work-related decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374. Dr. Hickman also concluded that, while Seever was moderately limited in his abilities to appropriately interact with co-workers and respond to work pressures, Seever was only slightly limited in his abilities to respond to changes in a work setting and to appropriately interact with supervisors and the public. Finally, Dr. Hickman checked a box indicating that no other capabilities were affected by Seever\u2019s impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">At the disability hearing, the ALJ asked the vocational expert (VE) what jobs were available to a hypothetical claimant with Seever\u2019s skills and physical limitations, including moderate limitations in his abilities to appropriately interact with co-workers and respond to work pressures. The VE identified picture framer, wood heel attacher, ticket seller, and call-out operator as examples of suitable jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">In his written decision denying benefits, the ALJ found that Seever had the RFC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>to perform light work \u201cwhere there is no direct contact ... with co-workers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20A. The ALJ further found that while such an RFC precluded Seever from returning to his past relevant work as a carpenter, there were at least four types of jobs in the national economy that he could perform: picture framer; heel attacher; ticket seller; and call-out operator. After the Appeals Council denied review, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final decision of the Commissioner, Seever sought relief in the United States District Court. Unsuccessful, Seever filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">I. Standards of Administrative Procedure &amp; Judicial Review</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Disability insurance benefits are available to qualified individuals who are unable \u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). To determine whether a claimant is disabled, an ALJ must follow a five-step sequential evaluation process. <em>Grogan v. Barnhart, </em>399 F.3d 1257, 1261 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">At step one, the claimant must show that he is not presently engaged in substantial gainful activity; at step two that he has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments; at step three that the impairment is equivalent to a listed impairment; and, at step four, that the impairment or combination of impairments prevents him from performing his past work. If the claimant successfully meets his burden, the burden of proof shifts to the Commissioner at step five to show that the claimant retains sufficient residual functional capacity ... to perform work in the national economy, given his age, education, and work experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-10\"><em>Id. </em>(citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">We review the ALJ\u2019s decision only to determine whether the correct legal standards were applied and whether substantial evidence supports the factual findings. <em>Branum v. Barnhart, </em>385 F.3d 1268, 1270 (10th Cir.2004). Substantial evidence is relevant evidence that \u201ca reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Evidence is not substantial, however, if it is overwhelmed by other evidence in the record or if it is a mere scintilla. <em>Id.; Grogan, </em>399 F.3d at 1261-62. \u201cAlthough we do not reweigh the evidence or try the issues de novo, we meticulously examine the record as a whole, including anything that may undercut or detract from the ALJ\u2019s findings in order to determine if the substantiality test has been met.\u201d <em>Grogan, </em>399 F.3d at 1262 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">II. RFC</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">\n<em>A. The ALJ\u2019s Evidentiary Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">Seever argues that the ALJ considered only portions of Dr. Hickman\u2019s opinion and none of Dr. Hastings\u2019 opinion in determining RFC. Regarding Dr. Hickman, Seever claims that the ALJ ignored the doctor\u2019s medical source statement that Seever was (1) moderately limited in his abilities to appropriately interact with co-workers and respond to work pressures; and (2) slightly limited in his abilities to appropriately interact with the public and supervisors, respond to work changes, and to understand, remember and carry-out detailed instructions. An ALJ is not, however, required to discuss every piece of evidence. <em>See Hamlin v. Barnhart, </em>365 F.3d 1208, 1217 (10th Cir.2004). Rather, an ALJ must discuss the evidence supporting his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>decision, the uncontroverted evidence he chooses not to rely upon, and any significantly probative evidence he rejects. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Here, the ALJ wrote only one restriction into Seever\u2019s RFC to account for his mental limitations: no direct contact with co-workers. Although the ALJ did not specifically cite Dr. Hickman\u2019s medical source statement as being responsible for this restriction, the ALJ did mention the medical source statement during the administrative hearing. Further, Seever does not suggest how the restriction fails to suit his moderately limited ability to interact appropriately with co-workers. Indeed, as the medical source statement indicates, an individual with a \u201cmoderate\u201d limitation \u201cis still able to function satisfactorily.\u201d Aplt.App. at 374. We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s restriction on co-worker contact is supported by substantial evidence and that the ALJ\u2019s failure to attribute the restriction to Dr. Hickman\u2019s medical source statement was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">As for Seever\u2019s ability to handle work pressures, we note that during the disability hearing, the ALJ asked the VE to consider a moderately limited ability to interact with co-workers <em>and </em>to handle work pressures in determining what jobs Seever could perform in the national economy. <em>Id. </em>at 421-22. The VE listed picture framer, wood heel attacher, ticket seller, and call out operator\u2014the same jobs that the ALJ listed in his decision as being available to Seever. Consequently, the ALJ\u2019s failure to discuss in his written decision Dr. Hickman\u2019s work-pressures opinion was at most harmless error. <em>See Fischer-Ross v. Barnhart, </em>431 F.3d 729, 733-34 (10th Cir.2005) (recognizing that harmless error analysis is applicable if \u201cno reasonable administrative factfinder, following the correct analysis, could have resolved the factual matter in any other way\u201d (quotation omitted)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Regarding Dr. Hickman\u2019s opinion that Seever is slightly limited in his abilities to interact with the public and supervisors, process detailed instructions, and respond to work changes, Seever has not suggested how those limitations are sufficiently probative of RFC as to merit discussion by the ALJ. \u201cSlight\u201d limitations are defined on the medical source statement as \u201cmild,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe individual can generally function well.\u201d Aplt. App. at 374. This is partly consistent with Dr. Gibson\u2019s opinion on the mental status form, which the ALJ did mention, that Seever \u201cshould respond well to supervision\u201d and could complete tasks within his abilities. <em>Id. </em>at 303. We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s failure to discuss Dr. Hickman\u2019s opinion on slight limitations was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">Seever also notes that the ALJ did not mention Dr. Hickman\u2019s observation in the disability evaluation report that Seever\u2019s personality test score was shared by individuals who \u201care severely and chronically maladjusted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371. But the probative value of that test score is unclear, given Dr. Hickman\u2019s further observation that Seever \u201cwas presenting himself in a negative light and may have been over reporting his difficulties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, Dr. Hickman prepared the report either prior to, or contemporaneous with, his medical source statement, and was undoubtedly aware of the test score and possible \u201cover reporting\u201d when setting Seev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>er\u2019s limitations in the medical source statement. Although Dr. Hickman could have transferred Seever\u2019s test score onto the medical source statement form as a \u201cmarked\u201d or \u201cextreme\u201d limitation, indicating a severe or complete functional impediment, <em>id. </em>at 374, he did not. Instead, he set Seever\u2019s mental limitations at only slight and moderate levels, indicating an ability to function at least satisfactorily. We will not fault the ALJ for failing to discuss a test score that Dr. Hickman\u2014 the administering physician\u2014questioned and implicitly concluded would not prevent Seever from functioning satisfactorily.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Seever also argues that the ALJ erred in not mentioning Dr. Hastings\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation evaluation. Again, we discern no reversible error. Dr. Hastings\u2019 \u2019\u2019totally disabled\u201d finding was limited to whether Seever could resume heavy manual labor, such as carpentry. The ALJ\u2019s decision at step four, that Seever was unable to perform any past relevant work, mirrors Dr. Hastings\u2019 conclusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, whether a social security claimant is disabled is an issue reserved to the Commissioner. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">\n<em>B. The ALJ\u2019s RFC Determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Seever contends that \u201cthe evidence in this case convincingly establishes that the ALJ should have included a restriction relating to Mr. Seever\u2019s at least moderate limitations in dealing with work pressures in a normal work setting and/or some restriction relating to his limited learning, memory, and concentration capabilities.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. at 40. As noted above, the ALJ included a work-pressures restriction in his hypothetical to the VE, who listed the same jobs that the ALJ ultimately derived at step five. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s failure to include the restriction as part of his written RFC determination was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">As for Seever\u2019s mental capabilities, the ALJ cited Dr. Hickman\u2019s disability evaluation report and found that \u201chis attention span, concentration and memory were intact.\u201d ApltApp. at 16. This is an accurate summation of Dr. Hickman\u2019s observations in the section entitled \u201cAttention, Concentration, and Memory,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 370, and correlates with Dr. Hickman\u2019s opinion that Seever demonstrated \u201cnormal cognitive skills,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 372. The ALJ also found that Seever\u2019s depression caused only mild difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence or pace, and mild difficulties in daily activities, but moderate difficulties in social functioning. This is consistent with Dr. Hickman\u2019s medical source statement, the psychiatric consultant\u2019s review form, and Dr. Gibson\u2019s mental status form.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">Nevertheless, Seever maintains that some restriction should have been imposed because of (1) the symptoms he reported to Dr. Hickman, (2) the results of Dr. Hickman\u2019s tests showing severe anxiety and depression, \u201cseventh grade level scores in spelling and math, several low scores during memory testing ... [and] either marked or borderline learning disabilities,\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. at 42, and (3) Dr. Hickman\u2019s observation that Seever\u2019s surgeries, residual pain, and physical limitations \u201chave taxed his psychological coping abilities,\u201d ApltApp. at 372. But Dr. Hick<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>man interpreted this information as presenting no more than a slight impairment\u2014meaning that he could still function well\u2014as to understanding, remembering, and carrying out detailed instructions, and he declined to identify any other mental capabilities affected by Seever\u2019s depression. We will not fault the ALJ for failing to interpret Seever\u2019s symptoms and test results differently than Dr. Hickman. <em>See Winfrey v. Chater, </em>92 F.3d 1017, 1022 (10th Cir.1996) (observing that an ALJ may not substitute his lay opinion for a medical opinion); <em>Hamilton v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>961 F.2d 1495, 1500 (10th Cir.1992) (recognizing that this court may not reweigh evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Nor are we convinced that the ALJ should have included in the RFC a mental capabilities restriction because Seever \u201ccalled Dr. Hayes\u2019s office in tears [in November 2000] due to his level of pain and delay in obtaining surgical treatment,\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. at 40, was \u201cplaced on two different antidepressant medications\u201d in 2001, <em>id., </em>and was diagnosed by Dr. Hastings with a \u201c3% permanent impairment ... due to psychological overlay and clinical depression,\u201d Aplt.App. at 300. Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to not place a learning, memory, and concentration restriction in Seever\u2019s RFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b773-14\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\">. Seever argues that harmless error analysis cannot be invoked because the Commissioner did not argue it below. But we may employ that analysis for the first time where, as here, the record is not overly long or complex, harmlessness is not debatable, and reversal would result in futile and costly proceedings. <em>See Wyoming v. Livingston, </em>443 F.3d 1211, 1226 (10th Cir.2006); <em>see also Jenkins v. Nelson, </em>157 F.3d 485, 494 n. 1 (7th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\">. Additionally, Seever argues that two of Dr. Hastings' findings \"seem to conflict with a finding that Mr. Seever could perform the significant standing and walking required by light work.\u201d Aplt's Br. at 31. We do not reach this argument because it is conclusoxy, and it appears to be offered regarding Seever\u2019s reliance on unpublished authority, rather than the ALJ\u2019s discussion of the relevant medical evidence. <em>See Murrell v. Shalala, </em>43 F.3d 1388, 1389 n. 2 (10th Cir.1994) (stating that \"perfunctory complaints,\u201d not adequately framed or developed, are insufficient to invoke appellate review).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
