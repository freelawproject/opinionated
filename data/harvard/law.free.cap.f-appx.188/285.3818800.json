Desalme was resentenced to a term of imprisonment of 160 months to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-18\">Desalme had filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion which resulted in an order that he be resentenced. Desalme argues, based on the principle of res judicata, that the district court erred at resentencing in reconsidering and denying him an adjustment of his offense level for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-23\">Desalme\u2019s argument is without merit. Res judicata is applicable only if \u201cthe first action concluded with a final judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>The Proctor &amp; Gamble Company v. Amway Corporation, </em>376 F.3d 496, 499 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotations and citation omitted). When a \u00a7 2255 movant challenges his conviction and sentence, he no longer has a legitimate expectation of finality in the original sentence. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>114 F.3d 46, 47-48 (5th Cir.1997). In the absence of a final judgment incorporating Desalme\u2019s sentence, his res judicata argument is without merit. The sentence imposed is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b309-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
