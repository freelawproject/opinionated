Bradford, East Baton Rouge Parish Prison inmate # 100094, appeals from the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit, alleging claims of kidnaping, false imprisonment, and illegal arrest. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. Under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) <em>&amp; </em>(2), a district court is to review a prisoner\u2019s complaint and to dismiss the complaint if it \u201cis frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted\u201d or if it \u201cseeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d \u00a7 1915A(b)(l)(2). This court reviews dismissals under \u00a7 1915A <em>de novo. See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The district court did not err in dismissing Bradford\u2019s claims against Judge Hernandez on grounds of absolute judicial immunity because the alleged acts of Judge Hernandez were judicial in nature and were not taken in the complete absence of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Ballard v. Wall, </em>413 F.3d 510, 515-17 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 11-12, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991); <em>Malina v. Gonzales, </em>994 F.2d 1121, 1124-25 (5th Cir.1993). Nor did the district court err in dismissing Bradford\u2019s claims against Peterson because her alleged acts were in furtherance of the prosecution of the case. <em>See Brooks v. George County, Miss., </em>84 F.3d 157, 168 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 430-31, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">Because it was apparent from the face of Bradford\u2019s complaint that his claims against Mixon are time-barred, the district court\u2019s dismissal of those claims under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) was appropriate. <em>See Gonzales v. Wyatt, </em>157 F.3d 1016, 1019-20 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
