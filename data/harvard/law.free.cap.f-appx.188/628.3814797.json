He argues that his due process right to confrontation was violated by the admission of hearsay evidence at his revocation hearing and that the district court plainly erred in allowing the prosecutor to discuss an ongoing investigation in another jurisdiction during sentencing. We find Smith\u2019s arguments without merit and affirm the district court\u2019s revocation of his supervised release and resulting sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">\u201c[A] due process standard is used to determine whether hearsay evidence admitted during revocation proceedings violates a defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Hall, </em>419 F.3d 980, 985 (9th Cir.2005). Where a releasee\u2019s right to confrontation is implicated, the court must employ the <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972), balancing test\u2014weighing the releasee\u2019s \u201cright to confrontation against the Government\u2019s good cause for denying it.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>984 F.2d 308, 310 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Appellant had the opportunity to confront Robin Brown, the source of the hearsay in Probation Officer Corniel\u2019s testimony, the district court\u2019s failure to undertake <em>Morrissey </em>balancing was harmless. Similarly, even without HUD Agent Grillo\u2019s testimony about Baldenegro\u2019s admissions, there was sufficient non-hearsay evidence to support the court\u2019s finding that Appellant had violated the terms of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"AGB\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">The prosecution made improper comments about an ongoing investigation in Texas into potential mortgage fraud by Appellant. Objection to it was not raised before the district court. We find no plain error because the record is clear that the district court recognized that it should not consider the prosecutor\u2019s statement in determining Appellant\u2019s sentence. Although we find the prosecutor\u2019s comments inappropriate, the district court clearly did not take them into account. <em>Cf. United States v. Caperell, </em>938 F.2d 975, 980 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s revocation of Smith\u2019s supervised release and the sentence imposed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b653-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
