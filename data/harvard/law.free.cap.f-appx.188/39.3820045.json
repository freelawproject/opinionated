Jankun\u2019s decision ordering Liu\u2019s removal to China and denying her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) relief. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-20\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 158 (2d Cir.2004). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Cir.2004). Nevertheless, \u201cthe fact that the [agency] has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application cannot insulate the decision from review.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). An adverse credibility determination must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus\u201d to the finding. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">In this case, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. IJ Jankun stated that Liu \u201cdid not answer the questions she was asked but repeated [] answer[s] she\u2019d given to [] previous question[s],\u201d and concluded that her testimony sounded \u201crote,\u201d and like \u201ca story that she had memorized rather than what actually had occurred to her.\u201d Indeed, the transcript of the hearing indicates that Liu failed to appropriately respond to questions she had been asked in regard to (1) when her first IUD had been removed, (2) whether or not she was alone when she had been taken to the hospital for an abortion, and (3) how she had been taken from the family planning office to the hospital. The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding based upon his assessment of Liu\u2019s demeanor is, therefore, supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 400-02 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The IJ also properly relied on the difference between Liu\u2019s assertion that Chinese officials had issued her a sterilization and abortion certificate and the 1998 Department of State Profile which indicates that U.S. Embassy and Consulates General are \u201cunaware of any so-called abortion certificates,\u201d and that the only document that could resemble such a certificate was \u201ca document issued by hospitals upon a patient\u2019s request after a voluntary abortion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The IJ determined that Liu\u2019s assertion that she had been forced to have an IUD inserted after the birth of her youngest daughter (which Chinese officials assumed was her first child) was inherently implausible. The 1998 Profile indicates that the \u201cuse of the IUD appears to be urged only for families who have already had two children,\u201d and that a \u201csecond child is allowed if the first is a girl.\u201d The IJ\u2019s determination was, supported by evidence that is reasonable, substantial, and probative when considered in fight of the record as a whole. See <em>Jin Chen v. DOJ, </em>426 F.3d 104, 113 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Because the only evidence of a threat to Liu\u2019s fife or freedom depended upon her credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on the claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003). Furthermore, Liu failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief in her brief to the BIA. This Court, therefore, lacks jurisdiction over the CAT claim, because the claim is unexhausted. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d) (\u201cA court may review a final order of removal only if ... (1) the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Accordingly, Liu\u2019s petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
