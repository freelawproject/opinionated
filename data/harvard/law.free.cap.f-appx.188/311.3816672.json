As to his asylum application, Siddiqi seeks to challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that his application was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). This court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that Siddiqi\u2019s asylum application was untimely. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(3). The petition for review is thus DISMISSED as to the asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Siddiqi argues that the BIA erred in denying his application for withholding of removal. Siddiqi fails to demonstrate that the alleged isolated incidents of mistreatment or his status as a young, male Muhajir establish a \u201cclear probability\u201d that he would be persecuted upon his return to Pakistan. This court has held that similar allegations of mistreatment do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See, e.g., Abdel-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 584 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Fleurinor v. INS, </em>585 F.2d 129, 132 (5th Cir.1978). Because the immigration judge\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence and the evidence does not compel a contrary conclusion, the petition for review is DENIED. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-14\">Siddiqi does not brief the BIA\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT. Accordingly, Siddiqi has waived the claim. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-15\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
