(OGA). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(d) &amp; 1291, and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b724-18\">Millikan was the president and a shareholder of Energy Title Consultants, Inc. (ETC). ETC operated check-cashing stores at which customers could purchase OGA money orders, among other transactions. Pursuant to a contract with OGA, ETC collected and remitted to OGA the proceeds from money order sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-19\">ETC\u2019s principal bank account was with Arvest State Bank. ETC did not open a separate account for OGA\u2019s funds; instead, ETC deposited funds into its regular account, and Arvest then remitted OGA\u2019s funds to it via electronic drafts on ETC\u2019s account. OGA was aware of ETC\u2019s procedure, and the parties operated in this manner for more than three years. A problem arose, however, when Arvest, who was also a creditor of ETC, sought to satisfy ETC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>obligations to it by freezing all of ETC\u2019s funds on deposit and closing ETC\u2019s account. Unfortunately, the seized funds included $515,545.09 in OGA money order funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">ETC and Millikan both filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. OGA brought an adversary proceeding in Millikan\u2019s case under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(4), which excepts from discharge debts that result from \u201cfraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny.\u201d After a two-day trial, the bankruptcy court held that the money order proceeds were trust funds and that ETC owed OGA a fiduciary duty in connection with collecting and remitting those funds. It further held that ETC\u2019s failure to avoid commingling the money order proceeds with its own funds and its failure to remit the full proceeds to OGA constituted defalcation. Finding that Millikan, as president of ETC, was personally liable for the defalcation, the bankruptcy court then denied discharge of the debt under \u00a7 523(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Millikan filed a motion to amend the court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and to alter or amend the judgment, which the bankruptcy court denied. Millikan then appealed to the district court. Affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, the district court held that ETC was negligent in performing its duty to protect OGA\u2019s funds, and that ETC\u2019s conduct constituted defalcation. It also held that Millikan, as ETC\u2019s president, was liable for the corporation\u2019s defalcation. Millikan now appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The parties have conceded \u00a7 523(a)(4)\u2019s fiduciary capacity requirement, so the sole issue on appeal is whether ETC\u2019s loss of OGA\u2019s funds constitutes \u201cdefalcation\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(4). This is a question of law, and as such it is reviewed de novo. <em>See Fowler Bros. v. Young (In re Young), </em>91 F.3d 1367, 1373 (10th Cir.1996). \u201c[E]xceptions to discharge are to be narrowly construed, and because of the fresh start objectives of bankruptcy, doubt is to be resolved in the debtor\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Bellco First Fed. Credit Union v. Raspar (In re Kaspar), </em>125 F.3d 1358, 1361 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">Millikan asserts that neither he nor ETC took, used, diverted, converted, or otherwise misappropriated OGA\u2019s proceeds, and he points out that he fully accounted for the monies\u2014they simply were not available to OGA because of Ar-vest\u2019s actions. He urges us to adopt the standard set forth in <em>Rutanen v. Baylis (In re Baylis), </em>313 F.3d 9, 18-19 (1st Cir.2002), in which the First Circuit held that \u201ca defalcation requires some degree of fault, closer to fraud, without the necessity of meeting a strict specific intent requirement,\u201d and to find that there was no defalcation. In the alternative, he argues that the district court and the bankruptcy court misapplied <em>Antlers Roof-Truss &amp; Builders Supply v. Storie (In re Storie), </em>216 B.R. 283, 288 (10th Cir.BAP1997), in which this circuit\u2019s Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP) held that \u201c\u2018defalcation\u2019 under section 523(a)(4) is a fiduciary-debtor\u2019s failure to account for funds that have been entrusted to it due to any breach of a fiduciary duty, whether intentional, wilful, reckless, or negligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">The statute does not define defalcation, and this court has not yet defined the term. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>provides two modern definitions: (1) \u201cembezzlement,\u201d and (2) \u201c[ljoosely, the failure to meet an obligation; a non-fraudulent default.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>448 (8th ed. 2004). In this context, though, \u201cdefalcation\u201d must mean something other than \u201cembezzlement,\u201d as \u00a7 523(a)(4) separately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>references embezzlement. <em>Black\u2019s </em>second definition, however, is rather broad; \u201ca non-fraudulent default\u201d may range from entirely innocent conduct to conduct closely approaching fraud. This potential range of meaning is reflected by the opinions of other circuit courts, which have established varying levels of culpability for finding a defalcation under \u00a7 523(a)(4). <em>See, e.g., Baylis, </em>313 F.3d at 20 (requiring \u201csomething close to a showing of extreme recklessness\u201d); <em>Republic of Rwanda v. Uwimana (In re Uwimana), </em>274 F.3d 806, 811 (4th Cir.2001) (holding even an innocent mistake can constitute defalcation); <em>Banks v. Gill Distrib. Ctrs., Inc. (In re Banks), </em>263 F.3d 862, 870 (9th Cir.2001) (same); <em>Office of Thrift Supervision v. Felt (In re Felt), </em>255 F.3d 220, 226 (5th Cir.2001) (requiring willful conduct, described as \u201cessentially a recklessness standard\u201d) (quotation omitted); <em>Carlisle Cashway, Inc. v. Johnson (In re Johnson), </em>691 F.2d 249, 257 (6th Cir.1982) (holding, in connection with \u00a7 523(a)(4)\u2019s predecessor statute, that subjective intent to violate fiduciary duty or bad faith is irrelevant, but indicating that negligence or mistake of fact would not support finding defalcation); <em>Cent. Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Herbst, </em>93 F.2d 510, 512 (2d Cir.1937) (holding that defalcation is different than fraud and embezzlement, but assuming that it requires \u201csome portion of misconduct\u201d); <em>see also Meyer v. Rigdon, </em>36 F.3d 1375, 1384-85 (7th Cir.1994) (holding that a negligent breach of duty was not sufficient to establish a defalcation under \u00a7 523(a)(ll), relating to fiduciary for depository institution or insured credit union).</p>\n<p id=\"A-R\">We need not reconcile those authorities\u2019 definitions of \u201cdefalcation.\u201d \u201cDefalcation\u201d requires, at least, \u201csome portion of misconduct.\u201d <em>Cent. Hanover Bank, </em>93 F.2d at 512. We conclude that the district court did not err in holding that, in these circumstances, there was a defalcation for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(4). OGA\u2019s funds ultimately went to satisfy ETC\u2019s debt to Ar-vest Bank. Those funds were susceptible to seizure by Arvest because ETC and Millikan deposited them in ETC\u2019s general bank account, in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 6, \u00a7 2123(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">In essence, when ETC failed to establish a separate bank account for the money order proceeds and designate that account as a <em>trust account </em>that Arvest did not have the right to setoff against, it was <em>consenting </em>to allow Arvest to pay itself with trust funds.... The effect is the same as if ETC had written Arvest a check for $515,545.09 and left the trust account short by that amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">R. Doc. 39 at 9. ETC, and Millikan as its president, are chargeable with knowledge of ETC\u2019s legal duties, including its statutory duty not to commingle funds. <em>See In re Felt, </em>255 F.3d at 226; <em>In re Johnson, </em>691 F.2d at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Millikan strenuously argues that he did not misapply OGA\u2019s funds or use them for his own or ETC\u2019s purposes. Effectively, though, the funds benefitted ETC by paying its obligation to Arvest Bank. Millikan also asserts that commingling is a red herring, and that Arvest would have seized all the funds in ETC\u2019s account whether or not it included any funds other than OGA money order funds. This is exactly the problem\u2014contrary to its statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>tory duty, ETC made OGA\u2019s funds available for seizure by placing them in its general account. Finally, we reject Millikan\u2019s argument that OGA\u2019s consent to ETC\u2019s arrangements negated ETC\u2019s obligation to comply with its statutory duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Appellee\u2019s motion for leave to file supplement of authorities is GRANTED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b724-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-4\">. Okla.
