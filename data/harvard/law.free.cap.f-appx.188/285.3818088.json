Juarez asserts that his prior California conviction for burglary under California Penal Code \u00a7 459 is not a crime of violence, as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, and that, as a result, the district court erred in assessing a 16-level crime of violence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Juarez\u2019s prior California conviction for burglary is the equivalent to the enumerated crime of violence offense of burglary of a dwelling. <em>See United States v. Murillo-Lopez, </em>444 F.3d 337, 344-45 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) 16-level crime of violence enhancement. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Juarez also contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Juarez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Juarez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
