International Rectifier Corporation opposes. IXYS replies. We consider whether the case should be remanded to allow the district court to reconsider its order entering a permanent injunction in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1837, 164 L.Ed.2d 641 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-19\">We note that, after the district court\u2019s issuance of the permanent injunction, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>eBay Inc. v. MercExchange L.L.C., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1837, 164 L.Ed.2d 641 (2006). The Supreme Court held that a district court must consider the traditional equitable factors when deciding whether to issue a permanent injunction. <em>Id. </em>at 1839-41. Here, on page 3 of its order providing findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding injunctive relief, the district court held that \u201c[o]nce infringement and validity have been established, irreparable harm is presumed.\u201d The district court\u2019s holding and other determinations may need to be revisited in light of <em>eBay. </em>Thus, we deem the more judicially efficient course, because no briefs have been filed, is to vacate the injunction and judgment and remand for further proceedings, as appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-23\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-24\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-25\">(1) The district court\u2019s injunction and judgment are vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings as appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-26\">(2) The motion is denied as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
