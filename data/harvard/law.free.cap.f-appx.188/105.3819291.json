Henderson, a former employee of Florence Mining, benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-945. For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Because we write primarily for the parties, we will recite only as much of the factual and procedural history of this case as is helpful to our brief discussion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ found that although the x-ray evidence did not establish the existence of pneumoconiosis by a preponderance of the evidence pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(1), the weight of the medical opinion evidence established the existence of both clinical and legal pneumoconiosis, <em>see </em>n. 2, <em>infra., </em>pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(4). That regulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmM\">A determination of the existence of pneumoconiosis may also be made if a physician, exercising sound medical judgment, notwithstanding a negative X-ray, finds that the miner suffers or suffered from pneumoconiosis as defined in \u00a7 718.201.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Any such finding shall be based on objective medical evidence such as blood-gas studies, electrocardiograms, pulmonary function tests, physical examination, and medical and work histories. Such a finding shall be supported by a reasoned medical opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av\">In concluding that the weight of the medical evidence established the existence of pneumoconiosis, the ALJ considered the medical opinions of three physicians. Dr. Vijay Malhotra, a board-certified internist, who performed an evaluation on behalf of the Department of Labor, opined that although Henderson\u2019s chest x-ray was negative for pneumoconiosis, he suffers from industrial bronchitis due to coal dust exposure. Dr. John Schaff, a board certified pulmonologist and internist, who performed an evaluation on behalf of Henderson, opined that Henderson\u2019s chest x-ray was positive for clinical pneumoconiosis and that Henderson also suffers from chronic bronchitis due to coal dust exposure. Dr. Robert Piekerill, a board certified pulmonologist, who performed an evaluation on behalf of Florence Mining, opined that Henderson\u2019s chest x-ray was negative for pneumoconiosis and that he suffers from chronic obstructive bronchial asthma unrelated to his coal mine employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The ALJ concluded that while Dr. Pickerill\u2019s opinion was documented and reasoned, Dr. Schaff s opinion better explained that Henderson\u2019s symptoms of coughing and wheezing with pulmonary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>obstruction and restriction were not due to asthma, as Dr. Pickerill opined. Rather, those symptoms resulted from coal dust exposure. Dr. Schaff convincingly explained how his diagnosis was supported by Henderson\u2019s history of at least sixteen years of coal mine employment, symptoms, pulmonary function abnormalities, and reduced diffusing capacity. The ALJ also found that Dr. Schaff s diagnosis of coal dust related chronic bronchitis was corroborated by Dr. Malhotra\u2019s diagnosis of industrial bronchitis due to coal dust exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In its petition for review, Florence Mining argues that the opinions of Drs. Schall and Malhotra were unreasoned and, therefore, could not be relied upon by the ALJ. Essentially, Florence Mining contends that the ALJ should have relied upon Dr. Pickerill\u2019s opinion and found that Henderson did not prove the existence of pneumoconiosis. We disagree. The ALJ was faced with three physicians giving different opinions regarding the cause of Henderson\u2019s pulmonary disability. The ALJ carefully reviewed the findings and opinions of each physician and made determinations of credibility and weight. That is precisely what he is required to do. As we said in <em>Kertesz v. Crescent Hills Coal Co., </em>788 F.2d 158 (3d Cir.1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">In reaching a decision, an ALJ should set out and discuss the pertinent medical evidence presented. The ALJ is not bound to accept the opinion or theory of any medical expert, but may weigh the medical evidence and draw its own inferences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 163 (citations omitted). Accordingly, the ALJ was acting well within his discretion in crediting the opinions of Drs. Schaff and Malhotra over the opinion of Dr. Pickerill.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Florence Mining also argues that Dr. Schaff s reliance on his own chest x-ray to diagnose clinical pneumoconiosis, when all of the x-ray evidence taken together did not merit a positive finding pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(1), \u201cshould have been deemed error, thus negating the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Schall found clinical pneumoconiosis.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 19. However, this argument is the proverbial \u201cred-herring.\u201d Dr. Schaff also opined that Henderson suffered from chronic or industrial bronchitis arising from coal dust exposure. Moreover, Dr. Schaff s opinion in this regard was corroborated by the opinion of Dr. Malhorta. Therefore, the ALJ\u2019s finding that Henderson established the existence of legal pneumoconiosis in the form of chronic or industrial bronchitis makes Henderson eligible for benefits even if he does not suffer from clinical pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">For the above reasons, we hold that the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\">. In <em>Mancia v. Director, OWCP, </em>130 F.3d 579 (3d Cir.1997), we explained our standard of review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">The [BRB] is bound by the ALJ's findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence. Our review of the [BRB's] decision is limited to a determination of whether an error of law has been committed and whether the [BRB] has adhered to its scope of review. In doing so, we must independently review the record and decide whether the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence has been defined as more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 584 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b130-11\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201 defines pneumoconiosis as \u201ca chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae, including respiratory and pulmonary impairments arising out of coal mine employment. This definition includes both medical, or 'clinical', pneumoconiosis and statutory, or \u2018legal\u2019, pneumoconiosis.\u201d \u201cThe statutory definition of pneumoconiosis (i.e., any lung disease that is significantly related to, or substantially aggravated by, dust exposure in coal mine employment) is much broader than the medical definition, which only encompasses lung disease caused by fibrotic reaction of lung tissue to inhaled dust.\u201d <em>Mancia v.
