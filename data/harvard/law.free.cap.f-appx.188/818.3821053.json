The district court granted Track\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based upon the lack of standing by Access and Wilder to pursue injunctive and declaratory relief under Rule 12(b)(1), Fed.R.Civ.P. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-17\">We have carefully reviewed the record and considered the briefs and the oral arguments of the parties. Based thereupon, we find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that, as Wilder lacked the requisite concrete and specific intent to return to the Track because he could not demonstrate that there was any reasonable chance of his revisiting the Track, other than \u201csomeday,\u201d he was not entitled to injunctive relief. We also find no error in the district court\u2019s ruling that, because Wilder also failed to prove a threat of future injury, he lacked standing to seek declaratory relief as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-18\">As Access\u2019 standing was dependent upon Wilder\u2019s standing, Access lacked standing to pursue injunctive and declaratory relief in the district court as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-19\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b842-21\">BARKETT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AZL\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b842-22\">Because standing under the ADA does not depend upon a plaintiffs prediction of a specific date of return to allegedly non-compliant facilities, I would reverse the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(1) dismissal of Doug Wilder\u2019s complaint. Wilder simply had to demonstrate that his return to Associated\u2019s facilities was likely, and not merely speculative. The record overwhelmingly confirms that Wilder made the showing necessary under the precedents of both the Supreme Court and this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-23\">The district court concluded that \u201cPlaintiffs evidence is speculative and establishes only \u2018someday\u2019 intentions of returning to the Track,\u201d and is therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>\u201cinadequate under <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992).\u201d <em>Lujan </em>explains that \u201cthe irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal citations and quotation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no question that Wilder satisfied the first two elements, and that the district court\u2019s ruling was based on Wilder\u2019s failure under the third prong to show that \u201cit [is] likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the [alleged] injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The facts of <em>Lujan </em>illuminate what \u201cspeculative\u201d means for the purpose of Article III standing. That case was brought under the Endangered Species Act by one plaintiff who sued to enjoin the rehabilitation of the Aswan High Dam because of endangered Nile crocodiles, and another who sued to protect various species in Sri Lanka. The first plaintiff had traveled to Egypt only once, in 1986; the second traveled to Sri Lanka only once, in 1981. Except for a generalized wish to return to Egypt and Sri Lanka \u201cin the future\u201d\u2014 those, apparently, were their exact words\u2014neither plaintiff offered any indication when they would next visit the environmental treasures they hoped to rescue. <em>Id. </em>at 563-64, 112 S.Ct. 2130. The Supreme Court held that \u201csuch \u2018some day\u2019 intentions\u2014without any description of concrete plans, or indeed even any specification of when the some day will be\u2014do not support a finding of the \u2018actual or imminent\u2019 injury that our cases require.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Despite structural barriers allegedly in violation of the ADA, Wilder, who has muscular dystrophy and is confined to a wheelchair, nonetheless professes a desire to revisit Associated\u2019s Tampa Greyhound Track. Wilder\u2019s unrebutted testimony reflected that he traveled to the Track six or eight times per year for the last three years. Because these trips are usually \u201cspontaneous,\u201d \u201cthere [was] no set date\u201d for his next visit when this case was before the district court. Even so, his interrogatory answers signaled an intent to visit the track over Christmas vacation, and in March, May, June, and July of 2005. Dis. Ct. DK. 54 interr. answers p. 4. Wilder testified that possible visits were also being contemplated for Father\u2019s Day and Thanksgiving. Dis. Ct. DK. 39, T. 167 \u00b6\u00b6 3-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">Even if Wilder had not expressed an intention to visit the track on Father\u2019s Day or next Thanksgiving, there can be no question that he gave adequate \u201cspecification of when the \u2018some day\u2019 will be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Wilder\u2019s professed intention to return to the Track in certain months and during certain vacations is clearly adequate to confer standing if, as the language above suggests, merely stating when \u201csome day\u201d might be could have conferred standing on the plaintiffs in <em>Lujan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">Whereas the <em>Lujan </em>plaintiffs were onetime visitors to far-flung places, Wilder has visited the Track between 18 and 24 times in the past three years. Given this track record, so to speak, we cannot fath<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>om how or why Wilder has failed to \u201callege[ ] facts giving rise to an inference that he will suffer future disability discrimination by the defendant.\u201d <em>Shotz v. Cates, </em>256 F.3d 1077, 1081 (11th Cir.2001). In the absence of a change in circumstance material to the plaintiffs future attendance at a particular facility, such recent and consistent use of the facility, wholly uncontested by defendants as a factual matter, leaves practically no reason why Wilder should have had to provide a \u201cset date\u201d and \u201cconcrete plans\u201d for his return. Wilder\u2019s recent and frequent use of the Track makes his intent to return credible <em>on that basis alone. As </em>the Supreme Court has said, evidence of past wrongs bears strongly on \u201cwhether there is a real and immediate threat of repeated injury.\u201d <em>City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 102, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Especially in the disability context, a \u201cspecific-date/set-plans\u201d standard would produce patently absurd results, and would almost certainly place plaintiffs in a Catch-22 so far as their credibility is concerned. To have standing under the ADA, is a wheelchair-bound individual who consistently but unpredictably frequents a particular Burger King required to predict the very day on which he will next crave a Whopper?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Circuit has already held that the disabled need not plan their lives in such minute detail and with such vast forethought in order to invoke the ADA\u2019s protection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For example, the plaintiff in <em>Stevens v. Premier, </em>215 F.3d 1237 (11th Cir.2000) intended to reuse the facility at issue (a cruise ship) only if it was altered to comply with the ADA. Obviously the timing of such compliance could not be predicted\u2014and was, indeed, extremely speculative to the extent that it depended on the result of the litigation itself. Nonetheless, we held that a proposed amended complaint alleging Stevens\u2019 intention to use the facility \u201cin the near future\u201d \u201cwould have cured the original complaint\u2019s failure to plead standing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1239.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">Our decision in <em>Stevens </em>cannot be squared with its resolution of the present case. If Stevens, who only once used defendant\u2019s facilities, could have \u201ccured\u201d his standing problem by simply affirming his intent to do so again \u201cin the near future,\u201d Wilder clearly had no standing problem to begin with. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-6\">. \"First, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact\u2014an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, ... and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical, ... Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of\u2014 the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.... Third, it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-5\">. <em>See Clark v. Burger King, </em>255 F.Supp.2d. 334 (D.N.J.2003) (\"Based on Clark\u2019s prior visits to Burger King restaurants, and his intent to return to these restaurants, we find that Clark has demonstrated a real and immediate threat of future injury, and has thus, satisfied the injury in fact requirement.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b844-6\">. The trial court bemoaned that \"Wilder could not even recall the date of his visit to the Track that led him to file the complaint in this case.\u201d If anything, this \"inability\u201d only confirms the absurdity of requiring Wilder to name specific dates and formulate concrete plans regarding his <em>future </em>visits to the facility. Attending a dog track, like eating at a fast-food joint, does not require and usually does not entail such intensive preparation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b844-12\">. The district courts of our Circuit have relied upon this precedent. <em>See, e.g., Access Now, Inc. v. S. Fla. Stadium Corp., </em>161 F.Supp.2d 1357, 1363-66 (S.D.Fla.2001) (finding injury-in-fact where individual plaintiff stated, without naming any specific dates, that he \"used to regularly attend games\u201d at Miami\u2019s Pro-player Stadium and \"would return, particularly if the alleged barriers are removed\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
