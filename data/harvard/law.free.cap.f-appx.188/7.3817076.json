The Honorable Kenneth M.

We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-17\">1. <em>The Withholding of Removal Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-18\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). We review the IJ\u2019s factual determinations for substantial evidence, <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. United States INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), and his legal determinations <em>de novo, see Islami v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 396 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-20\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must show that it is more likely than not that his or her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). Alternatively, if the applicant can demonstrate past persecution on one of the above statutory grounds, then eligibility for withholding of removal is presumed, subject to rebuttal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 306 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-21\">In this case, the IJ concluded that petitioners had not carried this burden because they established only a personal familial dispute that did not, in fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>demonstrate religious persecution. To the extent petitioners challenge the IJ\u2019s conclusion about the religious basis for the alleged persecution, we need not address that issue on this appeal. For the threats or actions of private persons, whatever their basis, to support relief from removal, an applicant must show that the government has proved unwilling or unable to control those private actors. <em>See Ivanishvili v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 342 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Setiadi v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 710 (8th Cir.2006). That is not this case. All the alleged harm was committed by private, non-governmental actors, specifically, Sushma Madhani\u2019s relatives and members of a Hindu extremist group acting at their behest. Jamal Madhani conceded that the actions of these private persons were never reported to government authorities. To the extent he attempts to justify this inaction by claiming that government officials would have accepted bribes from his wife\u2019s family to ignore such complaints, we can hardly conclude from such speculative evidence that a reasonable fact-finder would have been compelled to find that the complained-of actions reached beyond a personal dispute. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. United States INS, </em>386 F.3d at 74; <em>cf. Jian Xing Huang v. United States INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005) (rejecting speculative 10 evidence of feared future persecution). Accordingly, we decline to review further the denials of petitioners\u2019 applications for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">2. <em>Motion to Reopen</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, which may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) <em>(per </em>curiam). That is not this case. The BIA based its denial of the motion to reopen on the same reasoning specified by the IJ, finding that the Madhanis\u2019 alleged persecution was a \u201cpurely personal matter[ ],\u201d a conclusion supported by the record. Further, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that, because petitioners\u2019 claims were insufficient to qualify for withholding of removal, they necessarily could not show prejudice from alleged attorney misconduct. <em>See Esposito v. INS, </em>987 F.2d 108, 111 (2d Cir.1993) <em>(per </em>curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b32-22\">. Because the Madhanis failed to pursue their CAT claims before this court, we deem those claims waived and will not address them in this order. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
