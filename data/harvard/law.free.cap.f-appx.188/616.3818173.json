The petitioner\u2019s testimony was unworthy of belief, but in declaring it impossible to decide nationality, the IJ disregarded documentary and other evidence tending to show that in all probability she was, in fact, a refugee from Tibet. After making a finding of nationality, the Board should proceed to a decision on the merits of her claim. VACATED and REMANDED. It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b640-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
