KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b731-21\">Defendant-Appellant Orlando Jose Garcia pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). He was sentenced to 180 months imprisonment under the Armed Career Criminal provisions in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (\u201cArmed Career Criminal Act\u201d or \u201cACCA\u201d) and U.S.S.G \u00a7 4B1.4. On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in imposing his sentence because (1) the maximum sentence for the crimes he pled guilty to was ten years, (2) he was not indicted for a violation of \u00a7 924(e), (3) the government\u2019s notice of intent to seek an enhancement was defective, (4) the government\u2019s list of his prior convictions was different than that of the probation department (resulting in two sets of prior convictions), and (5) the judgment does not refer to the ACCA. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-22\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b731-23\">The parties are familiar with the facts leading to Mr. Garcia\u2019s arrest, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>repeat here only those necessary to our disposition. During a traffic stop of a vehicle in which Mr. Garcia was a passenger, officers recovered a loaded Smith and Wesson .357 revolver. A federal grand jury indicted him on three counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. Mr. Garcia pled guilty to one count with a maximum penalty of ten years, but fifteen years if he was determined to be an armed career criminal. Doc. 24 at 2, K 4(a), at 3, U 6(d). He was so advised, and reserved his right to appeal any sentence imposed under the ACCA. V R. at 8-9, 11-12; Doc. 24 at 3,116(d). The government filed a notice of its intention to seek an enhanced sentence pursuant to the ACCA, but mistakenly cited 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), rather than \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The Pre-Sentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) determined that Mr. Garcia was an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), based on past convictions for residential burglary, aggravated burglary and escape from jail. Mr. Garcia objected to the PSR under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), arguing against a Guidelines sentence under the ACCA. He also took issue with the felonies relied upon and argued that some of the violent felonies were not sufficiently distinguished from one another to be separate. He further objected to not being charged under \u00a7 924(e) by indictment, and to the government\u2019s notice which mistakenly identified \u00a7 924(c), rather than \u00a7 924(e). The district court determined that Mr. Garcia was an armed career criminal based on five prior convictions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I R. Doc. 41 at 1-2; IV R. 9-10, and enhanced his sentence accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">We review a sentencing enhancement under the ACCA de novo. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>401 F.3d 1220, 1224 (10th Cir.2005). As Mr. Garcia concedes, this court has held <em>post-Booker </em>that the existence and classification of prior convictions used to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence need not be charged in the indictment and submitted to a jury. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[W]e are bound by existing precedent to hold that the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>exception to the rule announced in <em>Apprendi </em>and extended to the Guidelines in <em>Booker </em>remains good law.... We therefore conclude that the government need not charge the \u2018fact\u2019 of a prior conviction in an indictment and submit it to a jury.\u201d); <em>United States v. Small, </em>423 F.3d 1164, 1188 (10th Cir.2005) (holding that the district court\u2019s career offender findings under \u00a7 4B1.1 did not implicate the Sixth Amendment, and that \u201cwhether the present offense and prior offenses constitute felonies that are crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses are questions of law unaffected by the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Booker\u201d). </em>We have adhered to this position. <em>United States v. Michel, </em>446 F.3d 1122, 1132-33 (10th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we reject Mr. Garcia\u2019s arguments premised on a need to indict him under \u00a7 924(e) and specify the pertinent felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Mr. Garcia\u2019s argument that he received insufficient notice about the ACCA enhancement is also unpersuasive. Procedural due process requires only reasonable notice of, and an opportunity to be heard, concerning the prior convictions. <em>See Oyler v. Boles, </em>368 U.S. 448, 452, 82 S.Ct. 501, 7 L.Ed.2d 446 (1962) (\u201cNevertheless, a defendant must receive reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard relative to the recidivist charge even if due process does not require that notice be given prior to the trial on the substantive offense.\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Gregg, </em>803 F.2d 568, 570 (10th Cir.1986) (noting that ACCA does \u201cnot prescribe any specific method of alleging ... prior convictions\u201d in pursuit of enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Here, Mr. Garcia\u2019s received actual notice of the possibility of an ACCA enhancement in a reasonable time, and he had an opportunity to be heard concerning that status. <em>See </em>III R. at 12 (government represents it provided notice prior to the plea); Doc. 24 at 2-3 (plea agreement); V R. at 8-9 (Mr. Garcia informed at change of plea hearing); II R. 1126(PSR); III R. at 16 (sentencing hearing). Moreover, the addendum to the PSR\u2019s failure to include one of Mr. Garcia\u2019s five prior convictions did not render notice inadequate. The addendum and the court\u2019s order contained at least three of the same qualifying convictions and Mr. Garcia had more than enough time between his receipt of the PSR and the sentencing hearing to make the appropriate objections. Mr. Garcia does not explain how any of these convictions would not qualify under the current state of the law. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>447 F.3d 1300, 1302-06 (10th Cir.2006). Finally, the district court\u2019s failure to include a reference to the ACCA in its final judgment does not render the judgment illegal. The judgment pronounced the sentence imposed. We can find no requirement that a judgment reflect any applied enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b731-24\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-5\">. The ACCA mandates that a defendant who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and has \u201cthree previous convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for a violent felony ... shall be ... imprisoned not less than fifteen years.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Section 4B1.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines defines those subject to enhancement under the ACCA as \"armed career criminal[s]\u201d and likewise provides for an enhanced sentencing offense level and criminal history category. The three prior convictions must arise from separate criminal transactions. <em>United States v. Michel, </em>446 F.3d 1122, 1133-35 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
