Copeland appeals his conviction and sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, (\u201cMDMA\u201d or \u201cecstasy\u201d), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846. On appeal, Copeland first argues that the district court erred when it admitted his co-defendant Ryan Martin\u2019s testimony that Martin had previously distributed cocaine and marijuana for Copeland, and that when he became indebted to Copeland as a result of those prior dealings, he agreed, at Copeland\u2019s request, to receive a package of MDMA for Copeland. Copeland argues that this testimony was overly prejudicial, was not necessary to the government\u2019s case, and that it only served to associate him with cocaine, which biased the jury against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">Second, Copeland argues that the district court erred by allowing the government to cross-examine him regarding his knowledge of the club scene in Miami and the presence there of ecstasy. Specifically, Copeland argues that the testimony introduced a stereotype about Miami that biased the jurors against him unfairly and may have caused them to convict him on that basis. He further argues that there was no evidence that Fort Myers, where the offense conduct occurred, could not have provided sufficient demand for the shipment of ecstasy.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">Finally, Copeland argues that the district court erred by attributing 300 additional ecstasy pills to him where this drug amount was based solely on Martin\u2019s testimony which was unreliable, as it was \u201cerratic\u201d and Martin admitted to \u201cpuffing\u201d his numbers for the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-15\">We review challenges to the district court\u2019s rulings on admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1249 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-16\">Evidence showing \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would [otherwise] be\u201d is \u201c[r]elevant evidence,\u201d and \u201c[a]ll relevant evidence is [generally] admissible\u201d at trial. Fed. R.Evid. 401 &amp; 402. While Federal Rule of Evidence 404 restricts the admission of evidence of \u201cother crimes committed outside of those charged[,] ... other crimes evidence may be admissible if it is inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Fortenberry, </em>971 F.2d 717, 721 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-17\">Evidence, not part of the crime charged but pertaining to the chain of events explaining the context, motive and setup of the crime, is properly admitted if linked in time and circumstances with the charged crime, or forms an integral and natural part of an account of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>crime, or is necessary to complete the story of the crime for the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-5\"><em>United States v. Williford, </em>764 F.2d 1493, 1499 (11th Cir.1985). This evidence is nevertheless inadmissible \u201cif its probative value \u2018is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\u2019\u201d under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. <em>Fortenberry, </em>971 F.2d at 721 (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 403).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">Copeland challenges Martin\u2019s testimony that detailed Martin\u2019s version of how he met Copeland and how he claimed to have received a package of ecstasy pills meant for Copeland. Martin could not have clearly described his relationship with Copeland, his own drug dependency, and the reason that he became indebted to Copeland without discussing Copeland\u2019s alleged trafficking of marijuana, cocaine, and ecstasy. Accordingly, the district court properly found that this testimony was inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">Further, this testimony was highly probative. The court analyzed the issue and found that it was not unfairly prejudicial. Accordingly, the district court did not err by admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">We review the district court\u2019s management of cross-examination for clear abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>913 F.2d 1552, 1564 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cCross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness. The court may, in the exercise of discretion, permit inquiry into additional matters as if on direct examination.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 611(b). \u201cThe trial court has broad discretion under Rule 611(b) to determine the permissible scope of cross-examination....\u201d <em>Jones, </em>913 F.2d at 1564.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">On cross-examination, Copeland admitted that Miami had more clubs than Fort Myers, that clubs tended to have more drugs, and that, accordingly, Miami was a larger drug market. Copeland, however, denied knowing anything about ecstasy, denied knowing if ecstasy was prevalent at clubs, and denied ever selling ecstasy. This testimony was relevant to the issue of Copeland\u2019s intent to distribute the MDMA Martin had received because both Copeland and Martin had testified that Copeland was from Miami and had ties to that city, and Martin testified that Copeland had sold ecstasy in Miami. The court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">Moreover, Copeland\u2019s argument that the information would prejudice him was that it would associate him, in the minds of the jurors, with negative stereotypes about Miami. Such a stereotype, however, would not have been necessary for the jury to convict Copeland. Martin\u2019s testimony was that Copeland was an ecstasy dealer in Fort Myers and Miami. The jury also heard the secret recording of Martin\u2019s conversation with Copeland, suggesting that Copeland was involved in narcotics. Further, the government presented evidence of Copeland\u2019s attempt to get Martin\u2019s father to encourage Martin to keep quiet after Martin\u2019s arrest. Finally, Copeland admitted to being a drug dealer. Thus, even if the court did err, that error was harmless and would not warrant reversal. <em>See Fortenberry, </em>971 F.2d at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-13\">We review a determination of drug quantity for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>545 U.S. 1127, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). \u201cAlthough sentencing may be based on fair, accurate, and conservative estimates of the quantity of drugs attributable to a defendant, sentencing cannot be based on calculations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>drug quantities that are merely speculative.\u201d <em>United States v. Zapata, </em>139 F.3d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam). Additionally, \u201c[t]he credibility of a witness is in the province of the factfinder and this court will not ordinarily review the factfinder\u2019s determination of credibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">In addition to the full weight of the second, seized package of ecstasy, the PSI attributed \u201cat least 300 MDMA pills that Martin received from a previous shipment\u201d to Copeland. Copeland argued that the 300 pills should not be added because of Martin\u2019s unreliability as a witness. The government, responding in kind, told the court that even if Martin\u2019s numbers had fluctuated, a conservative estimate based upon Martin\u2019s testimony supported a finding of 300 additional pills. Finally, when the court asked the probation officer about the number, her response was that she had used the \u201cconservative amount\u201d represented in the discovery materials. Accordingly, the court overruled Copeland\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Although the court did not specifically address the reliability of Martin\u2019s testimony, its ruling used the smallest quantity that Martin claimed to have been in the first shipment. In combination with the known amount of the seized package, this was a \u201cfair, accurate, and conservative\u201d estimate of the ecstasy properly attributable to Copeland and was not speculative. <em>Zapata, </em>139 F.3d at 1359. Therefore, the district court did not err. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1294, 1297 (affirming sentence for 30,000 ecstasy pills based on testimony that 25,000 to 50,000 pills had been involved in the offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
