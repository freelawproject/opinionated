Reversible error exists; we vacate the condition of Dominguez-Vasquez\u2019s supervised release that provides for his participation in a substance-abuse treatment program and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-27\">The district court imposed as a special condition of Dominguez-Vasquez\u2019s supervised release that \u201c[t]he defendant shall participate in a program of substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>abuse treatment as may be directed by the probation officer.\u201d Dominguez-Vasquez argues that the district court plainly erred in improperly delegating to the probation officer the decision about whether he must participate in a substance abuse treatment program. The government concedes that the district court\u2019s delegation was plain error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">We review issues raised for the first time on appeal for plain error. <em>United States v. Heath, </em>419 F.3d 1312, 1314 (11th Cir.2005). Under the plain error test, before we can correct an error not raised in the district court, there must be error, that is plain, and that affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). If all three conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>Under Article III of the United States Constitution, a district court may not delegate to the probation officer the authority to make the ultimate decision of whether a defendant must participate in a treatment program. <em>Id. </em>at 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">In this case, the district court plainly erred by delegating the decision of whether Dominguez-Vasquez must participate in substance abuse treatment to the probation officer. <em>See id. </em>This error affected Dominguez-Vasquez\u2019s substantial rights because his sentence would have been different but for the error. <em>See id. </em>at 1316. Without the error, the district court would have decided whether Dominguez-Vasquez had to participate in a substance abuse treatment program; and that decision would have been incorporated into his sentence. <em>See id. </em>And a violation of Article III through an improper delegation of judicial function meets the requirement that the error seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, we vacate the condition of Dominguez-Vasquez\u2019s supervised release that provides for his participation in a substance abuse treatment program and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">. Despite Dominguez-Vasquez\u2019s request that, on remand, we allow him to raise all possible sentencing issues anew, the scope of our remand to the district court is limited to consideration of the condition of Dominguez-Vasquez\u2019s supervised release about his participation in a substance abuse treatment program.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
