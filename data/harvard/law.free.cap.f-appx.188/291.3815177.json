Momin argues that the BIA\u2019s decision was erroneous because he demonstrated that if he returns to Pakistan it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted based on his membership in a political party.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-23\">In support of his argument, Momin relies on his testimony concerning arrests and beatings from the police and from members of a rival political faction, the most serious of which occurred in 1998 when Momin claimed that he was arrested, hung upside down, and beaten. We conclude from a review of the record, however, that the BIA\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-24\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
