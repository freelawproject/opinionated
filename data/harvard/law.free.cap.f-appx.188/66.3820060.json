For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-28\">On March 26, 2004, Mr. Bailey, who is African-American, went to Harleys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>ville National Bank and Trust (\u201cthe Bank\u201d), intending to cash a $1,408.08 check from First American Title Insurance Company, which is a customer of the Bank. He was told by the teller that he would be unable to cash the check. Bailey then spoke to the branch manager. The manager also informed him that he could not cash the check. According to the manager, under the Bank\u2019s check-cashing policy, Bailey, as a non-customer of the Bank, needed an endorsement guarantee from his own bank in order to cash any check over $1,000. The branch manager then gave Bailey a copy of the Bank\u2019s check cashing policy. When Bailey noticed that the policy said nothing about the endorsement guarantee and informed the branch manager that he met all of the Bank\u2019s written check-cashing requirements, the branch manager handwrote changes to the typed policy and again refused to cash Bailey\u2019s check. The Bank claims that Bailey became agitated and threatening. After he left the Bank, Bailey was pulled over by a police officer who said that he had been called by the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Bailey then filed a pro se civil rights action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. He brought this suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, claiming that the Bank\u2019s actions violated the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. After the close of discovery, the District Court granted the Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It dismissed Bailey\u2019s \u00a7 1983 and constitutional claims because the Bank was not a state actor and dismissed any claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 because Bailey and the Bank had no contractual relationship.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Bailey filed a timely notice of appeal. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review of a District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Bailey, the non-moving party. <em>See S &amp; H Hardware &amp; Supply Co. v. Yellow Transp. Inc., </em>432 F.3d 550, 554 (3d Cir.2005). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no need of a trial because \u201cthere is no genuine issue of material fact and [ ] the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">To succeed in a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must show a deprivation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and he must show that the deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law. <em>West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 47, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988). The color-of-state-law requirement is a threshold issue; \u201cthere is no liability under \u00a7 1983 for those not acting under color of law.\u201d <em>Groman v. Township of Manalapan, </em>47 F.3d 628, 638 (3d Cir.1995). To show that the defendant acted under color of state law, a litigant must establish that the defendant is a \u201cstate actor\u201d under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Benn v. Universal Health System, Inc., </em>371 F.3d 165, 169 n. 1 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">Bailey argues that the Bank is a state actor because of its extensive regulation by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the government, including participation in the federal reserve system and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, \u201c[t]he mere fact that a business is subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of the State for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Metro. Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 350, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974). Further, banks have been found not to be state actors, despite this extensive regulation, even when their complained-of actions have been explicitly authorized by the state. <em>See Apao v. Bank of New York, </em>324 F.3d 1091, 1095 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that a bank using non-judicial foreclosure procedure provided by state law was not a state actor for \u00a7 1983 purposes). Thus, the Bank is not a state actor by virtue of its regulation by the government and participation in the federal reserve system and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Nor does the involvement of the police transform the Bank into a state actor. Bailey claims that the Bank called the police in response to what it claims was his threatening behavior.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, in the absence of a conspiracy with the police to violate constitutional rights, a business\u2019s summons of a police officer to deal with a possible disturbance, does not make it a state actor. <em>See Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 152, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970); <em>Ginsberg v. Healey Car &amp; Truck Leasing, Inc., </em>189 F.3d 268, 272 (2d Cir.1999). Thus, even if he proved all of the allegations in his complaint, Bailey would not pass the threshold for bringing this \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Because there was no genuine issue of material fact and the Bank was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the District Court was correct in granting Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-6\">. Bailey expressly disclaims any reliance on \u00a7 1981 in this suit (Appellant Br.at 2-3). However, even if he had not abandoned \u00a7 1981, the District Court\u2019s decision would be affirmed. Section 1981 prohibits, among other things not relevant here, racial discrimination in the formation and performance of contracts. However, under Pennsylvania law, a drawee bank has no contractual obligation toward a recipient of a check, <em>see C &amp; K Petroleum Products, Inc. v. Equibank, </em>839 F.2d 188 (3rd Cir.1988), 13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3408, and thus, \u00a7 1981 is not implicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-5\">. In light of the fact that Bailey claims that the Bank is a state actor by virtue of its regulation by the federal government, his suit may be more properly characterized as one under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). However, such a recharacterization would not change the state action analysis. See <em>Brown v. Philip Morris, </em>250 F.3d 789, 801 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-22\">. Whether Bailey was, in fact, aggressive or caused a disturbance in the bank is a disputed fact. However, it is ultimately immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
