New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The Government asserts his guilty plea waived this issue and that, as a result, he lacks standing to challenge \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-24\">Merchan-Linares\u2019 guilty plea did not specifically waive the right to contest the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b). Accordingly, his plea does not preclude this appeal, <em>see United States v. Somner, </em>127 F.3d 405, 408 (5th Cir.1997); and, because he would be entitled to a lesser sentence if this challenge were successful, he has standing. <em>See Henderson v. Stalder, </em>287 F.3d 374, 380 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1048, 123 S.Ct. 602, 154 L.Ed.2d 521 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-25\">Merchan-Linares\u2019 claim is foreclosed, however, by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held treatment of prior convictions as sentencing factors in \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) was constitutional. Athough Merchan-Linares con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>tends a majority of the Supreme Court would now consider <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>to be incorrectly decided in the light of <em>Apprendi, </em>\u201c[t]his court has repeatedly rejected arguments like the one made by [Merchan-Linares] and has held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding despite <em>Apprendi. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Conceding this claim is foreclosed, he raises it only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
