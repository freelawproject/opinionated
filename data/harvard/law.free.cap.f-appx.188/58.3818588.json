Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(c)(2), Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales is automatically substituted for former Attorney General John Ashcroft.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b83-12\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">Zhu Lin, through counsel, petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s April 2004 decision affirming Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) Barbara A. Nelson\u2019s denial of her application for asylum and withholding of removal. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">Where, as here, the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not eligible for relief and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s reasoning, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guam, v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). The Court reviews questions of law <em>de novo, </em>including \u201cwhat evidence will suffice to carry any asylum applicant\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d <em>Islami v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 396 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-16\">In addition, a petitioner must administratively exhaust his or her claims before raising them in a petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2004). Here, we do not review Lin\u2019s argument that the IJ erred by not taking <em>sua sponte </em>administrative notice of extra-record documents because it was not exhausted before the BIA. Lin\u2019s related argument that the BIA erred for the same reasons is flawed, where her case was reopened and remanded specifically in order for her to provide additional evidence of her family planning claim, but she failed to do so. Although the agency has an obligation to establish the record, <em>Yang v. McElroy, </em>277 F.3d 158, 162 (2d Cir.2002), it is incumbent upon the applicant to prove her eligibility for relief under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-17\">We find no error in the IJ\u2019s analysis of the State Department Report, and no reason to take judicial notice of current country conditions in China. Moreover, as the government suggests, this Court has held that a petitioner must show more than uncorroborated testimony of general conditions in China to overcome the State Department\u2019s indication that there is no official policy of forced sterilization. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005). For the foregoing reasons the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED. Any pending request for oral arguments in his case is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
