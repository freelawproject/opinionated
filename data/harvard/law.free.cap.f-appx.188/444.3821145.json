Because the evidence in the record does not compel us to conclude to the contrary, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-21\">After fleeing Albania with his family in 1999, Cacani illegally entered the United States. At the removal hearing, Cacani, as lead petitioner, described the following events to support his claim that he was persecuted on account of his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-22\">From 1960 to 1965 and from 1971 to 1991, the Albanian Communist regime detained Cacani and his family in labor camps because they \u201cwere seen as opposing the Communist government\u201d and because two relatives had escaped to the United States. After his release, Cacani joined the Democratic Party (DP) and \u201cgave speeches and went from village to village in [Albania] spreading the concept of democracy through [his] speeches.\u201d He testified that he \u201c[spoke] out how the Socialist or Communist Party is and how the [DP] was freedom of rights on the brink.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-23\">Cacani testified he was threatened on four occasions because of his DP activities. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>First, in October 1997, a police chief and three masked police officers entered the restaurant Cacani owned, pointed their guns at the occupants, and ordered them to he down on the floor. The police chief then \u201cgrabbed [Cacani] from behind, pullfed] his gun,\u201d and told Cacani that he was going to kill him for \u201ctalking against the police\u201d and the Socialist Party. Second, in late 1997, masked officers again entered Cacani\u2019s restaurant and beat him until he lost consciousness. Cacani says his knee was injured as a result. Third, in 1998 or 1999, a person named \u201cLolly\u201d entered Cacani\u2019s restaurant, asked him why he was \u201ctalking bad\u201d about the Socialist Party and threatened to kill him if he continued to do so. Fourth, on May 15, 1998, as Cacani and his wife were driving to their village, a shepherd warned Cacani not to go to the village because two armed people were looking for him. Cacani proceeded on and shots soon rang out from bushes along the side of the road. Additionally, Cacani testified that he was interrogated 15 times at the local police station and prosecutor\u2019s office, where his interrogators asked him why he was \u201cspeaking against the government [and] the party,\u201d threatened him, and beat him.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The IJ denied Cacani\u2019s claims for relief, finding his testimony regarding the alleged past persecution not credible. The IJ also found that country conditions in Albania had changed since Caeani\u2019s alleged persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision without issuing a separate opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>398 F.3d 396, 401 (6th Cir.2005). We will not disturb the decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (quotation omitted). Under this standard, the IJ\u2019s findings are \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Singh, </em>398 F.3d at 400 (quotation omitted); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">A. Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The Act authorizes the Attorney General, in his discretion, to grant asylum to an alien who is a \u201crefugee,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A)\u2014that is, to an alien \u201cwho is unable or unwilling to return to ... [his home] country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The burden of proof is on the applicant to establish his refugee status. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b). And though an applicant who establishes past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution, that presumption may be rebutted if the government demonstrates there has been a fundamental change in country conditions such that the applicant\u2019s fear of being persecuted if returned to his home country is no longer well-founded. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">The IJ found Cacani\u2019s testimony not credible because, among other things: the testimony regarding the interrogations was vague; Cacani presented no corroborating evidence of his DP membership, aside from a partially-translated membership card; the \u201cactivities\u201d Cacani performed for the DP were not likely to have caused him problems; and Cacani\u2019s testimony contradicted the Albanian country reports. We need not evaluate the adverse-credibility determination, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>because we are convinced that conditions in Albania \u201chave changed enough to where [Cacani] no longer has a well-founded fear of being persecuted in [Albania].\u201d <em>Daneshvar v. Ashcroft, </em>355 F.3d 615, 624 (6th Cir.2004); <em>see id. </em>at 622 (\u201cAlthough we think that Petitioner may have a valid claim that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was erroneous, we nevertheless choose not to resolve this issue because we are satisfied that Petitioner failed to establish that he has a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">In finding that conditions in Albania had changed, the IJ referenced the Department of State\u2019s 2001 Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions for Albania. That document states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">With the Socialist Party currently leading a coalition government, it is highly unlikely in today\u2019s circumstances that many applicants will have credible claims to political persecution.... There is virtually no evidence that individuals are targeted for mistreatment on political grounds. Far more prevalent is organized and amateur crime.... All political parties have been active in most of the country without a pattern of mistreatment, even during the dark days of 1997.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Though we have recognized \u201cthat State Department reports may be problematic sources on which to rely,\u201d <em>Mullai v. Ashcroft, </em>385 F.3d 635, 639 (6th Cir.2004), we have adopted \u201cthe view that such reports are generally the best source of information on conditions in foreign nations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). And several recent cases from this court have held that changed county conditions in Albania rebut the presumption that an applicant \u201cwould be subject to future persecution upon removal or that he could have a well-founded fear of such future persecution.\u201d <em>Gjelaj v. Gonzales, </em>183 Fed.Appx. 490 (6th Cir. 2006); <em>see Liti v. Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 631, 639-40 (6th Cir.2005) (finding changed circumstances and holding that, \u201cin light of the fundamentally changed conditions in Albania, the Litis failed to satisfy their burden of demonstrating a well-founded fear of future persecution if they were to return\u201d); <em>Mullai, </em>385 F.3d at 639 (noting that, with respect to an alien who entered the United States in October 1996, \u201cchanged country conditions rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution in Albania\u201d); <em>Linadi v. Gonzales, </em>167 Fed. Appx. 515, 518 (6th Cir.2006) (\u201cFinally, the IJ correctly took note of the changed conditions in Albania, citing a State Department report from 2001 as evidence .... \u201d); <em>see also Prifti v. Gonzales, </em>No. 04-3909, 2005 WL 3113514, at *3, 2005 U.S.App. LEXIS 25144, at *5-6 (6th Cir. Nov. 18, 2005); <em>Palaj v. INS, </em>134 Fed. Appx. 29, 33 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Cacani argues that in finding changed county conditions the IJ \u201cerroneously focused on just one report of many ... in the record.\u201d But the reports Cacani points to\u2014other State Department documents and \u201creports from reputable human rights organizations\u201d\u2014do not compel us to conclude that the IJ\u2019s determination was wrong. First, the pre-2001 reports do nothing to rebut the manner in which the 2001 Profile, issued in May 2001, describes the changed conditions in Albania. Second, though many of these reports paint an unpleasant picture of the Albanian government\u2019s human rights record, they do not demonstrate that Cacani would face the requisite individualized threat of harm based on his political opinion. <em>See Daneshvar, </em>355 F.3d at 625 (denying petition for review because although \u201cmany Iranian citizens may live in fear of persecution by the Islamic regime,\u201d the petitioner \u201cpresented no credible evidence that he [would] be singled out for different treatment if he is deported back to Iran\u201d). Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>we deny the petition for review with respect to Cacani\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">B. Withholding of Removal and CAT Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Cacani also seeks review of the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal under the Act. To obtain such relief, Cacani must show by a clear probability that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See Mikhailevitch v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 384, 391 (6th Cir.1998); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). But \u201cbecause the lesser standard for establishing asylum eligibility eludes [Cacani, he necessarily] cannot meet the more stringent requirements for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Mullai, </em>385 F.3d at 639. We thus deny the petition for review on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">To obtain withholding relief under the CAT, Cacani bears the burden of establishing that \u201cit is more likely than not that he ... would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2). Cacani rests his request for CAT relief on the same ground as his request for asylum\u2014that he would be mistreated in Albania because of his political opinion. Cacani argues that because he \u201csuffered numerous ... incidents of police abuse\u201d and because there is \u201cvoluminous background material [in the record] regarding ill-treatment by the police,\u201d he carried his burden of showing that he will be tortured if returned to Albania. But we have already held that Cacani failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution because of his political opinion. It follows that he cannot make the more stringent showing required for obtaining withholding relief under the CAT, and we deny the petition for review on this claim. <em>See Liti, </em>411 F.3d at 641 (\u201c[B]ecause the Litis failed to establish eligibility for asylum, they also cannot meet the heightened requirements for relief under CAT.\u201d); <em>Yu v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 700, 703 n. 3 (6th Cir.2004) (\u201cSince Yu does not establish eligibility for asylum, he does not meet the more stringent standards required for withholding or the Torture Convention.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">For these reasons we deny the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
