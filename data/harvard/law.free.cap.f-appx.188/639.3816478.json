Appellant\u2019s position is that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of her authority under the parties\u2019 agreement when she considered the entire contract to determine the amount of damages owed to Brewster. In addition to awarding damages, the arbitrator also awarded costs and attorney\u2019s fees to Brewster.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument boils down to the contention that the arbitrator should have considered only the portion of the contract that supported its theory of damages. The role of the arbitrator was, however, to resolve the dispute of the parties, and this required considering the entire contract. The parties clearly agreed to the arbitration of \u201cany and all disputes arising with respect to this agreement.\u201d They further agreed that the arbitrator\u2019s award should be \u201cfinal and binding on each of the parties.\u201d Such an agreement must be enforced according to its terms. <em>United Steelworkers v. Enter. Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960); <em>Edward Hines Lumber Co. of Or. v. Lumber &amp; Sawmill Workers Local No. 2588, </em>764 F.2d 631, 635 (9th Cir.1985). The attorney\u2019s fees were not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b664-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
