We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 158 (2d Cir.2004). This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law regarding \u201cwhat evidence will suffice to carry any asylum applicant\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d <em>Islami v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 396 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews agency findings of fact under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">In order to satisfy the \u201con account of\u2019 element, the applicant must show that the persecution suffered arose from the applicant\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See, e.g., INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Even if the petitioner did have a political opinion, he must also have a well-founded fear of persecution <em>because </em>of that political opinion, rather than because of his refusal to comply with his persecutors\u2019 demands. <em>Id. </em>at 483, 112 S.Ct. 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Here, Vasudeva\u2019s own testimony indicates that the militant Sikhs did not abuse him on account of his Hindu religion, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group, but rather because he refused to cooperate with their demands for information regarding rich people to rob in the area. He specifically stated in his asylum application that he did not belong to any political parties, and his reason for refusing to give the militants information was that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to include in their party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Vasudeva testified that the militants were Sikh terrorists who fought against the government to create Khalistan. However, the \u201con account of\u2019 requirement is not satisfied by the persecutor\u2019s political motive. <em>Id. </em>at 482, 112 S.Ct. 812. Moreover, there is no information in the record indicating that the militants even knew Vasudeva\u2019s religion or considered him part of a particular group or class of people, or were motivated by anything other than their greed and a desire to gain useful information from Vasudeva.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">The IJ\u2019s determination that Vasudeva failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground is substantially supported by the record as a whole; his denial of asylum and withholding of removal was thus appropriate. Because Vasudeva does not address the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief before this Court and did not address it before the BIA, he has waived any challenge to that finding. <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cIssues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal.\u201d); <em>Gill v. INS, </em>420 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) bars \u201cthe consideration of bases for relief that were not raised below, and of general issues that were not raised below\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
