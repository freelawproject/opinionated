On appeal, he argues that the Superior Court <em>(Abramson, </em>J.) erred when it: (1) denied his motion to suppress; (2) denied his motions for a change of venue; and (3) instructed the jury concerning insanity. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-15\">The defendant\u2019s convictions arise out of a home invasion in Mont Vernon that he and three other individuals carried out in the early morning hours of October 4, 2009, which resulted in the death of Kimberly Cates. The defendant was charged with alternate counts of first-degree murder, alleging that, acting in concert with, and aided by, Steven Spader, he purposely or knowingly caused the death of Cates by attacking her with a knife. He was also charged with attempted murder of Cates\u2019 daughter, witness tampering, and conspiracy to commit murder and burglary. The defendant pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. The jury found him sane and guilty of all of the charges. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements he made to the New Hampshire State Police that he claimed were obtained in violation of his right to remain silent. He further contends that the court erred in denying his motions for a change of venue. He argues that a venue change was necessary due to the extensive amount of pretrial publicity regarding the crimes and the earlier trial of Steven Spader. Finally, he asserts that the court erroneously instructed the jury regarding insanity. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">\n<em>I. Suppression</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The following facts are drawn from the trial court\u2019s order on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and the record, or are otherwise undisputed. On October 5,2009, Troopers John Encarnacao and Jeffrey Ardini of the New Hampshire State Police interviewed the defendant at the New Hampshire State Police Troop B barracks in Milford regarding Cates\u2019 murder and the related crimes. At the outset of the interview, Trooper Encarnacao confirmed with the defendant that his presence at the barracks was voluntary and that the interview would be recorded. He further advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966). The defendant stated that he understood his rights and agreed to answer questions. The troopers then questioned the defendant about his recent activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">After approximately an hour, the recording device malfunctioned. When the interview resumed using a replacement audio recorder, Trooper Ardini asked the defendant if he remembered his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The defendant responded that he did. At that point, the troopers resumed questioning the defendant. They accused him of participating in the home invasion and the attack on Cates and her daughter. The defendant maintained that he could not recall everything that he had done during the preceding forty-eight hours, but he denied participating in the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">As the interview progressed, the troopers employed various tactics to elicit an admission from the defendant concerning his involvement in the crimes. They expressed skepticism at his memory loss and told the defendant that they did not believe him because his friends had inculpated him in the crimes. They repeatedly told the defendant that what he had told them did not match what his friends were saying and that this was his opportunity to tell the truth and explain \u201cwhy this happened.\u201d For instance, at one point Trooper Ardini said to the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-9\">[Trooper Encarnacao] and I just want to know <em>the why, </em>the how. It\u2019s not just crime, suspect, done. Come on. You think the lawyers that we deal with are going to take that? No. <em>They want to know </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>the why </em>because it totally changes the <em>story... .We try to answer the whys </em>and the whos but when there\u2019s more than one person you need to start looking out for yourself. <em>And that\u2019s where the why comes in. </em>That\u2019s why [we] are still in this room with you. We\u2019re here for you we want to give you the time. We understand it is not, it goes against everything in our inner instinctual mannerisms to admit any connection to this whole thing. Any. Even if you just drove to the general area and the people got out and they did whatever it is they did, you don\u2019t know whatever, it just goes against every instinct that we have in our bodies to say that because there\u2019s consequences to it. We\u2019re not bull****ting you, there\u2019s consequences. <em>But the consequences are vastly different depending on the why. </em>And that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.... <em>We want to help you paint that picture that helps explain your why before they paint it for you.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">(Emphases added.) He later told the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-6\">You know those guys are giving stuff up and you know what they\u2019re giving up is matching what we already know. I don\u2019t know how else to tell you. <em>This is your chance to give your version of why. Because the why is what\u2019s going to explain it and change the perception of this whole thing </em>specifically of you. We can only throw you the rope man. We can only throw you the rope. You got to grab it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">(Emphasis added.) Trooper Encarnacao subsequently told him that \u201c[t]he door is closing on your opportunity to explain <em>why this </em>happened.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">Despite the troopers\u2019 persistent exhortations to tell the truth and explain what happened, the defendant continued to profess his innocence. He challenged the evidence that the troopers claimed connected him to the crime, and further questioned why, if the troopers had such evidence, they had not already arrested him. After two and a half hours, Trooper Encarnacao stopped the interview to give everyone a break.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">Approximately twenty minutes later, the troopers resumed the interview. Trooper Ardini again asked the defendant if he remembered and understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The defendant said that he did and that he wanted to help with the investigation. The troopers then continued to confront him with information they had about the crimes. Shortly thereafter, the following conversation took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-10\">[The defendant]: (inaudible) I don\u2019t have to say anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJk\">[Trooper Encarnacao]: You don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>[The defendant]: So I don\u2019t want to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">[Trooper Enearnacao]: What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">[The defendant]: So I won\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">[Trooper Ardini]: What does that mean Chris?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">[The defendant]: I have a right not to say anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-9\">[Trooper Ardini]: That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-10\">[The defendant]: So I won\u2019t say anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-11\">[Trooper Enearnacao]: So what you\u2019re saying is you don\u2019t want to talk to us any longer? You have to speak.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-12\">[The defendant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-13\">[Trooper Enearnacao]: This interview is over then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-14\">[Trooper Ardini]: At Chris\u2019s request we are ending the interview and the recording. The time by my watch is 17:26.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-15\">At that time, the troopers turned off the recording equipment and ceased all questioning. Before Trooper Enearnacao left the interview room, the defendant said \u201csomething to the effect that he was just tired, that he\u2019s sorry, he doesn\u2019t feel like talking anymore.\u201d Trooper Enearnacao told him, \u201c[H]ey, that\u2019s your prerogative, you don\u2019t want to talk, that\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-16\">The defendant was then left alone in the interview room while Trooper Enearnacao alternated between sitting at a desk directly outside the interview room and speaking with other investigators about the case in another room at the barracks. At no point did the defendant request to leave. After about an hour, the defendant leaned forward and beckoned to Trooper Enearnacao, indicating that he wanted to speak with him. Trooper Enearnacao moved to the doorway of the interview room.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-17\">Trooper Enearnacao then had what he described as \u201cseveral separate conversations\u201d with the defendant in the span of fifteen to twenty minutes. The defendant first asked him \u201cif everybody was still there,\u201d and he told the defendant that he was not sure because he had spent the afternoon with the defendant. Trooper Enearnacao further told the defendant that it had been a long day and that he was tired. The defendant agreed and began talking about his family. The defendant then asked Trooper Enearnacao if his job was hard. Trooper Enearnacao responded that it was. The defendant continued to question the trooper about his job and whether it was \u201chard to deal with.\u201d Trooper Enearnacao responded, \u201c[Y]ou know, at times it is, but it\u2019s like any other job, you take the good with the bad.\u201d The defendant \u201csaid something to the effect that [Trooper Enearnacao] must see a lot, that must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>be hard to deal with,\u201d to which Trooper Encarnacao responded, \u201cit can be, but, <em>you know, the real thing that\u2019s hard to deal with is when you, you know, can\u2019t find the answers why something happens!\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The defendant then brought up the subject of the death penalty, asking Trooper Encarnacao whether the crimes under investigation were eligible for the death penalty. Trooper Encarnacao told him that he did not think so and then explained what crimes were eligible for the death penalty. The defendant also asked about the difference between first and second-degree murder, and Trooper Encarnacao explained the difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Following this conversation, Trooper Encarnacao testified that the defendant said, \u201cyou know what, why don\u2019t you go get your recorder... I\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201d Trooper Encarnacao testified that he was surprised by the defendant\u2019s statement because, in his mind, the interview was over, and the defendant had already decided not to tell the troopers anything else. Trooper Encarnacao reminded the defendant that he did not have to talk, but the defendant said, \u201c[N]o, you know, I\u2019m going to tell you everything.\u201d Trooper Encarnacao told the defendant that he had to retrieve his audio recorder and locate Trooper Ardini. The defendant stated that he did not want to speak with Trooper Ardini, but that he trusted Trooper Encarnacao. Trooper Encarnacao then retrieved an audio recorder and returned to the interview room. He testified that he asked the defendant \u201cif he wanted to do this,\u201d and the defendant \u201csaid he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Trooper Encarnacao then began recording. The following conversation ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">[Trooper Encarnacao]: And this is a continuation of [an] interview that we ended maybe forty five minutes or so ago. Ah it might have been a little longer. At your request we had been speaking -with ah, well it was Chris and I and Trooper Jeff Ardini from the Major Crime Unit at that time. Ah and again we were, we were interviewing Chris and at some point Chris said that he didn\u2019t feel like talking anymore. Ah is it true you\u2019ve come to me and you\u2019ve told me you\u2019d like to talk again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-9\">[The defendant]: Yes I would.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">Thereafter, Trooper Encarnacao again read the defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The defendant said that he understood his rights and he further agreed to speak with Trooper Encarnacao and answer questions. The defendant then confessed to his involvement in the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress his confession, arguing, in part, that his right to remain silent was violated because, after he had asserted this right, Trooper Encarnacao conducted \u201cthe functional equiva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>lent of interrogation which [led] back to a recorded formal interrogation.\u201d Following a hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The court found that, once the defendant invoked his right to remain silent, Trooper Encarnacao neither expressly interrogated the defendant nor conducted the functional equivalent of interrogation. Rather, the court found that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s statements were initiated <em>solely </em>by him, without <em>any </em>prompting by the police.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) Accordingly, the court ruled that the defendant\u2019s confession was not obtained in violation of his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues that his rights under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution were violated. Specifically, he contends that Trooper Encarnacao engaged in the functional equivalent of interrogation and, as a result, failed to \u201cscrupulously honor\u201d his invocation of his right to remain silent. We first address the defendant\u2019s claim under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid in our analysis. <em>State v. </em>Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Whether the defendant was subjected to interrogation is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>State v. Spencer, </em>149 N.H. 622, 625 (2003). Thus, we defer to the trial court\u2019s factual findings with respect to interrogation unless they are contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>However, we conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the trial court\u2019s ultimate determination of whether interrogation occurred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Before the defendant\u2019s responses made during custodial interrogation may be used as evidence against him, the State must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that it did not violate his constitutional rights under <em>Miranda. See, e.g., id. </em>at 624; <em>State v. Jeleniewski, </em>147 N.H. 462, 465 (2002). In <em>Miranda, </em>the Supreme Court held that if an accused is in police custody, has been informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and \u201cindicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 473-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Subsequently, in <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 101-04 (1975), the Supreme Court addressed the circumstances under which interrogation may be lawfully resumed after a defendant has invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The Court found that nothing in <em>Miranda </em>could \u201csensibly be read to create a <em>per se </em>proscription of indefinite duration upon any further questioning by any police officer on any subject, once the person in custody has indicated a desire to remain silent.\u201d <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 102-03. Relying upon the \u201cright to cut off questioning\u201d as enunciated in <em>Miranda, </em>the Court concluded \u201cthat the admissibility of statements obtained after the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under <em>Miranda </em>on whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>his \u2018right to cut off questioning\u2019 was \u2018scrupulously honored.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103-04. We have similarly concluded that whenever a suspect in custody exercises his option to cut off questioning, the police must scrupulously honor the suspect\u2019s desire to remain silent. <em>State v. Laurie, </em>135 N.H. 438, 442 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Nevertheless, the defendant himself may initiate further conversation and thereby waive the right he had previously invoked. <em>See State v. Plch, </em>149 N.H. 608, 616 (2003); <em>State v. Elbert, </em>125 N.H. 1, 9 (1984). In those instances, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, without improper prompting, initiated conversation with the police about the subject of the charges. <em>See Plch, </em>149 N.H. at 616. Thus, the defendant \u2014 even after he has asserted his right to remain silent \u2014 may choose to initiate further conversation with the police, and his subsequent statements may be admissible so long as his decision is not the result of improper prompting by the police. <em>See Plch, </em>149 N.H. at 616; <em>cf. United States v. Alexander, </em>447 F.3d 1290, 1294 (10th Cir. 2006) (stating that \u201ca defendant \u2014 even if he has asserted the right to counsel \u2014 may choose to reinitiate contact with the police so long as the government does not coerce him into doing so\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Here, the defendant does not dispute that, after he invoked his right to remain silent, he initiated the conversation with Trooper Encarnacao \u201cin the ordinary dictionary sense of that word.\u201d <em>State v. Gravel, </em>135 N.H. 172, 177 (1991) (quotation omitted). Nor does he assert that any of his statements were involuntary. Rather, he argues that Trooper Encarnacao\u2019s responses to his questions constituted the functional equivalent of interrogation because they were not confined to answering the defendant\u2019s questions but \u201cdirectly alluded to the prior interrogation\u201d regarding the crimes, and, therefore, that these responses improperly prompted him to confess. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Interrogation for <em>Miranda </em>purposes occurs when \u201ca person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent.\u201d <em>Spencer, </em>149 N.H. at 625 (quotation omitted). The functional equivalent of interrogation includes \u201cany words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301 (1980). The \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d aspect of the term \u201cfocuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police.\u201d <em>Plch, </em>149 N.H. at 614 (quotation omitted). \u201cThis focus reflects the fact that the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards were designed to vest a suspect in custody with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>added measure of protection against coercive police practices, without regard to objective proof of the underlying intent of the police.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\"> Trooper Encarnacao\u2019s responses to the defendant\u2019s questions did not constitute the functional equivalent of interrogation. Courts have held that a police officer\u2019s responses to certain inquiries by the defendant do not constitute interrogation. <em>Spencer, </em>149 N.H. at 625 (citing and discussing cases). In <em>Spencer, </em>for instance, we held that the officer\u2019s conduct of showing the defendant bank surveillance photographs of a person who appeared to be the defendant was done in response to the defendant\u2019s apparent confusion about being arrested and did not constitute interrogation. <em>Id. </em>at 626. Similarly, in <em>United States v. Conley, </em>156 F.3d 78, 83 (1st Cir. 1998), the court found that the officer\u2019s \u201ccomments regarding the facts of the case and the strength of the evidence\u201d were made \u201cin direct response to the [defendant\u2019s] importuning,\u201d and could \u201chardly be classified as interrogatory.\u201d Here, as in those cases, Trooper Encarnacao\u2019s statements to the defendant were made in direct response to the defendant and cannot be characterized as interrogatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that Trooper Encarnacao \u201cinvited [the defendant] to re-engage in a conversation about the crimes\u201d by his response that the hardest part of his job was when he was unable to find answers as to why a crime occurred. It is true that during their previous conversation with the defendant the troopers had referenced the need to know why the crime occurred; however, this fact alone does not support a conclusion that Trooper Encarnacao\u2019s response effectively \u201cturned the conversation back to the investigation of the Mont Vernon crimes.\u201d To the contrary, Trooper Encarnacao\u2019s response materially differs from statements that we have found to be the functional equivalent of interrogation in other cases. <em>See Plch, </em>149 N.H. at 614-15; <em>Gravel, </em>135 N.H. at 177 (officer\u2019s questions pertaining to the location where defendant had said he used drug were asked only to elicit incriminating evidence and, thus, constituted interrogation). For example, in <em>Plch, </em>the defendant was suspected of the murder and dismemberment of a woman. <em>Plch, </em>149 N.H. at 610. During an interview with the police, he invoked his right to counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 611-12. Subsequently, the interviewing officer told the defendant that if he had \u201ca change of heart and .. . want[ed] to stand up and be the man [he] want[ed] to be\u201d and let the police know where the victim\u2019s body parts were, then he would have to tell somebody that he wanted to speak with the detectives because they could no longer speak with him. <em>Id. </em>at 612 (quotation omitted). We found that the police should have known that these \u201cstatements were reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>from the suspect,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 614 (quotation and brackets omitted), and that they were intended to persuade the defendant to \u201chave a change of heart\u201d and tell the detectives where the body parts were, <em>id. </em>at 615 (quotation omitted). <em>See also State v. Dellorfano, </em>128 N.H. 628, 634 (1986) (finding that officer called out defendant\u2019s nickname in the jail cell area in order to elicit an incriminating answer); <em>State v. Beaupre, </em>123 N.H. 155, 158 (1983) (finding detective\u2019s invitation to the defendant to make a statement constituted custodial interrogation in violation of defendant\u2019s right to counsel under <em>Miranda). </em>Here, we cannot say that Trooper Encarnacao should have known that his response was reasonably likely to elicit a confession from the defendant regarding his involvement in the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The defendant further suggests that Trooper Encarnacao\u2019s response was meant to appeal to the defendant\u2019s \u201cinterest in police work that had been apparent from the beginning of their interaction.\u201d We disagree. The defendant asked Trooper Encarnacao a series of questions regarding the difficulty of his job, and the trooper directly responded by explaining what he found to be the hardest part of his job. <em>See Spencer, </em>149 N.H. at 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The defendant contends that he made earlier attempts to discontinue questioning but that the troopers nonetheless continued to question him before the interview ended. He maintains that his \u201cperceptions of the troopers\u2019 willingness to continue questioning him in the face of his initial, equivocal attempts to discontinue questioning are relevant to how he would perceive the later interaction with [Trooper] Encarnacao.\u201d We agree that, in determining whether Trooper Encarnacao conducted the functional equivalent of interrogation, we focus primarily on the defendant\u2019s perceptions. <em>See Plch, </em>149 N.H. at 614 (quotation omitted). Here, however, although the troopers continued to question the defendant despite his \u201cequivocal attempts to discontinue questioning,\u201d once the defendant unequivocally asserted his right to remain silent, the troopers immediately ended the interview and left the defendant alone in the interview room. After the defendant was left alone in the interview room, there is no evidence that he had any other conversations \"with the troopers until <em>he </em>later initiated contact with Trooper Encarnacao. In light of these facts, we fail to see how the defendant would perceive Trooper Encarnacao\u2019s later responses to the defendant\u2019s questions as the functional equivalent of interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Moreover, there was no reason for Trooper Encarnacao to believe that the defendant would suddenly decide to admit his involvement in the crimes. The troopers had interviewed the defendant for nearly four hours, during which time they repeatedly accused him of committing the crimes, and the defendant repeatedly professed his innocence. As a result, Trooper Encarnacao could have reasonably concluded that the defendant would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>continue to profess his innocence. <em>See Spencer, </em>149 N.H. at 626. This is evidenced by Trooper Encarnacao\u2019s testimony that he was surprised by the defendant\u2019s willingness to tell him everything as he thought the interview had ended and that the defendant was not going to tell them anything else. Although Trooper Encarnacao\u2019s intent is not conclusive, it is relevant to determining whether his response constituted the functional equivalent of interrogation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Accordingly, we hold that Trooper Encarnacao did not engage in the functional equivalent of interrogation. It follows, therefore, that he did not improperly prompt the defendant to initiate the further conversation. <em>See Pick, </em>149 N.H. at 615-16. Rather, the ensuing conversation was \u201cinitiated <em>solely </em>by [the defendant], without <em>any </em>prompting by the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Thus, the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights were not violated, and we find no error in the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. <em>See Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 300 (explaining that \u201c[v]olunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>see also State v. Reynolds, </em>124 N.H. 428, 433 (1984) (\u201cBy voluntarily initiating the discussion ... the defendant exercised the control over the questioning that the constitution guarantees him.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Finally, the defendant contends that we should find the State Constitution more protective than the Federal Constitution with respect to \u201csuspects who give statements after invoking their right to silence.\u201d He maintains that in deciding certain cases, such as those addressing whether there has been a valid waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights, we have viewed the State Constitution as more protective than the Federal Constitution. We have historically mandated, under our State Constitution, more protection of a suspect\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights than has the United States Supreme Court under the Federal Constitution. <em>See Gravel, </em>135 N.H. at 184. However, to the extent that the defendant is inviting us to provide greater protection under the State Constitution than is already given, he has failed to adequately develop an argument as to why we should now expand that protection. We, therefore, decline his invitation. See <em>State v. Euliano, </em>161 N.H. 601, 608 (2011) (declining to address defendant\u2019s argument that trial judge was not impartial under Part I, Article 35 of State Constitution and Sixth Amendment to United States Constitution because defendant had failed to adequately develop it).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">As the Federal Constitution offers the defendant no greater protection than the State Constitution does under these circumstances, <em>see Plch, </em>149 N.H. at 620; <em>Spencer, </em>149 N.H. at 629; <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 300-02, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\n<em>II. Venue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The defendant next argues that the trial court erred by denying his motions to change venue. The crimes in this case generated an extensive amount of media coverage. While much of the coverage occurred immediately after the crimes, co-conspirator Spader\u2019s trial and sentencing in November 2010, approximately four months before the defendant\u2019s trial, engendered numerous newspaper articles and editorials as well as daily television coverage. Many of those articles identified Spader and the defendant as being accused of Cates\u2019 murder and the attempted murder of her daughter. One article described the start of Spader\u2019s trial under the headline, \u201cJurors slated to visit site of grisly murder.\u201d Several articles quoted the prosecutor\u2019s opening argument, which included a graphic description of the attack and the defendant\u2019s involvement. Media accounts of Spader\u2019s trial also related the testimony of Quinn Glover, one of the co-conspirators who participated in the home invasion, in which he said that he saw \u201cGribble [take] his knife and ... put it on the right side of [Cates\u2019] throat. I turned my head away... when I looked back the knife was on the other side of her throat.\u201d (Parenthesis omitted.) Other articles set forth testimony describing how the defendant stabbed Cates\u2019 daughter. Another article explained that the defendant was accused of slashing Cates\u2019 throat and throwing her daughter into a sliding glass door. Several articles discussed citizens\u2019 reactions to the crimes under headlines such as \u201cTrial creates uneasy note for many\u201d and \u201cSpader murder trial testimony stokes public anxiety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Following Spader\u2019s conviction in November 2010, the news media shifted its focus to the defendant\u2019s case. At least one article reported that the defendant sought to suppress his confession. Several articles and a local television station later reported that the defendant admitted that he committed the crimes charged but had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. In addition, a few articles included comments by legal and mental health professionals on the viability of the insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Before trial, the defendant filed two motions requesting a change of venue. In the first motion, he argued that \u201c[t]he volume of adverse and hostile publicity generated during the trial and sentencing of\u2019 Spader required the court to presume prejudice in advance of jury <em>voir dire. </em>He further maintained that, if the court denied his change of venue request, it should consider the use of \u201csupplemental questionnaires to ascertain the true scope of the potential juror\u2019s exposure to pretrial publicity and that publicity\u2019s impact on that potential juror.\u201d The trial court denied his motion, finding that \u201cthe pretrial publicity surrounding the <em>Spader </em>trial was not so inherently prejudicial to justify a change of venue,\u201d and, given that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>issues raised in <em>Spader </em>[were] remarkably different from those [the] defendant raise[d],\u201d the defendant had failed \u201cto illustrate how the alleged inflammatory news coverage from the <em>Spader </em>trial prejudices the jury pool in his trial.\u201d The court also denied his request for a supplemental juror questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">After the jury was selected, the defendant renewed his motion to change venue. He argued that \u201cthe jury selection process [had] revealed that the adverse pretrial publicity in this case created fear, bias and widespread discussion of the case in the community such that the jurors\u2019 claims that they [could] be impartial cannot be believed.\u201d The court again denied his request, finding that he had \u201cnot met his heavy burden of establishing inherent or presumptive prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case garnered\u201d and had \u201cfailed to establish any bias or actual prejudice in the jury panel seated, such that he [could not] obtain a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the court erred by denying his motions because \u201cthe overwhelming media coverage and intensely antagonistic community sentiment\u201d denied him \u201ca fair determination of his sanity and criminal responsibility... in Hillsborough County.\u201d Although he bases his claim on both the State and Federal Constitutions, he relies primarily upon federal law, and does not argue for a higher standard under the New Hampshire Constitution. We first address the defendant\u2019s arguments under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid in our analysis. <em>See Ball, </em>124 N.H. at 231-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Part I, Article 17 of the New Hampshire Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">In criminal prosecutions, the trial of facts, in the vicinity where they happened, is so essential to the security of the life, liberty and estate of the citizen, that no crime or offense ought to be tried in any other county or judicial district than that in which it is committed; except in any case in any particular county or judicial district, upon motion by the defendant, and after a finding by the court that a fair and impartial trial cannot be had where the offense may be committed, the court shall direct the trial to a county or judicial district in which a fair and impartial trial can be obtained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">We have explained that Part I, Article 17 grants a criminal defendant the right to be tried where the crime was committed and the right to obtain a change of venue upon proof that he cannot obtain a fair trial there. <em>Petition of State of N.H. (State v. Johanson), </em>156 N.H. 148, 154 (2007). Similarly, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that under the Federal Constitution, \u201ca defendant <em>must </em>be given an opportunity to show that a change of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>venue is required in his case\u201d because of community prejudice. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). In addition, the due process requirements of Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantee a defendant the right to a trial by a fair and impartial jury. <em>State v. Smart, </em>136 N.H. 639, 646 (1993); <em>Groppi v. Wisconsin, </em>400 U.S. 505, 509 (1971); <em>see also </em>N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 35 (\u201cIt is the right of every citizen to be tried by judges as impartial as the lot of humanity will admit\u201d). Thus, if there is proof of community prejudice such that the defendant cannot receive a trial by a fair and impartial jury in the county where the crime was committed, the defendant has an absolute right to a change of venue. <em>See Petition of State of N.H. (State v. Johanson), </em>156 N.H. at 154; <em>see also Skilling v. United States, </em>130 S. Ct. 2896, 2913 (2010) (\u201cThe Constitution\u2019s place-of-trial prescriptions... do not impede transfer of the proceeding to a different district at the defendant\u2019s request if extraordinary local prejudice will prevent a fair trial \u2014 a basic requirement of due process.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Publicity about a case can result in two types of prejudice with regard to the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>State v. Laaman, </em>114 N.H. 794, 798 (1974). The first is inherent or presumptive prejudice, which exists when the publicity by its nature has so tainted the trial atmosphere that it will necessarily result in a lack of due process. <em>Id.', see Smart, </em>136 N.H. at 647. A claim of inherent prejudice does not require the defendant to show \u201cactual identifiable prejudice.\u201d <em>Smart, </em>136 N.H. at 647 (quotation omitted). The second type of prejudice is actual prejudice which exists when the publicity has infected the jurors to such an extent that the defendant cannot receive, or has not received, a fair and impartial jury trial. <em>Laaman, </em>114 N.H. at 798. In this situation, the defendant must show that the nature of the opinions formed by the jurors as a result of the publicity are such that they cannot be set aside to enable them to render a verdict based upon the evidence presented in court. <em>Id.', see also Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 723 (1961). Here, the defendant maintains that presumed or inherent prejudice resulted from the pretrial publicity and that \u201cthe community interest\u201d was such that \u201cthe jurors\u2019 assurances of impartiality must be doubted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The trial court\u2019s determination of the impartiality of the jurors selected, essentially a question of demeanor and credibility, \u201cis entitled to special deference.\u201d <em>Smart, </em>136 N.H. at 653 (quotation and ellipsis omitted). This is so in particular \u201cwith respect to pretrial publicity\u201d as \u201c[t]he judge of that court sits in the locale where the publicity is said to have had its effect, and brings to his evaluation of any such claim of prejudice his own perception of the depth and extent of news stories that might influence a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>juror.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted); <em>Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2918 (\u201cWhen pretrial publicity is at issue, primary reliance on the judgment of the trial court makes especially good sense.\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)). As a result, we have said \u201cthat the trial court\u2019s finding that a jury was impartial should only be overturned for manifest error.\u201d <em>Smart, </em>136 N.H. at 647. Because neither party argues that a different standard of review should apply, we will review the trial court\u2019s decisions in this case for manifest error.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\n<em>A. Pretrial Publicity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The defendant first contends that the pretrial publicity surrounding the Spader trial and leading up to his trial resulted in presumptive prejudice requiring a change of venue even before the trial court conducted <em>voir dire. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The seminal case for examining whether presumptive prejudice resulted from pretrial publicity is <em>Rideau v. Louisiana, </em>373 U.S. 723 (1963). <em>See Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2913. In <em>Rideau, </em>the defendant was charged with armed robbery, kidnapping, and murder in a small parish in Louisiana. <em>Rideau, </em>373 U.S. at 724. On the morning after the crimes, in the absence of defense counsel, the police interrogated the defendant in jail and obtained his confession. <em>Id. </em>at 724, 727. The interrogation was filmed and later broadcast on three separate occasions prior to trial by a television station in the parish where the crimes were committed, to an audience of between 20,000 and 53,000, in a community which had a population of approximately 150,000. <em>Id. </em>at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">The United States Supreme Court reversed the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a change of venue, stating that \u201c[w]hat the people of [the] . . . Parish saw on their television sets was [the defendant], in jail, flanked by the sheriff and two state troopers, admitting in detail the commission of the [crimes], in response to leading questions by the sheriff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725. The Court explained that \u201cto the tens of thousands of people who saw and heard it, [this was] in a very real sense ... [the defendant\u2019s] trial \u2014 at which he pleaded guilty to murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726. Based upon these facts, the Court found that \u201c[a]ny subsequent court proceedings in a community so pervasively exposed to such a spectacle could be but a hollow formality,\u201d <em>id., </em>and, as a result, \u201cwithout pausing to examine a particularized transcript of the <em>voir dire </em>examination of the members of the jury,\u201d the Court held that the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to change venue violated his right to due process of law. <em>Id. </em>at 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">More recently, in <em>Skilling, </em>the Supreme Court addressed a claim of presumed juror prejudice resulting from \u201cpretrial publicity and community prejudice\u201d against the defendant. <em>Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2907. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>defendant, a longtime Enron executive, had been prosecuted \u201cfor crimes committed before the corporation\u2019s collapse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He claimed that the trial court erred in failing to move his trial to a different venue because \u201cthe community passion aroused by Enron\u2019s collapse and the vitriolic media treatment aimed at him\u201d created a presumption of prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 2912 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The Supreme Court began its analysis by reviewing <em>Rideau </em>and other cases in which it \u201coverturned a conviction obtained in a trial atmosphere that was utterly corrupted by press coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2914 (quotation and brackets omitted). The Court explained that those \u201cdecisions . .. cannot be made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to news accounts of the crime alone presumptively deprives the defendant of due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and ellipses omitted). \u201cProminence does not necessarily produce prejudice, and juror impartiality,\u201d the Court reiterated, \u201cdoes not require <em>ignorance.\u201d Id. </em>at 2914-15. The Court then considered certain factors, <em>id. </em>at 2915-17, in making its determination that the defendant\u2019s trial shared \u201clittle in common with those in which [it] approved a presumption of juror prejudice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2916.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The defendant argues that we should consider several of the factors enumerated in <em>Skilling </em>in addressing his claim, specifically: (1) the size of the community and the pervasiveness of the media coverage; (2) the nature of the reporting; (3) the timing of the trial in relation to the crime; and (4) the effect of the media coverage surrounding Spader\u2019s trial. <em>See id. </em>at 2915-17. Upon consideration of these factors, we conclude that the trial court did not commit manifest error when it determined that the pretrial publicity did not create a presumption of prejudice sufficient to require a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\n<em>1. Size of the Community and Pervasiveness of the Media Coverage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">In this case, the jury was drawn from Hillsborough County, the most populous county in New Hampshire, with a population of over 400,000. <em>See Hillsborough County, </em>N.H. Employment Sec. (2012), <em>available at </em>http://www.nhes.nh.gov/elmi/products/cp/documents/hillsborough-cp.pdf. Although Hillsborough County is not as large as the community in <em>Skilling, </em>where the jury was drawn from a population with over 4.5 million eligible jurors, <em>id. </em>at 2915, it is significantly more populous than communities in which prejudice has been presumed, <em>see Rideau, </em>373 U.S at 724 (presumed prejudice found where prospective jurors drawn from parish with population of 150,000 residents); <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 719 (presumed prejudice found where prospective jurors drawn from rural county of approximately 30,000 residents); <em>Com. v. Toolan, </em>951 N.E.2d 903, 915 (Mass. 2011) (finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\u201c[t]he small size of the Nantucket community [with a population of just over 10,000 permanent residents] weighs in favor of finding local prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The defendant raises concerns about the impact that the crimes had on the community, citing articles quoting a few residents who expressed anger, bewilderment and heartbreak over the crimes. The defendant fails to demonstrate, however, how the sentiment expressed by a small number of residents in a county with over 400,000 residents is indicative of presumed prejudice in the potential jury pool. <em>Cf. United States v. Mitchell, </em>752 F. Supp. 2d 1216, 1221 (D. Utah 2010) (finding the fact that nine to ten thousand community volunteers were involved in the search for kidnapping victim in a county with a population of 2.8 million did not support presumption of prejudice); <em>United States v. McVeigh, </em>918 F. Supp. 1467, 1472 (W.D. Okla. 1996) (change of venue necessitated, in part, by community sentiment, which included public sympathy for the victims as demonstrated by memorials displayed in the state cap\u00edtol building and t-shirts honoring the victims sold in the courthouse on hearing days). Thus, given the size of the community from which the jury pool was drawn in this case, it is unreasonable to conclude that twelve impartial jurors could not be found. <em>See Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2915; <em>see also United States v. Diehl-Armstrong, </em>739 F. Supp. 2d 786, 793-94, 807 (W.D. Pa. 2010) (finding no presumed prejudice, in part because jury drawn from community with total population of 545, 615); <em>Com. v. Entwistle, </em>973 N.E.2d 115, 128 (Mass. 2012) (finding no presumed prejudice, in part because the jury was drawn from the most populous county in New England).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">With respect to the pervasiveness of the media coverage, the defendant cites \u201cinformation about the circulation of the three leading sources of news about the crimes: the Union Leader, WMUR, and the Nashua Telegraph.\u201d Unlike in <em>Rideau, </em>however, where the defendant provided evidence that an estimated 106,000 people in a population of 150,000 had been exposed to his confession, <em>Rideau, </em>373 U.S. at 724, the defendant here concedes that \u201cno definitive number of potential jurors exposed to... media [about the crime] can be created.\u201d Although the defendant maintains that \u201c[d]uring the Spader trial, WMUR estimated that an average of almost\u201d 41,000 adults in Hillsborough County watched the evening news, these numbers represent only approximately ten percent of Hillsborough County\u2019s population. Moreover, although \u201cthe record reflects how many homes in Hillsborough County received the Union Leader,\u201d as the defendant acknowledges, \u201cit cannot be calculated how many jury-eligible adults within the home read [reports] on the Mont Vernon crimes.\u201d Similarly, as recognized by the defendant, \u201cwebsite viewers may be anywhere in the county, state, or country.\u201d Given these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the publicity so saturated the community as to require a presumption of prejudice. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number><em>Coleman v. Kemp, </em>778 F.2d 1487, 1491-1540 (11th Cir. 1985) (concluding that prejudice could be presumed where pretrial publicity consisting of over 150 newspaper articles and various news broadcasts saturated a community of approximately 7,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\n<em>2. Nature of the Reporting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The defendant also claims that the nature of the reporting was prejudicial because \u201c[r]eports of the Spader trial graphically described the crimes and the victims\u2019 injuries, often using inflammatory language.\u201d \u201c[I]nherent, or presumptive, prejudice will only be found in cases where the publicity is of a certain nature,\u201d <em>Smart, </em>136 N.H. at 647, and \u201cattends only the extreme case,\u201d <em>Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2915. \u201c[I]t is the adverse nature of the publicity, not merely its quantity, that is critical in finding presumptive prejudice.\u201d <em>Smart, </em>136 N.H. at 649. However, even pervasive, adverse pretrial publicity \u201cdoes not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.\u201d <em>Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2916 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The defendant describes as inflammatory certain words in some of the news reports, including \u201cvicious,\u201d \u201csavage,\u201d \u201cgruesome,\u201d \u201chorrific,\u201d \u201ctorture,\u201d and \u201cdepravity.\u201d We have reviewed the material submitted by the defendant, and, although some of the news reports were accusatory in content and included graphic descriptions of the crimes, we agree with the trial court that an overwhelming amount of the material submitted consists of straightforward, factual accounts of the crimes as recounted at Spader\u2019s trial and the proceedings leading up to the defendant\u2019s trial. <em>See Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2916-17 n.17 (noting that \u201c[w]hen publicity is about the event, rather than directed at individual defendants, this may lessen any prejudicial impact\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>Smart, </em>136 N.H. at 649 (finding no presumed prejudice despite some hostile and accusatory pretrial publicity). \u201cDistinguishing between straightforward factual publicity about a celebrated case and inflammatory, adverse press is crucial.\u201d <em>Smart, </em>136 N.H. at 649. \u201cTo ignore these real differences in the potential for prejudice would not advance the cause of fundamental fairness, but only make impossible the timely prosecution of persons who are well known in the community, whether they be notorious or merely prominent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Here, the media coverage cited by the defendant \u201cwas not directed at arousing or inciting the passion of the community.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>752 F. Supp. 2d at 1222 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The defendant also points to reports of the Spader trial describing his involvement in the crimes as evidence of presumed prejudice. Here, however, unlike in <em>Rideau, </em>in which the defendant disputed his guilt and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the media repeatedly broadcast his \u201cdramatically staged admission,\u201d <em>Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2913, 2916, the defendant admitted to killing Cates and attempting to kill her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The defendant further suggests that presumptive prejudice resulted from reports on the Spader trial containing \u201cinformation about [the defendant] that was not introduced at his trial, such as Spader\u2019s statements about [the defendant\u2019s] involvement\u201d and that the defendant \u201creceived \u2018fan mail.\u2019 \u201d The defendant does not claim that the reports contained evidence that was inadmissible but simply that they contained evidence <em>not admitted </em>at his trial. Although there may be instances in which news reports containing <em>inadmissible </em>evidence are sufficient to presume jury prejudice, the mere fact that certain reports contained information that was <em>not admitted </em>in the defendant\u2019s trial is not sufficient to presume jury prejudice. <em>See Patton v. Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 1029, 1040 (1984) (pretrial publicity did not render a fair trial unlikely even when publicity revealed, among other things, \u201cinformation not admitted into evidence at trial\u201d); <em>Smart, </em>136 N.H. at 650. Moreover, as stated above, the defendant in this case admitted his involvement in the charged crimes. Thus, we conclude that news reports containing Spader\u2019s statements about the defendant\u2019s involvement in the crimes were insufficient to create a presumption of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\n<em>3. Timing of the Trial in Relation to the Crime</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\u201c[C]ourts generally find no presumption of inherent unfairness where there has been a substantial delay between the criminal act and the trial.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>752 F. Supp. 2d at 1224 (quotation omitted). For instance, in <em>Skilling, </em>the Supreme Court found significant that four years had elapsed between the time of Enron\u2019s collapse and the defendant\u2019s trial, stating that \u201cthe decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat in the years following Enron\u2019s collapse.\u201d <em>Skilling </em>130 S. Ct. at 2916. Here, the crimes occurred in October 2009 and the defendant\u2019s trial occurred nearly a year and a half later in March 2011. The defendant acknowledges that the media coverage of the crimes \u201cabated in the fall of 2009.\u201d Thus, the passage of time between the crimes and the defendant\u2019s trial diminished any presumptive impact of the publicity at the time the crime was committed. <em>See Goss v. Nelson, </em>439 F.3d 621, 633 (10th Cir. 2006) (\u201cThe passage of time before trial \u2014 in this case over a year \u2014 also diminishes the presumptive impact of publicity occurring at the time the crime was committed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">\n<em>Ip. Media Coverage of Spader\u2019s Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The defendant further argues that a change of venue was required because his trial occurred shortly after Spader\u2019s trial, during which extensive media coverage revived interest in the crimes. Thus, we turn to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the question of whether the timing of the media coverage of Spader\u2019s trial warranted \u201can automatic presumption of prejudice.\u201d <em>Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2917.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The defendant\u2019s trial took place approximately four months after the verdict in the Spader trial. Spader\u2019s trial received substantial publicity. The bulk of the media accounts submitted by the defendant were generated during and immediately following Spader\u2019s trial. The defendant submitted thirty-three articles related to Spader\u2019s trial, twenty-four of which mention the defendant, as well as seven additional articles related to the defendant\u2019s trial. As noted above, almost all of the material submitted consists of straightforward, factual accounts of the crimes as recounted at Spader\u2019s trial and the proceedings leading up to the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">More importantly, however, given that the defendant admitted his participation in the crimes and pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, Spader\u2019s trial \u201cha[d] little relevance to [the defendant\u2019s] state of mind at the time of the alleged crime.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>752 F. Supp. 2d at 1227 (finding co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea not relevant to defendant\u2019s case because he pleaded insanity). As the trial court correctly observed, the issues raised in Spader\u2019s trial were \u201cremarkably different\u201d from those raised in the defendant\u2019s trial. Spader pleaded not guilty, and, thus, at trial, the State bore the burden of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Here, on the other hand, the defendant admitted that he committed the acts charged but claimed that he was not guilty because he was insane at the time he committed them. Therefore, at his trial, the defendant had the burden of proving his insanity defense. <em>See </em>RSA 628:2 (2007). Consequently, to the extent that media reporting on the Spader trial described the defendant\u2019s involvement in the crime, the defendant admitted as much when he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Although the publicity about Spader\u2019s trial \u201ccalls for inquiry to guard against actual prejudice, it does not ordinarily \u2014 and, we are satisfied, it did not here \u2014 warrant an automatic presumption of prejudice.\u201d <em>Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2917 (finding that co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea a little over a month before jury selection began in defendant\u2019s trial did not warrant a presumption of prejudice so as to require a change of venue).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\n<em>B. Voir Dire</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The defendant next asserts that the trial court erred in failing to grant a change of venue because the \u201c[statements of potential jurors in both the Spader and [the defendant\u2019s] case[ ] confirm that the venue was overwhelmingly exposed to media coverage and hostile public opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">\u201cThe manner in which <em>voir dire </em>is conducted is wholly within the sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d <em>State v. Addison, </em>161 N.H. 300, 303 (2010) (quotation and brackets omitted), and \u201c[n]o hard-and-fast formula <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>dictates the necessary depth or breadth of <em>voir dire,\u201d Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2917. Whether a prospective juror is free from prejudice is a determination to be made in the first instance by the trial court on <em>voir dire. Addison, </em>161 N.H. at 303; <em>see also Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2917 (\u201cJury selection ... is particularly within the province of the trial judge.\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>Mu\u2019Min v. Virginia, </em>500 U.S. 415, 427 (1991) (noting that the trial judge is granted \u201cwide discretion ... in conducting <em>voir dire </em>in the area of pretrial publicity and in other areas of inquiry that might tend to show juror bias\u201d). Accordingly, as recognized by the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">Reviewing courts are properly resistant to second-guessing the trial judge\u2019s estimation of a juror\u2019s impartiality, for that judge\u2019s appraisal is ordinarily influenced by a host of factors impossible to capture fully in the record \u2014 among them, the prospective juror\u2019s inflection, sincerity, demeanor, candor, body language, and apprehension of duty. In contrast to the cold transcript received by the appellate court, the in-the-moment <em>voir dire </em>affords the trial court a more intimate and immediate basis for assessing a venire member\u2019s fitness for jury service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-6\"><em>Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2918 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\"> We will not presume unfairness of a constitutional magnitude simply because the community was aware of the crimes and the charges against the defendant. <em>See Dobbert v. Florida, </em>432 U.S. 282, 303 (1977). \u201cIt is not required... that the jurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.\u201d <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 722.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">In these days of swift, widespread and diverse methods of communication, an important case can be expected to arouse the interest of the public in the vicinity and scarcely any of those best qualified to serve as jurors will not have formed some impression or opinion as to the merits of the case. This is particularly true in criminal cases. To hold that the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused, without more, is sufficient to rebut the .presumption of a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality would be to establish an impossible standard. It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 722-23; <em>see also Laaman, </em>114 N.H. at 800. Indeed, \u201cin today\u2019s \u2018information age,\u2019 where news of community events are disseminated virtually instantaneously by an ever multiplying array of delivery methods, it would be difficult to find 12 jurors who do not at least have some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>knowledge of the facts of an important and tragic incident like this one.\u201d <em>Com. v. Briggs, </em>12 A.3d 291, 313 (Pa. 2011). Thus, the crucial question \u201cis not whether the community remembered the case, but whether the jurors at [the defendant\u2019s] trial had such fixed opinions that they could not judge impartially the guilt of the defendant.\u201d <em>Patton, </em>467 U.S. at 1035; <em>see also Briggs, </em>12 A.3d at 314 (\u201cthe pivotal question in determining whether an impartial jury may be selected is ... whether it is possible for [the] jurors to set aside their impressions or preliminary opinions and render a verdict solely based on the evidence presented to them at trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">We have reviewed the 2,347-page transcript of jury selection and have found no evidence to support the defendant\u2019s argument that a change of venue was required. Rather, the record establishes that the trial court conducted a thorough jury selection process over a period of eight days and went to great lengths to ensure that the empanelled jury was fair and impartial. <em>See State v. Nelson, </em>103 N.H. 478, 484 (1961) (requiring three weeks to pick jury in widely publicized case not evidence of prejudice but rather shows court\u2019s \u201cextreme care\u201d in obtaining an impartial jury); <em>see also Patton, </em>467 U.S. at 1027 (jury selection took ten days and generated 1,186 pages of testimony). For example, on the first day of jury selection, the court provided the prospective jurors with a letter, which explained to them that they had been summoned for the defendant\u2019s ease and provided a detailed explanation of the procedures to be used in jury selection. The letter further informed the prospective jurors that, until their service was completed, they were not allowed \u201cto read any newspaper articles, listen to any radio or television reports, or review any materials on the internet that may concern this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">After the jury selection began, the court again instructed the prospective jurors that, until they were excused from the panel, they were \u201cnot to read, watch, or listen to anything about this case.\u201d In its preliminary instructions, the court stressed the importance of deciding the case based solely upon the evidence presented and the obligation to be fair and impartial. The court also explained the nature of the charges and the insanity defense. The court then read to the venire a series of questions as to which affirmative answers could potentially warrant disqualification. Thereafter, the court met individually with those prospective jurors who answered affirmatively and determined whether disqualification was in fact warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">After two days of preliminary jury selection, the court and the attorneys conducted individual <em>voir dire </em>of 107 prospective jurors. Although the defendant argues that the supplemental questionnaire that he submitted to the court \u201cwould have ensured that each potential juror was questioned about the extent and effect of pretrial publicity and community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>sentiment,\u201d the record demonstrates that, in fact, the court and the parties questioned the prospective jurors regarding the extent and effect of their exposure to pretrial publicity and community sentiment. <em>See Mu\u2019Min, </em>500 U.S. at 431-32 (holding that United States Constitution does not require inquiry about pretrial prejudice to include specific questions regarding content of what each juror has read). The court began its questioning by telling the prospective jurors that there were no right or wrong answers to the questions. <em>See Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2919 (to ensure candor the court admonished each juror \u201cthat there were no right and wrong answers to the questions\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)). The court then asked each prospective juror a series of questions designed to elicit: the juror\u2019s prior knowledge of the case through publicity or otherwise; the extent of the juror\u2019s exposure to the media coverage of the case; whether the juror held or had expressed an opinion on the case, the defendant, or anyone else involved in the case; whether the juror would be able to set aside any information or opinions the juror had heard outside of the courtroom and render a fair and impartial verdict based solely upon the evidence presented; and whether, if the juror remembered something the juror may have read or heard during trial, the juror would be able to set it aside and not share it with other jurors. The attorneys for each side were then allowed up to ten minutes to question each prospective juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Our review of the individual <em>voir dire </em>demonstrates that almost all of the prospective jurors were aware of the crimes before jury selection, and nearly seventy-one percent were aware of the crimes because of exposure to pretrial media coverage. Sixty-five were excused for cause, and less than one third of that group was excused because of bias or preconceptions regarding the issue of the defendant\u2019s sanity. The remainder of those excused for cause were excused for other reasons such as inability to follow the court\u2019s instructions to refrain from media exposure and discussing the case, inability to understand the burden of proof, or because they had personal connections to the crimes or those involved in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">All sixteen seated jurors reported knowing about the crimes prior to jury selection, and most acknowledged that they had seen or heard media accounts of the case. Some reported learning about the case only at the time the crimes occurred, while others reported learning about it through media accounts of Spader\u2019s trial, and slightly more than half of those seated had discussed the crimes prior to jury selection or heard others talking about the case. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motions to excuse seven of the seated jurors for cause, but only five of those motions were based upon prior knowledge about the case or exposure to pretrial media or the opinions of others. In each instance, the court concluded that the juror\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>responses demonstrated that he or she would be able to render a decision based only upon the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">This was not a \u201ctrial atmosphere utterly corrupted by press coverage.\u201d <em>Dobbert, </em>432 U.S. at 303 (quotation and ellipsis omitted). \u201cThere is no suggestion of a circus atmosphere or lynch mob mentality... or of any other community-wide rush to judgment that infected other trials that have been set aside for lack of an impartial jury.\u201d <em>Stafford v. Saffle, </em>34 F.3d 1557, 1566 (10th Cir. 1994). \u201cSimply showing that [most of] the potential jurors knew about the case and that there was extensive pretrial publicity will not suffice to demonstrate that an irrepressibly hostile attitude pervaded the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1567. Indeed, given the nature of the crimes in this case, the defendant could not reasonably have expected to remain anonymous. <em>See Dobbert, </em>432 U.S. at 303; <em>Nelson, </em>103 N.H. at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Nor is it enough to show that some of the prospective jurors discussed the crimes or heard discussions of the case prior to being called for jury selection. This is particularly so since all of the jurors eventually seated stated that they would decide the case based only upon the evidence and not let media accounts or previous discussions affect their ability to decide the case. <em>Cf. Moore v. State, </em>481 S.E.2d 892, 895 (Ga. Ct. App. 1997) (noting that \u201c[s]ome prospective jurors apparently discussed the crime while waiting in the hallway prior to jury selection,\u201d but \u201ceach member of the venire who overheard that discussion denied hearing any opinion regarding the guilt of the defendants and stated the discussion would not affect his or her ability to decide the case based only on the evidence presented\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Moreover, the record in this case does not reveal a \u201cpattern of deep and bitter prejudice . . . throughout the community\u201d that would require a change in venue. <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 727 (quotation omitted). Unlike in <em>Irvin, </em>where the court excused over half of the prospective jurors \u201con challenges for cause as having fixed opinions as to the guilt\u201d of the defendant and \u201calmost 90% of those examined on the point. . . entertained some opinion as to guilt \u2014 ranging in intensity from mere suspicion to absolute certainty,\u201d <em>id., </em>here, less than twenty percent of those individually questioned were excused based upon bias or preconceptions regarding the defendant\u2019s sanity. Likewise, whereas in <em>Irvin, </em>\u201c[e]ight out of the 12 [seated jurors] thought [the defendant] was guilty,\u201d <em>id., </em>in this case, <em>voir dire </em>established that none of the seated jurors had in fact formed an opinion as to the defendant\u2019s sanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Rather, this case is more akin to <em>Murphy v. Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 803 (1975), in which the Supreme Court found that the jury selection process did not permit an inference of actual prejudice where \u201c20 of the 78 persons questioned were excused because they indicated an opinion as to [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>defendant\u2019s] guilt.\u201d The Court stated that while \u201c[t]his may indeed be 20 more than would occur in the trial of a totally obscure person, ... it by no means suggests a community with sentiment so poisoned against [the defendant] as to impeach the indifference of jurors who displayed no animus of their own.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Briggs, </em>12 A.3d at 316-18 (finding no error in denying defendant\u2019s motions to change venue when twelve percent of the prospective jurors \u201cstated that they had a fixed, unalterable opinion of [defendant\u2019s] guilt\u201d). Taking all of the circumstances into account, we conclude that there is ample support for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was unable to demonstrate any actual bias or prejudice in the seated jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Thus, we hold that the defendant has failed to establish that a presumption of prejudice arose from the pretrial publicity or that the publicity infected the jurors to such an extent that he was unable to receive a fair and impartial jury trial. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motions to change venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">As the Federal Constitution offers the defendant no greater protection than the State Constitution under these circumstances, <em>see Skilling, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2912-15; <em>Smart, </em>136 N.H. at 646, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\n<em>III. Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Before trial, both the defendant and the State submitted proposed jury instructions on the issue of insanity. The State\u2019s proposed instructions enumerated specific factors that the jury could consider in determining whether the defendant was insane at the time he committed the crimes. These instructions were drawn from the 2005 drafting committee\u2019s version of recommended New Hampshire Criminal Jury Instructions on insanity. The defendant objected to the State\u2019s proposed instructions but requested that, if the court were to use them, it also include certain other enumerated factors for the jury to consider in determining whether the defendant was insane. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s proposed insanity instructions and ruled that it would \u201cinstruct the jury on the insanity defense consistent with the 2005 draft model jury instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">At trial, the defendant renewed his request that the insanity instruction not specify factors for the jury\u2019s consideration. He claimed that \u201cthe facts of the case have made clear\u201d that the \u201cinstruction unfairly comments on the evidence and suggests that the State\u2019s theory of their case as to the definition of \u2018mental disease\u2019 is favored by the Court, when it is not supported by the law.\u201d The State objected, and the court denied the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could consider certain specified factors in its determination of insanity. The defendant contends that the specified factors overwhelmingly favored the State\u2019s theory of the case. The State disagrees, arguing that \u201c[t]he challenged instructions neither advocated [for] nor repudiated the State\u2019s trial position\u201d but \u201cmerely set forth possibly helpful factors that jurors could consider in weighing the merits of those positions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"> The purpose of a trial court\u2019s jury instructions is to state and explain to the jury, in clear and intelligible language, the rules of law applicable to the case. <em>State v. Cegelis, </em>138 N.H. 249, 252 (1994). When reviewing jury instructions, we determine whether the instructions adequately and accurately explain each element of the offense and reverse only if the instructions did not fairly cover the issues of law arising in the case. <em>See State v. Hernandez, </em>159 N.H. 394, 400 (2009).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">The scope and wording of jury instructions is generally within the sound discretion of the trial court, and any allegations of error will be evaluated by interpreting the disputed instructions in their entirety, as a reasonable juror would have understood them, and in light of all the evidence in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-7\"><em>Cegelis, </em>138 N.H. at 251-52 (quotation omitted). We review the trial court\u2019s decisions on these matters for an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Hernandez, </em>159 N.H. at 400. \u201cTo show that the trial court\u2019s decision is not sustainable, the defendant must demonstrate that the court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>State v. Davidson, </em>163 N.H. 462, 472 (2012) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">In this case, the disputed insanity instruction provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">In deciding whether the defendant was insane, you may consider any evidence of insanity. You may consider, for example, the nature of the defendant\u2019s acts, whether he was suffering from delusions or hallucinations, whether he knew the difference between right and wrong, and whether he knew the nature of his acts. You may also consider whether the defendant acted impulsively or acted with cunning and planning in executing his crimes and escaping or avoiding detection. You may also consider whether he had the power to choose between right and wrong and whether he could recognize acquaintances and transact business or manage his affairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-10\">Now, none of these things, however, is a test for insanity. You may consider all of these things, some of them, or none of them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>or whatever else you think is pertinent to the issue of whether the defendant was sane or insane at the time he committed his various illegal acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The defendant does not challenge the substance of the instruction itself. Indeed, he acknowledges that \u201c[t]he specific factors the trial court used here are similar to those listed in the standard jury instructions on insanity and mentioned in\u201d our previous decisions on the insanity defense. Nevertheless, he argues that \u201c[b]y specifying factors, the trial court gave an instruction that supported the State\u2019s theory of the case and influenced how the jury considered the evidence.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u201cA trial judge\u2019s primary duty in charging the jury is to clarify the issues of the case, and to assist the jury in understanding the questions to be resolved.\u201d <em>State v. King, </em>136 N.H. 674, 677 (1993) (quotation omitted). In New Hampshire, \u201cit is the practice of Superior Court judges not to comment upon the evidence or upon the credibility of witnesses in the charge to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). Such practice is prudent given that \u201cthe influence of the trial judge on the jury is necessarily and properly of great weight and his slightest word or intimation is received with deference, and may prove controlling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Upon review of the instructions in their entirety, and although we do not adopt these instructions as the <em>only </em>way to instruct the jury on the insanity defense, we find no error. The trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[i]t is up [to] you ... to determine as a question of fact whether the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect that caused him to act as charged.\u201d <em>See State v. Fichera, </em>153 N.H. 588, 593 (2006) (explaining that sanity and whether a mental disease or defect caused the charged conduct are questions of fact to be determined by jury). It explained that the jury may consider \u201cany evidence of insanity\u201d and provided the challenged factors as examples of what the jurors <em>could </em>consider as evidence of insanity. However, it made clear that the jury did not have to consider the factors and, in fact, that none of the factors is a test for insanity. <em>See State v. Plante, </em>134 N.H. 456, 461 (1991) (\u201c[A]ny test which measures the capacity of the defendant is a matter of evidence, which falls within the province of the jury to be considered like any other factual issue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The defendant suggests that the court\u2019s instruction erroneously stressed two factors, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe nature of the charged acts and whether [the defendant] knew and could choose between right and wrong.\u201d We disagree. We do not read the instructions as emphasizing any one factor. Moreover, the court instructed the jury that it could consider whatever else it found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>relevant to the issue of insanity. Thus, the instructions left the jurors free to consider any factor they deemed relevant to the issue of insanity, whether or not the factor was mentioned in the instruction. <em>See id. </em>at 462. In accordance with the applicable law on the insanity defense, the trial court also correctly stated that there is no legal definition or test for insanity. <em>See Fichera, </em>153 N.H. at 593 (explaining that \u201cthere is no test for determining whether a defendant is insane\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>Plante, </em>134 N.H. at 461 (\u201cThere is no specific test or criterion which determines the issue of mental illness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Citing statements made by the prosecutor in the State\u2019s closing argument, the defendant asserts that the State\u2019s theory of the case was that he \u201cwas not insane because he exhibited none of the factors contained in the court\u2019s instructions,\u201d and that, since the court provided examples of factors that supported only the State\u2019s theory, \u201cthe court shaped the course of the jury\u2019s deliberation of the evidence.\u201d Simply because the State tailored its closing argument to the enumerated factors that the court instructed the jury that it <em>could </em>consider, does not mean that the instruction improperly supported the State\u2019s theory of the case. <em>Cf United States v. Prawl, </em>168 F.3d 622, 629 (2d Cir. 1999) (stating that the purpose of the jury instruction notice requirement in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \u201cis to allow counsel to conform their arguments to the law as it will thereafter be presented by the judge to the jury\u201d (quotation omitted)); 88 C.J.S. <em>Trial </em>\u00a7 298, at 297-98 (2012) (\u201cCounsel may base his or her argument on the instructions of the court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">This is not a case where the court improperly focused the jury\u2019s attention on specific portions of the State\u2019s evidence and away from the defendant\u2019s theory of the case. <em>See King, </em>136 N.H. at 678 (finding improper the trial court\u2019s references in its jury instructions to specific evidence presented at trial by State and its failure to mention exculpatory testimony of defendant). Nor is this a case in which the trial court\u2019s instructions invaded the exclusive province of the jury in deciding which facts are proved by the evidence. <em>See State v. Ross, </em>141 N.H. 397, 399-400 (1996) (finding that trial court\u2019s instruction invaded the fact-finding function of the jury and eclipsed the permissible preceding statement of law). Further, the court explicitly instructed the jury that the arguments made by counsel \u201care not evidence\u201d and that the jury \u201cmay not consider [the arguments] as evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">In view of the entire charge, we find that a reasonable juror would not have understood the instruction as supporting the State\u2019s theory of the case; rather, it empowered the jury to consider <em>any evidence </em>that it deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>relevant to the issue of the defendant\u2019s insanity. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b52-6\">DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS and CONBOY, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
