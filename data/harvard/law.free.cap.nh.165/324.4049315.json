(Knothe) (collectively, the defendants), appeal an order of the Superior Court (McHugh, J.) denying their motion for summary judgment and granting the cross-motion for entry of final judgment on the issue of indemnity filed by the plaintiffs, JoAnne Gray, Jeffrey Gray, Jeffrey J. Gray, and Jonathan Gray. The defendants also appeal the trial court\u2019s order denying their motion for summary judgment on successor liability. We reverse the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 indemnity claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">The trial court found, or the record supports, the following facts. On or about December 3, 1996, Jeffrey Gray purchased a robe from The Orvis Company (Orvis) for his wife, JoAnne Gray. Orvis had purchased the robe from the manufacturer, Leisure Life. On January 9, 2005, Mrs. Gray was wearing the robe when she added a piece of firewood to her wood stove and the robe caught fire. As result, she was severely burned and suffered extensive injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>In the fall of 2007, the plaintiffs sued the defendants and Orvis along with other parties involved either in the design and distribution of the robe or the manufacture and sale of the wood stove. With respect to the defendants, the plaintiffs asserted numerous claims in connection with the robe, including counts sounding in negligence and strict liability. As to Orvis, the plaintiffs asserted claims of direct liability as well as a strict liability claim premised upon the liability of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In 2008, Leisure Life moved for summary judgment against the plaintiffs, asserting that Leisure Life was purchased by Knothe in 2004 and was a division of Knothe at the time Mrs. Gray sustained her injuries. Leisure Life argued that it was not liable for the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries because it was no longer the same entity that manufactured the robe, and the circumstances of the purchase did not support holding Knothe liable as a successor. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In 2009, Orvis successfully moved to add third-party claims against the defendants for indemnification and contribution. Orvis claimed that it \u201chad no involvement in the design and manufacturing of the robe\u201d and that it \u201cwas simply a \u2018pass-through\u2019 entity.\u201d As a result, Orvis sought indemnity or contribution from the defendants for any damages it ultimately owed to the plaintiffs, including the amount of any judgment against, or settlement by, Orvis. In addition, Orvis asserted that it was entitled to recover the costs and attorney\u2019s fees that it had incurred in defending against the claims asserted by the plaintiffs. In January 2010, Orvis sent a letter to the defendants asserting that it was entitled to indemnification and, therefore, that the defendants should \u201cassume the indemnity and defense of Orvis.\u201d Although the defendants participated in settlement discussions, they did not offer to indemnify or defend Orvis.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">On September 13, 2010, immediately prior to the scheduled start of the trial, all parties except Leisure Life settled with the plaintiffs. The parties involved in the sale and manufacture of the wood stove settled the claims against them for five million dollars. Orvis settled the claims against it for one million dollars and assigned to the plaintiffs \u201cany and all rights to indemnity\u201d that Orvis had against the defendants. The settlement did not extinguish the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The plaintiffs, as Orvis\u2019s assignees, subsequently moved for summary judgment against the defendants on the indemnity claim. They argued that the defendants had an implied duty to indemnify Orvis, and, that the plaintiffs, as assignees of Orvis\u2019s right to indemnity, were entitled to enforce that right. The defendants objected. The trial court deferred its ultimate ruling on the motion until after the trial on the plaintiffs\u2019 underlying claims against the defendants. On January 30, 2012, the jury returned a verdict in the defendants\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Thereafter, the defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that the jury\u2019s finding that the defendants were not liable to the plaintiffs precluded the plaintiffs from recovering on the indemnity claim. The plaintiffs objected and filed a cross-motion for the entry of final judgment. The trial court issued a written order denying the defendants\u2019 motion and granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion. Relying on <em>Morrissette v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>114 N.H. 384 (1974), the court found that \u201cthe verdict had no impact .upon [the plaintiffs\u2019] right to indemnity under the law,\u201d and that the plaintiffs had to prove only Orvis\u2019s potential liability at the time of settlement. The court ruled that the plaintiffs had satisfied their burden and, as a result, awarded them one million dollars based upon the defendants\u2019 implied obligation to indemnify Orvis for its settlement payment to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">With respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, the court found that this claim was \u201cakin to a claim for similar fees in cases where parties elect to litigate the issue of insurance coverage,\u201d and that \u201cif the insured prevails he shall receive court costs and reasonable attorney fees.\u201d Since the plaintiffs had prevailed on the issue of indemnity, the court found that they were \u201centitled to reimbursement of [Orvis\u2019s] defense costs and attorney[\u2019s] fees incurred up until the time of settlement\u201d and awarded the plaintiffs $298,811.73 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">On appeal, the defendants argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for the plaintiffs on the issue of indemnity. They further contend that there is no basis for the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs and that, therefore, the award must be set aside. Finally, the defendants argue that the trial court erred in finding Knothe liable as a successor to Leisure Life.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">When \u201creviewing the trial court\u2019s summary judgment rulings, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to each party in its capacity as the nonmoving party and, if no genuine issue of material fact exists, we determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Coco v. Jaskunas, </em>159 N.H. 515, 518 (2009) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">We first address the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court erred in ruling that they were required to indemnify the plaintiffs, as assignees of Orvis. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\"> We begin by reviewing the law pertaining to indemnity. In New Hampshire, the right to indemnity has historically existed: (1) \u201cwhere the indemnitee\u2019s liability is derivative or imputed by law\u201d; (2) where an implied duty to indemnify exists; or (3) where there is an express duty to indemnify. <em>Hamilton v. Volkswagen of America, </em>125 N.H. 561, 563 (1984) (quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>omitted). In the first situation, we have said that the right to indemnity arises \u201cwhere one is legally required to pay an obligation for which another is primarily liable.\u201d <em>Coco, </em>159 N.H. at 519 (quotation omitted); <em>see also Greenland v. Ford Motor Co., </em>115 N.H. 564, 571 (1975); <em>Morrissette, </em>114 N.H. at 387. This situation typically occurs in tort actions \u201cwhere one who, without active fault on his part, has been compelled by a legal obligation to pay an injured party for injuries caused by active fault of another.\u201d <em>Morrissette, </em>114 N.H. at 387 (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The second situation occurs where there is an implied agreement to indemnify. <em>See Jaswell Drill Corp. v. General Motors Corp., </em>129 N.H. 341, 346 (1987). \u201c[Ijndemnity agreements are rarely to be implied and always to be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>125 N.H. at 564. Nonetheless, an implied agreement to indemnify may exist when an indemnitor performs a service under contract negligently'and, as a result, causes harm to a third party in breach of a nondelegable duty of the indemnitee. <em>Jaswell Drill Corp., </em>129 N.H. at 346. The rationale for finding an implied agreement to indemnify under such circumstances is akin to the rationale for finding a right of indemnity in tort actions in that it is based upon \u201cthe fault of the indemnitor as the source of [the] indemnitee\u2019s liability in the underlying action and, conversely, the indemnitee\u2019s freedom from fault in bringing about the dangerous condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The third situation involves an express duty to indemnify, <em>Hamilton, </em>125 N.H. at 563, which arises when there is an express contract providing for indemnity, <em>see Kessler v. Gleich, </em>161 N.H. 104, 108 (2010). Under such circumstances, the right to indemnity is determined by the specific terms of the contract for indemnity. <em>See id. </em>We construe express indemnity agreements strictly, <em>id., </em>and indemnity arising from an express contract \u201cis not subject to equitable considerations,\u201d <em>Reyburn Lawn Designers v. Plaster Dev\u2019t Co., </em>255 P.3d 268, 274 (Nev. 2011). \u201c[E]xpress indemnity allows contracting parties great freedom to allocate indemnification responsibilities as they see fit, and to agree to protections beyond those afforded by the doctrines of implied or equitable indemnity.\u201d <em>Prince v. Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>202 P.3d 1115, 1120 (Cal. 2009) (quotations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\"> Here, the plaintiffs make no claim that the defendants expressly contracted to indemnify Orvis. The parties agree, as do we, that to the extent that a right of indemnity exists in this case, it arises under the first scenario in that Orvis\u2019s liability is derivative of the defendants\u2019. This form of indemnity has been described as an equitable right implied by law, which is based upon principles of restitution. <em>See Pulte v. Parex, </em>942 A.2d 722, 730-31 (Md. 2008); <em>see also Prince, </em>202 P.3d at 1124 (explaining that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>basis for indemnity is restitution\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)); <em>District of Col. v. Wash. Hosp. Center, </em>722 A.2d 332, 339 (D.C. 1998) (\u201cIndemnity is a form of restitution.\u201d); <em>Oates v. Diamond Shamrock Corp., </em>503 N.E.2d 58, 59 (Mass. App. Ct. 1987) (\u201c[Restitution is the basis for indemnity\u201d). In its most basic sense, indemnity means reimbursement, <em>Stanley v. Kelley, </em>90 N.H. 210, 214 (1939) (\u201cIndemnity imports reimbursement.\u201d), and is based upon \u201cthe concept that one party is unjustly enriched at the expense of another when the other discharges liability that should be the first party\u2019s responsibility to pay,\u201d <em>Oates, </em>503 N.E.2d at 59. In other words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">A person who, in whole or in part, has discharged a duty which is owed by him but which as between himself and another should have been discharged by the other, is entitled to indemnity from the other, unless the payor is barred by the wrongful nature of his conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\"><em>McCullough v. Company, </em>90 N.H. 409, 412 (1939) (quotation omitted), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, as stated in Gagne v. Greenhouses, </em>99 N.H. 292, 293-94 (1954); <em>see also </em>RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: Apportionment of Liability \u00a7 22, at 272 (2000). Thus, unless otherwise provided by contract, in order to seek indemnity, \u201can indemnitee must extinguish the liability of the indemnitor... either by a settlement with the plaintiff that by its terms or by application of law discharges the indemnitor from liability or by satisfaction of judgment that by operation of law discharges the indemnitor from liability.\u201d RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF Torts: Apportionment of Liability \u00a7 22 comment <em>b </em>at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The theory behind this principle \u201cis that the indemnitee has provided a benefit to the indemnitor by fully discharging the indemnitor\u2019s liability, making restitution appropriate.\u201d <em>AVCP Reg. Housing Auth. v. R.A. Vranckaert, </em>47 P.3d 650, 658 (Alaska 2002); <em>see </em>RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF Torts: Apportionment of Liability, Reporters\u2019 Note \u00a7 22 comment <em>b </em>at 276-77. However, \u201c[t]his [is] true only if the indemnitee provided the indemnitor with protection from liability.\u201d RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF Torts: Apportionment of Liability, Reporters\u2019 Note \u00a7 22 comment <em>b </em>at 277. \u201cIndemnification exists to prevent unjust enrichment; such enrichment occurs only when the indemnitee\u2019s payment to the victim protected the indemnitor from any future liability.\u201d <em>C &amp; E Services, Inc. v. Ashland Inc., </em>601 F. Supp. 2d 262, 277 (D.D.C. 2009). \u201cIt would ... be unfair under the basic principles of restitution to make a person pay noncontractual indemnity while he was still liable to the plaintiff.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability, Reporters\u2019 Note \u00a7 22 comment <em>b </em>at 277; <em>C &amp; E Services, Inc., </em>601 F. Supp. 2d at 277 (stating that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>indemnitor remains potentially liable \u201cto the party with whom the indemnitee settled, there is no unfairness that needs rectification\u201d because indemnitor was potentially liable to underlying plaintiff \u201cbefore the settlement and remains\u201d so after settlement). In such a case, the indemnitor \u201chas not been unjustly enriched by the settlement payment to the [underlying] plaintiff.\u201d <em>C &amp; E Services, Inc., </em>601 F. Supp. 2d at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Significantly, the plaintiffs have not cited, nor are we aware of, any cases in which the indemnitor has been required to indemnify the indemnitee when, after settlement, the indemnitor remained potentially liable to the underlying plaintiff. Indeed, according to the <em>Restatement, </em>\u201c[n]o case has permitted noncontractual indemnity against a person still liable to the plaintiff.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability, Reporters\u2019 Note \u00a7 22 comment <em>b </em>at 277; <em>see C &amp; E Services, Inc., </em>601 F. Supp. 2d at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Once an indemnitee has discharged the liability of the indemnitor, either by settlement or judgment, in order to obtain indemnification, the indemnitee must then prove that the indemnitor was primarily liable for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. <em>See Morrissette, </em>114 N.H. at 387; Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability, Reporters\u2019 Note \u00a7 22 comment c at 277 (\u201cA person seeking indemnity must prove that the indemnitor would have been liable to the plaintiff.\u201d). In this way, indemnity is distinguished from contribution because, whereas indemnity shifts \u201cthe entire burden of loss from one tortfeasor who has be\u00e9n compelled to pay it, to another whose act of negligence is the primary cause of the injured party\u2019s harm,\u201d contribution \u201cis partial payment made by each or any of jointly or severally liable tortfeasors who share a common liability to an injured party.\u201d 41 AM. Jur. 2d <em>Indemnity </em>\u00a7 3 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">These principles are consistent with, and reflected in, our comprehensive statutory framework for apportionment of liability and damages among tortfeasors. <em>See </em>RSA 507:7-d to :7-i (2010); <em>see also DeBenedetto v. CLD Consulting Eng\u2019rs, </em>153 N.H. 793, 798 (2006) (discussing the legislative history of RSA 507:7-d to :7-i). RSA 507:7-e, governing apportionment of damages among claimants and tortfeasors, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">I. In all actions, the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">(a) Instruct the jury to determine, or if there is no jury shall find, the amount of damages to be awarded to each claimant and against each defendant in accordance with the proportionate fault of each of the parties; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">(b) Enter judgment against each party liable on the basis of the rules of joint and several liability, except that if any party shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>less than 50 percent at fault, then that party\u2019s liability shall be several and not joint and he shall be <em>liable only for the damages attributable to him.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">(Emphasis added.) We have said that \u201c[t]he legislative history of RSA 507:7-e plainly demonstrates that,\u201d when the legislature amended the statute to its current form, \u201can underlying purpose of the . . . amendment was to relieve defendants involved in personal injury lawsuits from damages exceeding their percentage of actual fault.\u201d <em>Ocasio v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>162 N.H. 436, 446 (2011) (quotations omitted). In addition, RSA 507:7-f, II, addressing contribution among tortfeasors, provides that \u201c[c]ontribution is not available to a person who enters into a settlement with a claimant unless the settlement extinguishes the liability of the person from whom contribution is sought, and then only to the extent that the amount paid in settlement was reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Turning to this case, we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 indemnity claim fails because when Orvis settled with the plaintiffs, it extinguished its own liability, but not that of the defendants. The trial court\u2019s order addressing the settlement states that \u201c[t]his case has been settled as to <em>all defendants except Leisure Life </em>Industries.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In consideration for the receipt of one million dollars and the assignment of Orvis\u2019s indemnity rights against the' defendants, the plaintiffs released Orvis from all claims of liability asserted against it. In contrast, there was no release of liability running to the defendants, and the defendants remained potentially liable to the plaintiffs under the theories of direct liability asserted against them, including the strict liability claim. Indeed, after the settlement with Orvis and the stove defendants, the plaintiffs proceeded to trial on their liability claims against the defendants and, as a result, the defendants bore both the expense of defense and the risk of a substantial adverse verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Although, as the plaintiffs point out, their settlement with Orvis would' have reduced the amount of any judgment against the defendants by the amount of consideration paid, it did not extinguish the defendants\u2019 potential liability to the plaintiffs. <em>See </em>RSA 507:7-h. Since Orvis\u2019s settlement did not extinguish the defendants\u2019 liability, there was no basis for Orvis (or the plaintiffs, as assignees of Orvis) to obtain indemnity from the defendants. <em>See District of Col., </em>722 A.2d at 341-42; Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability \u00a7 22, at 272. The defendants were therefore entitled to judgment, as a matter of law, on the indemnity claim. <em>See United States Brass Corp. v. Dormont Mfg. Co., </em>242 Fed. Appx. 575, 579 (10th Cir. 2007) (plaintiff could not recover in common law indemnity for pre-trial settlement payment because plaintiff\u2019s settlement did not extinguish liability of defendant); <em>C &amp; E Services, Inc., </em>601 F. Supp. 2d at 278 (\u201cSince <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>it is indubitably clear that the settlement did not intend to relieve [the indemnitor] of any further liability and that it was not designed to settle the entire claim that the [underlying plaintiff] had against both of them, [the indemnitee\u2019s] claim for indemnification has to fail.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The plaintiffs argue that <em>Morrissette </em>compels a different result. We disagree. In <em>Morrissette, </em>the defendant did not argue that the third-party plaintiff was not entitled to indemnification because she failed to extinguish the defendant\u2019s liability as to the original claimant, and we did not address that issue. Rather, we addressed the specific question presented for our review, which concerned an indemnitee\u2019s burden of proof as to its own liability in an action for indemnity where the original action settled, <em>i.e., </em>its burden to show that it settled under legal compulsion, rather than as a mere volunteer. <em>See Morrissette, </em>114 N.H. at 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The defendants further argue that the trial court erred in awarding Orvis\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the plaintiffs. We agree. The trial court ruled that the plaintiffs were entitled to reimbursement of Orvis\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs based upon its ruling that they were entitled to indemnification. Since we have found that the trial court erred in ruling that the plaintiffs were entitled to indemnification, we necessarily find that the trial court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In light of our ruling, we need not address the defendants\u2019 argument regarding successor liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b352-8\">Dalianis, C.J., and Conboy and LYNN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
