Thompson, appeals a decision of the 2d Circuit Court \u2014 Lebanon District Division <em>(drone, </em>J.) denying his request for an appeal to superior court for a <em>de novo </em>jury trial and a decision of the Superior Court <em>(Vaughan, </em>J.) denying his petition to allow a misdemeanor appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">The following facts are supported by the record or are taken from our decision in a prior appeal in this case. <em>See State v. Thompson, </em>164 N.H. 447 (2012). The defendant was convicted, following a bench trial in Lebanon District Court, of driving while intoxicated (DWI). <em>See </em>RSA 265-A:2, I (Supp. 2012) (amended 2012); <em>Thompson, </em>164 N.H. at 448. The amended complaint against the defendant alleged two prior convictions, but the State did not enter evidence of those convictions at trial. <em>Thompson, </em>164 N.H. at 448. Rather, the State sought to admit them, over the defendant\u2019s objection, at sentencing. <em>Id. </em>The trial court admitted the evidence and sentenced the defendant to enhanced penalties for a third DWI offense under RSA 265-A:18, IV(b). RSA 265-A:18, IV(b) (Supp. 2012) (amended 2012); <em>Thompson, </em>164 N.H. at 448. Accordingly, the defendant was convicted of a class A misdemeanor. <em>See </em>RSA 265-A:18, IY(b). Had the prior offenses not been admitted, the defendant\u2019s conviction would have been a class B misdemeanor. <em>See </em>RSA 265-A:18,1(a)(1) (Supp. 2012) (amended 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">According to the circuit court order now being appealed, the defendant, at the sentencing hearing, \u201cstated his intent to appeal... to the Supreme Court.\u201d It appears, however, that the district court clerk\u2019s office sent the appeal to the superior court. The defendant then filed in the superior court an assented-to motion to remand the case to the trial court so that the contemplated appeal to this court could be filed. The superior court granted that motion. It appears that the trial court also stayed the defendant\u2019s sentence pending resolution of his appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>On appeal to this court in <em>Thompson, </em>the defendant argued that the trial court erred by imposing an enhanced penalty under RSA 265-A-.18, IV because the State failed to prove at trial the existence of his prior convictions. <em>Thompson, </em>164 N.H. at 448. We disagreed and affirmed the defendant\u2019s class A misdemeanor conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 451. The defendant then notified the trial court of his intent to appeal his conviction and sentence to the superior court and asserted his right to a <em>de novo </em>jury trial. <em>See </em>RSA 599:1 (Supp. 2006) (amended 2011). The trial court ruled that the defendant, having chosen to appeal to this court, was not thereafter entitled to appeal to the superior court for a <em>de novo </em>jury trial. The defendant then petitioned the superior court to allow a misdemeanor appeal pursuant to RSA 599:1 through 599:l-b, arguing that if he had, as the trial court decided, waived his right to appeal to the superior court, it \u201cwas the result of mistake, accident and misfortune.\u201d The superior court denied that motion. The defendant now appeals to this court the decisions of both the trial and superior courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The defendant first challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling that his election to appeal to this court waived his right to a jury trial in superior court. We note, as an initial matter, that he contests whether RSA 502-A:12 precludes him from now appealing his trial court conviction \u201cto the Superior Court for a jury trial where his appeal to this Court was made solely to determine whether his conviction in the [trial court] was properly for a Class A or a Class B misdemeanor.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 502-A:12 (2010). Resolution of this issue requires us to interpret the applicable statutes, which presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. State v. Hynes, </em>159 N.H. 187, 193 (2009).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-6\">In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole. We first examine the language of the statute, and, where possible, we apply the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used. We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language it did not see fit to include. Further, we interpret a statute in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">RSA 502-A:12 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-9\">I. A person sentenced by a district court for a class A misdemeanor after trial or after proceedings pursuant to District Court Rule 2.14 may appeal therefrom to the superior court for a jury trial as provided in RSA 599 ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>II. A person sentenced by a district court for a class A misdemeanor may, <em>if no appeal for a jury trial in superior court is taken, </em>appeal therefrom to the supreme court at the time the sentence is declared or -within 30 days after the sentence is declared. The supreme court\u2019s review shall be limited to questions of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">RSA 502-A:12 (emphasis added). RSA 599:1, in turn, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-6\">A person convicted by a district court of a class A misdemeanor, at the time the sentence is declared, may appeal therefrom to obtain a <em>de novo </em>jury trial in the superior court, which shall hear the appeal .... If, after a jury trial in the superior court, the defendant is found guilty, the superior court shall sentence the defendant, and the defendant may appeal questions of law arising therefrom to the supreme court. In the event the defendant waives the right to a jury trial after the case has been appealed, the superior court shall forthwith remand the case to the district court for imposition of the sentence originally imposed by the district court, and the defendant may appeal questions of law arising therefrom to the supreme court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">RSA 599:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">By its plain language, RSA 502-A:12 permits a person convicted in district (now circuit) court of a class A misdemeanor to appeal directly to this court \u201cif no appeal for a jury trial in superior court is taken.\u201d RSA 502-A:12. It does not allow a defendant to pursue both avenues of appeal, either simultaneously or consecutively. Accordingly, the statute requires a defendant to choose between appealing to superior court for a <em>de novo </em>jury trial or to this court for the resolution of questions of law. If the defendant chooses a <em>de novo </em>jury trial and is again convicted, he may then appeal that subsequent conviction to this court. <em>See </em>RSA 599:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">The defendant argues that he could not know that he was properly convicted of a class A misdemeanor until he appealed the enhanced penalty issue to this court and that \u201cRSA 502-A:12 never contemplated such a dilemma.\u201d His argument rests upon the premise that if the trial court had erred in using prior convictions not proved at trial to enhance his sentence \u2014 a contention we rejected in <em>Thompson, see Thompson, </em>164 N.H. at 451 \u2014 he would have been convicted of a class B, rather than class A, misdemeanor and, therefore, would not have been entitled to a jury trial. <em>See State v. Foote, </em>149 N.H. 323, 324 (2003) (noting that \u201c[a]s a matter of law, [a] defendant is not entitled to a jury trial on a class B misdemeanor\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number><em>see also </em>RSA 599:l-c (2001) (person sentenced by district court for violation or class B misdemeanor may appeal to supreme court). He argues that he could not \u201cknow whether he was properly convicted in the [trial court] of a Class A or a Class B misdemeanor\u201d until he obtained a ruling from this court, and that until we rendered our decision in <em>Thompson, </em>he \u201cdid not believe any appeal to the Superior Court was either advisable or even possible.\u201d He asserts that \u201c[i]n order to fully define his options ... [he] had to appeal to this Court to interpret the DWI statute ... to determine whether he had been convicted of an offense for which a jury trial was necessary and available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The defendant\u2019s statutory argument is unavailing. Both RSA 502-A:12, II and RSA 599:1 permit a defendant to appeal a class A misdemeanor \u201cat the time the sentence is declared,\u201d or within a limited time thereafter. At the time the defendant\u2019s sentence was declared by the trial court, he had been unambiguously convicted of a class A misdemeanor. That the defendant believed that classification was erroneous and intended to challenge it does not alter the conviction\u2019s validity <em>at that time </em>for purposes of determining the available avenues of appellate review. \u201c[U]nless and until [a defendant\u2019s] conviction is overturned, it is deemed valid ....\u201d <em>Stewart v. Bader, </em>154 N.H. 75, 85 (2006) (noting that a conviction is entitled to preclusive effect under collateral estoppel doctrine unless and until overturned); <em>cf. United States v. Coleman, </em>458 F.3d 453, 457 n.1 (6th Cir. 2006) (noting that \u201ccriminal convictions remain valid and in force pending appeal, unless the district court rules otherwise\u201d). It would fly in the face of the rule treating convictions as valid until overturned to allow a defendant to bypass the clear statutory procedure for appeals based upon his belief that the trial court erred. <em>Cf. Hansen v. State, </em>824 P.2d 1384, 1389 (Alaska Ct. App. 1992) (opining that \u201c[w]hen a defendant\u2019s conviction is on appeal, it appears to us unreasonable for that defendant to assume that the conviction is somehow invalid and that he is not a convicted felon for purposes of\u2019 statute prohibiting felon from possessing concealable firearm).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">We now turn to the defendant\u2019s constitutional argument. Specifically, he contends that by choosing a direct appeal to this court, he did not waive his right to a jury trial, as guaranteed by Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We first address the defendant\u2019s claim under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid our analysis. <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">It is undisputed that the defendant was entitled to a jury trial. <em>See Opinion of the Justices (DWI Jury Trials), </em>135 N.H. 538, 541-42 (1992) (noting that Part I, Article 15 of the State Constitution \u201cguarantees ... the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>right to trial by jury either in the first instance or on appeal to the superior court... to all criminal defendants facing the possibility of incarceration\u201d); RSA 265-A:18, IV (b)(2) (outlining terms of mandatory incarceration for a third DWI offense). \u201cThe constitutional right to trial by jury is one of central and fundamental importance, and courts do not presume acquiescence in the waiver of such a right.\u201d <em>Foote, </em>149 N.H. at 325 (quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The defendant contends that \u201c[t]he facts and circumstances of this case do not support a valid waiver of [his] right to a jury trial\u201d because \u201cit cannot be fairly argued that he intentionally, voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his right to [a] jury trial in Superior Court.\u201d \u2018Whether the facts support a valid waiver is a question of law which we review <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>There is, however, \u201cno set formula by which to validate a waiver of a jury trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">We have stated generally that \u201cwhen waiving a constitutional right, one must do so voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325 (quotation and brackets omitted). The defendant also argues, citing, among other cases, <em>State v. Hewitt, </em>128 N.H. 557 (1986), that \u201c[w]here a defendant is silent as to his intent to waive a jury trial, a court must hold some colloquy to assure that he has a full understanding of that waiver.\u201d <em>But see Foote, </em>149 N.H. at 325 (noting that \u201cthe trial court is not always required to conduct a colloquy to establish a valid waiver unless the waiver is tantamount to a guilty plea\u201d and explaining that a colloquy is required in the latter case \u201cbecause the defendant forfeits not only the right to trial by jury, but also the right to confront accusers as well as the right against self-incrimination\u201d). He represents that no colloquy was held in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">In <em>State v. Bousquet, </em>133 N.H. 485 (1990), we found <em>Hewitt </em>not controlling in light of factual differences, the principal one being that <em>Bousquet, </em>unlike <em>Hewitt, </em>involved an appeal in our two-tier criminal system. <em>Bousquet, </em>133 N.H. at 489. In <em>Bousquet, </em>the defendant had appealed his district court misdemeanor convictions to superior court for a <em>de novo </em>jury trial but twice failed to appear at the time scheduled for trial. <em>Id. </em>at 486. The superior court remanded the case for imposition of the defendant\u2019s sentences. <em>Id. </em>at 487. On appeal to this court, the defendant argued that his failure to appear for trial did not constitute a valid waiver of his right to a jury trial, and asserted that, under <em>Hewitt, </em>he could \u201conly waive his State constitutional right to a jury trial with a personal waiver which indicates his understanding of this right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489. We disagreed, holding that \u201cthe defendant failed to prosecute his appeal within the meaning of RSA 599:3, and can reasonably be deemed to have waived his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>right to a trial by jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492. Accordingly, we held that \u201cthe superior court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to reinstate his appeals [from district court to superior court for a <em>de novo </em>jury trial] did not unconstitutionally infringe upon\u201d his right to a jury trial under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">In <em>Bousquet, </em>by holding that the defendant could \u201creasonably <em>be deemed to have waived </em>his right to a trial by jury,\u201d <em>id. </em>(emphasis added), we recognized that in cases such as this, \u201cthe issue [is] not \u2018waiver\u2019 in the sense of voluntary relinquishment of a known right, but \u2018deemed waiver,\u2019 \u201d <em>Preston v. Seay, </em>541 F. Supp. 898, 899 (D. Mass. 1981), <em>aff'd, </em>684 F.2d 172 (1st Cir. 1982). In other words, RSA 502-A:12 dictates that by taking a direct appeal from a class A misdemeanor conviction to this court, a defendant must forego an appeal to superior court for a <em>de novo </em>trial to a jury; thus, he is deemed to have waived his right to a jury trial. <em>Cf. Preston, </em>541 F. Supp. at 900 (recognizing \u201cMassachusetts\u2019 doctrine that \u2018solid default\u2019 of appearance constitutes a \u2018deemed waiver\u2019 of the right to jury trial\u201d). The task before us is to determine whether that deemed waiver violates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">In <em>Bousquet, </em>we explicitly noted that our interpretation of Part I, Article 15 was \u201cguided by the reasoning of <em>Preston v. Seay,\u201d Bousquet, </em>133 N.H. at 491, which involved Massachusetts\u2019s then-existing two-tier criminal system, <em>see Preston, </em>541 F. Supp. at 899; <em>see also </em>Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 278, \u00a7 18 (1981) (amended 1993, 1996). That system, we noted, was similar to our own. <em>Bousquet, </em>133 N.H. at 488. In addition, the issue in <em>Preston </em>was on all fours with the issue in <em>Bousquet; </em>namely, whether \u201cMassachusetts act[ed] within constitutionally permissible limits in declaring that [the] petitioner lost his right to jury trial because he inexcusably failed to appear as directed\u201d for his <em>de novo </em>jury trial in Massachusetts\u2019s two-tier system. <em>Preston, </em>541 F. Supp. at 899. Here, the asserted deemed waiver is not a default but an affirmative election. Nevertheless, we again find <em>Preston </em>instructive. The petitioner in <em>Preston </em>sought to justify his absence at the time his case was called for trial \u201con the ground that he and his counsel understood that the case was set for pretrial conference and not for trial on that date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He argued, therefore, that the Commonwealth failed to show \u201cthat he made a knowing and intelligent waiver of jury trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant in this case similarly contends that the facts here do not show an intentional, voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver because he never \u201cindicated in any way that he intended to waive or believed he was waiving his right to [a] jury trial,\u201d but rather made an \u201cunequivocal and uncontested assertion of his intent to exercise\u201d that right. Specifically, in his assented-to motion to remand his appeal from the superior to the trial court, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>defendant stated that he sought the remand \u201cwithout prejudice to appeal to [the superior court] pursuant to RSA 599:1 should the [supreme court] deny his appeal and affirm the [trial court\u2019s] rulings, conviction, and sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Even assuming that the defendant did not subjectively intend to waive his right to a jury trial, we find his deemed waiver to be constitutionally valid. In upholding the deemed waiver in <em>Preston, </em>the court noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">Massachusetts\u2019 doctrine that \u201csolid default\u201d of appearance constitutes a \u201cdeemed waiver\u201d of the right to jury trial... is explicitly reasoned on the ground that \u201cwaiver\u201d may be held to have occurred even though it is not found that defendant had a state of mind, or by his actions manifested to others that he had a state of mind, of being willing to give up his right to jury trial....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\">... [U]nder Massachusetts law, a defendant may lose the right to jury trial because of a deemed waiver incident to a \u201csolid default\u201d of appearance, whether or not the defendant understood his right to jury trial and meant to, or manifested that he meant to, give up that right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 900-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Underlying the <em>Preston </em>court\u2019s reasoning in giving effect to the deemed waiver is the recognition that states may, within limits, regulate the manner of exercising the right to trial by jury. <em>See id. </em>at 901 (\u201c[A] state may impose reasonable regulations on the exercise of even the most precious rights.\u201d). Thus, the United States Supreme Court, in an opinion upholding Massachusetts\u2019s two-tiered criminal system, held: \u201cThe modes of exercising federal constitutional rights have traditionally been left, within limits, to state specification. In this case, Massachusetts absolutely guarantees trial by jury to persons accused of serious crimes, and the manner it has specified for exercising this right is fair and not unduly burdensome.\u201d <em>Ludwig v. Massachusetts, </em>427 U.S. 618, 630 (1976). Similarly, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts long ago rejected the contention that a default based upon a failure to comply with the statutory procedure for appealing a conviction to the superior court for a <em>de novo </em>jury trial violates the Massachusetts Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-10\">[The statute] gives any person convicted before a justice of the peace or police court the right to appeal to the superior court and to have a trial by jury, and makes regulations which are reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>able and necessary as to the mode in which he may enter and prosecute his appeal. If he neglects so to enter and prosecute his appeal, he waives his right of a trial by jury, and the provision ... that he may thereupon be defaulted and sentenced, is not unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-5\"><em>Commonwealth v. Whitney, </em>108 Mass. 5, 6-7 (1871) (citation omitted); <em>see Com. v. Francis, </em>374 N.E.2d 1207, 1212 (Mass. 1978) (holding, following <em>Whitney, </em>that defendant was deemed to have waived right to a <em>de novo </em>jury trial where failure to appear at <em>de novo </em>trial \u201cwas due to his own neglect in not informing the clerk\u2019s office of his change of address\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Also informing the court\u2019s decision in <em>Preston, </em>and our decision in <em>Bousquet, </em>was the United States Supreme Court\u2019s dismissal of appeals from the decisions in <em>Francis </em>and <em>Commonwealth v. O\u2019Clair, </em>374 N.E.2d 1212 (1978) (following <em>Francis </em>on deemed waiver issue), \u201cfor want of a substantial federal question,\u201d <em>Francis v. Massachusetts, </em>439 U.S. 805 (1978); <em>O\u2019Clair v. Massachusetts, </em>439 U.S. 805 (1978). <em>See Bousquet, </em>133 N.H. at 490; <em>Preston, </em>541 F. Supp. at 902. Thus, in <em>Bousquet, </em>we held that <em>\u201cFrancis </em>and <em>O\u2019Clair, </em>and the dismissal of their appeals by the Supreme Court, will control the decision here unless a new doctrinal development has arisen since these dismissals that mandates a different result.\u201d <em>Bousquet, </em>133 N.H. at 491. We note that the defendant here has cited no such new doctrinal development.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">With the foregoing in mind, we reiterate that RSA 502-A:12 \u201cabsolutely guarantees trial by jury to persons\u201d convicted in circuit court of a class A misdemeanor, and dictates, as \u201cthe manner . . . specified for exercising this right\u201d that the defendant may not <em>also </em>\u2014 either prior to, concurrently, or after his appeal to superior court \u2014 appeal that same circuit court conviction to this court. <em>Ludwig, </em>427 U.S. at 630. In essence, RSA 502-A:12 limits a defendant to one bite at the apple. Should he choose the <em>de novo </em>jury trial in superior court and again be convicted there, he may of course appeal <em>that </em>conviction to this court. RSA 599:1. We conclude that this procedure \u201cacts as a reasonable regulation on the exercise of the right to a jury trial,\u201d <em>Bousquet, </em>133 N.H. at 492, and is \u201cfair and not unduly burdensome.\u201d <em>Ludwig, </em>427 U.S. at 630. We further conclude that application of this procedure to the defendant in this case, resulting in the deemed waiver of his right to a jury trial, does not offend our State Constitution. Because the State Constitution provides the defendant at least as much protection as the Federal Constitution under these circumstances, <em>see Bousquet, </em>133 N.H. at 491-92; <em>Ludwig, </em>427 U.S. at 630; <em>Preston, </em>541 F. Supp. at 901, 904, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>Having reached this conclusion, we find unavailing the defendant\u2019s contention that he could not have resolved the issue of whether he was properly convicted of a class A or class B misdemeanor by appeal to the superior court because that appeal would have vacated his conviction completely. <em>See State v. Green, </em>105 N.H. 260, 261 (1964) (noting that appeal of a conviction under RSA 599:1 has the effect of \u201cvacat[ing] that judgment and transferring] the whole proceeding to the Superior Court, there to be tried de novo on the original complaint, unless amended or on an information substituted for the original complaint\u201d). Even assuming the defendant is correct, his contention merely highlights that he was put to the choice of appealing the classification of the conviction or trying the case anew, presumably in an attempt to gain an acquittal. As we herein hold, that choice does not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Finally, the defendant presents the question as to whether, even if he waived his right to a jury trial, that waiver was the result of \u201chonest mistake, accident, or misfortune\u201d and, therefore, justice requires, \u201cunder the peculiar circumstances of this case,\u201d that he be allowed an appeal for a <em>de novo </em>jury trial in the superior court pursuant to RSA 599:l-b. <em>See </em>RSA 599:l-b (2001). That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-6\">Any person aggrieved by a decision of a district or municipal court who was prevented from appealing therefrom, as provided in RSA 599:1..., through mistake, accident or misfortune, and not from his own neglect, may petition the superior court at any time within 30 days from the time the sentence is declared, to be allowed an appeal, setting forth his interest, his reason for appealing and the cause of his delay. The court may make such order thereon as justice may require.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-7\"><em>Id. </em>The defendant argues that the superior court unsustainably exercised its discretion in denying his petition to allow a misdemeanor appeal without first holding a hearing. He contends that \u201c[t]he record certainly contains no support for the Superior Court\u2019s decision that [he] made an affirmative choice to forgo his right to jury trial,\u201d and that \u201c[a] hearing on that issue would have made it clear that this was not the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\"> \u201cWe will not disturb an order denying a request for an evidentiary hearing unless a party establishes that it was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of the party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>State v. McGurk, </em>163 N.H. 584, 587 (2012). The defendant cannot make such a showing. Because we have found his deemed waiver to be constitutionally valid as a matter of law \u2014 even assuming that he did not subjectively intend to waive his right to a jury trial \u2014 the superior court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing, and its denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s RSA 599:l-b petition, does not constitute error. We find no unsustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b810-6\">DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY, LYNN and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
