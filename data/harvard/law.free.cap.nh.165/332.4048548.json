(father), appeals an order of the 6th Circuit Court \u2014 Franklin Family Division <em>(Gordon, </em>J.) terminating his parental rights. <em>See </em>RSA 170-C:5 (2002 &amp; Supp. 2012). He argues that the evidence does not support the family division\u2019s findings: (1) that he failed to support, educate, and care for Sophia-Marie; and (2) that termination of his parental rights is in Sophia-Marie\u2019s best interest. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-17\">The record supports the following facts. Sophia-Marie was born on November 10,2008. She lived with the father and her mother, the petitioner (mother), until November 2009, when the father moved out. In February 2010, the mother filed a parenting petition seeking full custody of Sophia-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Marie. The trial court granted the mother primary residential responsibility for Sophia-Marie until further hearing and awarded the father regular supervised parenting time.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">On August 17, 2010, the father was incarcerated in the New Hampshire State Prison as a result of convictions for the possession and sale of drugs. On December 6, the trial court issued a final decree and parenting plan awarding the mother sole custody of Sophia-Marie. The court recommended that the father have no visitation with Sophia-Marie while he was in prison, but noted that after he was released from prison he could file a motion for the court to consider \u201cwhether he should have parenting rights.\u201d The court further ordered the father to pay $50 a month in child support, which would accrue as an arrearage during his incarceration \u201cto be paid after he obtains employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">During his incarceration, the father sent at least sixteen letters to Sophia-Marie between October 8, 2010, and October 17, 2011. The father also made telephone calls to the mother and Sophia-Marie between November 2010 and February 2011. The mother then changed her telephone number so that the father could no longer contact them. The father testified that he continued to call for a few more months because he \u201cthought maybe the phone was just turned off.\u201d In November 2011, after being released to a halfway house, the father telephoned the child\u2019s maternal grandmother in an attempt to contact the mother and Sophia-Marie. The grandmother hung up on him. She then advised prison authorities that she did not want the father contacting her. The father testified that a prison official told him that further attempts to contact the mother could result in his return to prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">On February 13, 2012, the father was released from incarceration. In April, he filed a motion seeking to reinstate visitation with Sophia-Marie. In August, the mother filed a petition seeking termination of the father\u2019s parental rights on grounds of abandonment and nonsupport. <em>See </em>RSA 170-C:5, I, II (2002). That same month, the court held a hearing on the father\u2019s motion seeking visitation and, thereafter, issued an order awarding the father supervised visitation with Sophia-Marie. However, no visitation occurred because visitation was thereafter suspended pending resolution of the mother\u2019s termination petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">On February 20, 2013, the court held a hearing on the termination petition. At the hearing, the mother testified that she and Sophia-Marie live with the mother\u2019s fianc\u00e9. She stated that Sophia-Marie refers to him as \u201cdaddy\u201d and that, if the termination petition were granted, he would adopt Sophia-Marie. The mother testified that she did not inform Sophia-Marie about the letters that the father had sent and that, although she has not told Sophia-Marie that he is her father, she plans to do so eventually. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>further testified that the only child support payment she had received from the father since his release from incarceration was in December 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">At the final hearing, the father admitted that, prior to his incarceration, he was not a very good father to Sophia-Marie, but that he was now committed to being in her life. He testified that it does not bother him that Sophia-Marie refers to the mother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 as \u201cdaddy\u201d and that he believes that the relationship Sophia-Marie has with the mother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is good for her. He testified that he obtains sporadic employment from his father as a painter and remodeler, but that he was currently \u201con leave\u201d because there was \u201cno work temporarily.\u201d He stated that, although he did not provide financial support for Sophia-Marie prior to his incarceration, he had started paying child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Sophia-Marie\u2019s guardian ad litem (GAL) submitted a detailed final report that recommended that the termination petition be denied. At the hearing, the GAL testified that this was not an easy decision. He stated that the father appears to be a changed man and has \u201cmade an effort to turn his life around [and] he wants to be involved in [his] daughter\u2019s life.\u201d When asked by the court whether he thought it was in Sophia-Marie\u2019s best interest to create a relationship with the father, the GAL testified that he had spoken with the father\u2019s parole officer and counselor and \u201cthey both think he\u2019s doing well,\u201d but that the father\u2019s \u201ctrack record\u201d concerned him. However, he also expressed concern that, if the termination petition were granted and the father \u201chas pulled it together,\u201d then Sophia-Marie \u201cwould . . . miss[ ] out on [a] relationship\u201d with her father. The GAL stated, \u201cI don\u2019t have ... a crystal ball.\u201d He later said, \u201cI know what we have, but I\u2019m just not sure what the future will hold, and I\u2019m not sure how to weigh the risks and benefits of that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In its termination order, the court found that the father had not abandoned Sophia-Marie, but that he had failed to support, educate, and care for her. <em>See </em>RSA 170-C:5, II. The court also determined that it was in Sophia-Marie\u2019s best interest to terminate the father\u2019s parental rights. The father\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Parental rights are \u201cnatural, essential, and inherent\u201d within the meaning of Part I, Article 2 of the New Hampshire Constitution. <em>In re Jack L., </em>161 N.H. 611, 614 (2011) (quotation omitted). The dominant consideration in termination proceedings under RSA chapter 170-C (2002 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2012) is the welfare of the child, which prevails over the interests of the parents. <em>In re Jack L., </em>161 N.H. at 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Before a court may order the termination of a parent\u2019s rights, the petitioning party must prove a statutory ground for termination beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Haley K., </em>163 N.H. 247, 249 (2012); <em>see </em>RSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>170-C:5; RSA 490-D:2, VII (2010) (authorizing family division to exercise jurisdiction over termination of parental rights cases under RSA chapter 170-C). Once a statutory ground is established, the court must then consider whether termination is in the child\u2019s best interest. <em>In re Adam R., </em>159 N.H. 788, 792 (2010). Such a determination requires assessment of which of the possible alternative dispositional orders is the most desirable, under a standard giving priority to the assumed interest of the child. <em>In re Shannon M., </em>146 N.H. 22, 28 (2001); <em>In re Adam R., </em>159 N.H. at 792 (in weighing fundamental rights of parent against best interest of child under RSA chapter 170-C, dominant consideration is welfare of child, which must prevail over interest of parent). We will affirm the trial court\u2019s order unless it is unsupported by the evidence or plainly erroneous as a matter of law. <em>See In re Haley K., </em>163 N.H. at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">As a threshold matter, the mother asserts that we should dismiss the father\u2019s appeal because he has failed to allege that the court\u2019s order was plainly erroneous as a matter of law. We disagree. The father argues that the trial court erred in terminating his parental rights because the mother failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he did not adequately support, educate, and care for Sophia-Marie and that termination was in Sophia-Marie\u2019s best interest. Thus, he contends that the trial court\u2019s decision terminating his parental rights was unsupported by the evidence and, therefore, erroneous as a matter of law. We therefore decline to dismiss his appeal on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The father first argues that the mother failed to \u201cprovide sufficient evidence to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [he], although financially able to do so, had failed to support\u201d Sophia-Marie under RSA 170-C:5, II. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">RSA 170-C:5, II authorizes termination when,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\"><em>although the parents are financially able, </em>they have substantially and continuously neglected to provide the child with necessary subsistence, education or other care necessary for his mental, emotional, or physical health or have substantially and continuously neglected to pay for such subsistence, education or other care when legal custody is lodged with others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">RSA 170-C:5, II (emphasis added). Because the mother has sole legal custody of Sophia-Marie, she had the burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the father was \u201cfinancially able\u201d but nonetheless had \u201csubstantially and continuously neglected to pay for [the child\u2019s necessary] subsistence, education or other care.\u201d RSA 170-C:5, II.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The statute does not define, and we have not addressed, what it means to be \u201cfinancially able\u201d in this context. We need not do so here, however, because the record contains scant evidence as to the father\u2019s financial circumstances. The evidence concerning the father\u2019s employment was limited to testimony that he was sporadically employed by his father, but that he was currently \u201con leave\u201d because there was \u201ctemporarily\u201d no work. The mother had the heavy burden to produce evidence demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the father was \u201cfinancially able\u201d to pay for Sophia-Marie\u2019s care, but substantially and continuously neglected to do so. The mere fact that the father had sporadic employment does not establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, his ability to provide for Sophia-Marie.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The mother points to the father\u2019s fianee\u00e9\u2019s opinion that he is a good provider for her family to show that he was \u201cfinancially able\u201d to provide for Sophia-Marie. The fact that the father\u2019s fiance\u00e9 believes that the father is \u201ca good provider\u201d for her family, however, does not establish that the father is \u201cfinancially able\u201d to support Sophia-Marie. Moreover, although the mother testified, and the trial court found, that the father was not current on his court-ordered child support payments, in the absence of any evidence demonstrating his ability to make such payments, the mother failed to meet her burden of proving he was \u201cfinancially able.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">To the extent that the court relied upon the father\u2019s failure to pay child support during his incarceration as evidence that the mother met her burden, this was error. It is true that incarceration did not absolve the father of his parental obligation to provide for the care of his child. <em>See In re Haley K., </em>163 N.H. at 252. However, the final decree on the parenting plan provided that the father\u2019s child support obligation would accrue as an arrearage during his incarceration \u201cto be paid after he obtains employment.\u201d Thus, the father\u2019s failure to pay child support while he was incarcerated was anticipated, and his obligation to do so was postponed, by the family division. Therefore, the father\u2019s failure to pay support during his incarceration cannot be used to meet the mother\u2019s burden under RSA 170-C:5, II. <em>Cf. In re Sheena B., </em>139 N.H. 179, 184-85 (1994) (lack of contact when father was subject to restraining order prohibiting contact with child was not evidence of abandonment where record did not support a finding that father engaged in conduct that he knew, or should have known, would lead to loss of opportunity to see his child). Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence did not support the trial court\u2019s finding that the mother proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the father failed to provide for Sophia-Marie\u2019s support, education, or care under RSA 170-C:5, II. Therefore, that finding was erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">In light of our determination that the mother failed to prove a statutory ground for termination, we need not address the trial court\u2019s finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>termination of the father\u2019s parental rights was in the best interest of Sophia-Marie. <em>See In re Lisa H., </em>134 N.H. 188, 193 (1991) (noting that trial court\u2019s consideration of child\u2019s best interest is necessary only after finding one of the statutory conditions for termination of parental rights). However, because this issue could arise in a future proceeding between these parties and because both parties discuss it in their briefs, we take the opportunity to explain why, on this record, the trial court erred in its finding. <em>Cf. George v. Al Hoyt &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>162 N.H. 123, 138 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The court determined that termination of the father\u2019s parental rights was in Sophia-Marie\u2019s best interest based upon the GAL\u2019s report and \u201cthe evidence received at the hearing.\u201d The court observed that Sophia-Marie \u201chas no bond with or connection to [the father] and is apparently unaware of his existence.\u201d The court concluded that \u201c[attempting to reintroduce [the father] into [Sophia-Marie\u2019s] life at this point would be difficult and confusing\u201d and the mother\u2019s fianc\u00e9, \u201cwhom she already considers to be her father, is willing and prepared to adopt her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">We recognize that the difficulty and confusion that may result from reintroducing the father to Sophia-Marie is a factor to be considered in assessing whether termination of the father\u2019s parental rights is in Sophia-Marie\u2019s best interest. <em>Cf. In re Jessica B., </em>121 N.H. 291, 296 (1981) (upholding termination of parental rights where part of basis for termination was that child had not lived with mother for nearly five years and saw mother only occasionally). Sophia-Marie has not seen the father since she was nearly two years old. She is now almost five years old and, in that time, she has developed a strong relationship with the mother\u2019s fianc\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">However, the father has endeavored to maintain a relationship with Sophia-Marie, and we cannot ignore the fact that to the extent that Sophia-Marie does not know her father, it is, in part, due to the mother\u2019s decision not to disclose the father\u2019s attempts to contact her or even that he is her father. It cannot be assumed that termination is in the best interest of a child where the child\u2019s lack of knowledge of the parent whose rights are being terminated is due, in part, to the other parent\u2019s efforts to thwart attempts made to establish a relationship with the child. <em>Cf. In the Matter of Miller &amp; Todd, </em>161 N.H. 630, 641 (2011) (stating that \u201cthe obstruction by a custodial parent of visitation between a child and the noncustodial parent may, if continuous, constitute behavior so inconsistent with the best interests of the child as to raise a strong possibility that the child will be harmed\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>In re Sheena B., </em>139 N.H. at 184 (finding no statutory abandonment by one parent where separation from the child is caused solely by the other parent). Although it might be difficult and confusing for Sophia-Marie to be reintroduced to her father, we cannot say, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>under the facts of this case, that it would be in her best interest to terminate his parental rights and deny her the opportunity of reunification. <em>Cf. In re Lisa H., </em>134 N.H. at 193 (child\u2019s identification of foster parents as \u201cmom\u201d and \u201cdad\u201d was one factor to consider in conjunction with other factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Moreover, there is no evidence that the strength of the relationship Sophia-Marie has with the mother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 would be disrupted if the father\u2019s parental rights are not terminated. The mother has legal and physical custody of Sophia-Marie, and she will remain with both the mother and the mother\u2019s fianc\u00e9, absent further court order. The record does not reflect any effort by the father to acquire legal and physical custody of his daughter or to disrupt the relationship that she has with the mother\u2019s fianc\u00e9. Indeed, the father testified that he believes the relationship Sophia-Marie has with the mother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is good for her. The father merely wants the right to visit with his daughter to rebuild their relationship. <em>Cf. In re William A., </em>142 N.H. 598, 601-02 (1998) (termination not in best interest of child where mother merely wanted to visit with child and had consented to step-mother\u2019s appointment as legal guardian).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Furthermore, the evidence suggests that the father has enhanced his ability to have a positive relationship with Sophia-Marie. During his incarceration he completed a parenting class \u201cdesigned to promote healthy parenting skills\u201d and \u201cresponsible [fatherhood.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(evidence that mother had enhanced her ability to parent where she was participating in parenting classes supported denying termination petition). The GAL testified that the father has \u201cmade an effort to turn his life around [and] he wants to be involved in [his] daughter\u2019s life.\u201d The GAL testified that he spoke with the father as well as the father\u2019s counselor and parole officer, and it appears that the father has changed his life. We recognize the GAL\u2019s concern that the father\u2019s future behavior cannot be predicted. However, we cannot say that the inability to predict the father\u2019s future behavior supports a finding that termination is in Sophia-Marie\u2019s best interest. Indeed, the GAL also testified that he was concerned that if termination were ordered, Sophia-Marie would miss out on having a relationship with her father. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">We note that trial courts have broad discretion in managing visitation and a child\u2019s contact with noncustodial parents. <em>See In the Matter of Miller &amp; Todd, </em>161 N.H. at 640. This discretion affords trial courts various means by which to protect a child from the difficulty and confusion associated with reunification, short of terminating parental rights. As we have said before, termination of a parent\u2019s legal bond to a child is a solemn and irreversible event of constitutional import. <em>See In re William A., </em>142 N.H. at 602. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Although termination is sometimes required to protect a child\u2019s best interest, this is not such a case. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in finding that termination was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b360-6\">Hicks, Lynn and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
