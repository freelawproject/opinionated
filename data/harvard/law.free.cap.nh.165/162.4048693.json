We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">The jury could have found the following. On the evening of June 25,2010, New Hampshire Fish and Game Department Conservation Officers Christopher McKee and Geoffrey Pushee were on patrol on Pawtuckaway Lake in Nottingham when they observed a boat driven by the defendant traveling at full speed in a \u201cno wake\u201d zone. The officers signaled for the defendant to stop, but he turned his boat around and sped away. McKee later caught up with the defendant under a bridge, identified himself, and told the defendant to stop. In response, the defendant uttered profanities and attempted to back out from under the bridge. McKee was able to maneuver his boat alongside the defendant\u2019s boat and announced that he was going to board it. The defendant again directed profanities at McKee, telling McKee that he could not board the boat. As McKee started to board the defendant\u2019s boat, he saw the defendant\u2019s fist \u201ccoming right at [his] face,\u201d striking him in the right eye. He arrested the defendant after a struggle.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">At trial, McKee testified that he felt \u201c[e]xtreme, extreme pain\u201d after having been punched. By the time he got the defendant\u2019s boat back to shore, his eye had swollen shut and he could not see out of it. He testified that his eye remained swollen shut for three to five days, he had blurry vision for about ten to fourteen days thereafter, he missed approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>one week of work, and he \u201ccontinued to see an eye doctor after returning\u201d to work because of blurry vision issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The defendant was indicted for, among other charges that are not challenged on appeal, second-degree assault, based upon what the indictment alleged were McKee\u2019s \u201cprotracted vision problems.\u201d The defendant moved to dismiss that charge at the close of the State\u2019s case, arguing that \u201cno reasonable person could find Officer McKee suffered... <em>protracted </em>loss of or impairment to the health or of the function of any part of his body.\u201d The judge denied his motion, concluding that the evidence presented by the State was sufficient to send the question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the State presented insufficient evidence to demonstrate that Officer McKee suffered a serious bodily injury. The controlling statute, RSA 631:2, 1(a), provides that a person is guilty of second degree assault if he \u201c[k]nowingly or recklessly causes serious bodily injury to another.\u201d \u201cSerious bodily injury\u201d is defined as \u201cany harm to the body which causes severe, permanent or protracted loss of or impairment to the health or of the function of any part of the body.\u201d RSA 625:11, VI (2007). The indictment alleged that the defendant\u2019s attack on McKee \u201ccaus[ed] protracted vision problems\u201d; our review of his conviction is limited accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">To prevail on his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant must prove that no rational trier of fact, viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Wilmot, </em>163 N.H. 148, 154 (2012). \u201cWhether [the victim\u2019s] injuries constituted \u2018serious bodily injury\u2019 is a <em>question of fact </em>for the jury to decide.\u201d <em>State v. Scognamiglio, </em>150 N.H. 534, 536 (2004) (emphasis added); <em>see State v. Plant, </em>124 N.H. 813, 813 (1984) (memorandum opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\"> The parties advance different views as to what constitutes a \u201cprotracted\u201d impairment for the purpose of RSA 625:11, VI. The State points to a decision from Missouri defining protracted as \u201cmore than momentary!;] no minimum degree of trauma must be inflicted in order to constitute protracted loss or impairment.\u201d <em>State v. Norwood, </em>8 S.W.3d 242, 246 (Mo. Ct. App. 1999). The defendant, on the other hand, argues that the injury must be at least as \u201cserious\u201d as a permanent or severe impairment, and must last \u201cfor a long time or longer than expected or usual.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) We need not decide between these proffered definitions \u2014 when a statutory term is undefined, we ascribe to it its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Appeal of Town of Nottingham, </em>153 N.H. 539, 553 (2006). A \u201cprotract[ed]\u201d impairment is one that is \u201cdelay[ed] or prolonged] ... in time.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1826 (un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>abridged ed. 2002). Whether an impairment is protracted is therefore a question of degree, and the role of this court is limited to determining whether a rational jury could have considered McKee\u2019s injuries to be delayed or prolonged.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that McKee suffered a protracted impairment to the function of his eye. <em>See </em>RSA 631:2, 1(a). Considering the facts recited above in the light most favorable to the State, the jury could have believed McKee had consistently impaired vision for up to nineteen days and, for at least some time thereafter, intermittently impaired vision requiring medical attention. Although our decisions do not shed light on this particular question, injuries of this duration have been held sufficient by appellate courts in other states to demonstrate serious bodily injury. <em>See, e.g., State v. Meyers, </em>145 P.3d 821, 829, 830 (Haw. App. 2006) (a \u201creasonable mind might fairly conclude\u201d that victim suffered protracted impairment to function of lungs based on evidence of eight fractured ribs causing severe pain and discomfort that began to alleviate after two weeks); <em>Huerta v. State, </em>933 S.W.2d 648, 649 (Tex. Ct. App. 1996) (evidence sufficient to raise jury issue on protracted impairment of a bodily organ when the victim was hit and kicked in the groin, urinated blood as a result, and was unable to return to work as a police officer for several days); <em>People v. Mohammed, </em>557 N.Y.S.2d 35, 36 (App. Div. 1990) (memorandum decision) (victim suffered \u201cprotracted impairment of health\u201d based on evidence of \u201cfractured humerus [bone] requiring several weeks of immobilization\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The victim\u2019s injuries in this case are also consistent with injuries found by this and other courts to constitute serious bodily injury more generally. In <em>Scognamiglio, </em>for example, we concluded that a rational jury could have found the defendant guilty of causing serious bodily injury when the victim had a broken nose, swollen and discolored eyes, clogged breathing passages, and a sinus infection. <em>Scognamiglio, </em>150 N.H. at 537. Similarly, in <em>State v. Kiluk, </em>we held that a rational jury could have found the defendant guilty of causing serious bodily injury when the victim had wounds requiring seven stitches and a scratched eyeball resulting in blurred vision. <em>State v. Kiluk, </em>120 N.H. 1, 4 (1980). Out-of-state decisions are also generally in accord. <em>See, e.g., Coronado v. State, </em>654 So. 2d 1267, 1270 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1995) (victim suffered \u201cgreat bodily harm\u201d based on evidence of \u201cfacial fracture, numbness and a great deal of pain around the eye and face\u201d); <em>People v. Fosselman, </em>659 P.2d 1144, 1148 (Cal. 1983) (victim suffered serious bodily injury based on evidence that victim\u2019s jaw was broken and wired shut for three weeks after injury); <em>cf. Feagin v. State, </em>731 S.E.2d 778, 780 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>(Ga. Ct. App. 2012) (victim suffered \u201cserious disfigurement\u201d based on evidence that victim\u2019s eye was severely swollen and took \u201cseveral weeks\u201d to heal).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">There may be cases in which the duration of a bodily impairment is so brief that we would be justified in declaring the injury to be non-protracted as a matter of law. Indeed, not only is there no set formula for determining when the effects of an injury linger long enough to constitute serious bodily injury, but that determination may also depend, at least in part, on the nature of the impairment. Here, however, it was within the province of the jury, as the ultimate trier of fact, to find that the injury to McKee\u2019s eye constituted a protracted impairment and, thus, serious bodily injury. <em>Cf. Feagin, </em>731 S.E.2d at 780 (\u201c[Wjhether a disfigurement is serious is almost always a question for the jury to resolve on a case-by-case basis.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b186-7\">LYNN and Bassett, JJ., concurred; DALIANIS, C.

I respectfully dissent. To prevail on his sufficiency of the evidence claim, the defendant, Wayne Dorrance, must prove that no rational trier of fact, viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Wilmot, </em>163 N.H. 148, 154 (2012). Here, the indictment alleged that the defendant caused serious bodily injury to Officer Christopher McKee, resulting in \u201cprotracted vision problems.\u201d The majority correctly states that \u201c[w]hether the victim\u2019s injuries constituted \u2018serious bodily injury\u2019 is a question of fact for the jury to decide.\u201d (Brackets and emphasis omitted.) To reach that question, however, we must first resolve a preliminary issue \u2014 the meaning of \u201cprotracted\u201d within the serious bodily injury statute. <em>See </em>RSA 625:11, VI (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">As we have noted on numerous occasions, the interpretation of a statute is <em>a question of law, </em>which we decide <em>de novo. See State v. Brooks, </em>164 N.H. 272, 291 (2012). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>We first examine the language used, and, when possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to words used. <em>Ocasio v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>162 N.H. 436, 450 (2011). Nevertheless, we construe statutes in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation. <em>Id. </em>Our goal is to apply statutes in light of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them, and in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme. <em>Appeal of Hartford Ins. Co., </em>162 N.H. 91, 95 (2011). With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>respect to the Criminal Code, we construe its provisions \u201caccording to the fair import of their terms and to promote justice.\u201d RSA 625:3 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">To \u201cprotract\u201d is \u201cto draw out or lengthen in time or space.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S Third New International Dictionary 1826 (unabridged ed. 2002). The common meaning of \u201cprotracted\u201d is \u201ccontinuing, dragged out, drawn out, elongated, extended, lengthened, lengthy, lingering, long, long-continued, long-drawn, never-ending, ongoing, prolix, prolonged, or unending.\u201d <em>Moore v. State, </em>739 S.W.2d 347, 352 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987). Consequently, although the legislature did not delimit the duration of a \u201cprotracted\u201d impairment necessary to support a finding of \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d it must have intended that \u201cprotracted\u201d connote a period of time of prolonged duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The State contends that \u201cprotracted\u201d must have been intended to mean something different from \u201cpermanent\u201d or \u201csevere,\u201d the other two variants of serious bodily injury, because \u201cthe legislature is presumed not to have used superfluous or redundant words.\u201d <em>Pennelli v. Town of Pelham, </em>148 N.H. 365, 367-68 (2002) (quotation omitted). I do not disagree. Nevertheless, \u201cwords are known by the company they keep.\u201d <em>Phaneuf Funeral Home v. Little Giant Pump Co., </em>163 N.H. 727, 734 (2012). \u201cPermanent\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d describe conditions that are unending or very harsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The commentary to the Model Penal Code supports this interpretation. <em>See State v. Donohue, </em>150 N.H. 180, 183 (2003) (recognizing that \u201cour Criminal Code is largely derived from the Model Penal Code\u201d). In discussing the distinction between bodily injury and serious bodily injury, comment 3 differentiates the \u201cvery broad coverage\u201d achieved under the bodily injury statute from \u201cthe extreme gravity of injury\u201d punished under the serious bodily injury statute. MODEL PENAL Code \u00a7 211.1 cmt. 3, at 188 (1980). Accordingly, \u201cwe can conclude that, like the drafters of the Model Penal Code, [our legislature] intended to describe \u2018drastic harms\u2019 and injuries of \u2018extreme gravity\u2019 \u201d when it envisioned \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d <em>State v. George, </em>79 P.3d 1050, 1056 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">This conclusion is consistent with cases from other jurisdictions having similar statutory language. Those courts have held that injuries that did not require stitches, inpatient hospitalization, surgery, or follow-up medical treatment did not constitute \u201cprotracted loss or impairment\u201d as a matter of law. <em>E.g., id. </em>(no protracted impairment as matter of law where mobility of arm affected for two days following shooting); <em>State v. Rowlett, </em>No. M2011-00485-CCA-R3-CD, 2013 WL 749502, at *16 (Tenn. Crim. App. Feb. 26, 2013) (loss of sight for no more than one night was not protracted); <em>Moore, </em>739 S.W.2d at 351, 352 (mother\u2019s testimony that, as a result of stab wound to back, complainant was bedridden and that it was at least a week before he could \u201creally go out and see people\u201d was insufficient, as a matter of law, to establish protracted impairment (quotation omitted)); <em>Villarreal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>v. State, </em>716 S.W.2d 651, 652 (Tex. Ct. App. 1986) (evidence that victim\u2019s ribs were fractured and he could not raise his arms for two weeks was insufficient as matter of law to establish protracted impairment); <em>Williams v. State, </em>696 S.W.2d 896, 897 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985) (bullet wounds did not require surgery); <em>Kelly v. State, </em>153 P.3d 926, 930 (Wyo. 2007) (victim left with scar after being hit on head with iron grate from stove top).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Here, McKee testified that he felt immediate pain, that his eye was swollen \u201calmost shut\u201d for three to five days, and that he had blurry vision for ten to fourteen days thereafter. Although he testified that he was transported to the hospital by ambulance after the incident, he provided no indication of what treatment he received for his eye. Nor did he offer any testimony that he experienced any specific functional limitations because of the injury. Although he testified to having blurry vision, he never asserted that he was unable to see at a level sufficient to conduct his daily affairs. In short, the record lacks evidence that McKee suffered consequences for a \u201ccontinuing, dragged out, drawn out, elongated, extended, lengthened, lengthy, lingering, long, long-continued, long-drawn, never-ending, ongoing, prolix, prolonged, or unending\u201d period of time following the punch to his eye. <em>Moore, </em>739 S.W.2d at 352. Consequently, in my view, his impairment was not \u201cprotracted\u201d as a matter of law and, therefore, did not constitute \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d as charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The legislature is, of course, free to increase the criminal penalties for any person convicted of causing any bodily injury to a law enforcement officer. However, since I question whether the legislature intended an assault resulting in a limited period of vision impairment such as McKee suffered in this case to be penalized as \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d and because I am concerned about charging decisions that might be made in the future as a consequence of the majority\u2019s opinion, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b188-6\">CONBOY, J., joins in the dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
