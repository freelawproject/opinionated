Ct. R. 9. The interlocutory transfer poses one question: \u201cDoes the definition of a \u2018loaded pistol or revolver\u2019 [under RSA 159:4 (2002)] encompass ... a firearm with no cartridge in the firearm, and no magazine in the magazine well[,] but with a loaded magazine located next to it and easily accessible?\u201d We answer the question in the negative and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b219-15\">The following facts are drawn from the interlocutory transfer statement. <em>See In re C.M., </em>163 N.H. 768, 770 (2012). On May 8, 2012, police searched the defendant\u2019s vehicle and found a .40 caliber semi-automatic pistol adjacent to a loaded magazine in the vehicle\u2019s glove compartment. The pistol did not have a cartridge in the chamber or a magazine in the magazine well.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-16\">The State charged the defendant with a class A misdemeanor for \u201cknowingly carrying] a loaded pistol as defined in RSA 159:4 in a vehicle without a valid license ...\u201d The defendant moved to dismiss, arguing that \u201c[t]he firearm at issue was not loaded and therefore no license was required and no crime was committed.\u201d The trial court found RSA 159:4 \u201cpotentially ambiguous\u201d and transferred the question now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">RSA 159:4 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">No person shall carry a loaded pistol or revolver in any vehicle or concealed upon his person, except in his dwelling, house or place of business, without a valid license____A loaded pistol or revolver shall include any pistol or revolver <em>with </em>a magazine, cylinder, chamber or clip in which there are loaded cartridges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">The defendant argues that \u201cwith\u201d in the second sentence should be interpreted narrowly as \u201cjoined to,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International DICTIONARY 2626 (unabridged ed. 2002), so that a \u201cloaded pistol or revolver\u201d encompasses only a firearm that contains one or more cartridges. The State counters that \u201cwith\u201d should be interpreted broadly as \u201cdenoting nearness, agreement, or connection,\u201d Webster\u2019s New Dictionary AND THESAURUS 625 (1990), so that a \u201cloaded pistol or revolver\u201d encompasses a firearm that contains no cartridges but is located near a loaded magazine or clip. Although the State\u2019s reading of RSA 159:4 is plausible, we conclude that the only reasonable construction of the statute is the one offered by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. State v. Lathrop, </em>164 N.H. 468, 469 (2012). We are the final arbiters of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Town of Carroll v. Rines, </em>164 N.H. 523, 528 (2013). When interpreting a statute, we first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>State v. Matton, </em>163 N.H. 411, 412 (2012). We do not read words or phrases in isolation, but in the context of the entire statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>Our goal is to apply statutes in light of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them, and in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>We will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Evans v. J Four Realty, </em>164 N.H. 570, 572 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">The first sentence of RSA 159:4 prohibits a person from carrying a \u201cloaded\u201d pistol or revolver in any vehicle without a valid license. As pertinent here, \u201cloaded\u201d is defined as <em>\u201ccontaining </em>an explosive charge.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, <em>supra </em>at 1326 (emphasis added). \u201cLoaded\u201d is also the past participle of the verb \u201cload,\u201d which means \u201cto put a load on or in a carrier, device, machine, or container; [specifically] <em>to insert the charge or cartridge in the chamber of a firearm.\u201d Id. </em>at 1325 (emphasis added). Based on these definitions, a \u201cloaded\u201d pistol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>or revolver may mean a pistol or revolver containing a cartridge in the chamber, <em>see id., </em>or, more broadly, a pistol or revolver containing a cartridge in any position from which it can be fired, <em>see id. </em>at 1326; <em>People v. Clark, </em>53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 99, 102 (Ct. App. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">We conclude the legislature intended the second sentence of RSA 159:4 to clarify that \u201cloaded\u201d should be defined according to the broader of the two accepted meanings above. Therefore, a \u201cloaded pistol or revolver\u201d means not only a pistol or revolver that contains a cartridge in the chamber, but also a pistol or revolver <em>containing </em>a cylinder, magazine, or clip with a cartridge that can be discharged through the normal operation of the firearm. This reading is consistent with the common and approved usage of \u201cloaded.\u201d We aim to preserve the common and approved usage of a word \u201cunless from the statute it appears a different meaning was intended.\u201d <em>Phaneuf Funeral Home v. Little Giant Pump Co., </em>163 N.H. 727, 731 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The State argues that the meaning of \u201cloaded\u201d should be expanded further to include a pistol or revolver that does not contain any cartridges but that is located near a detachable magazine or clip that contains cartridges. Those jurisdictions that have defined \u201cloaded\u201d more broadly than the common meaning \u2014 <em>i.e., </em>as encompassing firearms \u201cnear\u201d ammunition \u2014 have done so explicitly. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 265.00 (15) (2013) (\u201c 'Loaded firearm\u2019 means any firearm loaded with ammunition or any firearm which is possessed by one who, at the same time, possesses a quantity of ammunition which may be used to discharge such firearm.\u201d); 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 6102 (2012) (\u201cIn the case of a firearm which utilizes a detachable magazine, [loaded] shall mean a magazine suitable for use in said firearm which magazine contains such ammunition and has been inserted in the firearm or is in the same container or, where the container has multiple compartments, the same compartment thereof as the firearm.\u201d); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 2923.16(K)(5)(a) (West Supp. 2013) (defining \u201cunloaded\u201d for purposes of a statute regulating the handling of firearms in motor vehicles). In contrast, RSA 159:4 provides no indication that the legislature intended \u201cloaded\u201d to be defined so broadly as to encompass pistols or revolvers \u201cnear\u201d ammunition. Therefore, we conclude the legislature did not intend this reading. <em>Cf. Evans, </em>164 N.H. at 572 (\u201c[We will not] add language that the legislature did not see fit to include\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">We note that RSA 207:7, II (2011) could be read to provide some support for the State\u2019s position. The statute is located under the \u201cGeneral Provisions as to Fish and Game\u201d chapter, and states, in pertinent part: \u201cNo person shall have or carry, in or on a motor vehicle, OHRY, snowmobile, or aircraft, whether moving or stationary, a cocked crossbow, a loaded rifle or loaded shotgun, or a rifle or shotgun with a cartridge in a magazine or clip <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>attacked to the gun!\u2019 </em>RSA 207:7, II (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because RSA 207:7, II includes the phrase \u201cattached to the gun,\u201d the absence of such language in RSA 159:4 arguably supports the inference that the legislature intended RSA 159:4 to have a broader application than RSA 207:7, II. <em>See In re Guardianship of Williams, </em>159 N.H. 318, 323 (2009) (\u201c[W]here the legislature uses different language in related statutes, we assume that the legislature intended something different.\u201d (emphasis omitted)). That statute, however, also supports a contrary inference. The inclusion of the last clause in RSA 207:7, II arguably shows that the legislature assumed a rifle or shotgun with a cartridge in a magazine or clip attached to the gun (rather than in the chamber) would not qualify as a \u201cloaded\u201d rifle or shotgun (otherwise there would have been no need to include that clause). Given that the legislature did not regard a firearm with a cartridge in an <em>attached </em>magazine or clip as \u201cloaded,\u201d it seems highly unlikely that the legislature intended by use of the word \u201cwith\u201d in RSA 159:4 to include as \u201cloaded\u201d a broader category of firearms, <em>i.e., </em>those located near, but unattached to, a clip or magazine containing a cartridge. In light of the conflicting inferences that may be drawn from RSA 207:7, II, we are not persuaded that this statute is indicative of legislative intent to depart from the common meaning of the term \u201cloaded\u201d as used in RSA 159:4. <em>See Phaneuf </em>163 N.H. at 731 (we aim to preserve the common and approved usage of a word \u201cunless from the statute it appears a different meaning was intended\u201d); <em>cf. Clark, </em>53 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 103-04 (interpreting \u201cloaded\u201d according to its common meaning in a section of the Health and Safety Code even though a section of the Penal Code contained a broader definition of the word).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Furthermore, we reject the State\u2019s reading of RSA 159:4 because it could render the statute unconstitutionally vague. <em>See </em>N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 15; <em>State v. Ploof </em>162 N.H. 609, 620 (2011) (\u201cIt is a basic principle of statutory construction that a legislative enactment will be construed to avoid conflict with constitutional rights wherever reasonably possible.\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>State v. Pratte, </em>158 N.H. 45, 48 (2008) (\u201cThe underlying principle of vagueness is that no person should be held criminally responsible for conduct which he or she could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.\u201d (quotation omitted)). A criminal statute is void for vagueness when it forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>men of ordinary intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. <em>State v. Wong, </em>125 N.H. 610, 621 (1984). Under the State\u2019s reading, a person of ordinary intelligence would have to guess at how \u201cnear\u201d a pistol or revolver must be to a loaded magazine or clip to constitute a violation of RSA 159:4. In contrast, interpreting a \u201cloaded pistol or revolver\u201d as a pistol or revolver <em>containing </em>a cartridge in any position from which it can be fired eliminates the uncertainty: a pistol or revolver either contains a cartridge in such a position or it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The State argues that even if its reading of RSA 159:4 would render the statute unconstitutionally vague, we may apply \u201cjudicial narrowing\u201d to clarify any vagueness. <em>See Bleiler v. Chief, Dover Police Dep\u2019t, </em>155 N.H. 693, 702-03 (2007) (applying \u201cjudicial narrowing\u201d to avoid an unconstitutionally vague reading of a statute). Because we reject the State\u2019s reading, we do not reach this issue. However, even if we were to adopt the State\u2019s reading, we still would decline to apply \u201cjudicial narrowing.\u201d In <em>Bleiler, </em>we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that RSA 159:6-b (2002) was unconstitutionally vague because it permitted the issuing authority to suspend or revoke a license to carry a loaded pistol or revolver for \u201cjust cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 701-03. Read in the context of the entire statutory scheme, we reasoned that the phrase \u201cjust cause\u201d \u201crefer[red] to a licensee\u2019s use of a weapon for an improper purpose or to the licensee\u2019s status as an unsuitable person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702. First, we interpreted \u201cimproper purpose\u201d with reference to a statute listing proper purposes. <em>Id. </em>Then, we applied judicial narrowing to the term \u201csuitable person\u201d by drawing upon statutes and case law describing individuals who are deemed msuitable to carry a concealed weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 702-03. We concluded that the statute \u201cgives notice to a person of ordinary intelligence of the conduct that may result in the revocation of his or her license to carry loaded weapons concealed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Here, there is no guidance in either the broader statutory scheme or established case law about how \u201cnear\u201d a pistol or revolver would have to be to a loaded magazine or clip for it to be considered \u201cloaded.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>RSA ch. 159. Therefore, as the State seems to concede, in order to clarify the substantial uncertainty resulting from its reading of RSA 159:4, we would effectively have to add language similar to that contained in one or more of the out-of-state statutes cited earlier in this opinion. This would go beyond judicial narrowing \u2014 rewriting statutes is a task reserved for the legislature. <em>See Evans, </em>164 N.H. at 572 (\u201c[We will not] add language that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d); <em>State v. Lamy, </em>158 N.H. 511, 521 (2009) (\u201c[I]t is the province of the legislature to enact laws defining crimes . ...\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">At oral argument, the State cited <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>841 F. Supp. 79 (E.D.N.Y. 1994), <em>aff'd, </em>53 F.3d 545 (2d Cir. 1995), to support its reading of RSA 159:4. In <em>Rodriguez, </em>police searched the defendant\u2019s apartment and found a large cache of firearms and drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 80-81. Expecting to adduce evidence at trial to demonstrate that a pistol and silencer were found, unattached, in a briefcase, the government charged the defendant with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (1993), which provided in pertinent part: \u201cWhoever, during and in relation to any... drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm, shall... be sentenced to imprisonment for five years, and if the firearm... is <em>equipped </em>with a firearm silencer... to imprisonment for thirty years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81 (emphasis added). The court determined that the word \u201cequipped\u201d in the statute did not mean \u201cattached to,\u201d but, rather, \u201cstanding] in a relation one to the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83. Thus, the pistol was \u201cequipped\u201d with the silencer because \u201cthey [could] efficiently be pressed into joint service to meet a particular need.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The State\u2019s reliance on <em>Rodriguez </em>is misplaced. First, the <em>Rodriguez </em>court drew support for its broad construction of the term \u201cequipped\u201d on then-existing precedent giving a broad construction to other terms of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), including the term \u201cuse.\u201d Those precedents, however, were either overruled or at least significantly limited by the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137 (1995), which gave \u201cuse\u201d a narrow construction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>82 F.3d 849, 852-53 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\"> More fundamentally, silencers are categorized as \u201cdangerous and unusual weapons\u201d that the government can prohibit for individual use. <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>4:08CR3064, 2008 WL 4372821, at *4 (D. Neb. 2008) (quotation omitted); see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a) (2006) (grouping silencers in the same category as other highly regulated firearms such as machineguns and short-barreled rifles and shotguns); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d), 5871 (2006) (receiving or possessing an unregistered silencer is a federal crime subject to penalty of up to ten years imprisonment and $10,000 fine). \u201c[A] silencer is practically of no use except for a criminal purpose. . . . Possession of a silencer thus demonstrates a disregard of law and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>substantial risk of improper physical force.\u201d <em>United States v. Huffhines, </em>967 F.2d 314, 321 (9th Cir. 1992); <em>see also United States v. Schrum, </em>346 F. Supp. 537, 539 (E.D. Va. 1972) (describing a silencer as a \u201cgangster-type\u201d weapon). By contrast, in this country, ownership and use of standard pistols and revolvers is not only widespread and generally accepted as lawful, <em>see Staples v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 600, 612 (1994), but also implicates constitutional rights, <em>see </em>U.S. CONST, amends. II, XIV;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 2-a. For these reasons, we interpret RSA 159:4 narrowly so as to set forth a clear demarcation between that conduct which is allowed and that which is prohibited. <em>Cf. Staples, </em>511 U.S. at 614 (\u201cIf we were to accept as a general rule the Government\u2019s suggestion that dangerous and regulated items place their owners under an obligation to inquire at their peril into compliance with regulations, we would undoubtedly reach some untoward results.\u201d); <em>Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. 489, 499 (1982) (\u201c[P]erhaps the most important factor affecting the clarity that the Constitution demands of a law is whether it threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Finally, we acknowledge the State\u2019s point that its reading of RSA 159:4 arguably advances the goal of the statute - protecting public safety - to a greater extent than our construction. But, as the Supreme Court has aptly observed, \u201cit frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that <em>whatever </em>furthers the statute\u2019s primary objective must be the law.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. United States, </em>480 U.S. 522, 525 (1987) (per curiam); <em>see Brown v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>46 F.3d 102, 108 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Accordingly, we hold that in order for a pistol or revolver to be considered \u201cloaded\u201d within the meaning of RSA 159:4, the pistol or revolver must <em>contain </em>a cartridge in the chamber or must <em>contain </em>a magazine, cylinder, or clip inserted in or otherwise adjoined to the firearm such that the firearm can be discharged through normal operation. Of course, if the legislature disagrees with our interpretation of RSA 159:4, it is free, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>subject to constitutional limitations, to amend the statute. <em>See N.H.
