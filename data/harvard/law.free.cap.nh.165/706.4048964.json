Fischer, appeals his convictions, following a jury trial in Superior Court <em>{Brown, </em>J.), on two counts of second degree assault, both of which resulted in extended terms of imprisonment. <em>See </em>RSA 681:2,1(c) (2007); RSA 651:6,11(a) (Supp. 2012). He argues that: (1) the trial court erred in admitting testimony under the excited utterance hearsay exception; (2) the evidence was insufficient to prove that his conduct manifested extreme indifference to the value of human life; (3) the trial court erred in instructing the jury on extreme indifference to the value of human life; (4) the trial court violated his rights against double jeopardy by sentencing him on both second degree assault convictions; (5) the trial court erred in imposing extended terms of imprisonment; and (6) the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it must unanimously find a specific bodily injury. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The jury could have found the following facts. At 10 p.m. on February 18, 2010, the victim, the defendant\u2019s wife, returned to their home in Dover from her shift as a nurse at York Hospital. She and the defendant argued. She then removed her rings, threw them at him, and told him that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t do this any more.\u201d In response, the defendant grabbed her by the throat, pushed her head into the wall behind her -with such force that it dented the wall, threw her to the floor, and left the house. When the defendant returned, the victim told him that she was not going to stay in the relationship and that she was going to obtain a restraining order the next day. The defendant responded that if she did, he would kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The defendant turned off the lights in the kitchen and went upstairs. When the victim went from the living room into the kitchen and turned the lights back on, the defendant came downstairs, turned the lights off, and lunged at her. He grabbed her from behind, put his hand over her mouth, and brought her to the floor. Then he stepped on her head, preventing her from getting up. He grabbed her by the hair and sweatshirt and dragged her into the living room. The sweatshirt tightened around her neck so she could not breathe or speak. The defendant then went back upstairs. The victim spent the rest of the night on the couch, although she could not sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">In the morning, the defendant apologized and said that he wanted \u201cto fix things,\u201d but the victim said that she could not stay with him. As she was leaving the house for work, the defendant charged at the door, slamming it on her finger. Rather than going to her department at York Hospital, the victim went to the emergency room. The emergency room doctor deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>mined that her finger was fractured. Although she tried to work after leaving the emergency room, she was sent home because of her injured finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The victim left the hospital and telephoned a co-worker, Pamela Damrill. She also telephoned her mother\u2019s partner, Kristin Busch. She told both what had happened. She then called her brother, a Rochester police officer, who accompanied her to obtain a restraining order. The victim also reported the assaults to the Dover police. At the recommendation of the police, she went to the Wentworth-Douglass Hospital emergency room to be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">At the hospital, the victim told the nurse that, during the previous night, she had been assaulted by her husband, who pushed her to the floor, stepped on her, and choked her. She also said that her husband slammed her finger in the door. The nurse noted bruising on the victim\u2019s back near her right shoulder blade, tenderness on her cervical spine, tenderness on the back of her head and front of her neck, and swelling, tenderness, and bruising on her left index finger. In addition to her fractured finger, the victim was diagnosed with muscle strain in her neck, cervical strain, and abrasions and contusions on her neck, back, and head.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The defendant was indicted on three counts of second degree assault. The first charge alleged that the defendant caused serious bodily injury to the victim by slamming a door on her hand, causing her to suffer a fractured finger. The other two charges, one concerning the assault in the living room and the other concerning the assault in the kitchen, alleged that the defendant recklessly caused bodily injury to the victim under \u201ccircumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, the defendant moved to dismiss all three charges, arguing that the State had introduced insufficient evidence. The trial court denied the motion. The jury returned a not guilty verdict regarding the alleged assault that caused the victim\u2019s broken finger, but found the defendant guilty of the counts based upon the incidents in the living room and kitchen. The defendant moved to set aside the verdicts, renewing his insufficiency claim. The trial court denied the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">The defendant first argues that the trial court erred in admitting Kristin Busch\u2019s testimony under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. The admissibility of evidence is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. McDonald, </em>163 N.H. 115, 121 (2011). We will not reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Id. </em>In determining whether a ruling is a proper exercise of judicial discretion, we consider whether the record establishes an objective basis sufficient to sustain the discretionary decision made. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>The excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule permits the admission of hearsay statements \u201crelating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 803(2). \u201cTo qualify as an excited utterance, the statement must be a spontaneous verbal reaction to some startling or shocking event, made at a time when the speaker was still in a state of nervous excitement produced by that event and before she had time to contrive or misrepresent.\u201d <em>State v. Pepin, </em>156 N.H. 269, 274 (2007) (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"> Busch testified that the victim telephoned her at around 8:45 a.m., after the victim left work. The victim was tearful, and her voice was shaky. Busch then gave a detailed narrative of her conversation with the victim, in which the victim described the assaults and said that she \u201cwas scared.\u201d When the defendant objected to Busch\u2019s testimony as inadmissible hearsay, the trial court concluded that it was admissible as an excited utterance. Previously, however, the trial court had ruled that Pamela Damrill\u2019s testimony concerning the victim\u2019s telephone call to her, which was made shortly before the call to Busch, was not an excited utterance because of the \u201cintervening events\u201d between the assaults and the call \u2014 the victim\u2019s drive to the emergency room for treatment for her finger and her time at work. In light of the trial court\u2019s finding that these intervening events precluded admission of Damrill\u2019s testimony as an excited utterance, it erred in admitting Busch\u2019s testimony concerning the victim\u2019s subsequent statements to her. <em>See id. </em>(noting excited utterance exception is based upon spontaneity and impulsiveness of statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The State argues that any error in admitting Busch\u2019s testimony was nevertheless harmless.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">An error is harmless if we can say beyond a reasonable doubt that it did not affect the verdict. The State bears the burden of proving that an error is harmless. The evaluation of whether the State has met its burden involves consideration of the alternative evidence presented at trial and the character of the contested evidence. An error may be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is of an overwhelming nature, quantity or weight, and if the contested evidence is merely cumulative or inconsequential in relation to the strength of the State\u2019s evidence of guilt. In making this determination, we consider the alternative evidence presented at trial as well as the character of the inadmissible evidence itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-8\"><em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>164 N.H. 800, 810-11 (2013) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Here, the alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. The victim provided a graphic account of the assault in the living room. She also described in detail the assault in the kitchen. The officer who interviewed the victim at the Dover police station testified that she had a mark on the left side of her neck and a bruise on the back of her shoulder. Photographs of the victim\u2019s injuries and the dent in the wall were admitted as exhibits at trial. The nurse who examined the victim at the WentworthDouglass Hospital emergency room testified that the victim told her that she had been assaulted by her husband on the previous night, and that during the assault she was pushed to the floor, stepped on, and choked. The nurse noted bruising on the victim\u2019s back near her shoulder blade, tenderness in her neck, tenderness on the back of her head, and swelling, tenderness, and bruising on her finger \u2014 injuries that the nurse testified were consistent with the victim\u2019s description of the assaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In relation to this evidence, Busch\u2019s testimony was inconsequential and cumulative. <em>See State v. Hernandez, </em>159 N.H. 394, 403 (2009). Our review of the record establishes that Busch\u2019s recitation of her conversation with the victim was devoid of any evidence not disclosed by other witnesses. The defendant argues, however, that \u201cBusch\u2019s testimony about [the victim\u2019s] statements prejudiced the defense by attributing to [the victim], on the day after the events, a similar description of the details of the previous night, thereby bolstering her credibility.\u201d Busch\u2019s testimony, however, was substantially the same as testimony elicited from the nurse who treated the victim at the Wentworth-Douglass Hospital. <em>See State v. Fischer, </em>143 N.H. 311, 317 (1999) (concluding that any error in admitting victim\u2019s prior consistent statement was harmless where it was merely cumulative of testimony of physician who examined victim shortly after attack). Here, the nurse recounted the victim\u2019s description of the assaults, testifying that the victim\u2019s injuries were consistent with her description of what had happened. Consequently, the jury heard other testimony \u201cbolstering the victim\u2019s version of the attack[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming and because the contested evidence was inconsequential and cumulative, we conclude that the erroneous admission of Busch\u2019s testimony as an excited utterance was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\"> The defendant next argues that the State introduced insufficient evidence to prove that his conduct manifested an extreme indifference to the value of human life. To prevail, the defendant must establish that no rational trier of fact, viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Dion, </em>164 N.H. 544, 548 (2013). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Whether a defendant acted with \u201cextreme indifference\u201d is a question of fact for the jury. <em>State v. Edson, </em>153 N.H. 45, 47 (2005). \u2018We have previously determined that an attacker acts with \u2018extreme indifference\u2019 when he inflicts any degree of bodily injury on a victim and when the \u2018circumstances\u2019 of the attack demonstrate a blatant disregard for the risk to the victim\u2019s life.\u201d <em>State v. Fletcher, </em>129 N.H. 641, 644 (1987) (quotation omitted). The injuries, however, need not themselves be life-threatening. <em>State v. Bailey, </em>127 N.H. 416, 423 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">We conclude that, as to both assaults, there was sufficient evidence that the defendant caused bodily injury to the victim under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life. The circumstances of these assaults, as testified to at trial, support a finding that the defendant\u2019s conduct manifested extreme indifference to the value of human life, particularly since the jury could have concluded that the course of the defendant\u2019s conduct, if continued, could have caused the victim\u2019s death. <em>See Fletcher, </em>129 N.H. at 644. We therefore conclude that a rational juror, viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The defendant next asserts that the trial court erred in its instructions defining the element of extreme indifference to the value of human life. \u2018When reviewing jury instructions, we evaluate allegations of error by interpreting the disputed instructions in their entirety, as a reasonable juror would have understood them, and in light of all the evidence in the case.\u201d <em>State v. Furgal, </em>164 N.H. 430, 434 (2012) (quotation omitted). The scope and wording of jury instructions are within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we review the trial court\u2019s decision for an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>State v. Etienne, </em>163 N.H. 57, 70 (2011). \u201cTo show that the trial court\u2019s decision is not sustainable, the defendant must demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">A person is guilty of second degree assault if he \u201c[r]ecklessly causes bodily injury to another under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d RSA 631:2,1(c). Citing <em>State v. Schultz, </em>141 N.H. 101, 105 (1996), a second degree murder case, the defendant proposed the following jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">[P]roof of extreme indifference to the value of human life requires more than a demonstration that Defendant had created and disregarded a substantial risk of death. \u201cExtreme indifference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>the value of human life\u201d requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a \u201cblatant disregard\u201d of a substantial and [unjustifiable risk of death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The State objected, asserting that the definition of \u201crecklessly\u201d given by the trial court contained the \u201csubstantial and unjustifiable risk\u201d language and, therefore, that it did not need to be repeated in the definition of \u201cextreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d The trial court agreed, noting that it was \u201csticking to the standard instructions throughout the entire instruction format.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The trial court instructed the jury that the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted recklessly \u2014 that he \u201cwas aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk,\u201d that he \u201cconsciously disregarded the risk,\u201d and that his disregard of the risk \u201cwas a gross deviation from what the law-abiding person would have done.\u201d The court also explained that the risk had to be \u201cto the [victim\u2019s] life.\u201d Regarding \u201cextreme indifference to the value of human life,\u201d the trial court defined the term as meaning that \u201cthe [defendant\u2019s acts demonstrate a blatant disregard for the risk to the [victim\u2019s] life. It\u2019s not necessary the injury \u2014 or a series of injuries themselves be life-threatening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">We find no error in the trial court\u2019s instructions. Here, the jury instructions mirrored the language that we have approved regarding the requirements for second degree assault. <em>See, e.g., Fletcher, </em>129 N.H. at 644 (stating that \u201cattacker acts with \u2018extreme indifference\u2019 when he inflicts any degree of bodily injury on a victim and when the \u2018circumstances\u2019 of the attack demonstrate a blatant disregard for the risk to the victim\u2019s life\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>Bailey, </em>127 N.H. at 424 (explaining \u201cextreme indifference\u201d requires proof of \u201ca blatant disregard\u201d for the risk to human life (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">We disagree with the defendant\u2019s assertion that the jury instructions failed to convey that \u201can essential aspect of the meaning of the extreme indifference element\u201d is \u201cthe requirement that the defendant must have created and disregarded a substantial risk of death.\u201d The court correctly instructed the jury that to find guilt, it must find that the defendant \u201cwas aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk\u201d and that the risk had to be \u201cto the [victim\u2019s] life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">Moreover, \u201c[t]he trial court is not required to use the specific language requested by the defendant. Rather, the purpose of the trial court\u2019s charge is to state and explain to the jury, in clear and intelligible language, the rules of law applicable to the case.\u201d <em>Furgal, </em>164 N.H. at 434 (quotation omitted). The jury instructions fairly covered the issues of law in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>the case, and, therefore, we find no unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>See Etienne, </em>163 N.H. at 70; <em>see also Bailey, </em>127 N.H. at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The defendant next argues that the trial court violated his right against double jeopardy by sentencing him on both convictions for second degree assault because each conviction was based upon an indictment alleging the same bodily injury \u2014 \u201ccontusions and muscle strain to [the victim\u2019s] head and neck.\u201d The State counters that the defendant\u2019s sentences did not violate his right against double jeopardy because each indictment required evidence of a distinct series of assaults. Because the issue of double jeopardy presents a question of constitutional law, our review is <em>de novo. State v. McGurk, </em>157 N.H. 765, 773 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Part I, Article 16 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution protect a defendant from being punished twice for the same offense. N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 16; U.S. CONST, amends. V, XIV. We first address the issue under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid in our analysis. <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\"> For the purpose of double jeopardy analysis, two charged offenses cannot be regarded as the same offense if they do not arise out of the \u201csame act or transaction.\u201d <em>See Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932); <em>State v. Matey, </em>153 N.H. 263, 270 (2006); <em>see also State v. Hull, </em>149 N.H. 706, 717 (2003). Here, the defendant was charged with two separate incidents of assault \u2014 the first took place in the living room and, sometime thereafter, the second occurred in the kitchen. That each assault resulted in injuries to the victim\u2019s head and neck does not establish that they arose out of the same act or transaction. We therefore conclude that the defendant was not subjected to multiple punishments for the same offense and, consequently, that his right against double jeopardy under the State Constitution was not infringed. The Federal Constitution provides no greater protection than the State Constitution in this area. <em>See Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304; <em>McGurk, </em>157 N.H. at 774. Accordingly, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">The defendant next argues that the trial court erred in imposing extended terms of imprisonment because RSA 651:6, 11(a), which authorizes extended terms of imprisonment in certain circumstances, does not apply. Alternatively, he asserts that the statute is unconstitutionally vague. The State contends that the extended terms were properly imposed because the defendant had twice previously been imprisoned on sentences of a year or more that arose from separate criminal episodes and that the extended term statute is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Prior to 2003, a trial judge was authorized to impose an extended term of imprisonment if the judge found that the defendant had \u201ctwice previously been <em>imprisoned </em>... on sentences in excess of one year.\u201d RSA 651:6,1(c) (Supp. 2002) (emphasis added). In an effort to comply with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466 (2000), the legislature amended the statute to permit imposition of an extended term where the defendant had \u201ctwice previously been <em>convicted </em>... on sentences in excess of one year.\u201d RSA 651:6,11(a) (emphasis added); <em>see State v. Dansereau, </em>157 N.H. 596, 599-600 (2008). The change in the statute does not improve its clarity; \u201c[d]espite the change from \u2018imprisoned\u2019 to \u2018convicted,\u2019 as it stands today, the statute still requires a trial court to find, before it imposes an extended term of incarceration, that the defendant (1) was previously <em>imprisoned </em>twice, resulting from (2) sentences in excess of one year.\u201d <em>State v. Motton, </em>163 N.H. 411, 414 (2012) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The defendant contends that the statute requires either \u201ctwo prior noncontinuous periods of imprisonment\u201d or an \u201cextension of one continuous period of incarceration\u201d that \u201carises out of an offense committed after the defendant\u2019s first sentencing.\u201d Resolution of this issue requires that we interpret the language of RSA 651:6, 11(a). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiters of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Evans v. J Four Realty, </em>164 N.H. 570, 572 (2013). When examining the language of the statute, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used. <em>Id. </em>We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Id. </em>We construe the Criminal Code \u201caccording to the fair import of [its] terms and to promote justice.\u201d RSA 625:3 (2007); <em>see State v. Martin, </em>164 N.H. 687, 689 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The wording of the statute, as we have interpreted it, does not support the defendant\u2019s contention. To \u201cimprison\u201d means \u201c[t]o confine (a person) in prison.\u201d BLACK\u2019S Law DICTIONARY 825 (9th ed. 2009). A \u201csentence\u201d is \u201c[t]he judgment that a court formally pronounces after finding a criminal defendant guilty; the punishment imposed on a criminal wrongdoer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1485. Here, although the defendant\u2019s prior convictions resulted in one uninterrupted period of incarceration, he nevertheless was twice previously imprisoned on sentences in excess of one year for purposes of the statute. <em>See </em>RSA 651:6,11(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">In 1996, the defendant was charged with first degree assault and witness tampering. While he was incarcerated, awaiting trial on those charges, he was charged with two further acts of witness tampering. He was subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>quently convicted of both sets of charges. In November 1996, the defendant was sentenced on the assault conviction to imprisonment of seven and one-half to fifteen years, stand committed. On the accompanying -witness-tampering conviction, he was sentenced to imprisonment of three and one-half to seven years, stand committed, with two and one-half years suspended, to run consecutively to the sentence on the assault conviction. Thus, as to this set of two convictions, which the trial court found to be the result of one criminal episode, the defendant was \u201cimprisoned on a sentence in excess of one year.\u201d In December 1997, the defendant was sentenced on each of the two subsequent witness-tampering convictions to imprisonment of three and one-half to seven years, stand committed, with two and one-half years suspended, to be served concurrently with each other and with the sentences he was already serving. Thus, as to this set of two convictions, he was also \u201cimprisoned on a sentence in excess of one year.\u201d Contrary to the defendant\u2019s arguments, the statute\u2019s requirements are met even though the second set of sentences of imprisonment ran concurrently with the first set. We note that, because the State does not contest the trial court\u2019s characterization of each set of two sentences as constituting one sentence of imprisonment for purposes of sentence enhancement, we need not determine whether each of the four prison sentences could have been properly \u201ccounted\u201d in the enhanced-sentencing calculus. We, therefore, conclude that the trial court did not err in its determination that \u201cthe threshold two convictions [were] satisfied by the sentence served from the consolidated assault and first witness tampering when added to the second \u2018conviction\u2019 from the latter two witness tamperings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">We likewise reject the defendant\u2019s arguments, based upon <em>Dansereau, </em>that we must apply the rule of lenity to resolve in his favor what he alleges to be ambiguity in the statute and that, because the statute is unconstitutionally vague, it should not have been applied. Although we applied the rule of lenity in <em>Dansereau, </em>we did so because the defendant in that case had been twice \u201cconvicted,\u201d but had not been twice \u201cimprisoned\u201d because one of the underlying convictions resulted in a suspended sentence. <em>Dansereau, </em>157 N.H. at 597. In that circumstance, we concluded that the statute was ambiguous and that review of the legislative history did not resolve the ambiguity. <em>Id. </em>at 599-603. We have subsequently held, however, that when a defendant has been twice previously \u201cimprisoned,\u201d rather than merely \u201cconvicted,\u201d the statutory requirements for an extended term of imprisonment are satisfied. <em>See State v. Russo, </em>164 N.H. 585, 597 (2013); <em>Matton, </em>163 N.H. at 414. Consequently, we find unavailing the defendant\u2019s argument that the statute is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>The defendant finally argues that the trial court committed plain error by failing to instruct the jury that, in order to convict him, it had to unanimously agree on a specific bodily injury caused by his conduct. Under the plain error rule, we may consider errors not raised before the trial court. <em>State v. Guay, </em>164 N.H. 696, 703 (2013). For us to find plain error: \u201c(1) there must be an error; (2) the error must be plain; (3) the error must affect substantial rights; and (4) the error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Relying upon <em>State v. Greene, </em>137 N.H. 126 (1993), the defendant maintains that the error in failing to so instruct the jury was plain. In <em>Greene, </em>following a question from the jury during deliberations, the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that it need not unanimously find any one of the three acts of unprivileged physical contact alleged in the complaint. <em>Greene, 137 </em>N.H. at 128, 131. In <em>Greene, </em>however, the defendant was charged with misdemeanor simple assault on a police officer in that she \u201cpunch[ed] [him] in the face with her fist <em>and </em>in the torso with her fist <em>and </em>did further kick him about the body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127 (quotation omitted and emphases added). In that case, the <em>element </em>of unprivileged contact was alleged to be three separate blows. <em>Id. </em>at 129. Here, in contrast, the indictments charged the defendant with recklessly causing \u201cbodily injury\u201d to the victim in that he <em>caused </em>\u201ccontusions and muscle strain to [the victim\u2019s] head and neck.\u201d Thus, the jury was required to find that the defendant recklessly caused \u201cbodily injury\u201d to the victim. The defendant does not cite, nor could we find, a case in which a court has held that a jury must be unanimous as to which alleged injury was caused by an assault. We therefore conclude that any error in failing to instruct the jury that it had to unanimously agree on a specific bodily injury caused by the defendant\u2019s conduct was not plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b738-7\">Dalianis, C.J., and HlCKS, LYNN and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
