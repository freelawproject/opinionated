L.R.B. trial examiner in his Intermediate Report, are essentially undisputed. Superior Transportation, Inc., operating out of Naturita, Colorado, hauled ore from mines in Colorado to mills of Union Carbide Nuclear Company at Uravan, Slick Rock and Rifle, Colorado under its contract with Union Carbide. Pursuant to a consent election in March 1960, the Union was certified by the N.L.R.B. as bargaining agent for Superior\u2019s truck drivers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Contemporaneously with the Union certification proceedings, Respondent purchased Superior\u2019s trucks, trailers, incidental parts inventory and other minor items of equipment and took assignment, with certain modifications,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of Superior\u2019s hauling contract. Superior ceased its Naturita operations and Respondent hired nine of its drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">There appears to be no controversy relative to the appropriateness of the bargaining unit comprised of Superior\u2019s drivers, as was certified by the N.L.R.B. And, there is no contention either that Superior disposed of its Naturita properties in order to avoid bargaining obligations or that Respondent is anything other than a bona fide purchaser.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus our case is unlike most \u201csuccession\u201d cases which primarily concern themselves with whether changes of ownership were truly bona fide or whether they were merely subterfuges for the avoidance of bargaining agreements, i. e., whether there was merely a disguised continuance of the old employer. See Southport Petroleum Co. v. N. L. R. B., 315 U.S. 100, 62 S.Ct. 452, 86 L.Ed. 718; N. L. R. B. v. Ozark Hardwood Co. (8 CA), 282 F.2d 1; N. L. R. B. v. Birdsall-Stockdale Motor Co. (10 CA), 208 F.2d 234, 46 A.L.R.2d 587. Rather, our question is whether the \u201csuccession\u201d of Respondent has changed the employing industry so as to render the certified bargaining unit inappropriate. See N. L. R. B. v. Alamo White Truck Service, Inc. (5 CA), 273 F.2d 238; N. L. R. B. v. Armato et al. (7 CA), 199 F.2d 800. In deciding this question we necessarily deal in terms of succession of employment, and not succession of employers, i. e., in terms of the continued nature of the employment rather than the source of such employment. If the transfer operated to effect a basic change in the employing industry, in the sense that the trucking operation of the predecessor became merged or integrated into the larger business of Respondent so as to lose its identity, then the bargaining unit is no longer appropriate and enforcement of the order should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">Stated simply, Respondent\u2019s position in resisting enforcement of the order is that it did not purchase the business of Superior, has not continued the same employing industry, and is not therefore a \u201csuccessor\u201d employer whose refusal to bargain with the Union was violative of Section 8(a) (5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act of 1947 (29 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 158(a) (1, 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The N. L. R. B. adopted the findings of the trial examiner to the effect that Respondent did succeed to the business of Superior, and that the appropriateness of the certified bargaining unit survived the transfer between them. And, unless clearly erroneous, these findings are conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">As to the issue of successor ship of Superior\u2019s hauling business, the trial examiner acknowledged that all Respondent paid for was Superior\u2019s physical properties, consisting of its hauling and loading equipment, as well as various maintenance equipment and parts. But the examiner perceptively noted that before purchasing these physical properties, Respondent made certain that it would also obtain the contractual rights to haul for Union Carbide; that it took precautions, through acquisition of Superior\u2019s state trucking permits, to rule out any trucking competition by Superi- or in that geographical area; and that absent these assurances, the transfer would not have taken place. The record supports these findings and substantiates the examiner\u2019s conclusion that \u201c(R)ealistically viewed * * * the payment for Superior\u2019s equipment encompassed both the transfer and the assignment.\u201d And, we agree that a true succession of the business enterprise was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">As to the continued appropriateness of the bargaining unit, the examiner pointed out that although Superior\u2019s lease on its Naturita terminal expired a few days after the transfer, and Respondent thereafter moved its newly acquired hauling business to Uravan, a short distance away, \u201c(T)he general character of the operations * * * remained substantially the same.\u201d He concluded that the changes in the mode of operations <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> did not substantially alter \u201cthe nature of the business transacted by Superior\u201d and that just as Superior\u2019s business was the trucking of ore for Union Carbide, \u201cRespondent\u2019s principal business at its Ura-van terminal, was and is the trucking of ore for Union Carbide.\u201d Additionally, the examiner found that \u201c(T)he unit of drivers under Superior at Naturita remained a unit of drivers under the Respondent at its Naturita and, later, Ura-van terminal, with no substantial change in the nature of their duties.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And, though there is a marked degree of cooperation between Respondent\u2019s Uravan operation and others of its trucking terminals, it was found that separate books are kept on each of the terminals and that the terminal supervision of driver personnel is separate and distinct. Indeed, the foreman and supervising officer of Superior was hired by Respondent, along with the nine Superior drivers, and he continued in that capacity at Uravan. The examiner found that \u201c * * * such integration as exists is not of a degree to in any way impair the efficacy of separate bargaining units * * * \u201d, and the record amply supports his conclusion that the bargaining unit, admittedly appropriate for Superior\u2019s Naturita operation, remained so upon its assimilation by Respondent and its removal to Uravan. The Board\u2019s conclusions in this respect have decided weight in view of the wide discretion committed to the Board in the determination of an appropriate bargaining unit. See Packard Motor Car Co. v. N. L. R. B., 330 U.S. 485, 67 S.Ct. 789, 91 L.Ed. 1040; N. L. R. B. v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 331 U.S. 868, 67 S.Ct. 1725, 91. L.Ed. 1872. It may be that since the certification proceedings and the transaction in question, the Union has ceased to represent a majority of the employees at the Uravan terminal. But even so, that is not a matter for our consideration here. We decide only that the transaction did not operate to destroy the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>propriateness of the bargaining agent as established <em>by </em>the certification proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The petition for enforcement is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-6\">.

Superior had obtained the contract by an assignment from I. Sander, Inc., its parent company, -which required the latter\u2019s guarantee of Superior\u2019s performance.
