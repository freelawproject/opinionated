Proc. 28 U.S.C.A., in its finding that Board had reasonable cause to believe that Engineers had engaged in an unfair labor practice or practices ?; and</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">(2) Did the District Court abuse its judicial discretion in issuing the temporary injunction?</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The facts as adduced by the testimony below and evidenced by the record may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Schwerman Company of Pennsylvania (\u201cSchwerman\u201d) on June 19, 1961 filed a charge with John J. Cuneo, Regional Director of the Twenty-second Region of the National Labor Relations Board, which it amended on June 29, 1961, alleging that Engineers had engaged and was engaging in unfair labor practices proscribed by Section 8(b) (4) (i) (ii) (D) of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cAct\u201d). Section 8 prohibits certain conduct in furtherance of jurisdictional disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">After investigation, the Regional Director concluded the charges had merit and warranted proceedings before Board and petitioned the District Court for the injunction now under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The hearing before the District Court developed this situation:</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Selby Drilling Corporation (\u201cSelby\u201d) had a subcontract for certain work on the Spruce Run Reservoir being constructed near Clinton, New Jersey, for the State of New Jersey. Selby purchased bulk cement for its operations from Universal Atlas Cement (\u201cAtlas\u201d) and the latter contracted with Schwerman to deliver the cement to the project in motor trucks. The deliveries were made by tractor-trailer units to Selby\u2019s batching plant located at the job site. The cement was unloaded by means of compressed air generated by the tractor forcing it from the trailer unit into the bin or silo of the batching plant. The unloading operation involves the hook-up of the delivery pipe of the trailer to the receiving pipe which is attached to the bin; connection of the air hose between the tractor which operates the compressor and the trailer (which contains the cement); starting and regulation of the tractor motor; the build-up and maintenance of proper air pressure to the cement compartment on the trailer; and the operation of the delivery valves.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">The testimony discloses that Schwer-man made several deliveries of cement in May, 1961 and that the unloading was then performed by members of Engineers, under instructions of one of Sel-by\u2019s supervisory employees. After a \u201cfew loads\u201d deliveries were stopped due to a job shutdown and then resumed on June 8, 1961. At that time Schwerman learned that Engineers\u2019 members had been doing the unloading and instructed its drivers \u201cunder no circumstances to allow anyone else to unload the truck\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">On June 9, 1961 when a tractor-trailer unit of Schwerman arrived at the project site, one Czyz, a member of Engineers, attempted to unload the cement cargo and was told by Schwerman\u2019s driver, Heil-man, that he was not to do so and that he, Heilman, would unload. At that juncture another member of Engineers told Heilman \u201cIf we don\u2019t unload it, nobody unloads it * * * take it out of here\u201d. One Gatti, Engineers\u2019 steward on the job, then present, told Heilman the unloading job \u201cwas Engineers\u2019 work.\u201d Heilman, after consulting by phone with Schwerman\u2019s Terminal Manager Wilson, his superior, drove the tractor-trailer, loaded, from the project site.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>On June 12, 1961, Wilson accompanied Schwerman\u2019s tractor-trailer to the project. Gatti then told Wilson and his driver that unloading was the \u201cjob\u201d of Engineers. Wilson, in reply, said the \u201cjob\u201d was that of its drivers, members of Local No. 773, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America (\u201cTeamsters\u201d). After a delay of an hour and a half during which Gatti conferred with Selby\u2019s supervisor, Wilson was advised that his driver could proceed to unload. Two deliveries were made the following day, June 13th, with the unloading performed by Schwerman\u2019s drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">On June 14th Engineers\u2019 men again prevented unloading of a cement cargo. No further deliveries were attempted to June 19th when Schwerman sent two separate tractoi'-ti'ailer units with loads to the project under supervision of Wilson and two fellow supervisory officials. At that time Gatti and two other members of Engineers physically blocked the attempts of a Schwerman driver to unload his cargo. A \u201cheated argument\u201d ensued between the Engineers and Teamsters men during which Gatti said \u201cIf you get the cement into the bin it will rot there because we won\u2019t touch it.\u201d Engineers operated the batching bins. After a 15 to 30 minute verbal set-to Schwerman\u2019s men agreed under protest to divide up the unloading job with Engineers in a manner not here pertinent. One of Schwerman\u2019s di\u2019ivers protested and said he was going to take up the matter with the Board because \u201cThey are taking my work away from me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The original charge with the Board was filed by Schwerman the same day. Deliveries to the project continued under the foregoing arrangement until the issuance of the injunction herein on July 7, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">It was on the basis of the foregoing events that the District Court found \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that Engineers had \u201cused self-help and made these moves, restraining acts\u201d for the \u201cpurpose of having this work assigned to [its] organization and taken away from [Teamsters]\u201d, and that there was accordingly \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that Engineers\u2019 conduct violated Section 8(b) (4) (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">On this appeal Engineers urged (1) there did not exist a \u201cjurisdictional dispute\u201d between it and Teamsters and accordingly there was no basis for the application of Section 8(b) (4) (D); and (2) the issuance of that temporary injunction was in error under the factual situation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">On review of the record we cannot say that the District Court was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d in its fact-finding that there was \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that Engineers engaged in acts and conduct in violation of Section 8(b) (4) (D). Nor can we say that the District Court abused its discretion in issuing the temporary injunction under the evidence earlier recited.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">Since the scope of our review \u201cis limited to a determination whether the District Court\u2019s finding that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of the Act as charged has been committed is clearly erroneous and whether the District Court abused its discretion in granting injunctive relief\u201d,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> further consideration becomes unnecessary. The eases cited by Engineers are inapposite on their facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">For the reasons stated the Order Granting Temporary Injunction will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">Judge GOODRICH participated in the consideration of this case but died prior to the filing of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-9\">. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160 (l); 73 Stat. 544.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b443-10\"><em>. </em>Section 8(b) (4) (D) of the Act, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-11\">\u201c (b) It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents\u2014 *****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-12\">\u2018\u2018(4) (i) to engage in, or to induce or encourage any individual employed by any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce to engage in, a strike or a refusal in the course of his employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials, or commodities or to perform any services; or (ii) to threaten, coerce, or restrain any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce, where in either case an object thereof is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-20\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-21\">\u201c(D) forcing or requiring any employer to assign particular work to employees in a particular labor organization or in a particular trade, craft, or class rather than to employees in another labor organization or in another trade, craft, or class, unless such employer is failing to conform to an order or certification of the Board determining the bargaining representative for employees performing such work * * *\u00bb 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(b) (4) (D).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b443-23\">.
