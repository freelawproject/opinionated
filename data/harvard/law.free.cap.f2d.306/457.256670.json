Decision hinges on whether the District Judge was warranted in concluding that \u201cthe motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief,\u201d under the strict construction of that phrase of the statute which is dictated by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions, Walker v. Johnston, 312 U.S. 275, 61 S.Ct. 574, 85 L.Ed. 830 (1941); Waley v. Johnston, 316 U.S. 101, 62 S.Ct. 964, 86 L.Ed. 1302 (1942); U. S. ex rel. Farnsworth v. Murphy, 358 U.S. 48, 79 S.Ct. 76, 3 L.Ed.2d 46 (1958). We hold that he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-25\">Smith\u2019s well-writen <em>pro se </em>brief limits his claims on appeal to misconduct by agents of the Bureau of Narcotics and especially by Avant, the Government\u2019s principal witness. These claims, which have several facets, are based on an affidavit of Mack, a \u201cspecial employee,\u201d who testified for Smith at the trial in June, 1960, and is now incarcerated with him at Lewisburg after conviction, on a plea of guilty, apparently on the narcotics charge which he related in his trial testimony. Mack\u2019s statement that no sale of narcotics was ever made by Smith in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>presence does not even begin to tender an issue of perjury, since Avant had not named Mack as among those present on that occasion; his further statement that Smith never acknowledged in his presence having any narcotics in his possession or any knowledge where these could be illegally purchased simply renews the issue of fact which the jury determined. Another facet concerns the degree of Avant\u2019s acquaintance with Smith during the war. Avant testified that he and Smith both served in the 369th Coast Artillery Regiment, that he had seen Smith \u201caround the regiment,\u201d but that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know him at all,\u201d they being in different battalions. Mack now asserts that he, Avant and Smith \u201cwere well known to each other, having been members of the same branch, same regiment of the Armed Forces during World War two. \u2014 The 369th Coast Artillery\u201d and that \u201cArmy records must and will show that we, aforementioned three were in almost daily contact during 1941 and 1942 in Oswego, New York, and Camp Edwards, Massachusetts.\u201d Whether or not the Army had any such records, or preserved them if it had, Smith has produced none \u2014 not even records to rebut Avant\u2019s testimony that he and Smith were in different battalions. Moreover, Smith chose not to testify at the trial, and Mack gave the following testimony on direct examination by Smith\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">\u201cQ. Can you tell me whether you and Avant, Agent Avant, and Smith ever met or were together during the time you were in service? A. Well, I imagine sometime, but I couldn\u2019t say offhand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Furthermore, the whole issue of the extent of Avant\u2019s wartime acquaintance with Smith hardly rises to a level of materiality sufficiently significant to warrant action under \u00a7 2255 even if Avant knowingly minimized it to some degree, United States v. Kyle, 297 F.2d 507 (2 Cir. 1961). Finally, Mack claims that \u201cDuring Mr. Smith\u2019s trial, Agent Avant came to my house and coerced me into signing false statements implicating Mr. Smith in my narcotic sales.\u201d The reference, apparently, is to a statement signed two weeks before the trial began, which Government counsel used to discredit Mack on cross-examination, although he disavowed it, 283 F.2d at 762. The defense, with whom Mack was cooperating, had full opportunity to bring out the facts now alleged, if facts they be, United States v. Branch, 261 F.2d 530 (2 Cir. 1958), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 993, 79 S.Ct. 1125, 3 L.Ed.2d 981 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Hence, assuming in Smith\u2019s favor that perjury or subornation of perjury by Avant on a material issue would warrant relief under \u00a7 2255, even though Avant\u2019s alleged misconduct is not even alleged to have been known to the prosecutor, see Pyle v. Kansas, 317 U.S. 213, 63 S.Ct. 177, 87 L.Ed. 214 (1942); Curran v. Delaware, 259 F.2d 707, 712-713 (3 Cir. 1958), cert. denied, 358 U.S. 948, 79 S.Ct. 355, 3 L.Ed.2d 353 (1959), Judge McGohey was justified in denying the instant motion without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
