No significance is to be attached to the fact that petitioner was originally approached by an INS investigator in the anteroom of the New York City Magistrate\u2019s Court where she was awaiting trial on a solicitation charge. See 8 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1357(a) (1). The testimony of the arresting officer on the criminal charge to the effect that petitioner had offered to commit an act of prostitution with him was admissible to rebut petitioner\u2019s defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-23\">On the basis of the evidence before him, the hearing officer could reasonably have concluded that petitioner\u2019s conduct was \u201ca pattern of behavior or deliberate course of conduct entered into primarily for financial gain\u201d rather than \u201ca casual or isolated act.\u201d 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 4191(a) (12) (Supp. 1960). See 8 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1251(a) (12), 1182(a) (12). Any doubts we may have about the wisdom of proceeding against a fifty-three year old war refugee, since married to an American citizen, on the basis of a few acts of prostitution during a brief period of unemployment cannot justify setting aside a lawful administrative determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-24\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
