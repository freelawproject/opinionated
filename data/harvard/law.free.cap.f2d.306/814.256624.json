Code \u00a7 2305 (1961) and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of five months to two years. The basis for the indictment was the alleged extortion of $50 from the complaining witness by verbally threatening to accuse him of conduct which if true would tend to disgrace him and subject him to ridicule and contempt of society. Evidence adduced in support of the indictment related to threats to tell the complaining witness\u2019 wife that he had caused the pregnancy of another woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">The question on appeal is whether appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal, based on insufficiency of the evidence, should have been granted. We are satisfied that the evidence was sufficient for submission of the issue of guilt to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
