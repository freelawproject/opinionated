Their motion for summary judgment was denied, the Secretary\u2019s cross motion was granted and the complaint was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">The Secretary of the Interior on June 2, 1937 approved a law and order Code of Tribal Offenses, applicable on Indian reservations. At that time no mention was made of peyote. On June 3, 1940 the Navajo Tribal Council adopted its Resolution No. CJ-1-40 which recited in part that \u201cduring the last few months great quantities of peyote\u201d had been brought into the Navajo reservation; the use of peyote is not connected with \u201cany Navajo religious practice\u201d and is harmful and foreign to the Navajo traditional way of life. The Resolution thereupon embodied a section denouncing as \u201can offense against the Navajo Tribe\u201d the sale, use or possession within the Navajo country of the \u201cbean known as peyote.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The Acting Secretary of the Interior on December 18, 1940 approved the Tribal Resolution, and added to the Secretary\u2019s 1937 law and order Code a subjection which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-7\"><em>\u201cPeyote violations. Any Indian </em>who shall introduce into the Navajo \u25a0country, sell, use or have in his pos.session within said Navajo country, the bean known as peyote, shall be \u25a0deemed guilty of an offense and upon \u25a0conviction thereof shall be sentenced to labor for a period not to exceed 9 months, or a fine not to exceed $100, or both.\u201d (Emphasis added.) [See 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.87NH (1958)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">That action of the Acting Secretary on December 18, 1940 was attacked in the appellants\u2019 first prayer for relief now before us which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-14\">\u201c(1) That the action of defendant\u2019s predecessor on December 18, 1940 in approving Resolution No. CJ-1-40 as adopted by the Navajo Tribal Council on June 3, 1940 be declared null and void, and invalidly authorized and in violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">We have concluded that the appellants have failed to show the existence of a present case or controversy with respect to the Secretary\u2019s action in 1940. That action was superseded in 1959 and so has been rendered moot because of facts and circumstances to which we next advert.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-16\">On January 6, 1959, the Navajo Tribal Council by Resolution No. CJA-1-59 adopted as tribal law the law and order Code or regulations of the Department of the Interior, with amendments, which until that time had been generally applicable to Indian tribes. As authorization for its action the Tribe had relied on the Secretary\u2019s regulation, 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.1(e) (1958) which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-17\">\u201cNothing in this section shall prevent the adoption by the tribal council of ordinances applicable to the individual tribe, and after such ordinances have been approved by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Secretary of the Interior they shall be controlling, and the regulations of this part which may be inconsistent therewith shall no longer be applicable to that tribe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">In so adopting as tribal law all those sections which might be applicable to the Navajo Indians, the Navajo Tribe, by its own action, had included specifically 25 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 11.7 6NH \u2014 11.87NH (1958). Thus made part of the tribal law was section 11.87NH, supra, <em>\u201cPeyote violations.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The Secretary on February 11, 1959 approved that action by the Navajo Tribe, thus and thereby consenting to the supersession of 25 C.F.R. Part 11. The Secretary\u2019s law and order Code was no longer to apply to the Navajo Tribe. In necessary consequence the only prohibition thereafter to be applied against the introduction by an Indian into the Navajo Indian reservation, or the sale or the use of peyote by an Indian \u201cwithin said Navajo country\u201d was to be found in what the Navajo Tribe itself had adopted as tribal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Appellants\u2019 complaint did not challenge that 1959 approval by the Secretary. They would have had us say that the 1940 approval by the Secretary was an unlawful act, beyond his powers in that Congress had never authorized the Secretary to take that step. But 25 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-7\"><em>\u201cDuties of Commissioner. </em>The Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, and agreeably to such regulations as the President</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">may prescribe, have the management of all Indian affairs and of all matters arising out of Indian relations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-13\">Appellants, no doubt, would want us-to say with respect to the Secretary\u2019s 1959 approval of the Tribal action that the Secretary, in effect, has unlawfully, in violation of appellants\u2019 First Amendment rights, prohibited the free exercise of religion by these appellants. But the Secretary has done no more than approve action which the Navajo Tribe was-entitled to take. Moreover, his affidavit of record discloses that \u201cneither he nor any employee of the Department of the Interior acting under his direction or supervision has threatened or intends to threaten the plaintiffs, or any of them, with arrest, fine or imprisonment because of their alleged use of peyote on the-Navajo Indian Reservation.\u201d Cf. Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 501, 507, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961). It may be noted that First Amendment rights were-asserted in behalf of the Native American Church,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of various named plaintiffs as its members, and of all others similarly situated, in Native American Church-v. Navajo Tribal Council.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There the District Court refused to enjoin enforcement of the tribal ordinance banning peyote. The Court of Appeals affirmed a judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-14\">While it is so that Congress retains paramount authority to legislate for and enforce its laws on all the tribes <footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in certain respects, only in special in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>stances has it done so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Supreme Court so recently stated: Otherwise, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkWV\">\u201cThe eases in this Court have consistently guarded the authority of Indian governments over their reservations. Congress recognized this authority in the Navajos in the Treaty of 1868, and has done so ever since. If this power is to be taken away from them, it is for Congress to do it.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-3\">We have interpolated the foregoing discussion only because appellants in their complaint had asked \u201cfor such other and further relief which to this Court may seem just and proper.\u201d It is our view that the Secretary\u2019s approval of the tribal action in 1959 was entirely in keeping with that abstinence from federal intervention in the internal affairs of an Indian tribe which the law clearly requires. The Secretary had simply recognized the valid governing authority of the Tribal Council.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">We conclude that the appellants have failed to present more than an abstract question, and in such a situation, the District Court in any event, in the exercise of its discretion might properly have withheld the entry of a declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>Relief had been sought against the Secretary, both individually and officially. Since in our view the Secretary acted properly as an official, it follows that the District Court correctly entered summary judgment and thereupon dismissed the complaint. The Secretary was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-10\">. Established pursuant to the treaty proclaimed August 12, 1868, 15 Stat. 667.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b868-11\">. The complaint alleged that peyote \u201cconsists of the tops of a small cactus, botanically identified as Lophophora Wil-liamsii,\u201d the principal ingredients being alkaloids, of which the most important is mescaline. When taken or administered in accordance with the customs, rites and rituals of the church, the complaint alleges, \u201cpeyote is not a substance deleterious to human life or health, is not habit-fonning and does not result in addiction.\u201d The Secretary\u2019s answer states that he has taken no position and made no findings as to whether peyote is or is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>\u25a0deleterious or habit forming, and avers that \u201cCongress has included peyote within its definition of the term \u2018habit-forming narcotic drug,\u2019 42 U.S.C. sec. 201 (j).\u201d [That section includes, inter alia, opium, with its alkaloid derivatives morphia, heroin and codeine; coca leaves and the derivative cocaine, Indian hemp and its derivatives \u201cand peyote in its various forms.\u201d]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b869-9\">.

The appellants alleged that the Secretary in June, 1960, had rejected their demand that he revoke his predecessor\u2019s approval of the 1940 Tribal Resolution. Thus appellants\u2019 second prayer for relief must likewise fall insofar as appellants asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-19\">\u201c(2) That the action of defendant in failing and refusing to revoke, rescind or withdraw the prior approval granted to Resolution No. CJ-1-40 be declared null, void, illegal and in violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and that defendant\u2019s action be declared arbitrary and capricious * * *_\u00bb</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b870-8\">.
