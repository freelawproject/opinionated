Subsequently, appearing pro se, he filed a motion to amend, requesting the \u201cfair value for work done\u201d in the net amount of $536,873.85, which motion the court allowed. He also filed a belated jury claim, which was denied. The case was referred to a master, who found for Lar-kin in the amount of $6,051.64. Larkin\u2019s objections to the master\u2019s report were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>overruled, the report was confirmed, and judgment was entered thereon, from which he now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">At the threshhold of the appeal is the question whether the master erred, as matter of law, in interpreting a letter from Larkin to Platt as an acceptance of the correctness of an accounting, rather than an offer of compromise. On May 23, 1957 Platt wrote Larkin respecting \u201cyou[r] claim [of] a balance due of $111,436.40. Your figures are incorrect in practically every particular. We list, herewith, an analysis of your account as it stands.\u201d There followed a detailed statement of account. So far as Platt was concerned this was clearly stated as what it considered to be due, and not in any way as a compromise suggestion. On January 20, 1958 Larkin wrote to Platt\u2019s and the surety companys\u2019 counsel, \u201cWe have decided to accept a settlement based on Platt\u2019s letter to us of May 23, 1957 * * * with one exception.\u201d There followed a discussion of one item in Platt\u2019s letter of May 23, which was a payment made by Platt to an alleged creditor of Larkin\u2019s. Larkin objected that this had been paid \u201cbefore the other contract was settled and was not a payment received by us.\u201d Larkin contends his undertaking to accept this \u201csettlement\u201d was in the nature of a compromise offer. The master treated it as an admission that Platt\u2019s accounting was correct except as to the one rejected matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The word \u201csettlement,\u201d sometimes a word of art in legal circles as denoting a compromise, has other well-recognized meanings. Accounts are \u201csettled.\u201d When all obligations of both parties under a contract have been finally disposed of it is common to speak of the contract as being \u201csettled.\u201d Indeed, Larkin used the word in this manner in the second quoted part of his letter. The master was warranted in finding that his earlier use of that word was in the sense of an acceptance of figures as distinguished from a proposal of compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">We have reviewed the master\u2019s .report in the light of the testimony and exhibits. We find no error. Larkin\u2019s claim to recover for all work and materials on the basis of a <em>quantum meruit </em>in disregard of the contract is contrary to established principles.
