Morgan in the original complaint, and both Morgan and Strom in an amended complaint, had sought review of the Secretary\u2019s issuance to Wallis of a public land oil and gas lease of some 826 acres of Government-owned lands in Louisiana at the mouth of the Mississippi River. All the various parties, Wallis included, at different times had filed \u201cpublic lands\u201d lease offers under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 437, as amended, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 181 et seq. (1958), as amended, 30 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 181 et seq., each allegedly including the land for which the Secretary finally deemed Wallis to be qualified. The various parties also had filed separate lease offers on the additional theory that the lands were \u201cacquired lands\u201d of the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-14\">The Director of the Bureau of Land Management concluded that the lands in question were not and could not have been at any time \u201cacquired lands,\u201d for the United States had never previously divested itself of title to the lands in issue, only thereafter to re-acquire them. Accordingly he ruled that the law and the regulations pertaining to <em>public </em>lands must control.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-15\">Thereupon he gave Wallis and Morgan thirty days within which to show cause and to submit briefs and evidence with respect to that ruling. Neither party responded. The Director then ruled that his decision eliminating the \u201cacquired lands\u201d applications had become final, the offers thereunder were deemed finally rejected, and as to those applications, the case was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-16\">With an appeal from that ruling pending before the Secretary, appellant Strom many months later, in 1956, filed public land offers for the same lands, and later, in 1957, filed acquired lands offers with respect thereto. The Secretary affirmed the challenged decision of the Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-17\">The Secretary also rejected the Morgan public land offer on the ground that Morgan had failed to connect the metes and bounds description of unsurveyed lands with a corner of the public lands surveys. He ruled additionally that the description in the Morgan application was insufficient under the applicable regulation <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to identify the land. It may be noted that the regulations also provide that an offer will be rejected and will confer no priority unless it be completed in accordance with the regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-18\">The Secretary concluded that Wallis had filed a proper public lands lease offer which complied with the Department regulations. Thus the award went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>him as the first qualified applicant,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the Secretary found Strom to be junior to Wallis.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The Secretary\u2019s decision is subject to judicial review only if it can be shown that he has acted arbitrarily or unreasonably or that his interpretation of what constitutes \u201cpublic lands\u201d is erroneous as a matter of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\"> The Secretary had been granted authorization by the Act \u201cto prescribe necessary and proper rules and regulations and to do any or all things necessary to carry out and accomplish the purpose of this Act * * <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> His interpretation of his own regulations is of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It has long been established that the determination by the Secretary of a question of fact on a matter within his jurisdiction is well-nigh conclusive.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here the District Court with the administrative record before it, entered findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the Secretary\u2019s decision. In light of the record, we have considered the claims advanced by the appellants and have discerned no adequate basis upon which that determination may be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">It follows that the appellants have failed to sustain their burden of demonstrating error in the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that Wallis was the first qualified applicant and is entitled to the lease.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly the order of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-10\">.
