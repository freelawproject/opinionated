The latter, not having been served in this District, appeared specially and filed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>motion to dismiss in which the Commissioner joined. This appeal is from the order dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">It appears that the Commissioner on October 28, 1958, published for opposition in the Official Gazette, Burlington\u2019s application Serial No. 38,667 for registration of its trade-mark BUR-TEX for life preservers, swim vests, water ski belts, wading pools and various other sports goods. Registration was opposed by Barr which for many years was registrant of the trade-mark BARR for toys, such as balls, dolls, basketballs, footballs and other items of various shapes, and of the mark BARTEX for rubber balloons.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board noted that BARR is a surname while BUR-TEX is a coined, arbitrary designation having no apparent significance. The respective marks were found to be distinctly different in sound and appearance. In view of what the Board deemed substantial differences between the marks and the goods as identified in the Burlington application and the opposer\u2019s registration, the Board concluded it to be unlikely, within the ambit of 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(d), that the respective marks as applied to the goods would cause confusion, mistake, or deception of purchasers. The Board further con-eluded as to BARTEX, applied to toy rubber balloons when contrasted with BUR-TEX as applied to Burlington\u2019s sports goods and equipment that purchasers would not be likely to assume that the respective products emanate from the same source. The opposition accordingly was dismissed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_y\">Thereupon, Barr as a \u201cdissatisfied\u201d party gave due notice of its appeal to the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1071 and 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 142 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"AjKh\">Burlington, as a party \u201csatisfied with the decision\u201d of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, was entitled to invoke application of the next step, as 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1071 expressly provides. When Burhngton exercised the right there conferred upon it, all further proceedings were to be conducted as a civil action as provided in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 146 (1958). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqkN\">Section 146 prescribes the mode in which that civil action is to proceed, The \u201csuit may be instituted against the party in interest as shown by the records of the Patent Office at the time of the decifon complained of.\u201d That \u201cparty in fter+ef fcon&gt; tbe applicant before thf. Pateat \u00b0ffice ln/he \u201cter partes proc\u00aee1dlf?'w\u00cd!ieh arosJe fro\u201cthe fi!ed by the registrant Barr,</p>\n<p id=\"Atf\">Under the circumstances such as were exhibited on this record, Burlington is an adverse party, and the only one. Had there been more than one adverse party residing in a plurality of districts not embraced within the same state, or \u201can adverse party residing in a foreign country,\u201d pursuant to section 146, the District Court for the District of Columbia would have had jurisdiction,</p>\n<p id=\"ARd\">However section 146 expressly specifies that the Commissioner of Patents \u201cshall not be a necessary party,\u201d and jurisdiction may not be obtained by service upon him. We have noted that the Commissioner is not an \u201cadverse\u201d party for the jurisdictional purposes of the statute,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as here invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"AvN\">The District Court correctly dismissed the complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"amz-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-9\">. The Barr Rubber Products Company v. Burlington Mills Incorporated, 125 USPQ 592 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b317-12\">. The Commissioner took the position that he is \u201cnot a necessary party to an inter partes proceeding under Section 146,\u201d but that Burlington is an \u201cindispensable party,\u201d not amenable to process in the District of Columbia, and had been served only in Burlington, Wisconsin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"avl-dedup-0\">.
