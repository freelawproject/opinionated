Appellant was given a sentence of 5 years imprisonment on each count, with the sentences on counts 1, 2, and 3 to run consecutively to each other, and with the sentences on the rest of the counts to run concurrently with those on the first three counts. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>term of appellant\u2019s imprisonment thus amounted to a total of 15 years.</p>\n<p id=\"AbK\">P. ^ \u201e ,, ,, [1,2] The first basis of appellant s motion to vacate was a contention that all the counts m the indictment were fatally defective m that they failed to charge that, m making the sales or in conspiring to effect them, appellant had knowingly and wilful y undertaken to violate the statute. We long ago held, however, under the Harrison Narcotics Act, that criminal intent is not an element of the offense of selling narcotic drugs m violation of the statute. Daugherty v. United States, 8 Cir 2 F 2d 691, reversed on other grounds 269 U.S. 360, 46 S.Ct. 156, 70 L.Ed. 309. The motive with which one may have engaged m such forbidden selling, or in conspiring to effect such forbidden sales as have been completed, is wholly immaterial. Guilbeau v. United States, 5 Cir., 288 F. 731, 733.</p>\n<p id=\"AB2t\">The provision of the Harrison Narcotics Act, 38 Stat. 786, that \u201cit , ,, , , \u201e , \u00bb , \u201e shall be unlawful for any person to sell, , , , .

This prohibition has judicially been regarded, through the years, in the numerous prosecutions which have been made under it, as involving no question of intent. Neither the language of the statute nor any existing decision affords any possible basis for appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-36\">The second ground of appellant\u2019s motion was a statement that he had \u00abentered a plea of guiLy with the under- , v \u2022 p , \u2022 .. , tt <em>n </em>standing by information that the U. S. ... .i, .. ,, , i . Attorney told him that he would receive more than the minimum, but it would be (the counsel\u2019s advice) from seven to ten years (See Exhibit A) but received fifteen years\u201d. Exhibit A referred to in appellant\u2019s statement and attached by Hm ag a bagig fop big motion&gt; contained nothing that eould be contended to con-fltitute an improper inducement in regard tQ ^ lengtb of hig sentence. To ^ contrary; it demonstrated that all ^ had occurred in the situation was tbat the United gtateg Attorney and ap.. pellant,g appointed counsel had each ven. tured an opinion Qr prediction as to what gentence tbe courfc mig.ht impose&gt; and that appellant&gt;s counBel had made it clear that thege were merely personal estimates Qr gueggeg without implication of bagig for relianee on tbem ag far as the court wag concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"AoJ\">The exhibit consisted of a letter to appellant from his counsel in which it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APKY\">\u201cWith respect to your inquiry concerning my statement that you would re\u201cive than a seven year f1S\u00b0n s\u00ae\u00eden*e f0r P^ding guilty, I remember that matter quite dis- ,. <em>,, </em>TT ., , , ... tmctly. The United States Attorney , ... ,, , , . ,, , ., handling the case stated that it was . . ,, . his opinion that you would receive ,, ,, more than the minimum because of . , your prior record, and that it was ; . ,,,,,, ,,, hls gUeSS thatTth&lt;? seate?.ce \"\u00b0u d b,\u00ae years\u2018 a 1S iac y *e([a stating to you that, although the TT -x j cu , . , \u2019 , United States Attorney was much . ... ... , <em>\u00b0 </em>more familiar with such matters, it ,. was my estimation that your sen- . ,,, p J \u201e tence would be for ten years. <em>J</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agt\">Mere prediction as to the court\u2019s likely attitude on sentence, whether made by the United States Attorney or by defendant\u2019s appointed counsel, is not a ground for having a sentence vacated and a plea of guilty withdrawn, where it has been indicated or otherwise is manifest that the expression is one of personal opinion&gt; witb n0 bagig for the defendant to regard it as involving any agreement or , , ,. ,, , understanding with the court.
