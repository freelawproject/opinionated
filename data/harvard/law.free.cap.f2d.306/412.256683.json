The first count charged him with receiving, concealing, selling and facilitating the transportation, concealment and sale of some 4.9 grams of heroin imported and brought into the United States contrary to law, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7\u2022 173 and 174. The second count charged him with receiving, concealing, and facilitating the transportation and concealment of 51.4 grams of heroin, in contravention of the same statute. The third count accused him of assaulting, opposing, impeding and interfering with agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics engaged in and on account of their official duties, in violation of 18 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 111 and 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-23\">The jury convicted Mont on the first and third counts and acquitted him on the second; the judge sentenced' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>him to six years\u2019 imprisonment on the first count and to one year\u2019s on the third, the sentences to run concurrently. We need not concern ourselves with alleged errors in the trial of the second count, on which Mont was acquitted, unless these affected the fairness of his trial on the first count. Similarly, if the conviction on the first count was proper, any errors in the trial of the third count, on which he was given a shorter concurrent sentence, that did not affect the trial on the first count, are of no moment, Lawn v. United States, 355 U.S. 339, 362, 78 S.Ct. 311, 2 L.Ed.2d 321 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">On the evening of June 21, 1961, acting on the basis of a telephone message from an unnamed caller, whose information was not considered sufficiently substantial to obtain a warrant, Federal Narcotics Agent Bailey and his \u201cpartner,\u201d Agent Carrozo, went to a building at 411 W. 128th St. to conduct surveillance of Mont, whom, because of the telephone call, they suspected of being engaged in packaging narcotics for sale to addicts. According to their testimony, which, so far as credible, we must here follow, United States v. Brown, 236 F.2d 403, 405 (2 Cir. 1956); United States v. Burgos, 269 F.2d 763, 765 (2 Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 362 U.S. 942, 80 S.Ct. 808, 4 L.Ed.2d 771 (1960), on entering the lobby they saw Mont \u201cstanding just inside the threshold of apartment No. 6.\u201d Mont, appearing to have recognized Carrozo, \u201cmomentarily froze,\u201d and then raised his left hand to his mouth, inserting therein glassine envelopes of the sort commonly used in the narcotics trade. Bailey shouted, \u201cFederal Officers, you are under arrest.\u201d Mont allegedly slam-locked the open door of Apartment No. 6, threw the keys into the backyard through an open door, and made a break to follow them. A scuffle ensued. Carrozo grabbed Mont who brought his knee up and kicked Carrozo hard in the groin. Bailey seized Mont and stuck his hand into Mont\u2019s mouth to retrieve the contraband, whereupon Mont took the maxillary action not unnatural under the circumstances and lacerated Bailey\u2019s thumb. After some further struggle Carrozo administered a blow to Mont\u2019s solar plexus; allegedly as a result of this, the glassine envelopes, numbering 25 and containing some 4.5 grams of heroin, fell from Mont\u2019s mouth. Nearly a quarter of an hour in total elapsed before Mont was subdued.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">After making a field test of the contents of one of the envelopes, finding that they contained heroin, and regaining the keys, Carrozo opened Apartment No. 6 and searched it. The agents found 135 similar glassine envelopes containing some 22 grams of heroin in the pocket of a jacket, and a package containing 21% grams in the false bottom of a cigarette box, but no paraphernalia for packaging. They also searched an automobile, belonging to Mont\u2019s wife, without result.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\"> After a preliminary hearing, F.R.Crim.Proc. 41, 18 U.S.C.A., Judge Dimock denied a motion to suppress the narcotics, holding that the seizure of the 25 envelopes and the search resulting in the seizure of the heroin in the apartment were incident to a lawful arrest. The agents\u2019 observation of Mont\u2019s conduct, particularly in the light of the information previously given, met the requirements of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(2) with respect to arrest. Hence the only question as to the seizure of the 25 glassine envelopes relates to their extraction from Mont\u2019s person. The Government stresses that the envelopes were not withdrawn from Mont\u2019s mouth by Bailey but were exploded by Carrozo\u2019s blow to the solar plexus, and points to Espinoza v. United States, 278 F.2d 802 (5 Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 827, 81 S.Ct. 65, 5 L.Ed.2d 55 (1960), as sanctioning even more vigorous methods of removal. The distinction between extraction and explosion seems dubious, even if we could believe that Mont possessed such singular oral retaining powers, and appellant contends that Espinoza should not be followed in the light of possibly contrary intimations arising from Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952). However, we are not here required to decide the issue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>appellant tenders. Mont started the fight, altogether unlawfully on the agents\u2019 testimony which Judge Dimock was warranted in accepting, and the agents\u2019 response must be viewed in that atmosphere and in the context of the necessity to quell resistance to a valid arrest. Judge Dimock\u2019s ruling that the search of Mont\u2019s apartment was lawful rested on the agents\u2019 testimony that Mont was arrested \u201cjust inside the threshold,\u201d Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20, 46 S.Ct. 4, 70 L.Ed. 145 (1925); United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 62-65, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653 (1950); Carlo v. United States, 286 F.2d 841 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 366 U.S. 944, 81 S.Ct. 1672, 6 L.Ed.2d 855 (1961). Appellant contends this testimony was incredible in the light of evidence that the only lock that was in working order was one which required use of a key. The Government responds that even on that view, a search that would have been lawful, because reasonable, if a defendant were arrested one step inside the threshold, does not become unlawful because he was arrested a step outside it, see Clifton v. United States, 224 F.2d 329 (4 Cir.), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 894, 76 S.Ct. 152, 100 L.Ed. 786 (1955); Kremen v. United States, 353 U.S. 346, 77 S.Ct. 828, 1 L.Ed. 2d 876 (1957). We are not required to decide these questions since the narcotics seized in the apartment were offered only in support of the second count on which the jury acquitted, see Gibson v. United States, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 81, 149 F.2d 381, cert. denied sub nom. O\u2019Kelley v. United States, 326 U.S. 724, 66 S.Ct. 29, 90 L.Ed. 429 (1945); Blassingame v. United States, 254 F.2d 309 (9 Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The only objection to the admission of evidence that we need to consider relates to testimony of Carrozo, on redirect examination, that he had \u201creceived information to the effect that the defendant had picked up or had delivered to him two ounces of heroin and at that moment he [the defendant] was in his apartment putting it in small glassine envelopes in order to distribute to the addict trade.\u201d The judge instructed the jury that such hearsay evidence \u201ccan be considered by you only on the question whether the narcotics agents reasonably believed that the defendant was committing a crime at the time they arrested him\u201d and not \u201con the question whether the defendant actually had possession of narcotics.\u201d Appellant says the charge did not cure the alleged error, first, because it came too late, an argument which is not here persuasive, see Judge L. Hand in United States v. Smith, 283 F.2d 760, 764 (2 Cir. 1960), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 851, 81 S.Ct. 815, 5 L.Ed.2d 815 (1961); United States v. Crosby, 294 F.2d 928, 946 (2 Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 984, 82 S.Ct. 599, 7 L.Ed.2d 523. (1962) , and, second, because probable cause for the arrest was not an issue for the jury, Ford v. United States, 273 U.S. 593, 605-606, 47 S.Ct. 531, 71 L.Ed. 793 (1927), which is more so. The Government responds that the testimony was admissible to show that the agents were performing their official duties, an essential element of the crime charged in the third count, so that even if there were an error in the instruction, it was harmless because the evidence was admissible for a broader purpose. Appellant could rejoin that, since no one had disputed that the agents were going about Government business, the judge should nevertheless have excluded hearsay that was so obviously detrimental, see 6 Wigmore, Evidence (3 ed. 1940) \u00a7 1864, at 491. Without deciding as to any of these contentions, we uphold receipt of the evidence on the basis of another argument of the Government, namely, that defendant\u2019s counsel \u201copened the door\u201d by questioning Carrozo as to the nature of the information he had received, in a futile effort to lay the basis for a claim of entrapment, even after specific warning from the Court that the consequences would be that \u201cthe floodgates are open and the Government can tell all they know about your client,\u201d United States v. Angelet, 231 F.2d 190, 192 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 351 U.S. 952, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>76 S.Ct. 849, 100 L.Ed. 1476 (1956). Defendant\u2019s general objection to the evidence was thus properly overruled; no request was made that the hearsay be limited to the issue raised on cross-\u25a0examination, Malatkofski v. United States, 179 F.2d 905, 914 (1 Cir. 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"AQO\">The two remaining questions meriting discussion relate to the charge. The judge read from the familiar clause in 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174, \u201cWhenever on trial for a violation of this section the defendant is shown to have or to have had possession of the narcotic drug, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless the defendant explains the possession to the satisfaction of the jury,\u201d and charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-3\">\u201cYou see this can answer the question in any case where a defendant is proved beyond a reasonable doubt to have possession of the drug and does not explain that possession to your satisfaction. That is enough to entitle you to conclude that he knows that it [the drug] has been unlawfully imported into the United States and that its possession would be unlawful \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">When he asked whether there were any \u25a0exceptions, defendant s counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-15\">\u201cThe only exception I have is your Honor\u2019s failure to charge the intentional violation of the indictment knowingly and wilfully. Outside of that I have nothing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-19\">'To this the court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARf\">\u201cI don\u2019t like to emphasize one thing as against the rest of the things I said. I think Section 174 is broad enough so that knowing possession would be enough to authorize conviction so that while if you gave that request in advance I would have given it, I don\u2019t think I will do it now. You may have your exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-30\">It would have been better if the judge had granted the request so as to make it crystal-clear that the jury \u25a0must be convinced of the defendant\u2019s \u25a0guilty knowledge, although referring again to the so-called presumption if he thought this needed for completeness, The Government always has the burden of establishing that defendant knew that what he was receiving, concealing, etc. was a narcotic drug imported in violation of law; guilty knowledge is clearly an essential element of the offense defined 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174, Harris v. United States, 359 U.S. 19, 23, 79 S.Ct. 560, 3 L.Ed.2d 597 (1959); cf. Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952). However, once the Government has proved possession \u00b0t what in fact was a narcotic drug, it need do no more to <em>get </em>to the jury, which <em>may </em>convict unless the defendant explains the possession to its satisfaction. Appellant\u2019s claim that \u00a7 174 relieves the Government only of proving knowledge of importation contrary to law is with\u00b0ut mfrit- The statute says, more broadly\u2019 that sueh Possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless the defendant explains the Possession to the satisfaction of the Jury\u2019 and the Supreme Court has shown no disposition to construe \u00a7 174 to mean less than ^ says, Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 63 and fn. 14, 77 S.Ct. 623, <em>1 </em>L.Ed.2d 639 (1957); Harris v. United States, supra; cf. Casey v. United States, 276 U.S. 413, 48 S.Ct. 373, 72 L.Ed. 632 (1928). Where the charge left something to be desired was that although it correctly said that possession of the drug \u201cis enough to entitle you to conclude that he knows that it has been unlawfully imported into the United States and that its possession would be unlawful,\u201d it did not add \u201ca conclusion to which you must come before you can convict,\u201d or words to that effect. It would be hypercritical to reverse on such a nicety, when there is nothing to indicate that any defect in the instruction could have been prejudicial. In a recent case where there was an issue of guilty knowledge far more serious than here, the defendant there having testified that she believed the packages of narcotics found on her person actually contained essence of perfume, we approved an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>struction that \u201cthe statute \u2018casts upon her [the defendant] the burden of rebutting this inference, [that she was importing and concealing the heroin in violation of Section 174] by explaining to the satisfaction of the jury that she did not know she was importing a narcotic drug.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Christmann, 298 F.2d 651, 653 (2 Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The second criticism of the charge is that the judge submitted the entire first count of the indictment to the jury, although, it is urged, there was no evidence, other than the hearsay statement of the informer, that would warrant a conclusion that Mont sold or facilitated a sale. The Government answers that under \u00a7 174 unexplained possession alone permits an inference of sale or facilitation of sale, even though the logical basis for such an inference is more tenuous than with respect to receipt or concealment, Yee Hem v. United States, 268 U.S. 178, 45 S.Ct. 470, 69 L.Ed. 904 (1925), or even purchase, Casey v. United States, supra, at 418, 48 S.Ct. at 374, since in many cases the possession will be for use rather than sale. However, we are not required to rely on this, since if there were any error in submitting the issue of sale to the jury, which we do not decide, it was not prejudicial. It would be impossible for anyone to have concluded, on the evidence here, that Mont had sold or facilitated a sale of heroin but had not received or concealed it. Indeed, the charge made it evident that the prime issue to which the jury should direct its attention was Mont\u2019s \u201creceiving\u201d the heroin. True, the judge\u2019s statement that \u201cthis, of course, would follow irresistibly if you find he had possession of them\u201d was not completely correct \u2014 if someone had slipped heroin into Mont\u2019s pocket without his knowledge at the time, Mont might be \u201cpossessing\u201d it without having \u201creceived\u201d it \u2014 but since there was nothing to suggest such an extraordinary circumstance, any incompleteness of the instruction created no prejudice on the evidence here. Very likely if the judge had been asked to tell the jury to consider only receiving and concealing, he would have done so. Hence, even if there were error in what he did, which we do not say, the case would not be one for the use of our power under the \u201cplain error\u201d rule, F.R.Crim.Proc. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">We have reviewed the grand jury minutes of Carrozo\u2019s testimony and agree with Judge Dimock in seeing no inconsistency requiring that they be turned over to defense counsel. We have considered all other grounds assigned and find them without merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-6\">. Counsel for appellant requested that we reconsider the previous action of another panel (Judge Waterman dissenting), sustained by the Circuit Justice, refusing to interfere with Judge Dimock\u2019s denial of bail pending appeal. We agree with counsel that the questions on appeal were not frivolous. However, the denial of bail appears to have rested also on appellant\u2019s being a poor bail risk, a consideration even more persuasive now that we have unanimously affirmed his conviction, lienee we decline to grant bail pending application for rehearing or certiorari.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
