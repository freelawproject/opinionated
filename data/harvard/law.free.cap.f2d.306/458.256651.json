Jackson, retired from the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, to exercise the judicial functions of a United States District Judge envisioned in Article III of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">In March 1959, after a trial by a jury in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, with Judge Jackson presiding, O\u2019Connor was convicted and sentenced for the offense of robbery, in violation of 22 D.C.Code, \u00a7 2901. Motions for a mental examination and for relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 were both unsuccessful, as were attempts to appeal from the denials of those motions. The \u00a7 2255 motion was predicated on an alleged denial of an opportunity for O\u2019Connor to make a statement in his own behalf prior to sentencing. F.R, Crim.P. 32(a), 18 U.S.C.A. All of the foregoing proceedings in the District Court were conducted by Judge Jackson who had retired from the Court of Customs &amp; Patent Appeals in 1952, and was sitting in the District Court for the District of Columbia under an assignment by the Chief Justice of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-16\">In February 1961 O\u2019Connor filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. That petition asserted that Judge Jackson was not an Article III Judge, and therefore had no constitutional authority to preside over the trial of a felony case in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The argument went on that a \u00a7 2255 motion to the sentencing Court was not required as that Court was without authority \u201cto act at all,\u201d and hence, in the words of the statute, \u201cThe remedy by [\u00a7 2255] motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. This appeal followed from the denial of that petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-17\">Through the recent decisions of the Supreme Court in Glidden Co. v. Zdanok (Lurk v. United States) 1962, 370 U.S. 530, 82 S.Ct. 1459, 8 L.Ed.2d 671, the constitutional question has been authoritatively determined as has been the Article III status of Judge Jackson \u2014 the very same Judge in the Lurk ease. As it is clear that O\u2019Connor could not prevail on the merits of his constitutional claim, we need not decide the preliminary question whether the remedy of habeas corpus, rather than \u00a7 2255, was open to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-18\">We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
