Defendants\u2019 brief graphically describes the episode. Mrs. Ford \u201cwas a passenger in a motor vehicle * * * which was stopped in a line of traffic * * *. There were three vehicles stopped behind the car in which plaintiff was a passenger and a truck owned and operated by the defendants hit the rear of the fourth car which caused a chain reaction and the car in which the plaintiff was a passenger was struck.\u201d Judgment was entered for Mrs. Ford. This appeal raises no issue as to the defendants\u2019 negligence as found by the jury but attacks various rulings by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b854-21\">It is claimed that the trial judge erred in not permitting defense counsel to ask his witness a \u201cdirect question\u201d as to whether or not he had made certain statements. It does not appear that counsel purported to quote specifically the challenged statement of any particular one of three witnesses. Without our making point of possible ambiguity on that account, we will develop the setting and the background in which the questioned ruling appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-22\">A police officer testified that defendants\u2019 driver said he was driving the defendants\u2019 dump truck about twenty miles per hour at the <em>moment </em>of impact. Robinson, the driver of the car ahead of the truck, testified that the truck had \u201crammed\u201d into the rear of his car so that it resulted in a \u201ctotal loss.\u201d The officer further testified that each of the four cars ahead of the truck, and the truck itself, had been damaged more or less severely.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-23\">The transcript discloses that after the series of collisions, defendants\u2019 driver, Cureton, and his helper, Brooks, got out of the truck, and \u201ceverybody that was involved got out of the cars,\u201d immediately. There was testimony that they were all \u201cexcited.\u201d Brooks made a statement to Cureton, admitted as part of the res gestae, \u201cthat he was driving too fast all day long,\u201d Mrs. Ford testified. Robinson testified that the helper said \u201cI have told you to cut your speed down, way back, I told you to cut your speed.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>On cross examination defendants\u2019 counsel again asked \u201cJust what it was that your man said that got out of the truck to Mr. Cureton?\u201d The answer was \u201cWell, I heard him say to him, he said, T told you to cut your speed, way back,\u2019 that\u2019s what he said, T told you to cut down on your speed\u2019 \u201d \u2014 and \u201cHe said it a couple of times.\u201d Defense counsel brought out that the statement was made by Brooks \u201cnear\u201d the car and the truck. Mrs. Thomas, driver of the car in which plaintiff had been riding, testified that the \u201colder man\u201d [Brooks] said \u201cthe boy had been driving real fast all day and he had been after him * *</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Brooks when called as a defense witness was asked certain questions and made reply as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-6\">Q. [Defense counsel] Now, did you at any time while you were there, after the accident occurred, on this bridge, make any statement to Roy Cureton, \u2014 A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-7\">Q. Wait a minute. That you were speeding all day or traveling fast all day and \u201cI told you so?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-8\">[Plaintiff\u2019s counsel] Now, Your Honor, I object\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-9\">The Court: The objection is sustained on the basis that the question suggests the answer; it is a leading question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-10\">[Defense counsel] Well, if Your Honor please, three witnesses have made that statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-11\">The Court : I realize that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-12\">[Defense counsel] I put this witness on only in rebuttal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-13\">The Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-14\">[Defense counsel] How can I rebut unless I ask that particular question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-15\">The Court: Certainly you can ask him if he had any conversation at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-21\">[Defense counsel] That doesn\u2019t make a direct denial of that. All right, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-22\">[Defense counsel] Did you make any statement at all to Roy Cureton at any time? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-23\">Q. Was anything mentioned about speed? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-24\">Defendants here argue that the trial judge erred in his ruling that the question as noted was \u201cleading.\u201d Trial judges have been and must be given a wide discretion in matters such as this. Some judges will permit questions to be so framed as to take account specifically of the exact testimony which the witness is called upon to refute. Certainly in some circumstances that approach is entirely proper. We have quoted the testimony challenged in rebuttal, for the three witnesses in phrasing their recollection had differed, not unusually, in varying degrees as to the precise wording of what they had heard Brooks say. But the substance of their recollection was uniform, and it is our view that in refutation of the questioned testimony, the defense received the full import of the denial by Brooks. Not once, but twice, he testified that he had made no \u201cstatement\u201d to Cureton after the accident. Nothing had been \u201cmentioned about speed,\u201d Brooks said, so that an issue was squarely raised. If the jury had believed Brooks, the testimony of the three witnesses on this point obviously could not stand. We fail to see how the defendants were prejudiced in light of the record as developed above. After all, the whole purpose of examination as well as cross examination, is to get at the facts and to exhibit to the jury a basis for its resolution of the issues. We are satisfied that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">It is next asserted that the trial judge erroneously allowed the plaintiff on June 20, 1961, to call a medical witness, Dr. Gordon, as to the permanency of Mrs. Ford\u2019s injury. Defense counsel objected although he had received on May 23, 1961 a copy of Dr. Gordon\u2019s report.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-5\">The Court: Now, what detriment do you sustain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-6\">[Defense counsel] I relied upon the stipulation we have in the case * * -\u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-7\">The Court: Do you allege that you are taken by surprise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-8\">[Defense counsel] No. That has nothing to do with it. It doesn\u2019t come under that. I am saying we have a definite stipulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">The record shows that at pretrial, January 31, 1961, plaintiff had asserted her intention to urge a claim for permanent injury to her cervical and lumbar spine, adding that supporting evidence was not then available. The parties accordingly stipulated for an exchange by March 1, 1961, of medical reports <em>then </em>in hand and for \u201ca similar exchange of all such reports within 48 hours of the alert for this case for trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">No time limit was set for providing any such later reports. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel agreed to make his client available for a physical examination by a physician of defendants\u2019 choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">With the case approaching trial status, Dr. Gordon examined the plaintiff on May 8, 1961, but a written report of his findings had not been received on May 9, 1961 when plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved to amend the January pretrial stipulation. He had informed defense counsel of \u201cwhat the doctor says.\u201d Defense counsel objected \u201cfor the simple reason that this was pretried January 31, 1961.\u201d The pretrial judge ruled that no amendment was necessary since the original pretrial stipulation was broad enough to include the claim of permanent injury. Mrs. Ford\u2019s counsel again offered the plaintiff for examination. The judge asked defense counsel \u201cDo you want any examination?\u201d He replied, \u201cYour Honor please, I am ready for trial and that is all I can say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">Clearly, if the case had then gone to trial without plaintiff\u2019s counsel having supplied Dr. Gordon\u2019s report within forty-eight hours in advance, a very different problem would have arisen. There still would have been the question of whether an injured plaintiff properly should be debarred in her only chance for recovery from presenting evidence of her full claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">But the case did not then go to trial; trial did not commence until June 19, 1961. Meanwhile, Dr. Gordon\u2019s report had been furnished to the defense nearly one month before trial. The trial judge saw no breach of the January stipulation in view of such facts. Neither do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-15\">Defense counsel would argue that an exchange between plaintiff\u2019s counsel and Judge Pine altered all arrangements which previously had been made. It seems that on May 12, 1961, counsel for the parties appeared before Judge Pine as the plaintiff asked for a continuance of one week due to the fact that a key witness, Dr. Braden, who had treated the plaintiff on some 30 occasions, had made previous plans to be away at a medical convention. He was already under subpoena and, no doubt, could have been compelled to forego his own plans if the case had to be tried that very week. Defense counsel, objecting, pointed out that plaintiff\u2019s counsel \u201cwanted to change the pretrial this past Wednesday and did that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-16\">Judge Pine granted the continuance of one week, observing \u201cthere will be no more continuances after that.\u201d It is asserted that the continuance was conditioned on assurances that the \u201cstatus quo\u201d was to be maintained, which the defense interprets as precluding the plaintiff from producing Dr. Gordon. We do not agree that the record may fairly be so construed. Judge Pine was talking about Dr. Braden. The defense then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>knew that Dr. Gordon had examined Mrs. Ford on May 8, and the defense attorney had been informed on May 9th of \u201cwhat the doctor says.\u201d All that was lacking was Dr. Gordon\u2019s medical report which was to be furnished at least forty-eight hours before trial. The transcript of the proceedings before Judge Pine makes no reference to Dr. Gordon. We find no basis whatever for the contention that plaintiff agreed to forego presenting Dr. Gordon as a witness in return for the continuance necessitated by the intended absence of Dr. Braden.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Defense counsel argued to the trial judge that he relied upon the \u201cstipulation,\u201d supra, as the \u201cmain ground\u201d for his objection to testimony by Dr. Gordon. He added, in effect, that the doctor <em>could </em>not qualify, since he had examined the plaintiff \u201cpurely for the purpose of testifying.\u201d As Dr. Gordon had \u201cnever treated her,\u201d counsel insisted, the doctor \u201ccan\u2019t testify under those circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The judge asked: \u201cCan\u2019t he examine her and testify as to his opinion?\u201d [Defense counsel] \u201cNot under the cases that I have, if Your Honor please; they very definitely say no.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Not persuaded, the trial judge allowed examination of Dr. Gordon to proceed. Appellant attacks that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-19\">Appellant seems to have anticipated that Dr. Gordon, a specialist in orthopedic surgery, was being called to give an opinion based only on <em>statements </em>made to him by Mrs. Ford, not for purposes of treatment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but solely to qualify him as a witness. In the latter circumstance, some cases hold that such statements are inadmissible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even in such cases, however, it is seen that a qualified expert may testify as to his findings in the course of his own physical examination of the party and his opinion based thereon, and may answer competent hypothetical questions propounded to him as an expert.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We have allowed an expert, even in a criminal case, to testify as to the opinion he reached based on his physical examination of the complainant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In District of Columbia v. White,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> this court found no error where an expert medical witness testified that at a consultation with the plaintiff\u2019s physician, he was given a history of the case, including the fact of an earlier injury. \u201cSuch information furnishes the basis for the opinion or conclusion arrived at in almost every diagnosis, \u2014 certainly in cases where the trouble arises from accident,\u201d the court noted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>Here one of the medical questions in issue was the degree of recovery from or the possibility of permanent residual effects of the injury. Dr. Gordon testified concerning the series of tests to which he subjected Mrs. Ford. He rested his prognosis upon what he recited as \u201csufficient findings on an objective basis.\u201d It is clear from the record that his opinion was so predicated. Accordingly, Dr. Gordon was a competent witness<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and his <em>testimony was </em>properly received.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Di\\ Braden first saw Mrs. Ford on February 7, 1960, at Casualty Hospital. Thereafter and down to May 3,1961, he saw her on some thirty occasions. Based on his experience with and knowledge of Mrs. Ford\u2019s injury and the course of her recovery, he expressed the opinion \u201cthat this thing is probably permanent.\u201d Dr. Gordon was asked to express an opinion as to whether Mrs. Ford \u201cdoes or does not have a permanent residual weakness or disability as a result of her injury.\u201d He answered \u201cit would appear at this time that it is permanent but I can\u2019t be absolutely sure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Defendants contend that such evidence was insufficient to predicate admission of mortality tables indicating a life expectancy of 33 years. We disagree. What weight the jury might accord to that evidence was a matter solely within its province. If the jury concluded that permanency of injury in some degree had been shown, the mortality tables provided competent statistical evidence, not as \u201cabsolute guides of the judgment and conscience of the jury,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but as data to be taken into account in calculating a basis for the award of fair and reasonable damages in light of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">We have carefully considered all claimed errors, so earnestly and diligently pressed by defendants\u2019 counsel. We are satisfied that the defendants have not shown prejudicial error affecting their substantial rights.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"AMn\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b854-24\"> Throughout we will refer to the parties as they were designated at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-16\">.
