C. for a period not to exceed 30 days; and (3) in failing, in its Order, to require that the production of documents be to, and before, a member of the Commission or one of its Hearing Examiners?</p>\n<p id=\"b280-23\">These issues are presented on this appeal by the four appellants from the District Court\u2019s Order entered following a hearing on a rule to show cause, pursuant to the Commission\u2019s Application<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>for enforcement of its subpoenas requiring appellants to give testimony and produce documentary evidence in an investigation being conducted by the Commission. In its Application, the Commission alleged that the appellants had failed and refused to comply with the subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">In its Memorandum and Order<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the District Court stated \u201c * * * we have examined and re-examined the. entire record and are totally unable to determine from it that the business corporations herein involved would in the slightest degree be hindered in their normal operations by the production and turning over of the various documents contained in the specifications attached to the subpoenas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Appellants do not challenge the relevance of the records involved to the Commission\u2019s investigation although they dispute the District Court\u2019s finding that they would not be hindered in the normal operations of their business by turning over the records to the Commission. On this score it must be noted that the District Court, in its Memorandum Opinion, stated that \u201cif it is brought to the attention of the Court that any serious hindrance to respondents\u2019 business will be caused by adherence to the provisions of the Order, we will reconsider it as to those specific instances.\u201d Further, the Commission\u2019s subpoenas specifically provided that <em>copies </em>of appellants\u2019 records</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">could be produced in lieu of original records.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Pertinent to our disposition of the instant appeal are these facts as evidenced by the record:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">Appellants<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Standard American, Inc. (\u201cStandard\u201d) and Mansville Construction, Inc. (\u201cMansville\u201d) are engaged in the sale of home improvement fixtures, equipment and supplies and their installation ; appellant Val Worth Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cVal Worth\u201d) prepares scripts for and produces television commercials for Standard and Mansville, and appellant Wolf, Dorleg and Wolf, Inc. (\u201cWolf\u201d) buys time from TV stations for these commercials.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">The appellants have interlocking officers and directors; Sam Leonard is president of Standard and Mansville and an officer and director of Val Worth and Wolf; Samuel Moskowitz is secretary and treasurer of Standard and Mansville and an officer and director of Val Worth and Wolf;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Abraham B. Wolf is president of Val Worth and Wolf; vice-president, office manager and accountant of Standard and Mansville.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">On January 5, 1961, the Commission, in the course of an <em>ex parte </em>administrative investigation to determine whether appellants, among others, \u201cin connection with the sale and offering for sale of home improvement fixtures, equipment and supplies and the installation thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>are engaging in false and misleading advertising or other deceptive acts or practices in a manner violative of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act\u201d,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> served subpoenas upon appellants requiring them to appear at the United States Court House in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before one Eugene R. Baker, a designated attorney-examiner of the Commission, and to testify and produce specified documentary evidence. The documents subpoenaed were limited to the calendar year 1960. The appearance of each appellant was scheduled in the subpoenas for stated hours on January 23-24-25, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Appellants, in response to the subpoena, appeared through Leonard and Wolf. The record establishes that they failed to produce numerous records specified in the subpoenas and that their oral testimony was so evasive at times that it bordered on sham and evidenced a transparent attempt to conceal the truth.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, with respect to such records as were produced appellants refused to permit the Commission\u2019s attorney-examiner to retain them for the purpose of making copies or inspection and analysis. They in-particular challenged the right of the Commission to transport the records to Washington so that they might be photostated and studied. Appellants while on the witness stand, and their counsel, throughout the course of the healings before the Commissioner\u2019s examiner, demonstrated an attitude of hostility and a defiance bordering on contempt of the investigative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">The issues as to whether the District Court erred (1) in ordering appellants to produce documentary evidence, originals or copies, within 30 days at a time and place to be fixed by the Commission, and (2) in authorizing the Commission to take into custody the evidence produced and to remove it to Washington for a period not to exceed 30 days, will be considered together as they are controlled by the provisions of Section 9 of the Act and well-settled principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">Section 9 authorizes the Commission\u2019s use of subpoenas for the \u201cproduction of * * * documentary evidence * * * from any place in the United States, at any designated place of hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-16\">The Courts have time and again held that the Commission may exercise its \u201cbroad power of investigation and subpoena, prior to the filing of a complaint\u201d;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Commission, as an administrative agency of the United States \u201ccharged with seeing\u201d that the Act is enforced, \u201chas a power of inquisition\u201d ; it is \u201cmore analogous to the Grand Jury, which does not depend on a case or controversy for power to get evidence but can investigate merely on suspicion that the law is being violated, or even just because it wants assurance that it is not\u201d ;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it is sufficient if the investi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>gation is within the Commission\u2019s authority and unless the evidence sought by the subpoenas is clearly irrelevant and immaterial it is the duty of the district court to order compliance;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and subpoenaed documents may be retained by the Commission for a reasonable length of time.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Although appellants urged in the District Court, as they do here, that the Commission\u2019s subpoenas are burdensome and oppressive and that the compliance ordered will deprive them of \u201cthousands of current records in daily business use\u201d and result in \u201cwhat is tantamount to the virtual destruction of a successful business\u201d they did not adduce a single shred of evidence in the District Court to support their assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\"> It is settled that if appellants wanted the District Court to make \u201cappropriate provisions for assuring the minimum interference with the conduct of [their] business\u201d,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> they should have met their burden of showing the unreasonableness of the Commission\u2019s demand,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and should have \u201cmade a record that would convince [the District Court] of the measure of their grievance rather than ask [it] to assume it.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Anent the foregoing, as earlier stated in this opinion, the District Court specified in its Order that appellants could bring to its attention \u201cany serious hindrance\u201d to their business by adherence to its provisions. The specification referred to renders de minimis appellants\u2019 point with respect to the removal of the subpoenaed records to Washington especially in the light of the fact that the subpoenas were directed only at records of appellants\u2019 operations for the year I960, and the Order directing compliance was issued July 21, 1961 by which time the-records could scarcely be called \u201ccurrent\u201d and \u201cin daily business use\u201d as appellants assert. Certainly, under the factual situation which prevailed here, we find no error in the Order directing appellants to produce the documentary evidence, as called for in the Commission\u2019s subpoenas, within 30 days at a time and place to be fixed by the Commission and in authorizing the evidence so produced to be removed to Washington for a period not to exceed 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-17\">There remains for disposition<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> appellants\u2019 remaining contention that the District Court erred in failing, in its Order to require that the production of documents be to, and before, a member of the Commission or one of its Hearing Examiners.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-18\">The contention stated is utterly without merit. The cases cited in the margin are dispositive.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> They squarely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>hold that in an investigational hearing such as is here involved there is no requirement that subpoenas be made returnable to the Commission or a Hearing Examiner and that they may be made returnable to an attorney-examiner as in the instant proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"ah8-dedup-0\">For the reasons stated the Order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A9t\">Judge Goodrich participated in the consideration of this case but died prior to the filing of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-13\">. The Commission\u2019s Application to the District Court was pursuant to provisions of Section 9 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (38 Stat. 722; 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 49) which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-14\">\u201cThat for the purposes of this Act the commission, or its duly authorized agent or agents, shall at all reasonable times have access to, for the purpose of examination, and the right to copy any documentary evidence of any corporation being investigated or proceeded against; and the commission shall have power to require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all such documentary evidence relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>to any matter under investigation. Any member of the commission may sign subpoenas, and members and examiners of the commission may administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">\u201cSuch attendance of witnesses, and the production of such documentary evidence, may be required from any place in the United States, at any designated place of hearing. And in case of disobedience to a subpoena the commission may invoke the aid of <em>any </em>court of the United States <em>in </em>requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">\u201cAny of the district courts of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such inquiry is carried on may, in case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any corporation or other person, issue an order requiring such corporation or other person to appear before the commission, or to produce documentary evidence if so ordered, or to give evidence touching the matter in question; and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-16\">.
