Holland, appellant herein, while Holland was engaged in highway construction on a state highway project north of Belgrade, Montana. In its first cause of action Yellowstone alleged that the damage to the pipe and the consequent loss of gasoline were proximately caused by the negligence of Holland. In Yellowstone\u2019s second cause of action it was alleged that Yellowstone was the owner and in possession of certain easements, that the pipeline was installed pursuant to said easements, and that Holland without Yellowstone\u2019s consent trespassed and entered upon the confines of Yellowstone\u2019s easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-17\">Holland\u2019s answer admitted that he had made a contract for the construction of the highway and that certain equipment operated by him struck and punctured appellee\u2019s pipeline at the point where it intersected and crossed the highway. However, Holland denied that he was negligent or that he trespassed upon Yellowstone\u2019s easements. He also alleged as affirmative defenses (1) that Yellowstone had been contributorily negligent; (2) that appellant was engaged in public work under a contract with the state of Montana, and that while performing such work he was entitled to share in the sovereign immunity of the state of Montana; and (3) that Yellowstone\u2019s damages were proximately caused by the negligence of the Montana Highway Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-18\">The case was tried before the district court without a jury, and judgment was entered in favor of appellee in the sum of $18,330.20. Holland timely filed a notice of appeal. The district court had jurisdiction by reason of diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332, the ap-pellee being a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware and the appellant being a citizen of the state of Montana. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-19\">The district court found that appellant had knowledge of the existence of the pipeline, of its location laterally and of its elevation at the center line of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>highway project upon which appellant was working. It further found that appellant \u201cwas operating heavy road construction machinery along said highway in the vicinity of said pipeline when a piece of said machinery punctured said pipeline\u201d and that the damage to the pipeline was the direct and proximate result of the negligence and careless conduct of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Appellant contends that there was no evidence to support the court\u2019s finding of negligence and points to certain portions of the evidence to support this contention. Appellant\u2019s contract for the construction of the highway provided that the Highway Construction Engineers would furnish all necessary plans and working drawings. The place where the proposed highway crossed appellant\u2019s pipeline was shown thereon. A profile' and cross-section in the plans show the elevation of the pipeline at the center line of the highway to be 59.8 feet.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The point of the break in the pipeline was not at the center line of the highway, but was to one side about 41% feet from the center line. The testimony showed that by measurement after the accident the elevation of the top of the pipeline at the point of the break was approximately 61.66 feet. The plans nowhere showed the elevation of the pipeline 41% feet from the center line. Appellant contends that he had a right to rely upon the pipe elevation figures contained on the profile and that he was not negligent when he cut the pipe at an elevation approximately two feet higher than the figures that appeared upon the profile. Other facts appearing from the testimony and exhibits at trial led the district court to reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The testimony showed that Ricketts, the project engineer for the Montana State Highway Department, went over the project with appellant\u2019s superintendent and physically pointed out the location of power lines, telephone line and appellee\u2019s pipeline. It was agreed between them \u201cto stay two feet above the pipeline\u201d in excavating and that when the roadway and a drain ditch nearby were ready for final digging \u201cthe pipeline would be dug and discovered.\u201d There was a four-foot high yellow iron post on each side of the roadway indicating that \u201ca pipeline was present near them.\u201d Ricketts\u2019 daily diary of August 16 showed that he had talked to appellant\u2019s superintendent that day about appellee\u2019s pipeline, that they had agreed it was well marked and that he was not to excavate within two feet of the top of the pipeline. On August 21 Ricketts warned appellant about getting reckless around the pipeline. His recollection was that \u201cthey were swinging too far east and getting too close to the pipeline with their road equipment.\u201d Furthermore, it was contemplated that when the drain ditch and roadway were ready for blue-top the engineering crew or contractor would dig out and locate the pipeline, after which time the drain ditch could be graded accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">One plan, a profile, of the proposed project prepared by the State Highway Commission of Montana showed the location of the pipeline crossing the project with the following writing thereon: \u201cYELLOWSTONE PIPE LINE H. P. OIL X-ING \u2014 TOP OF PIPE ELEV. 4359.8 DO NOT DISTURB.\u201d The same profile design shows a drain ditch running parallel to the proposed road, and at the location where the pipeline crossed this road and drain ditch there appeared the following: \u201cNOTE STA. 135+8\u2014 WARP DRAIN DITCH BOTTOM RT TO AVOID OIL LINE X-ING\u201d. The word \u201cwarp\u201d was explained by Ricketts to mean that it is possible that the pipeline may not be where the elevation establishes it to be, thus making it necessary to change the grade of the bottom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>of a ditch to fit the pipeline. \u201cIn other words, warping means changing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">On August 24 Ricketts \u201cre-warned the contractor about the Yellowstone Pipe Line.\u201d Ricketts testified that he discussed the matter several times with appellant\u2019s superintendent that they would get the roadway and drain ditch ready for bluetop \u201cbefore we did any serious work in and around the vicinity of the pipeline itself so that we could expose the pipe and at the same time we were setting final grade we could make the necessary adjustment for the pipe.\u201d Ricketts assumed that the elevation of the top of the pipe was 59.8 feet and discussed this with appellant\u2019s superintendent. Ricketts stated that he had discussed with the superintendent that there was \u201cpossibly a variation in the elevation of that pipe and we had no idea how much it would be, but we were safe in assuming 59.8 was a close figure.\u201d He told him that \u201che wanted to be there any time they were in there around that pipe working.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">On Monday, August 27, about 7:15 a. m., when it was quite foggy and before Ricketts arrived at this portion of the job, one of appellant\u2019s loaded scrapers hit the pipeline and broke it, causing a flow of gasoline in the area. When Ricketts arrived at the job where the break occurred some time after 8 a. m., Holland\u2019s foreman told him that due to the fog \u201che wasn\u2019t sure where he was at and then in the next second he told me he was told to be in this area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">On cross-examination Ricketts did state that at the time of the break appellant was doing nothing contrary to what was shown on the plans and specifications or on the stakes and that he (Ricketts) thought two feet of cover over the 59.8 feet, the assumed elevation of the top of the pipeline, would be sufficient for any warping that would be required. However, there was also testimony from other witnesses that it is common knowledge that pipeline elevations fluctuate with the topography. Furthermore, there was testimony that when pipelines come to a structure such as a road they often make a change in grade and go down under the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">A former superintendent of Yellowstone testified that the 10-inch pipe involved in this case could possibly make a \u201c180\u00b0 bend or a complete U-turn in 35 feet without causing the sides of the pipe * * * to appreciably deform,\u201d and that it is possible for pipelines to have considerable fluctuation in grade without violating any normal construction technique. Holland\u2019s superintendent testified that he had driven with Ricketts past the location of the pipeline and that Ricketts had told him to be careful \u201cin connection with the construction or with the pipeline.\u201d Holland\u2019s superintendent further testified that his equipment started cutting over the pipeline five or six days before the accident, that the soil was a wet gravel subject to displacement by the heavy equipment working on it, that there was a hump of dirt over the location of the pipeline, that there was a puddle of water standing in the ditch near the hump, that part of the time they were actually working in water, that the agreement was that they were to stay two feet over the pipeline, and that Ricketts was constantly alerting them to the fact that the pipeline was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Section 19-103 of the Revised Code of Montana (1947) provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-10\">\u201cThe words \u2018neglect,\u2019 \u2018negligence,\u2019 \u2018negligent,\u2019 and \u2018negligently\u2019 import a want of such attention to the nature or probable consequences of the act or omission as a prudent man ordinarily bestows in acting in his own concerns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">In his memorandum decision the district judge stated that the defendant Holland was only chargeable with the duty of exercising ordinary care. In addition, however, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-12\">\u201cIn determining whether ordinary care has been exercised in particular circumstances the nature, extent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>probability of apparent hazards in the conduct involved, the necessity and expedience of the course pursued, and the inconvenience, risk and expense of any available alternative action must be weighed and considered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">The court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">\u201cDefendant contractor knew he was working with heavy, bladed machinery near a high pressure gasoline pipe line. Obviously, violent rupture of the pipe line would present the possibility of extreme danger to life and property from explosion and fire. The contractor relied upon elevation figures given him by the state engineer without taking any measures to verify the data or otherwise determine the actual location and depth of the pipe line in its underground crossing of the road construction area. The relatively inconsequential time and expense of hand digging and probing was not ordered or expended to determine the depth of the pipe line at the point of highway crossing before blading into the earth at that point with heavy machinery. In view of the limited number of highway crossings of the pipe line throughout the entire project and the small amount of work necessary to accomplish reasonably adequate precautionary measures to avoid striking the pipe line, it appears to this court that an ordinarily prudent contractor under the same or 'similar circumstances would have taken such measures and the failure to do so constituted negligence chargeable to defendant which directly and proximately caused the damages complained of.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">In reviewing the judgment below we are guided by the rule that a district judge\u2019s findings of fact are not to be set aside unless clearly erroneous. Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-15\"> We agree with the principles set forth in the court\u2019s memorandum decision, and we feel they adequately state the Montana law which is controlling. Moreover, we believe that the inference of negligence drawn by the court from the facts in the case is reasonable and is amply justified by those facts. In addition we hold that the finding of the district judge that Yellowstone was not contributorily negligent is not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-16\">The district court did not consider it necessary to pass upon appellee\u2019s alternative cause of action based on trespass because of the finding that appellant was negligent. For the same reason the district court held that appellant\u2019s defense of sovereign immunity was inapplicable. We believe the action of the district court in this regard was proper.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ASYn\">Judgment affirmed</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-6\">. The actual elevation figure was 4359.8, but for the sake of simplicity the first two digits have been omitted and will be omitted from all further references to elevation figures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b673-6\">. Appellant claimed that appellee was con-tributorily negligent in that it had not installed its pipeline to the depth below the old road which had been agreed upon by appellee and the county which permitted the laying of the pipeline.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\">. With respect to appellant\u2019s defense of sovereign immunity appellant quoted from 69 A.L.R. 490 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">\u201cOne who contracts with a public body for the performance of public work is entitled to share immunity of the public body from liability for incidental injuries necessarily involved in the performance of the contract, where he is not guilty of negligence.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-17\">The rule within which appellant seeks to come, then, applies, if at all, only to liabilities not based upon negligence. Thus, appellant, because he was found to be negligent, is expressly excluded from the class of persons with whom he seeks to identify himself. Nothing in the Montana law that has been cited to us indicates that the doctrine of sovereign immunity would be extended beyond the bounds of the above quoted statement. It would appear that the judicial trend is toward a contraction of rather than an extension of sovereign immunity. See, e. g., Muskopf v. Corning Hospital District, 55 Cal.2d 211, 11 Cal.Rptr. 89, 359 P.2d 457 (1961).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
