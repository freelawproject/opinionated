We are in complete agreement with the FPC that Sun Oil<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is controlling here because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>the petitioners have not attempted to file with or use before the Commission any contract executed on or after April 2, 1962, containing any such indefinite pricing provision. There is thus no indication that petitioners have been, or may ever be, adversely affected by the amended regulations. Petitioners are not aggrieved by the orders and we are therefore without authority to review their validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">The motion to dismiss is</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-12\">. 18 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 154.93, 157.14(a), and 157.-25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b927-13\">.
