The second is by Jiffy for infringement of the patent. The trial court, finding the patent invalid, granted a declaratory judgment to Tate and dismissed the Jiffy complaint. Jiffy appeals both judgments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-17\">Our concern is with the validity of the product patent involved. It consists of a nail-less adhesive picture hanger capable of being secured to a wall without penetrating its surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-18\">In 1953 Tate sued Jiffy to invalidate the original patent 2,647,711.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Two years later that action was settled by an agreement which gave Tate a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to manufacture the \u2019711 hangers. The trial court properly found as a fact under the evidence that \u201cTate has made a hanger embodying the alleged invention of the Mar-gulis (\u2019001) patent in suit. Tate has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>been engaged in prior litigation in 1955 against the first Margulis patent '711, and <em>in December 1955 when the prior litigation was settled by the grant of a free non-exclusive license under Margulis \u2019711 Tate was making the particular Hanger now charged to infringe the Margulis patent in suit, </em>which was merely a pending application at that time. As soon as Tate learned the Margulis patent in suit had been granted and that its current hanger was charged to infringe, Tate immediately brought the present Declaratory Judgment suit. Pending the outcome of this litigation, T\u00e1te has not been making the hanger of the Margulis patent in suit since shortly after bringing this suit.\u201d The sole physical difference between the hangers is the arrangement for the hook. This is described in the \u2019001 patent as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asd\">\u201e \u201e \u201e . \u201e A hook 19 '\u2022 is pivotally secured upon support bar 17, by having a perpendicular integral tubuiar flange 20 inserted through hook-receiving opening 18 of support bar 17 and mating openings 26 and 27 on the juxtaposed faces of the hem. The rear end of flange 20 which projects somewhat beyond the rear opening 27 of the hem is flared, swaged or peened so as to retain hook 19 on hanger 10. This is readily accomplished, as tubular flange 20 is of relatively thin cross-section compared with the shank portion 21 and bight or bill portion 22 of hook 19. Hook 19 is secured in position by the flared outwardly turned rear portion of tubular flange 20 and the rear face of shank portion 21 adjacent the flange. The outside diameter of tubular flange 20 is smaller than the diameter of hook-receiving opening 18 and the flared portion of flange 20 does not engage strip 11 so tightly as to prevent pivotation of hook 19.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfcA\">It is undisputed that the '711 patent is the closest prior art to the patent in question. Viewing the hangers side by side, the basic difference between the two which is readily perceptible to the eye is that the hook on the \u2019711 hanger <em>swivels around the head of a separate eyelet </em>which is inserted through a hole in the metal support bar while the hook on the \u2019001 hanger <em>is part of an integral flanged eyelet </em>which is also inserted through a hole in the bar. As a result of substituting a single moving element for a moving element and a stationary element, which together obviously serve the same function as the single moving element, Jiffy alleges the following structural differences and advantages to have accrued in the \u2019001 hanger: (1) it is dinner, making it \u201ceasier to interlock an <em>*** </em>of one Picture hanger wit^ the bill of the hook of another picture hanger\u201e. it is lighter, \u201cthereby reducing shipping COsts\u201d; (3) it is more efficient because \u201ethere ^ no metal to metal rub_ bing gurfaces * * *\u00bb causing the h00k jn one position. Thus, \u00abthe hook ig eagier to rotate * * * \u201e The rotary mounting better faciiitates the uge of twQ OT more hangerg acting in concert to enable greater weightg to be bung thereon; (4) it is \u201ceasier to manufacture * * * since fewer steps are needed\u201d and there are none of the \u201cjamming and alignment problems associated with the manufacture\u00bb of the &gt;711 hang_ er; (g) it can be manufactured much more rapidly becauge the integral hook arrangement facilitates an increase of automation in the manufacturing proess; and (g) it is therefore \u201ccheaper to rnimnfnptm-A * * * <em>\u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5E\"> As stated the \u2019001 patent is for a product. From the facts, it is apparent that if the \u2019001 hanger is to be considered patentable apart from the patented \u2019711 hanger, there must be embodied within it certain structural fea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>tures which distinguish it from the \u2019711 hanger and which meet the test of invention, to wit: Whether \u201cthe differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.\u201d 35 U.S.C., 1952 ed., Section 103. See R. M. Palmer Company v. Luden\u2019s, Inc., 236 F.2d 496, 500 (3 Cir., 1956). The only distinguishing features between the two hangers are the substitution of the hook and separate eyelet by a hook with an integral flanged eyelet, a decrease in weight and thickness, and an increase in hook mobility. Aside from the hook arrangement, the district court found \u201cupon examination of the two hangers\u201d that \u201cany difference in weight, mobility of the hook, or thickness of the hanger is, at best, negligible.\u201d 196 F.Supp. at 291. This finding of fact by the district court cannot be disturbed unless clearly erroneous. R. M. Palmer, supra, 236 F.2d at 498. Our own examination of the two hangers reveals that beyond any reasonable doubt, these differences are not readily perceptible to the senses. The district court also found with justification that the advantages claimed from these differences \u201care not, in fact, there.\u201d 196 F.Supp. at 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Regarding the change in hook arrangement, the district court said, \u201cThe substitution of functional equivalents, albeit one piece for two, does not constitute an advance in the art. For this reason alone \u2019001 does not embody any new concept which might achieve the dignity of invention.\u201d Ibid. It cited in support Welsh Manufacturing Co. v. Sunware Products Co., 236 F.2d 225 (2 Cir., 1956), and 1 Walker on Patents 196 (Deller ed., 1937) the latter citing numerous authority. Jiffy contends that reliance on these authorities \u201cwas improper\u201d because they \u201crefer to a situation wherein separate parts are <em>rigidly </em>secured together and the alleged invention was the making of the entire unit in one integral piece. In the case at bar, the i nvention resides in making integral parts which formerly were <em>rotatably </em>movably secured together.\u201d Jiffy asserts that \u201cthis distinction is extremely important and the court below failed to grasp its significance.\u201d Actually the substitution of one integral rotatable part for one fixed part and one rotatable part calls for nothing more than the exercise of routine mechanical skill. It is in principle the same as the substitution of one integral fixed part for two separate fixed parts under the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Jiffy next contends that the trial judge erred in relying upon patents outside the art to which picture hangers pertain in concluding that the use of an integral hook arrangement was anticipated. This was an alternative holding by the court in connection with its conclusion of lack of invention. See 35 U.S.C., 1952 ed., Section 102(e). Those patents deal with shoe lacing-hooks, glove fasteners, envelope fasteners, and the like, having in common the employment of an integral hook arrangement similar or identical to the one in question. The court held that the use of the arrangement in the \u2019001 patent \u201cwas an obvious expedient\u201d in view of the \u201ccommon practice in industry to make hooks with integral flanged eyelets for many purposes.\u201d Id., 196 F.Supp. at 295. It also found that there was no showing by Jiffy that \u201cthere was a demand in the industry for such a combination. When Margulis perceived there could be an advantage in assembling the parts to make the hook and eyelet in one piece, and hence a reduction in cost of manufacture, he had only to order the part from the Edwin B. Stimpson Co., who were readily equipped to supply it, * * * who were already supplying the hook and eyelet in two separate pieces\u201d and who had \u201cmade many kinds of small metal pieces, including hooks with integral eyelets for many years for many purposes. * * * [T]he part was made promptly available to Jiffy by the Stimpson Company.\u201d Id. at 297. We find no error here. Zephyr American Corp. v. Bates Mfg. Co., 128 F.2d 380, 383 (3 Cir., 1942); Welsh Man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>ufacturing Co. v. Sunware Products Co., supra, 236 F.2d at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"> There is nothing about the \u2019001 hanger which suggests any reasonable advance in the character or utility of the product apart from that embodied in the \u2019711 hanger. They are basically the same product with the exception that the \u2019001 hanger is modified to permit a more simple and faster manufacturing process. This is not sufficient to confer patentability upon a product. Pfanstiehl Chemical Co. v. American Platinum Works, 135 F.2d 171 (3 Cir., 1943). The same reasoning applies to the commercial success of the \u2019001 hanger. Commercial success is not sufficient to confer patentability upon a product not otherwise patentable. Stanley Works v. Rockwell Mfg. Co., 203 F.2d 846, 848 (3 Cir., 1953), cert. den. 346 U.S. 818, 74 S.Ct. 30, 98 L.Ed. 345 (1953). Though of no vital importance, it is noteworthy that there is no evidence that the commercial success was caused by any advance in the \u2019001 hanger as compared to the earlier one</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Lastly, Jiffy contends that this appeal is governed by R. M. Palmer Company v. Luden\u2019s, Inc., supra. In that suit, however, the invention was not obvious to those skilled in the art. The patents were for designs of chocolate animals which \u201cdisclose artistic treatment in form and configuration, creating a pleasing impression and substantially different aesthetic effect * * * \u201d and which \u201creflect originality born of inventive faculty.\u201d Id. 236 F.2d at 501. These designs \u201cawakened the [stagnant and lagging] industry to a new satisfaction of a long felt need.\u201d Id. at 498. The facts in Luden\u2019s are nowise comparable to those before us. Dollac Corporation v. Margon Corporation, 275 F.2d 202 (3 Cir., 1960), is more in point. The patent was for a new, more realistic doll eye combination. Although it had \u201cbeen customary to provide radial serrations for the express purpose of simulating natural iris lines,\u201d defendant claimed \u201cdiscovery of a reflection of incident light in contrast with an adjacent non-reflective pupil portion.\u201d Id. at 204. However, the serrated surface was no different than that described in prior art \u201cexcept the function ascribed to it.\u201d Ibid. We there concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">\u201cTo assemble the teachings of others and yet produce a device validly patentable, there must intervene * * * more ingenuity than that of a mechanic skilled in the art. It is settled teaching of the patent law that the aggregation of old elements which, in the aggregation, perform or produce no new or different function than that performed or produced by them theretofore, is not patentable invention. Lincoln Engineering Co. of Illinois v. Stewart-Warner Corp., 1938, 303 U.S. 545, 549, 58 S.Ct. 662, 82 L.Ed. 1008.\u201d Ibid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The use of the integral hook arrangement in the case at bar falls well within the import of these words. It neither required unusual skill nor produced unusual results; it was apparent to an ordinary person skilled in the art when the occasion demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The judgments of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-10\">. In No. 13,805 Tate, as plaintiff, moved for summary judgment. This was prior to the consolidation of the two civil actions. The sole ground urged by Tate on this motion was that it was entitled to make the \u2019001 hangers on the basis of the license agreement concerning the \u2019711 hangers. The motion was denied, the court finding that the \u2019001 hanger \u201cdoes not fit within the language of\u201d the claims made in the \u2019711 patent, because the \u2019711 \u201cclaims indicate that the hook is attached to the bar by a separate device, a rivet. The 001 patent provides that the hook and the attachment to the bar comprise one unit, or, as described in the patent, an \u2018integral tubular flange.\u2019 This suffices to distinguish what Tate is now manufacturing from what is claimed in the 711 patent.\u201d Jiffy deems this to be \u201c[t]he law of the case in the court below * * * the picture hanger of the patent in suit is not within the closest prior art, namely patent 2,647,711 * * However, the court specifically stated in its opinion on the motion that it was not considering \u201cat this stage of the litigation\u201d Tate\u2019s claim that the \u2019001 patent is invalid since this claim \u201cwas not pressed upon the argument for summary judgment * * The court confined itself to Tate\u2019s claim of license, a claim which has been subsequently abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-19\">.
