McLaughlin, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 266, 292 F.2d 759, we were presented with the question whether the District of Columbia Motor Fuel Tax Law required a foreign corporation which desired a license to import motor-vehicle fuel into the District of Columbia to have a resident general agent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute provided that the applicant should give the name of its resident general agent. We held that if the corporation did not have an agent of that description the statute did not require one to be procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-24\">In reaching the above conclusion we considered <em>inter alia, </em>Article 26, section 2, of the Police Regulations of the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>trict of Columbia,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which requires the importer, in qualifying for a license, to designate a local representative and to maintain a local office or place of business within the District of Columbia. We held that in the absence of a resident general agent the licensing statute required the corporation to designate such a representative as Article 26 specifies. We remanded the case to the District Court to afford the Company an opportunity to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">After the remand the Commissioners revised the application form to conform with our decision, that is, to call for the address of the applicant\u2019s local office or place of business in the District of Columbia. The Company applied again, but in answer to the request for its local office or place of business stated \u201cNone. See Item 15.\u201d The answer to Item 15 gave \u201cUnited States Corporation Company\u201d as the name of the Company\u2019s local representative in the District of Columbia, but did not name, or say that the Company had, a local office or place of business. The Company clearly had no intention of claiming that it had a local office or place of business, for its answer to question 12, \u201cname and address of resident general agent in District of Columbia,\u201d was \u201cNone. Local representative <em>\u2014for service of process </em>\u2014 named in item 15 below\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Thereupon the Commissioners, through the Corporation Counsel, advised the Company that its application was unsatisfactory. The Company then moved in the District Court for an order to compel the Commissioners to issue a license to it to import motor-vehicle fuel for the year beginning July 1, 1961, pursuant to the application above referred to, or in the alternative for a trial on the merits. The motion was denied. The Commissioners\u2019 cross-motion to dismiss the complaint was granted, with the effect of dissolving an injunction which had preserved the Company\u2019s importing activities pending final disposition of the case. The Company\u2019s application for an injunction pending appeal was granted by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Our previous opinion set forth qualifications a motor-fuel <em>importer </em>must satisfy in order to obtain a license under the statute. Our decision became the law of the case and was followed by the District Court. The judgment of the District Court accordingly is</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-25\">. 47 D.C.Code \u00a7 1903(a) (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b801-21\">. <em>47 </em>D.C.Code \u00a7 1916 (1961) authorizes the Commissioners to promulgate such regulations as in their judgment are necessary for the administration of the Motor Fuel Tax Law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
