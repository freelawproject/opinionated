On August 13, 2007, relator, Disciplinary Counsel, filed a complaint charging respondent with two counts of violating the Code of Professional Responsibility, and respondent answered. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>hearing was held before a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court. The panel dismissed count two of the complaint, and relator narrowed the charge with respect to count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">{\u00b6 2} In April 2008, the panel issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation, which the board adopted in part. The board recommends that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six months but that the suspension be stayed on the condition that respondent commit no further misconduct. We adopt the board\u2019s findings and the recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">{\u00b6 3} At issue is respondent\u2019s conduct with respect to a client\u2019s sale of real property and his virtually simultaneous filing of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">{\u00b6 4} Respondent represented Stefan A. Unger in connection with the latter\u2019s sale of his home in Fredericktown, Ohio. After the closing, respondent took possession of the sale proceeds of $81,000 at his client\u2019s request, and on November 1, 2004, he placed the $81,000 in his client trust account. On November 8, 2004, Unger filed for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Unger\u2019s attorney for the bankruptcy was Robert Bardwell, who rented office space from respondent and to whom respondent had referred Unger.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">{\u00b6 5} Unger did not disclose the proceeds from the sale of the Fredericktown house to his bankruptcy attorney and did not include the asset in his bankruptcy petition. Respondent became aware of the bankruptcy one week after it was filed and asked Unger whether the asset had been disclosed. According to respondent, Unger told him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Respondent discussed the proper course of action with two attorneys in his office (Bardwell was not one of them) and testified that he received advice from the late Charles W. Kettlewell Sr. Respondent testified that Kettlewell advised him that he could not, consistently with legal ethics, disclose the existence of the funds to the bankruptcy court, the trustee, or attorney Bardwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">{\u00b6 6} Subsequently, respondent disbursed money out of the account at Unger\u2019s direction a total of eight times. The largest of these disbursements was $36,493.72, which respondent sent by check to a title company on Unger\u2019s behalf on December 13, 2004. Respondent also attempted to convey the remainder of the funds in the account to Unger in December 2004, but the check was marked \u201cvoid\u201d and returned to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">{\u00b6 7} Because Unger did not disclose to the bankruptcy court the proceeds from selling his house, the trustee filed a \u201cno asset report\u201d with the court, and the court discharged Unger\u2019s debts on March 1, 2005. Approximately one week later, the trustee received information \u2014 apparently from a former associate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>respondent \u2014 that respondent was holding the house-sale proceeds in his client trust account. In a fax sent to respondent, the trustee in Unger\u2019s bankruptcy claimed that the funds constituted property of the trustee and demanded immediate remittance of the funds along with an accounting and documentation of the real estate sale. The trustee also withdrew the no-asset report.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 8} Upon receiving the trustee\u2019s fax, respondent took the following steps. First, he contacted two experienced attorneys, Mark Aultman and Avin Mathews, seeking advice and representation. According to respondent, both attorneys confirmed the earlier advice given by Kettlewell. Second, respondent alerted Unger to the trustee\u2019s action and demanded that Unger turn over the funds to the trustee and admit his apparent misrepresentation. When Unger refused, respondent disclosed the presence of the house-sale funds in the trust account to Unger\u2019s bankruptcy attorney. Respondent also refused to turn over the funds remaining in the account to Unger.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">{\u00b6 9} Following the advice he had received, respondent sent a fax to the trustee that stated, \u201cWe are unable to respond to your questions on the basis of attorney/client privilege.\u201d On May 3, 2005, the trustee transmitted another demand for the funds, this time noting that she stood \u201cin the shoes of the debtor\u201d with respect to the attorney/client privilege. The fax stated that if respondent did not remit the funds and tender the requested documents within ten days, the trustee would file a motion with the bankruptcy court and seek sanctions. In response, respondent sent a letter proposing, on behalf of Unger, to \u201cresolve this matter\u201d by having Unger agree to pay the amounts owed to creditors plus an amount as fee to the trustee by September 1. In a June 1 letter, the trustee rejected the offer and renewed her demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">{\u00b6 10} On August 24, 2005, the trustee filed a motion to compel the turnover of documents and funds with the bankruptcy court. On September 19, 2005, the court granted the motion. Respondent did not comply until the trustee filed an additional motion on October 26, 2005; respondent testified that although his office had received the court order, it was misfiled by his staff. On November 29, 2005, respondent conveyed the remaining funds and documents to the trustee. He also requested, by motion, relief from paying attorney fees and costs. By then, $13,513.97 of the original $81,000 remained in respondent\u2019s client trust account. At the board hearing, the trustee testified that creditors who had filed proofs of claim had received only 97 percent of the amounts owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">{\u00b6 11} Subsequently, respondent did pay fees and costs, and the matter was resolved between respondent and the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">The Violation of DR 7-102(A)(7)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">{\u00b6 12} In connection with the foregoing conduct, relator originally charged respondent with violations of DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(4) (prohibiting conduct involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 1-102(A)(5) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting conduct adversely reflecting on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), and 7-102(A)(7) (prohibiting the counseling or assisting of a client in conduct that the lawyer knows to be illegal or fraudulent).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the hearing, relator dismissed the dishonesty charge under DR 1-102(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 13} In finding a violation of the Disciplinary Rules, the board focused on the prohibition in DR 7-102(A)(7) against assisting a client in conduct that the lawyer knows to be illegal or fraudulent. The board viewed respondent\u2019s disbursement of house-sale proceeds at the direction of Unger as a violation of that prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 14} We agree with the board. The evidence showed that when respondent ordered the disbursements to be made, he was fully aware of the bankruptcy, harbored the reasonable suspicion that Unger had not disclosed the house-sale proceeds to the bankruptcy court, and had the means to inform himself. Nonetheless, the ledger for the client trust account reveals that respondent ordered eight disbursements totaling $65,189.72 after the bankruptcy filing, of which three equaling $44,927.72 went to payees other than Unger himself.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When asked why he made the disbursements at Unger\u2019s request under these circumstances, respondent stated, \u201cI had no other option but to distribute the money to him.\u201d But respondent also stated that, from his initial knowledge of the existence of the bankruptcy case, he had fully \u201cassumed\u201d that the money in the trust account constituted an asset properly subject to ownership and control by the bankruptcy court and its trustee. As discussed, the board concluded that the house-sale proceeds constituted bankruptcy assets at the filing of the bankruptcy, and we agree with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 15} In spite of all these circumstances, respondent initially disbursed all but $13,500 of the funds to Unger and to third parties at Unger\u2019s direction. Only after the bankruptcy trustee discovered the funds and demanded turnover of the money did respondent adopt the different approach of refusing to disburse monies at Unger\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 16} We agree with the board that respondent, by disbursing money from the client trust account at Unger\u2019s direction, provided active assistance to Unger\u2019s evasion of the bankruptcy laws in violation of DR 7-102(A)(7). We also agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>that respondent\u2019s conduct was not excused by his belief that the attorney-client privilege prohibited him from disclosing the existence of the house-sale proceeds. Quite simply, respondent could have acted with consistency by <em>not disclosing </em>but also <em>not disbursing </em>the funds at Unger\u2019s direction. Although respondent rejected this course of action initially, he embraced it after the bankruptcy trustee learned of the house-sale proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">{\u00b6 17} Finally, we note that respondent\u2019s improper assistance to Unger with respect to the bankruptcy proceeding led to a depletion of the proceeds from the sale of the house that caused actual harm to Unger\u2019s creditors: the bankruptcy trustee testified that the creditors lost three percent of their claims because of insufficient assets in the bankruptcy estate. All these circumstances justified the finding of a violation of DR 7 \u2014 102(A)(7) as well as DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(5) and (A)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The Propriety of the Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 18} Having found a violation of DR 7-102(A)(7) and concomitant violations of DR 1-102(A)(5) and (6), the board proceeded to determine the proper severity of the sanction. In this regard, the board determined that respondent\u2019s refusal to admit wrongdoing was offset by the fact that respondent had sought and relied on legal advice with respect to the assertion of the attorney-client privilege. The board found that reliance on legal advice did not have any further mitigating effect as to the improper disbursement of house-sale proceeds, because respondent apparently did not seek advice regarding the disbursement issue. The board additionally found mitigation in the absence of any selfish motive on respondent\u2019s part and in the character testimony offered by the Honorable James Green of the Franklin County Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 19} We agree with the board\u2019s analysis of the factors presented. In particular, we look to two cases to evaluate the proper sanction in this case. In <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Wallace </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 496, 700 N.E.2d 1238, the attorney had assisted her client in filling out interrogatories in connection with contempt proceedings for failure to pay child support. Assisted by the attorney, the client quit-claimed his interest in a house to his current wife; the deed was executed the day after the attorney received the interrogatories, which demanded that the client identify, among other things, any interest he owned in real property. The quitclaim deed was recorded a week later. Ultimately, the attorney helped the client fill in \u201cnone\u201d where identification of real property interests was requested. Originally charged with violating DR 7-102(A)(7) (among other provisions) for assisting in a fraudulent conveyance, the fraudulent character of the conveyance was not proved, and the attorney was found to have violated only DR 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting conduct that adversely reflects on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law). That violation stemmed from assisting the client in concealing the real property interest on the responses to interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>{\u00b6 20} The court adopted the recommended sanction of a public reprimand. The court observed that \u201c[although respondent could not disclose client confidences, she could have disclosed the publicly recorded deed to opposing counsel, after advising her client of her intention to do so.\u201d <em>Wallace, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 500, 700 N.E.2d 1238. Also significant was the fact that the attorney had received \u201cno personal gain\u201d and that \u201cno party suffered any permanent financial harm\u201d from the violation. Id. at 498, 700 N.E.2d 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 21} While in the present case Unger\u2019s concealment of the house-sale proceeds, assisted by respondent\u2019s disbursement of funds to third-party creditors, conferred no financial benefit on respondent, respondent\u2019s disbursements did inflict harm on the creditors of the bankruptcy estate who could not fully collect on their claims. The six-month stayed suspension reflects the greater severity of the violation and the harm in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Frenden </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 601, 660 N.E.2d 1152, we imposed a six-month suspension (without stay) when an attorney had obtained the client\u2019s release from probation by actively representing to a judge that the client had never been in trouble apart from the underlying violation \u2014 even though the attorney knew that another arrest warrant had been issued against the client for a separate offense. For this failure to disclose, the attorney stipulated to a violation of DR 1-102(A)(5) (prohibiting conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice). The attorney had previously received a public reprimand in 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">{\u00b6 23} By contrast with the present case, the attorney in <em>Frenden </em>was directly involved in perpetrating the misrepresentation to the court and had received discipline previously in the form of a public reprimand several years before. These points of contrast justify the stay of the six-month suspension in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">{\u00b6 24} Finally, we note the material differences between the present case and <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Wright (1991), 58 </em>Ohio St.3d 126, 568 N.E.2d 1218. In <em>Wright, </em>the attorney involved himself in a bankruptcy proceeding in which a client had failed to disclose assets, and the attorney received a two-year suspension with 18 months stayed. The attorney\u2019s involvement in <em>Wright </em>was much more direct than the respondent\u2019s in this case \u2014 the attorney attended a creditor\u2019s meeting and remained silent despite knowing that the client was concealing assets. The violations in <em>Wright </em>included DR 1-102(A)(4). By contrast, respondent in this case did not involve himself in the bankruptcy, and relator dismissed the DR 1-102(A)(4) charge at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">{\u00b625} For all the foregoing reasons, we adopt the board\u2019s analysis and its recommended sanction of a six-month suspension, with all six months stayed on the condition that respondent commit no further misconduct during the stayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>suspension. If respondent violates this condition, the stay will be lifted, and respondent will serve the entire six-month suspension.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b574-8\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Stacy Solochek Beckman, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b574-9\">Kegler, Brown, Hill &amp; Ritter Co., L.P.A., Christopher J. Weber, Geoffrey Stern, and Rasheeda Z.

In certain instances, DR 7-102(B)(1) contravenes client confidentiality and requires a lawyer to reveal a fraud perpetrated by a client if the client will not do so himself. Because relator did not charge this violation, the propriety of respondent\u2019s conduct under this provision is not before us. See <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Farmer, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 137, 2006-Ohio-5342, 855 N.E.2d 462, \u00b6 25 (misconduct not charged cannot be adjudicated in a disciplinary proceeding).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-10\">.
