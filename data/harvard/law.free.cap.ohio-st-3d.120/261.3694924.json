VanCleave, for disability-retirement benefits. Because we hold that SERS did not abuse its discretion in denying VanCleave\u2019s application, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">SERS Membership and Employment</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">{\u00b6 2} VanCleave has been a member of SERS since 1985. She was originally employed by the Washington Local Schools near Toledo as a school bus driver. She became a custodian at Monac Elementary School in February 1996 and received good performance evaluations in that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">{\u00b6 3} In July 1996, while she was cleaning a bathroom wall at the school, VanCleave fell off a ladder, landing directly on her buttocks, lower back, and legs. As a result of the pain she experienced due to the fall, VanCleave left work in April 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Application for Disability-Retirement Benefits and Initial Denial of Benefits and Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">{\u00b6 4} VanCleave filed an application for disability-retirement benefits<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with SERS in June 2000. Her treating physician, Richard A. Koepke, D.O., certified that VanCleave \u201cis physically and/or mentally incapacitated for a period of at least <em>12 months </em>and is unable to perform the duty for which [she was] formerly responsible as a school employee.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Dr. Koepke listed Van-Cleave\u2019s primary disabling conditions as \u201c[h]erniated disc L4-5, degenerative disc disease lumbar spine, [and] bilateral sciatic neuralgia,\u201d and her underlying condition as \u201c[f]ibromyalgia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">{\u00b6 5} SERS ordered a medical examination of VanCleave by Claire V. Wolfe, M.D. Dr. Wolfe conducted a physical examination of VanCleave in October 2000. Dr. Wolfe noted that VanCleave complained of constant pain to her lower back, right buttock, and leg. Dr. Wolfe further found upon her examination of VanCleave that \u201c[p]alpitation revealed profound tenderness in the anterior chest bilaterally, moderate tenderness in the right lateral epicondyle and mild on the left, marked tightness in the left upper trapezius, mild tightness in the levators and cervical paraspinals. She was moderately tender in the lower back. She was severely tender with palpitation in the right buttock, moderately on the left. Both greater trochanders were tender, as were the medial knees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Dr. Wolfe diagnosed VanCleave with \u201c[f]ibromyalgia syndrome\u201d and \u201c[ljumbar degenerative disk disease without active radiculopathy\u201d and included the following in her recommendations:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cMs. Crooks [n.k.a. VanCleave] has MRI documentation of lumbar degenerative disk disease with a bulge at L4-5 primarily to the left. Almost all of her symptoms are to the right. After several years of symptoms, she has no objective neurologic deficits. She has had normal electrodiagnostic studies in the past. Her low back symptoms are most compatible with her fibromyalgia diagnosis. I do not find anything on today\u2019s examination that would preclude her from continuing work as a custodian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b6 8} Based upon this examination, Dr. Wolfe certified that VanCleave \u201cis not physically * * * incapacitated for a period of at least <em>12 months </em>and is able to perform the duty for which [she was] responsible * * * as a school employee.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">{\u00b6 9} An SERS medical advisory committee reviewed VanCleave\u2019s application and the evidence and concluded that VanCleave was not permanently disabled from performing her duties as a school custodian. The committee recommended that VanCleave\u2019s application be denied, and SERS adopted the committee\u2019s recommendation and denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">{\u00b6 10} VanCleave appealed the decision, requested a personal appearance before the SERS retirement board, and submitted additional documentation in support of her appeal. Included in her additional submission was a letter from Dr. Koepke in which he noted that he had examined VanCleave in February 2001 and diagnosed her as having (1) degenerative disc disease L4-5, (2) chronic spinal sprain, (3) fibromyalgia, which was confirmed by multiple evaluations by specialists and was created or significantly aggravated by her July 1996 work injury, and (4) sciatic neuralgia. Dr. Koepke concluded that VanCleave could not return to her previous work as a janitor. Dr. Koepke noted that although VanCleave had undergone various treatments, including physical therapy, she remained unable to perform her previous duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">{\u00b6 11} The medical advisory committee found that the additional submissions did not constitute additional objective medical evidence as defined in former Ohio Adm.Code 3309-1-41. The committee recommended that VanCleave\u2019s appeal be denied. In March 2001, SERS notified VanCleave that its retirement board had upheld its original decision to deny her request for disability-retirement benefits. SERS also denied her request for a personal appearance before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">First Mandamus Case and Remand for Appeal Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">{\u00b6 12} In September 2002, VanCleave filed a mandamus action in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County challenging the denial by the SERS board of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>application for disability-retirement benefits. By agreement of the parties, the mandamus action was dismissed and the matter was remanded for an appeal hearing before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">{\u00b6 13} Before the hearing, VanCleave submitted updated records and reports in support of her application. This additional information included a May 2003 letter by Dr. Koepke, in which he diagnosed VanCleave as having (1) chronic spine sprain, (2) degenerative disc disease with previous herniation, (3) bilateral sciatic neuralgia, (4) fibromyalgia, (5) myospasm and myositis, and (6) chronic neuropathic pain syndrome. Dr. Koepke concluded that VanCleave\u2019s pain was \u201ctoo disabling [for her] to perform her duties\u201d as either a janitor or bus driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">{\u00b6 14} The documentation also included several reports of Allan G. Clague, a neurologist, who had diagnosed VanCleave with neuropathic pain syndrome and was treating her for that condition. Dr. Clague determined that VanCleave could not return to her former position and that because she could perform the required duties for only short periods of time, she was totally and permanently medically disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">{\u00b6 15} VanCleave also submitted an April 2003 psychiatric evaluation of her by Melanie Thombre, M.D, diagnosing her as suffering from secondary mental disability, i.e., cognitive disorder, sleep disorder due to pain, and mood disorder due to chronic pain. Dr. Thombre concluded that VanCleave is totally and permanently disabled for her previous work as a school custodian and bus driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">{\u00b6 16} At the hearing, VanCleave and her husband testified that she could not perform her previous position of school custodian. The medical advisory committee thereafter ordered that VanCleave be reexamined by Dr. Wolfe. Dr. Wolfe reexamined her in September 2003 and diagnosed VanCleave as suffering from (1) fibromyalgia syndrome, (2) depression and chronic anxiety, and (3) lumbar degenerative disease without acute radiculopathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">{\u00b6 17} Dr. Wolfe again concluded that VanCleave \u201cis not physically * * * incapacitated for a period of at least <em>12 months from the date of application </em>and is able to perform the duty for which [she was] responsible * * * as a school employee.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Dr. Wolfe based her conclusion that VanCleave was not physically incapacitated on her opinion that although VanCleave had fibro-myalgia, she was not precluded from working:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cPeople with fibromyalgia are, in fact, generally distressed. The question of disability is more difficult to assess because it is a subjective one. I do not believe the fibromyalgia is functionally disabling, even for Mrs. Van-Cleave\u2019s job as a custodian. However, every physician that she has seen has told her that she cannot return to that, that her pain complaints will only be worse with that type of activity and it would be therefore very difficult, I think, for her to believe that she <em>could </em>return to such activity even if she went through a work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>hardening program. It is difficult when you are the treating physician to be \u2018objective\u2019 and not take the subjective pain into consideration. However, based on my review of all the data and the examinations, I do not believe there are objective abnormalities that would preclude Mrs. VanCleave\u2019s work.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">{\u00b6 19} The medical advisory committee relied on Dr. Wolfe\u2019s new medical evaluation and recommended that its original decision to deny VanCleave\u2019s application for disability-retirement benefits be upheld and that the appeal be denied. In November 2003, the SERS retirement board upheld its decision to deny the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Second Mandamus Action</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">{\u00b6 20} In December 2006, more than three years after the retirement board\u2019s decision, VanCleave filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County for a writ of mandamus to compel SERS to pay disability-retirement benefits to her. In the alternative, VanCleave requested a writ of mandamus ordering the SERS board to vacate its denial of benefits and state its specific bases for its denial, including an explanation of how VanCleave\u2019s mental condition was determined without evaluation by a board-appointed psychologist or psychiatrist. VanCleave further requested, in the alternative, a writ of mandamus ordering the SERS board to revoke its denial of her application and to have her evaluated by a board-appointed psychologist or psychiatrist, and ordering that any board decision thereafter specify the evidence relied upon and the bases for its decision. After SERS submitted an answer and the parties filed evidence and briefs, the court of appeals denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">{\u00b6 21} This cause is now before the court upon VanCleave\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Mandamus \u2014 General Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">{\u00b6 22} VanCleave requests extraordinary relief in mandamus, challenging the SERS action denying her application for disability-retirement benefits. \u201cThe Public School Employees Retirement System was established for the purpose of providing retirement allowances and other benefits to public school employees other than teachers.\u201d <em>State ex rel. McMaster v. School Emps. Retirement Sys. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 130, 133, 630 N.E.2d 701, citing 1 Baker &amp; Carey, Ohio School Law (1993) 399, Section 8.25. Under R.C. 3309.39(C), to be entitled to disability-retirement benefits, an SERS member must be \u201cmentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of the member\u2019s last assigned primary duty as an employee by a disabling condition either permanent or presumed to be permanent for twelve continuous months following the filing of an application.\u201d \u201cBecause there is no provision for appealing a final SERS decision, mandamus is available to correct any abuse of discretion by SERS.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Stiles v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>School Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 156, 2004-Ohio-2140, 807 N.E.2d 353, \u00b6 13. \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs when a decision is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Duty to Explain Decision on Disability-Retirement Benefits: Lack of Statutory Basis for <em>Duty </em>\u2014 State <em>ex rel. Pipoly v. State Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">{\u00b6 23} VanCleave asserts that she is entitled to the requested writ of mandamus because SERS did not identify the evidence it relied upon and explain its reasons for denying her application for disability-retirement benefits. She contends that we should extend our decision in <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245, to orders of public employee retirement systems, like SERS, that concern applications for disability-retirement benefits. In <em>Noll, </em>we held, \u201cIn any order of the Industrial Commission granting or denying benefits to a claimant, the commission must specifically state what evidence has been relied upon, and briefly explain the reasoning for its decision.\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">{\u00b6 24} We previously rejected a comparable request to extend <em>Noll </em>to public-employee-retirement-system disability determinations in <em>State ex rel. Pipoly v. State Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, because (1) the <em>Noll </em>holding was expressly limited to workers\u2019 compensation claims, (2) the creation of the legal duty that a relator seeks to enforce in mandamus proceedings is the distinct function of the General Assembly, and courts are not authorized to create the legal duty enforceable in mandamus, (3) there had not been a flood of cases involving disability determinations by public employee retirement systems comparable to that experienced in workers\u2019 compensation cases so that court review of the administrative proceedings would be overly burdensome, and (4) <em>Noll </em>relied heavily on a decision in which we emphasized that the statutory duty existed on the part of the Industrial Commission to specify the basis for its decisions. Id. at \u00b6 16-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">{\u00b625} We concluded that the retirement system in <em>Pipoly </em>had no duty to specify the evidence it relied upon and its reasoning for its decision denying disability-retirement benefits:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cTherefore, while extending <em>Noll </em>to [State Teachers Retirement System] and [State Teachers Retirement Board] determinations may be tempting based on policy considerations, see <em>[State ex rel.] Ochs [v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 674,] 675-676, 710 N.E.2d 1126, we will not impose the <em>Noll </em>requirements in the absence of a statutory duty or a comparable need for these requirements in cases other than workers\u2019 compensation cases. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Schwaben v. School Emp. Retirement Sys. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 280, 285, 667 N.E.2d 398 (\u2018However, while it may be tempting to decide this case on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>subjective principles of equity and fundamental fairness, this court has a greater obligation to follow the law5). Accordingly, [the State Teachers Retirement System] had no clear legal duty cognizable in mandamus to specify what evidence it relied upon and explain the reasoning for its retirement board\u2019s decision denying Pipoly\u2019s application for disability retirement benefits.\u201d Id. at \u00b622.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">{\u00b6 27} Insofar as VanCleave\u2019s claim represents a reargument of the matters we previously considered and rejected in <em>Pipoly, </em>we deny it for the reasons previously specified in that case. As we observed in <em>Pipoly, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, at \u00b6 21, \u201cour review in a mandamus proceeding challenging an administrative determination on an application for disability retirement benefits is not any more burdensome than reviewing a summary judgment entered by a trial court without a detailed opinion. See Civ.R. 52.\u201d Although it may be preferable from a policy standpoint that a retirement board explain its reasoning for its decision, the General Assembly is the final arbiter of public policy. <em>Hubbell v. Xenia, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Duty to Explain Decision on Disability-Retirement Benefits: Procedural Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">{\u00b628} VanCleave also claims that SERS\u2019s duty to identify the evidence it relied upon and to briefly explain its reasons for denying her application for disability-retirement benefits is constitutionally required by procedural due process and the right to open courts and to a remedy. See Section 1, Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (\u201cnor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\u201d); Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution (\u201cAll courts shall be open, and every person, for an injury done him in his land, goods, person, or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and shall have justice administered without denial or delay\u201d). We did not consider these issues in <em>Pipoly, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, because they were not raised in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">{\u00b629} VanCleave has waived her claim that the rights under the Ohio Constitution to open courts and to a remedy impose a duty on SERS to identify the evidence it relied upon and to explain its reason for its decision because she failed to raise this claim in the court of appeals in her pleading, briefs, or objections to the decision of the court magistrate. See <em>State ex rel. Brady v. Pianka, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 147, 2005-Ohio-4105, 832 N.E.2d 1202, \u00b6 14 (appellant waived constitutional claim that she did not raise in the court of appeals); <em>State ex rel. Van Dyke v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 430, 2003-Ohio-4123, 793 N.E.2d 438, \u00b6 42 (court need not address merits of constitutional claims on appeal when relator did not raise them in her complaint or amended complaint and other parties did not consent to the litigation of these claims); <em>State ex rel. Schmidt v. School Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>100 Ohio St.3d 317, 2003-Ohio-6086, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>798 N.E.2d 1088, \u00b6 6 (appellant waived issue that she could have raised in objections to magistrate\u2019s decision in lower court).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">{\u00b6 30} To trigger the benefit of the right to procedural due process found in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, VanCleave must show that she has a protected property or liberty interest in the disability-retirement benefits for which she applied. See <em>State v. Hayden, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 211, 2002-Ohio-4169, 773 N.E.2d 502, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">{\u00b6 31} Even if it were assumed that VanCleave has a property interest in a disability-retirement benefit, she has not demonstrated in this case that she did not receive due process regarding her claim for that benefit. After VanCleave\u2019s application for disability benefits was denied, she sought reconsideration of that decision and obtained a personal appearance before the board to present her position. After that hearing, the SERS medical advisory committee requested and obtained another medical evaluation of Van Cleave for consideration. Cf. R.C. 3309.39(C). After the SERS board upheld its original decision to deny disability-retirement benefits, VanCleave had the opportunity to obtain the medical evaluations and the opinions of the medical advisory committee members and to argue, in this mandamus action, that the board abused its discretion in denying her benefits. See, e.g., <em>Stiles, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 156, 2004-Ohio-2140, 807 N.E.2d 353, \u00b6 13 (abuse-of-discretion standard applies in mandamus action challenging SERS\u2019s denial of disability retirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">{\u00b6 32} Included in the record of this mandamus case are Dr. Wolfe\u2019s medical evaluations of VanCleave and the medical advisory committee\u2019s correspondence outlining why the doctors on that committee believed that VanCleave was not entitled to a disability-retirement benefit. Among the arguments VanCleave presented to the court of appeals was her contention that the SERS board abused its discretion by relying upon the medical report of Dr. Wolfe because the doctor had used the wrong standard in determining whether VanCleave\u2019s fibromyalgia was disabling. Under these circumstances, it is not clear how VanCleave\u2019s mandamus claim has been prejudiced by the summary nature of the board\u2019s decision. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Haylett v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 325, 332-333, 720 N.E.2d 901, citing <em>Mathews v. Eldridge </em>(1976), 424 U.S. 319, 334-335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (in determining what process is due, factors include the value, if any, of additional procedural safeguards).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">{\u00b6 33} Therefore, we reject VanCleave\u2019s claim that due process required that SERS support its denial of her application for disability-retirement benefits by specifically identifying the evidence it relied upon and explaining the reasons for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>{\u00b6 34} In so holding, we note that disability-retirement claimants, like Van-Cleave in this case, appear to already have, through administrative regulation, some right to obtain important information upon which to determine, generally, the basis of the board\u2019s decision. One of the pertinent regulations governing SERS disability determinations, Ohio Adm.Code 3309-1-41(A)(1), provides that a notice of the denial of disability benefits must be issued to the applicant and must \u201cinform the member of * * * [t]he medical evaluation and the board\u2019s denial * * * of disability benefits [and] [t]he procedures for appeal of a denial * * * of disability benefits.\u201d Although the regulation does not specify that a notice of denial of disability benefits must explain the evidence relied upon to deny benefits, Ohio Adm.Code 3309-1-41(A)(1)(a) does require that the applicant be informed of \u201cthe medical evaluation\u201d upon which, presumably, the benefit denial was based.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, the \u201cmedical evaluation\u201d of the SERS board\u2019s consulting physician, or the SERS medical advisory committee\u2019s review of and concurrence in that evaluation, may in some cases provide the board\u2019s rationale for denying benefits. See, e.g., <em>McMaster, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 130, 630 N.E.2d 701 (upholding SERS\u2019s denial of disability benefits based in part on recommendation of the board\u2019s consulting physicians); <em>State ex rel. Lecklider v. School Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 271, 2004-Ohio-6586, 819 N.E.2d 289, \u00b6 21 (SERS board did not abuse its discretion where the board\u2019s consulting physician and all the doctors of the medical advisory committee concluded that relator was not physically incapacitated from doing her job).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">{\u00b6 35} In the present case, the letter that SERS sent to VanCleave advises that the board upheld its original decision to deny her disability-retirement benefits and that VanCleave had no further appeal rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That letter does not \u201cinform [VanCleave] of the medical evaluation,\u201d regardless of the precise meaning of that term. The term \u201cmedical evaluation\u201d in the regulation may mean nothing more than providing the applicant with a copy of the examining physician\u2019s evaluation \u2014 here, that of Dr. Wolfe \u2014 a matter we do not decide today. Failure to provide this information with the board\u2019s decision to deny benefits may require reversal of the board\u2019s order because a letter denying benefits without also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>providing the medical evaluation it was based upon does not appear to be in compliance with the SERS rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 36} However, this case provides no occasion to decide what the term \u201cmedical evaluation\u201d in Ohio Adm.Code 3309-l-41(A)(l)(a) means, as Van Cleave has not based her claim on an allegation that she was not \u201cinformed of the medical evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Mental Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">{\u00b6 37} VanCleave next asserts that the court of appeals erred in not granting a writ of mandamus to compel SERS to obtain a psychological evaluation of her when new evidence submitted with her appeal \u2014 the psychiatric report of Dr. Thombre based on an April 2003 psychiatric examination \u2014 indicated that she suffered from a mental disability in addition to her claimed physical disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">{\u00b6 38} Under the version of Ohio Adm.Code 3309-1-41(A) in effect at the time of VanCleave\u2019s application, an applicant for disability-retirement benefits could appeal the initial SERS decision to deny benefits by filing a notice of intent to appeal and by providing \u201cadditional objective medical evidence\u201d in support of the appeal, which evidence was required to be \u201ccurrent\u201d and documented by a physician specially trained in the field of medicine \u201cpertinent to the illness or injury for which the disability was claimed.\u201d 2000-2001 Ohio Monthly Record 1678, 1679, effective May 2, 2001. The present version of Ohio Adm.Code 3309-1-41(A) similarly requires that an applicant submit \u201cadditional evidence\u201d with an appeal of an initial SERS decision to deny disability-retirement benefits, with that evidence defined to be \u201ccurrent and pertinent to the illness or injury for which the disability was claimed.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 3309-l-41(A)(2)(a) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">{\u00b6 39} VanCleave\u2019s application did not claim a disability based on a mental condition. Yet her mental condition is pertinent to the injuries for which she claimed disability: it arose from her physical injuries and symptoms, e.g., the chronic pain associated with her fibromyalgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">{\u00b640} Nevertheless, VanCleave did not submit any evidence regarding a mental condition with her application. When she did submit evidence concerning this condition with her appeal, the evidence failed to disclose any disabling mental condition during the pertinent period of time for purposes of her application \u2014 12 continuous months following VanCleave\u2019s June 2000 application for disability-retirement benefits. See R.C. 3309.39(C) (\u201cMedical examination of a member who has applied for a disability benefit shall be conducted by a competent disinterested physician or physicians selected by the retirement board to determine whether the member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of the member\u2019s last assigned primary duty as an employee by a disabling condition either permanent or presumed to be permanent for twelve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>continuous months following the filing of an application\u201d). Instead, Dr. Thom-bre\u2019s report included a diagnosis based on an April 2003 examination and did not reveal whether VanCleave was disabled as a result of mental disability during the pertinent time period of June 2000 to June 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">{\u00b6 41} Moreover, VanCleave could have requested that SERS conduct a mental-health evaluation of her during the proceedings before it, but she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 42} Under these circumstances and in the absence of any specific duty to do so under the pertinent statutes and regulations, SERS did not abuse its broad discretion in failing to order, sua sponte, a mental-health evaluation of VanCleave by a physician selected by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Claimed Abuse of Discretion in Denial of Benefits and Reliance on Dr. Wolfe\u2019s September 2003 Report</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">{\u00b6 43} VanCleave next contends that SERS abused its discretion in denying her application for disability-retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">{\u00b6 44} VanCleave\u2019s contention lacks merit. The court below correctly determined that the SERS board did not abuse its discretion in denying VanCleave disability benefits. Specifically, the medical reevaluation by Dr. Wolfe of Van-Cleave\u2019s condition concluded that Van Cleave suffered from fibromyalgia syndrome, depression and chronic anxiety, and lumbar degenerative disc disease without active radiculopathy, but did not exhibit complex regional pain syndrome. Based upon her review of the data, the treating physicians\u2019 reports, and her 2003 examination of Van Cleave, Dr. Wolfe concluded that Van Cleave did not suffer from a disability that would preclude her return to her last assigned duties as a custodian. The doctors of the SERS board\u2019s medical advisory committee reviewed Dr. Wolfe\u2019s report and the extensive medical documentation submitted by Van Cleave, and concurred with Dr. Wolfe\u2019s opinion that Van Cleave was not permanently incapacitated for the performance of her former duties as a custodian.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">{\u00b6 45} VanCleave argues that SERS could not have relied on Dr. Wolfe\u2019s September 2003 report to deny her application for disability-retirement benefits because of the lack of objective medical evidence associated with her diagnosed condition of fibromyalgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">{\u00b6 46} It has been recognized that \u201cfibromyalgia is an unusual impairment in that its symptoms are often not supportable by objective medical evidence.\u201d <em>Vance v. Commr. of Social Sec. </em>(C.A.6, 2008), 260 Fed.Appx. 801, 806, 2008 WL 162942. It is thus difficult to determine the severity of a claimant\u2019s fibromyalgia because of the unavailability of objective clinical tests. See <em>Sarchet v. Chater </em>(C.A.7, 1996), 78 F.3d 305, 307 (\u201cSome people may have such a severe case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>fibromyalgia as to be totally disabled from working * * * but most do not <em>* * </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">{\u00b6 47} But even in fibromyalgia cases, and notwithstanding VanCleave\u2019s argument to the contrary, subjective complaints are not conclusive of disability, and objective medical evidence is still relevant to a determination of the severity of the condition. See <em>Vance, </em>260 Fed.Appx. at 806, 2008 WL 162942, quoting <em>Arnett v. Commr. of Social Sec. </em>(C.A.6, 2003), 76 Fed.Appx. 713, 716 (\u201c \u2018If there is [objective medical evidence of an underlying medical condition], the examination focuses on 1) whether objective medical evidence confirms the severity of the alleged pain arising from the condition, or 2) whether the objectively established medical condition is of such severity that it can reasonably be expected to produce the disabling pain\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">{\u00b6 48} Therefore, the SERS did not abuse its discretion in relying on Dr. Wolfe\u2019s report even though she had concluded that she did not believe that there were \u201cobjective abnormalities\u201d that would preclude VanCleave from performing her previous custodial duties. Nor did Dr. Wolfe completely discount Van-Cleave\u2019s subjective complaints as VanCleave suggests; instead, Dr. Wolfe recognized that the question of disability for people diagnosed with fibromyalgia \u201cis more difficult to assess because it is a subjective one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">{\u00b6 49} To be sure, some of VanCleave\u2019s treating physicians expressed opinions regarding the severity of VanCleave\u2019s condition that differed from those of Dr. Wolfe and the SERS medical advisory board. But given the difficulties of determining the severity of fibromyalgia and its impact upon whether a claimant is permanently incapacitated from returning to her former job duties, the SERS board did not abuse its discretion in relying on the opinions of its consulting physician and the views of the board\u2019s medical advisory committee in upholding its denial of VanCleave\u2019s application for disability-retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">{\u00b6 50} Therefore, because VanCleave failed to establish any abuse of discretion by SERS in its determination denying her application for disability-retirement benefits, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-12\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b506-13\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b506-14\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Connor, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-11\">.

See <em>Kapps v. Wing </em>(C.A.2, 2005), 404 F.3d 105, 115, and cases cited therein (\u201cEvery [federal] circuit [court of appeals] to address the question * * * has concluded that applicants for benefits * * * may possess a property interest in the receipt of public welfare entitlements\u201d). See also <em>Flatford v. Chater </em>(C.A.6, 1996), 93 F.3d 1296, 1304 (\u201call appellate courts to date, including this one, have not questioned whether a social security claimant has a property interest in benefits for which he or she hopes to qualify\u201d). To determine what process is due with respect to VanCleave\u2019s property interest, it is necessary to consider (1) \u201cthe private interest that will be affected by the official action,\u201d (2) \u201cthe risk of erroneous deprivation of that interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards,\u201d and (3) \u201cthe government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute requirement would entail.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Haylett v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 325, 332-333, 720 N.E.2d 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">{\u00b6 52} The private interest involved here \u2014 the right to disability-retirement benefits \u2014 is significant. The risk of an erroneous deprivation of that right due to the lack of a statement by the School Employees Retirement System (\u201cSERS\u201d) identifying the evidence it relied upon and its reasons for denying the application may be less than claimed by VanCleave. But the value in requiring an explanation is manifest \u2014 it will enable both parties and the court to better discern the reasons for the SERS determination and thereby also enable a more accurate resolution of a mandamus action challenging that determination. Finally, there is no evidence or indication that requiring SERS and its retirement board to specify what evidence it relied upon and to briefly explain its reasons for denying a disability-retirement benefits application would be either fiscally or administratively burdensome.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">{\u00b6 53} Procedural due process requires SERS to specifically state what evidence it relies upon and briefly explain the reasoning for its denial of VanCleave\u2019s application for disability-retirement benefits. <em>Kapps, </em>404 F.3d at 124 (\u201cClaimants cannot know <em>whether </em>a challenge to an agency\u2019s action is warranted, much less formulate an effective challenge, if they are not provided with sufficient information to understand the basis for the agency\u2019s action\u201d [emphasis sic]). See <em>Barron v. Bd. of Trustees of Policemen\u2019s Pension &amp; Relief Fund </em>(1985), 176 W.Va. 480, 485, 345 S.E.2d 779, paragraph four of the syllabus (the \u201cprocedural due process rights that should be accorded a member of the Policemen\u2019s Pension and Relief Fund * * * are that such member is entitled * * * to have the Board of Trustees give a written statement outlining its reasons for denying [an application for disability] benefits).\u201d I am convinced that VanCleave has established that she is entitled to a limited writ of mandamus to compel SERS to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>vacate its decision denying her application for disability-retirement benefits and to issue a new decision specifically stating what evidence it relies upon and briefly explaining its reasoning. An explanation would be particularly beneficial here, where Dr. Wolfe emphasized her suspect reliance on the lack of objective symptoms to support her conclusion that VanCleave was able to perform her job duties. See <em>Rogers v. Commr. of Social Sec. </em>(C.A.6, 2007), 486 F.3d 234, 245 (\u201cin light of the unique evidentiary difficulties associated with the diagnosis and treatment of fibromyalgia, opinions that focus solely upon objective evidence are not particularly relevant\u201d). The majority opinion\u2019s reliance on <em>Vance v. Commr. of Social Sec. </em>(C.A.6, 2008), 260 Fed.Appx. 801, 807, 2008 WL 162942, is misplaced because in that case, the court of appeals emphasized that there was evidence that the claimant\u2019s symptoms \u201chave either improved or remained stable.\u201d In <em>Vance, </em>\u201cother evidence also supported the * * * finding that [the claimant] was not. entirely credible with respect to the severity of her pain and limitations, including her activities of daily living.\u201d Id. The record here is bereft of comparable evidence.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b508-7\">Fell &amp; Marcus Co., L.P.A., and George N. Fell II, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b508-8\">Nancy Hardin Rogers, Attorney General, and Todd A. Nist, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">{\u00b6 54} I also disagree with the majority opinion\u2019s conclusory statement that \u201cit is not clear how VanCleave\u2019s mandamus claim has been prejudiced by the summary nature of the board\u2019s decision.\u201d At a minimum, due process requires SERS to explain why it denied VanCleave\u2019s claim for disability-retirement benefits. Furthermore, SERS has introduced no evidence that it would suffer a fiscal or administrative burden that outweighs the risk that disability-retirement applicants would be wrongly denied benefits to which they are entitled when courts reviewing SERS determinations are uncertain of the reasons underlying those decisions. Therefore, fundamental due process requires that the judgment of the court of appeals be reversed and that a limited writ of mandamus be granted to compel SERS to issue a new decision on VanCleave\u2019s disability-retirement application that identifies the evidence it relies upon and briefly explains the reasons for the new decision. Because the court fails to do so, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b508-6\">O\u2019Connor, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
