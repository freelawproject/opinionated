Because neither the board nor the school district planning and supervision commission was authorized to abolish the employee\u2019s position and lay her off after the employee had obtained continuing-contract status, we grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">Employment as the Safe and Drug Free Schools Coordinator</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Deborah Couch, is a licensed substitute teacher who has never held a teacher\u2019s certificate in Ohio and has never been authorized to teach on a full-time basis. Respondent Trimble Local School District Board of Education employed Couch as the district\u2019s Safe and Drug Free Schools Coordinator on a part-time basis from October 1993 until February 2000, when she was hired as the school district\u2019s full-time Safe and Drug Free Schools Coordinator. This position was a nonteaching position. When the board hired Couch as a full-time coordinator in February 2000, it did so by resolution without any written contract, and the position was completely funded by grant proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>{\u00b6 3} The board approved a two-year contract for Couch in April 2001 to remain as the Safe and Drug Free Schools Coordinator. Neither the board\u2019s minutes nor the contract specified that the position was contingent on the continued receipt of grant proceeds. Two years later, the board approved a five-year contract for Couch. The contract was mistakenly titled a \u201cteachers contract\u201d; because Couch did not have a teacher\u2019s license, she could not be employed as a teacher. Although the contract did not specify that it was contingent on funding, the board\u2019s vote approving the contract was conditioned on the \u201cpending availability of continued funding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Financial Planning and Supervision Commission</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">{\u00b6 4} In January 2001, the state auditor declared the school district to be in a state of fiscal emergency, pursuant to R.C. 3316.03(B)(2). As a result of the emergency declaration, a financial planning and supervision commission was created for the school district to direct its return to financial stability. See R.C. 3316.05(A). The commission approved a financial recovery plan for the school district and later approved an addendum to the plan. Neither the plan nor its addendum specified the abolition of Couch\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">{\u00b6 5} In March 2005, the board adopted a five-year fiscal forecast through June 30, 2009, that indicated the abolishment of several positions, including the coordinator position held by Couch. On April 13, 2005, the board abolished the coordinator position \u201cbeginning with the 2005-2006 school year due to declining enrollment.\u201d Grant funding for the position was not available for that school year, and the school district had lost a significant amount of revenue as a result of enrollment decreases.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">{\u00b6 6} The state auditor then certified that the school district no longer met the fiscal-emergency conditions and that the financial planning and supervision commission for the school district was terminated as of June 9, 2005, pursuant to R.C. 3316.16. The state auditor relied on the district\u2019s forecast to determine that a fiscal emergency no longer existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">{\u00b6 7} Even though its role in the operation of the school district had been terminated, the commission met on June 16, 2005, and purported to adopt the board\u2019s reductions in force, which included abolishing the coordinator position, for incorporation into the recovery plan and forecast. The board then suspended Couch\u2019s contract as coordinator effective August 22, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Grievance and Arbitration</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">{\u00b6 8} Although Couch was not a licensed or certificated full-time teacher, she paid membership dues to the Trimble Local Teachers Association that were deducted from her paychecks from March 2000 to August 2004. The association filed a grievance concerning the school district\u2019s decision to abolish Couch\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>position as well as the positions of three other employees. The arbitrator determined that the association lacked standing to pursue the grievance on Couch\u2019s behalf because the coordinator position was not within the bargaining unit specified in the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Mandamus Case</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">{\u00b6 9} In August 2007, Couch demanded that the school district reinstate her to the position of Safe and Drug Free Schools Coordinator and pay her applicable back wages and benefits. The school district refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">{\u00b6 10} Several months later, Couch filed this action for a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, the school board, its members, and the school district superintendent, to reinstate her to the position of Safe and Drug Free Schools Coordinator and to pay all back pay and benefits owed to her from her layoff until the date of judgment, plus interest. Respondents filed an answer. After an unsuccessful mediation, we granted an alternative writ. 117 Ohio St.3d 1474, 2008-Ohio-1841, 884 N.E.2d 1107. The parties have now filed evidence and briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">{\u00b6 11} This cause is now before the court for our consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Mandamus: Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">{\u00b6 12} To be entitled to the requested writ of mandamus, Couch must establish a clear legal right to be reinstated to the position of Safe and Drug Free Schools Coordinator and to be awarded back pay and benefits, a clear legal duty on the part of respondents to reinstate her with back pay and benefits, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State ex rel.

Stacy v. Batavia Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 269, 2002-Ohio-6322, 779 N.E.2d 216, \u00b6 19, quoting <em>State ex rel. Boggs v. Springfield Local School Dist.

If such employees are rehired, their subsequent contract shall be for a period of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(B) After the termination of the two-year contract provided in division (A) of this section, if the contract of a nonteaching employee is renewed, the employee shall be continued in employment, and the salary provided in the contract may be increased but not reduced unless such reduction is part of a uniform plan affecting the nonteaching employees of the entire district.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(C) The contracts as provided for in this section may be terminated by a majority vote of the board of education. * * * [T]he contracts may be terminated only for violation of written rules and regulations as set forth by the board of education or for incompetency, inefficiency, dishonesty, drunkenness, immoral conduct, insubordination, discourteous treatment of the public, neglect of duty, or any other acts of misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance. In addition to the right of the board of education to terminate the contract of an employee, the board may suspend an employee for a definite period of time or demote the employee for the reasons set forth in this division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">{\u00b6 19} As we observed in <em>State ex rel. Boggs v. Springfield Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 222, 226, 694 N.E.2d 1346 <em>(\u201cBoggs I\u201d):</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cPursuant to R.C. 3319.081, local district school boards are required to enter into written employment contracts for a period of not more than one year with newly hired, regular nonteaching school employees. If those employees are then reemployed, the school board is required to enter into a written two-year contract with the employee. <em>After three years of full-time employment, a nonteaching school employee is deemed to be employed pursuant to a continuing contract.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">{\u00b6 21} When the board approved a five-year contract for Couch as coordinator in April 2003, she had already been employed full-time in that nonteaching position for three years. Therefore, pursuant to R.C. 3319.081, once she was reemployed, she was deemed to be employed pursuant to a continuing contract. That continuing-contract status was not contingent upon the existence of grant funding for the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Having achieved continuing-contract status upon reemployment in 2003, Couch could be laid off or suspended from her coordinator position only for the reasons set forth in R.C. 3319.081. \u201cR.C. 3319.081 gives statutory job security to nonteaching local school district employees, in that it provides for termination of employment contracts <em>only </em>for the express enumerated reasons set forth in R.C. 3319.081(C), or for \u2018any other acts of misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Boggs I, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 226, 694 N.E.2d 1346.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">{\u00b6 23} The board was not authorized to abolish the coordinator position and lay off Couch. \u201c[NJothing in R.C. 3319.081 * * * authorizes layoffs of nonteaching local school district personnel. Therefore, in the absence of a collective bargaining agreement, R.C. 3319.081 prohibits a school district\u2019s board of education from abolishing positions and laying off nonteaching personnel.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Ohio Assn. of Pub. School Emps./AFSCME, Local f AFL-CIO v. Batavia Local School Dist. Bd. of Ed. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 191, 195, 729 N.E.2d 743; <em>Boggs II, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 561, 757 N.E.2d 339. A collective bargaining agreement between the board and a union representing certain nonteaching employees, which was cited by respondents as authorizing the board\u2019s abolishment of the coordinator position and its layoff of Couch, is inapplicable because it does not specifically negate Couch\u2019s statutory rights under R.C. 3319.081. See <em>Ohio Assn. of Pub. School Emps., </em>at syllabus and 197-198, 729 N.E.2d 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">{\u00b6 24} Therefore, because Couch attained continuing-contract status in 2003, the school board lacked authority in 2005 to abolish her position and lay her off for economic reasons. <em>Boggs I, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 226-227, 694 N.E.2d 1346.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Commission\u2019s Lack of Authority</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">{\u00b6 25} When the board rejected Couch\u2019s request for reinstatement, it claimed that the abolishment of the coordinator\u2019s position and layoff of Couch was authorized by R.C. 3316.07(A)(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">{\u00b6 26} Upon the declaration of a fiscal emergency in any school district, a financial planning and supervision commission is established for the district. R.C. 3316.05(A). Within 120 days after the first commission meeting, the commission must adopt a financial-recovery plan that specifies actions to eliminate all fiscal-emergency conditions, balance the budget, and avoid future emergency conditions. R.C. 3316.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">{\u00b6 27} During the existence of the commission, it has various powers and duties. R.C. 3316.07. One of the commission\u2019s powers is \u201c[t]o make reductions in force to bring the school district\u2019s budget into balance, notwithstanding section 3319.081 and divisions (A) and (B) of section 3319.17 of the Revised Code, notwithstanding any provision of a policy adopted under section 3319.171 of the Revised Code, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>4117.08 or 4117.10 of the Revised Code or in any collective bargaining agreement entered into on or after November 21,1997.\u201d R.C. 3316.07(A)(11). The commission was thus generally authorized under R.C. 3316.07(A)(11) to abolish the coordinator position and lay off Couch to balance the school district\u2019s budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">{\u00b6 28} Nevertheless, the commission had already been terminated by the state auditor when it met and adopted the board\u2019s reductions in force for incorporation into the recovery plan. As the arbitrator hearing the teachers association\u2019s grievance noted, he was \u201chard put to recognize an action of the Financial Planning and Supervision Commission for the Trimble Local School District that occurred after the Commission\u2019s official demise.\u201d Thus, the commission\u2019s attempted reduction in force relating to Couch\u2019s position was ineffective because the commission lacked authority to make the terminations after its termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">{\u00b6 29} Therefore, Couch has established that she was wrongfully terminated from her employment as the district\u2019s Safe and Drug Free Schools Coordinator and has established a clear legal right to reinstatement to that position and a clear legal duty on the part of respondents to reinstate her.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">{\u00b6 30} Respondents claim for the first time in their brief that Couch was properly terminated pursuant to R.C. 3319.171 because she was an \u201cother administrator\u201d under R.C. 3319.02. Respondents, however, never treated Couch as an \u201cother administrator,\u201d never cited these statutes or relied on this defense in rejecting Couch\u2019s request for reinstatement, and did not raise this contention in their answer to this mandamus action. We granted an alternative writ based on pleadings that did not specify this issue, and Couch introduced evidence without notice that respondents would raise this claim. Under these circumstances, we hold that respondents waived our consideration of this contention. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Cleveland, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 70, 2005-Ohio-3807, 831 N.E.2d 987, \u00b6 64 (parties in mandamus action waived court\u2019s consideration of claim when they did not raise it in pleadings, and evidence was presented by the parties without notice of the claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">{\u00b6 31} Moreover, the evidence that the parties did introduce established that the school district treasurer confirmed that no district administrator had been laid off. And Couch\u2019s duties as coordinator did not establish that she was an \u201cother administrator.\u201d R.C. 3319.02(A)(1)(b) and 4117.01(L).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Laches</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">{\u00b6 32} We also reject respondents\u2019 contention that laches bars Couch\u2019s mandamus action. Couch timely pursued the grievance and arbitration procedure when respondents treated her as a teacher. Following the arbitrator\u2019s decision finding that she was not part of the collective bargaining unit including teachers, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>demanded reinstatement; upon refusal of her demand, she filed this mandamus action. Respondents failed to introduce evidence of prejudice to their ability to defend against Couch\u2019s mandamus claim. See <em>State ex rel. Roadway Express, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 510, 514, 696 N.E.2d 1064 (\u201cprejudice is ordinarily represented by a respondent\u2019s inability to defend due to the passage of time\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Ohio Dept. of Mental Health v. Nadel, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 405, 2003-Ohio-1632, 786 N.E.2d 49, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Lack of Adequate Remedy in the Ordinary Course of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">{\u00b6 33} Couch also lacks an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law because she had no right to appeal the school board\u2019s failure to follow its statutory duty to recognize her continuing-contract status. See <em>State ex rel. Lakeview Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Trumbull Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 200, 2006-Ohio-2183, 846 N.E.2d 847, \u00b6 9; see also <em>State ex rel. Cohn v.

From this amount, we must deduct the amount she earned as a substitute teacher through April 25, 2008 ($16,694), any additional amount she earned between April 26, 2008, and the end of the 2007-2008 school year, the amount she earned working a half day at the Plains School on April 14, 2008 ($32.50), and unemployment compensation benefits she received after she was laid off ($8,606). See <em>State ex rel. Guerrero v. Ferguson </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 6, 7, 22 O.O.3d 98, 427 N.E.2d 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">{\u00b6 38} Therefore, Couch has established her entitlement to a back-pay award of $68,738.80 less any amounts she earned during the period she acted as a substitute teacher from April 26, 2008, to the end of the 2007-2008 school year. Couch has not established her entitlement to any other benefits with the requisite certainty. See <em>State ex rel. Mun. Constr. Equip. Operators\u2019 Labor Council v.

Bd. of Edn. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 222, 694 N.E.2d 1346, and <em>State ex rel. Ohio Asm. of Pub. School Emps./AFSCME, Local </em>4, <em>AFL-CIO v. Batavia Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 191, 729 N.E.2d 743, whose positions were abolished only to be subsequently replaced by a private company. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">{\u00b6 44} The majority concluded that Couch had a continuing contract that the school board could not terminate except for reasons specified in R.C. 3319.081. The court relied on <em>Boggs </em>and <em>AFSCME </em>in support of its decision that Couch could not be laid off or suspended and that the board could not abolish the Safe and Drug Free School Coordinator position. However, both <em>Boggs </em>and <em>AFSCME </em>involved nonteaching positions that the school districts wanted to contract to a private entity, and both cases also involved a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">{\u00b6 45} In <em>Boggs </em>and <em>AFSCME, </em>the school boards decided to abolish the classifications of bus driver and mechanic and to contract those jobs to a private company. The school boards then laid off the workers. However, the school districts did not eliminate the positions but merely contracted with a third party to fill them. We determined that a board of education \u201cwas not authorized to lay off [nonteaching employees] by abolishing their positions \u2018while, in effect, retaining the same positions and hiring nonpublic employees to fill them.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Boggs v. Springfield Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 558, 561, 757 N.E.2d 339, quoting <em>AFSCME, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 191, 195, 729 N.E.2d 743.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b318-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Blaugrund, Herbert &amp; Martin, Inc., Stephen P. Postalakis, and David S. Kessler, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b318-10\">Garry E. Hunter Law Offices, Inc., L.P.A., and Garry E. Hunter, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">{\u00b6 46} Couch\u2019s situation is different. She was hired to fill a special position that the board created by resolution. It was completely funded by grant proceeds. Although the funding contingency was not stated in her recent contract, it was expressed in the board minutes when the five-year contract was approved. With the school district in dire financial straits and the funding gone, the board had no choice but to abolish the position and suspend Couch\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">{\u00b6 47} I do not believe that the school board should be obligated to reinstate Deborah Couch to the position of Safe and Drug Free Schools Coordinator. The school district is struggling financially, suffering from a loss of revenue due to declining enrollment, and making personnel cuts. The majority\u2019s mandate to reinstate Couch to the coordinator position will require the board to fund a position \u2014 one that is not even a regular teaching or nonteaching position \u2014 for which it had never allocated funds. This may require the board to fund the position from general revenues, which in turn would necessitate the board to make concessions in other areas that it considers more vital.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">{\u00b6 48} The majority relies on a technical interpretation of school contract law and extends it to purely grant-funded positions. As a consequence, this opinion may have far-reaching consequences for those school districts that create special positions and fund them by a grant or other specialized funding. Extending contract law under these circumstances may affect numerous specialized grant positions other than this Safe and Drug Free School Coordinator position. This decision may obligate school districts to long-term contracts and awards of back wages in situations where there was no intention of long-term employment. I believe that the judiciary should not be creating rights or obligations that may have major financial implications upon our schools. Instead, this should be accomplished through collective bargaining or the legislative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">{\u00b6 49} Because I believe Couch\u2019s circumstances differ from the contract employees in <em>Boggs </em>and <em>AFSCME, </em>I respectfully dissent and would deny the writ.</p>\n<judges id=\"b318-8\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
