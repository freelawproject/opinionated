Because the ordinance is an exercise of the municipality\u2019s police power that conflicts with a general law, the ordinance is unconstitutional. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">H.B. 12</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">{\u00b6 2} In January 2004, the General Assembly enacted Am.Sub.H.B. No. 12. Effective in April 2004, the bill created a licensing procedure for handgun owners in Ohio. See R.C. 2923.125. This case does not implicate the licensing procedure itself, but instead involves a municipality\u2019s ability to regulate handgun possession on its own property by persons possessing a valid permit to carry a concealed handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">{\u00b6 3} Specifically, this matter requires review of R.C. 2923.126(A), which provides that a licensed handgun owner \u201cmay carry a concealed handgun anywhere in this state,\u201d except as provided in R.C. 2923.126(B) and (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-15\">{\u00b6 4} R.C. 2923.126(B) contains a list of exceptions to this right and sets forth specific locations where a licensed handgun owner may not carry a concealed handgun:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-16\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c(B) A valid license issued under section 2923.125 or 2923.1213 of the Revised Code does not authorize the licensee to carry a concealed handgun in any manner prohibited under division (B) of section 2923.12 of the Revised Code or in any manner prohibited under section 2923.16 of the Revised Code. A valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>license does not authorize the licensee to carry a concealed handgun into any of the following places:</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c(1) A police station, sheriffs office, or state highway patrol station, premises controlled by the bureau of criminal identification and investigation, a state correctional institution, jail, workhouse, or other detention facility, an airport passenger terminal, or an institution that is maintained, operated, managed, and governed pursuant to division (A) of section 5119.02 of the Revised Code or division (A)(1) of section 5123.03 of the Revised Code;</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(2) A school safety zone, in violation of section 2923.122 of the Revised Code;</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(3) A courthouse or another building or structure in which a courtroom is located, in violation of section 2923.123 of the Revised Code;</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(4) Any room or open air arena in which liquor is being dispensed in premises for which a D permit has been issued under Chapter 4303. of the Revised Code, in violation of section 2923.121 of the Revised Code;</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(5) Any premises owned or leased by any public or private college, university, or other institution of higher education, unless the handgun is in a locked motor vehicle or the licensee is in the immediate process of placing the handgun in a locked motor vehicle;</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(6) Any church, synagogue, mosque, or other place of worship, unless the church, synagogue, mosque, or other place of worship posts or permits otherwise;</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(7) A child day-care center, a type A family day-care home, a type B family day-care home, or a type C family day-care home, except that this division does not prohibit a licensee who resides in a type A family day-care home, a type B family day-care home, or a type C family day-care home from carrying a concealed handgun at any time in any part of the home that is not dedicated or used for day-care purposes, or from carrying a concealed handgun in a part of the home that is dedicated or used for day-care purposes at any time during which no children, other than children of that licensee, are in the home;</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(8) An aircraft that is in, or intended for operation in, foreign air transportation, interstate air transportation, intrastate air transportation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft;</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(9) Any building that is owned by this state or any political subdivision of this state, and all portions of any building that is not owned by any governmental entity listed in this division but that is leased by such a governmental entity listed in this division;</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(10) A place in which federal law prohibits the carrying of handguns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Furthermore, R.C. 2923.126(C)(1) and (C)(3) allow private employers and landowners to prohibit gun possession on their property as they deem fit. Thus, the law provides a right for license holders to carry concealed handguns anywhere in the state subject to several express exceptions that apply universally throughout the state, and further subject to the directives of private employers and property owners, who are authorized to prohibit handguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">{\u00b6 17} The General Assembly went even further, however, providing in an uncodified portion of H.B. 12 that \u201c[n]o municipal corporation may adopt or continue in existence any ordinance * * * that attempts to restrict the places where a person possessing a valid license to carry a concealed handgun may carry a handgun concealed.\u201d H.B. 12, Section 9, 150 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3390.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">{\u00b6 18} Shortly after H.B. 12 took effect, the city of Clyde passed Ordinance 2004-41. That ordinance provides: \u201cNo person located within the confines of any City Park shall knowingly carry or have, on or about his person or readily to hand, any deadly weapon, irrespective of whether such person has been issued a license to carry a concealed handgun pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2923.125 or pursuant to a comparable provision of the law of any other state.\u201d Clyde Codified Ordinance 923.10(a). The ordinance further provides that a violation of the prohibition is a misdemeanor offense of the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">{\u00b6 19} Ohioans for Concealed Carry, Inc., filed an action in August 2004 seeking an order striking down the ordinance and, further, seeking injunctive relief prohibiting Clyde from curtailing gun owners\u2019 rights. Both Ohioans for Concealed Carry, Inc., and Clyde moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted judgment in favor of Clyde, relying on the Sixth District Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Toledo v. Beatty, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 502, 2006-Ohio-4638, 863 N.E.2d 1051. In <em>Beatty, </em>the Sixth District confronted a Toledo ordinance strikingly similar to the Clyde ordinance and held that R.C. 2923.126 was not a general law for home-rule purposes and therefore that the ordinance did not run afoul of Section 3 of the Home Rule Amendment, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution. The trial court, in applying the analysis in <em>Beatty </em>to the Clyde ordinance, reached the same conclusion and entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">{\u00b6 20} Ohioans for Concealed Carry appealed that determination to the San-dusky County Court of Appeals. While the case was on appellate review, the General Assembly enacted 2006 Sub.H.B. No. 347, creating R.C. 9.68, which emphasized the \u201cfundamental individual right\u201d to \u201ckeep and bear arms\u201d and expressed the legislature\u2019s further desire \u201cto provide uniform laws throughout the state regulating the ownership [and] possession * * * of firearms.\u201d R.C. 9.68(A). But the bill did more than merely restate the need for uniformity; R.C. 9.68(A) also provides that \u201c[e]xcept as specifically provided by the United States Constitution, Ohio Constitution, state law, or federal law, a person, -without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>further license, * * * may own, possess, purchase, * * * or keep any firearm * * Simply put, the General Assembly, by enacting R.C. 9.68(A), gave persons in Ohio the right to carry a handgun unless federal or state law prohibits them from doing so. A municipal ordinance cannot infringe on that broad statutory right.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">{\u00b6 21} The court of appeals used R.C. 9.68 to distinguish <em>Beatty, </em>which had been decided prior to the legislature\u2019s enactment of H.B. 347. R.C. 9.68(A), the court reasoned, \u201cindicates the Ohio Legislature\u2019s clear intent that the concealed carry laws have general and uniform operation throughout Ohio.\u201d <em>Ohioans for Concealed Carry Inc. v. Clyde, </em>Sandusky App. Nos. S-06-039 and S-06-040, 2007-Ohio-1733, 2007 WL 1098347, \u00b6 12. Because R.C. 9.68(A) precluded any law other than state or federal law from infringing on the right to carry arms, the law preempted Clyde Ordinance 2004-41. In accordance with its analysis, the appellate court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter for entry of summary judgment in favor of Ohioans for Concealed Carry. Id. at \u00b6 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">{\u00b6 22} Clyde appealed that determination to this court, and we accepted the discretionary appeal. 115 Ohio St.3d 1408, 2007-Ohio-4884, 873 N.E.2d 1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Article XVIII \u2014 The Home Rule Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">{\u00b6 23} The Home Rule Amendment to the Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII, permits municipalities \u201cto exercise all powers of local self-government and to adopt and enforce within their limits such local police, sanitary and other similar regulations, as are not in conflict with general laws.\u201d Section 3, Article XVIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">{\u00b6 24} A home-rule analysis presents a three-step process. <em>Am. Fin. Servs. Assn. v. Cleveland, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 170, 2006-Ohio-6043, 858 N.E.2d 776, \u00b6 23-24; see also <em>Mendenhall v. Akron, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 33, 2008-Ohio-270, 881 N.E.2d 255, \u00b6 17. The first step is to determine whether the ordinance at issue \u201c \u2018involves an exercise of local self-government or an exercise of local police power.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Fin. Servs. </em>at \u00b6 23, quoting <em>Twinsburg v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 226, 228, 530 N.E.2d 26, overruled on other grounds, <em>Rocky River v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 1, 20, 539 N.E.2d 103. If the ordinance is one relating solely to matters of self-government, \u201cthe analysis stops, because the Constitution authorizes a municipality to exercise all powers of local self-government within its jurisdiction.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">{\u00b6 25} The second step, which becomes necessary if the local ordinance is an exercise of police power, requires a review of the statute to determine whether it is a general law under our four-part test announced in <em>Canton v. State, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, syllabus. See also <em>Mendenhall, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 33, 2008-Ohio-270, 881 N.E.2d 255, \u00b6 18. If the statute qualifies as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>general law under this test, the local ordinance must give way if it conflicts with the general law. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">{\u00b6 26} The final step in the analysis, therefore, is to determine whether the ordinance conflicts with the statute, i.e., \u201cwhether the ordinance permits or licenses that which the statute forbids * * *, and vice versa.\u201d <em>Struthers v. Sokol </em>(1923), 108 Ohio St. 263, 140 N.E. 519, at paragraph two of the syllabus; see also <em>Marich v. Bob Bennett Constr. Co., </em>116 Ohio St.3d 553, 2008-Ohio-92, 880 N.E.2d 906, \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">{\u00b6 27} Clyde makes two separate arguments in support of its position that the ordinance is a constitutional exercise of its home-rule power. First, Clyde argues that regulation of its city parks is purely a matter of local self-government and, therefore, that the city is within its power to enact the legislation regardless of the applicable state statute. Second, Clyde argues that even if the ordinance is an exercise of its police power, R.C. 2923.126 is not a general law according to our <em>Canton </em>test, because it does not apply uniformly throughout the state. According to Clyde, the concealed-handgun law\u2019s multiple exceptions render uniform application impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">{\u00b6 28} Ohioans for Concealed Carry, on the other hand, maintains that the very language of the ordinance supports the conclusion that it is one of police power and that the regulation of firearm possession is a prime example of the exercise of that power. Ohioans for Concealed Carry also contends that the exceptions, though numerous, apply uniformly throughout the state and do not affect uniform application or enforcement, meaning that the statute constitutes a general law. Because the arguments presented require examination of multiple aspects of the home-rule analysis, we will conduct a complete examination of each facet of that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">{\u00b6 29} Before beginning our analysis, however, we note that the appellate court held that R.C. 9.68 and 2923.126 preempted the Clyde ordinance. <em>Ohioans for Concealed Carry Inc., </em>2007-Ohio-1733, 2007 WL 1098347, \u00b6 12. But as we stated in <em>Am. Fin., </em>\u201c[a] statement by the General Assembly of its intent to preempt a field of legislation is a statement of legislative intent\u201d that may be considered in a home-rule analysis but does not dispose of the issue. <em>Am. Fin. Servs. Assn., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 170, 2006-Ohio-6043, 858 N.E.2d 776, \u00b6 31. Accordingly, although R.C. 9.68 and 2923.126 embody the General Assembly\u2019s intent to occupy the field of handgun possession in Ohio, that intent \u201cdoes not trump the constitutional authority of municipalities to enact legislation pursuant to the Home Rule Amendment, provided that the local legislation is not in conflict with general laws.\u201d Id. We therefore proceed to apply the test established in <em>Canton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Local Self-Government v. Local Police Power</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">{\u00b6 30} The first step of the home-rule analysis, as noted, is to determine whether the ordinance is an exercise of police power or of local self-government. As this court recently noted, \u201c[a]n ordinance created under the power of local self-government must relate \u2018solely to the government and administration of the internal affairs of the municipality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marich, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 553, 2008-Ohio-92, 880 N.E.2d 906, \u00b6 11, quoting <em>Beachwood v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1958), 167 Ohio St. 369, 5 O.O.2d 6, 148 N.E.2d 921, paragraph one of the syllabus. Police-power ordinances, however, \u201cprotect the public health, safety, or morals, or the general welfare of the public.\u201d Id., citing <em>Downing v. Cook </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 149, 150, 23 O.O.3d 186, 431 N.E.2d 995.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">{\u00b6 31} In <em>Marich, </em>we examined Norton Codified Ordinance 440.01, which \u201cregulat[ed] the traffic that pass[ed] through the municipality by placing size requirements on the vehicles that may be driven there.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 15. Emphasizing that the ordinance served \u201cto protect drivers and pedestrians who might be traveling on those roads,\u201d we held that it embodied an exercise of the municipality\u2019s police power. Id. In reaching this holding, we reiterated that traffic ordinances \u201cin general\u201d constitute exercises of a municipality\u2019s police power because they operate to protect the public. Id. at \u00b6 14; see also <em>Mendenhall, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 33, 2008-Ohio-270, 881 N.E.2d 255, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">{\u00b6 32} In <em>Ohio Assn. of Private Detective Agencies, Inc. v. N. Olmsted </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 242, 602 N.E.2d 1147, we considered North Olmsted Ordinance No. 79-27, which required security officers, private policemen, and similar workers to register with the local police department before commencing employment. There, we held that the ordinance constituted an exercise of the city\u2019s police power, reasoning that the ordinance imposed a penalty for noncompliance and that it could \u201chardly be argued to be a matter involving the structure or operation of a charter municipality.\u201d Id. at 244, 602 N.E.2d 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">{\u00b6 33} Furthermore, though we have never spoken directly on the subject of firearm regulation as an exercise of police power in the home-rule context, we stated in <em>Klein v. Leis, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 537, 2003-Ohio-4779, 795 N.E.2d 633, \u00b6 13, that concealed-weapon laws regulate \u201cthe manner in which weapons can be carried\u201d and \u201cinvolve! ] the police power\u201d of the enacting authority. The issue in <em>Klein </em>focused on the constitutionality of R.C. 2923.12 \u2014 as opposed to a municipal ordinance \u2014 but the character of the law is the same regardless of the enacting entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">{\u00b6 34} Several appellate courts, consistent with <em>Klein, </em>have held that local ordinances regulating firearm possession are police-power regulations. In <em>Cincinnati v. Baskin, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 539, 2004-Ohio-5055, 817 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 8, overruled on other grounds, <em>Cincinnati v. Baskin, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 279, 2006-Ohio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>6422, 859 N.E.2d 514, the Hamilton County Court of Appeals reaffirmed its earlier holding that Cincinnati Municipal Code 708-37, prohibiting the possession of certain semiautomatic firearms, was \u201c \u2018a reasonable exercise of the city\u2019s police power to protect its citizens from violence stemming from the use of semiautomatic weapons.\u2019 \u201d \u00b6 8, quoting <em>Cincinnati v. Langan </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 22, 30, 640 N.E.2d 200. See also <em>Toledo v. Beatty, </em>169 Ohio App.3d 502, 2006-Ohio-4638, 863 N.E.2d 1051, \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">{\u00b6 35} The ordinance at issue here is an exercise of Clyde\u2019s police power. First, the ordinance does not \u201crelate \u2018solely to the government and administration of the internal affairs of the municipality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marich, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 553, 2008-Ohio-92, 880 N.E.2d 906, \u00b6 11, quoting <em>Beachwood, </em>167 Ohio St. 369, 5 O.O.2d 6, 148 N.E.2d 921, paragraph one of the syllabus. Like the traffic ordinances at issue in <em>Marich, </em>or the registration ordinance in <em>Ohio Assn, of Private Detective Agencies, </em>the Clyde ordinance \u201crelates to public health and safety as well as the general welfare of the public.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">{\u00b6 36} Second, the ordinance imposes a penalty just as the ordinances presented in <em>Marich, Baskin, Mendenhall, </em>and <em>Ohio Assn. of Private Detective Agencies. </em>Here, violation of the Clyde ordinance results in a first-degree misdemeanor. But whether criminal or civil, an ordinance\u2019s penalty is aimed at curbing the regulated behavior for the general welfare of a municipality\u2019s citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">{\u00b6 37} Finally, the plain language of the ordinance undermines any argument that it is one relating to local self-government. Section 2 of the ordinance, for example, declares that it is \u201can emergency measure necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety.\u201d While a municipality\u2019s description or classification of its enactments is not dispositive, Section 2 clearly supports our determination and provides further support for the nature of the ordinance. The ordinance is therefore an exercise of Clyde\u2019s police power, and we proceed to the next step in our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">General-Law Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">{\u00b6 38} We next consider whether R.C. 2923.126 is a general law. As we have stated, to be a general law, \u201c \u2018a statute must (1) be part of a statewide and comprehensive legislative enactment, (2) apply to all parts of the state alike and operate uniformly throughout the state, (3) set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations, rather than purport only to grant or limit, legislative power of a municipal corporation to set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations, and (4) prescribe a rule of conduct upon citizens generally.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Fin. Servs. Assn., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 170, 2006-Ohio-6043, 858 N.E.2d 776, \u00b6 32, quoting <em>Canton, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">{\u00b6 39} We proceed to evaluate the statute under each prong of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Statewide Comprehensive Legislative Enactment</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">{\u00b6 40} We look first to the language of the statute to determine whether it creates a statewide comprehensive legislative enactment. R.C. 2923.126(A), as a complement to the licensing statute, R.C. 2923.125, creates a right subject to specifically enumerated exceptions and, where selected by an owner, exceptions based on private property and employment. The General Assembly, in crafting the statute, indicated that it \u201cwishfed] to ensure uniformity throughout the state regarding * * * the authority granted to a person holding a license of that nature.\u201d Am.Sub.H.B. No. 12, Section 9, 150 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3390. The General Assembly reiterated the need for uniformity in R.C. 9.68(A), which represents an attempt by that body to nullify all municipal laws impeding uniform application of the state statute. \u201c[T]he general assembly finds the need to provide uniform laws throughout the state regulating the ownership, <em>possession, * * * transport, storage, carrying, </em>* * * or other transfer of firearms.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 9.68(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">{\u00b6 41} The General Assembly could not have been more direct in expressing its intent for statewide comprehensive handgun-possession laws. We therefore hold that R.C. 2923.126, which regulates handgun possession as part of the licensing procedure, is a statewide comprehensive legislative enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Uniform Application of the Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">{\u00b6 42} R.C. 2923.126, as noted, creates a right to carry concealed handguns if the carrier has obtained a state-issued permit. The statute also creates multiple, specific exceptions to this right, R.C. 2923.126(B), and it grants private property owners the right to preclude licensed firearm carriers from privately owned property through the use of posted signs, R.C. 2923.126(C). Clyde contends that this system \u201ccreates a patchwork of inconsistent application within and beyond municipal boundaries throughout Ohio that completely defeats the stated purpose of providing uniformity with respect to where concealed carry licensees\u201d may carry handguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">{\u00b6 43} We rejected a similar argument in <em>Marich. </em>There, the Bob Bennett Construction Company argued that by granting power to cities over the regulation of street permits, \u201cthe General Assembly established a system that will inherently vary to some degree from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Marich, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 553, 2008-Ohio-92, 880 N.E.2d 906, \u00b622. Our decision reasoned, however, that \u201c[t]his statutory framework applies to all parts of the state without exception, and the basic process is a uniform one.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 24. We concluded in <em>Marich </em>that notwithstanding different applications or outcomes in varying jurisdictions, \u201cmere differences in the interpretation and application of the statutory language are not enough to prevent a statute from applying to all parts of the state and operating uniformly throughout it.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>{\u00b6 44} Clyde relies on our decision in <em>Canton, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, in support of its position, but this reliance is misplaced. In <em>Canton, </em>we held that the statute did not constitute a general law, because it \u201ceffectively applied] only in older areas of the state, i.e., cities where residential areas no longer have effective deed restrictions or no longer have active homeowner associations.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">{\u00b6 45} The statute at issue here, however, has no similar differential application. See <em>Marich, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 553, 2008-Ohio-92, 880 N.E.2d 906, \u00b6 23. It applies to all municipalities in the same fashion, subject to the same exceptions. None is singled out or treated differently, and the statute does not operate differently based on different locations in our state.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">{\u00b6 46} Furthermore, the statute is not arbitrary in its differentiation between private and public property. See R.C. 2923.126(C). The distinction between private and public property merely reflects that private landowners can restrict access to their property in many ways public owners cannot. See, e.g., <em>Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 551, 568, 92 S.Ct. 2219, 33 L.Ed.2d 131 (owners may regulate \u201cgeneral rights,\u201d including free speech, \u201con property privately owned and used nondiscriminatorily for private purposes only\u201d). Some owners will permit licensed handgun carriers access to their premises. Some will not. That the law offers a choice to private landowners while offering none to municipalities does not render the statute arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">{\u00b6 47} There is a distinction between public and private property. A private landowner is the sole possessor of private property. <em>Eastwood Mall, Inc. v. Slanco </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 221, 626 N.E.2d 59; <em>Bresnik v. Beulah Park Ltd. Partnership, Inc. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 302, 617 N.E.2d 1096. See also <em>Prune-Yard Shopping Ctr. v. Robins </em>(1980), 447 U.S. 74, 81, 100 S.Ct. 2035, 64 L.Ed.2d 741 (private property does not lose its private nature because it is open to the public). On the other hand, public property is owned by the taxpayers and is accessible to all. If there were no distinction made between public and private property as the dissent suggests, then a municipality could in the future choose to expand the prohibition from public parks to public sidewalks and roadways, and eventually to all public property.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">{\u00b6 48} We therefore conclude that the public/private distinction does not affect the uniform application of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Police, Sanitary, or Similar Regulation</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">{\u00b6 49} The third prong of the general-law test is whether the statute \u201c \u2018set[s] forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations, rather than purports] only to grant or limit legislative power of a municipal corporation to set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Fin. Servs. Assn., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 170, 2006-Ohio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>6043, 858 N.E.2d 776, \u00b6 32, quoting <em>Canton, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">{\u00b6 50} R.C. 2923.126, like the Clyde ordinance, is an exercise of police power, because it \u201crelates to public health and safety as well as the general welfare of the public.\u201d <em>Marich, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 553, 2008-Ohio-92, 880 N.E.2d 906, \u00b6 14. The statute, however, does more than merely prevent municipalities from enacting inconsistent handgun laws. It provides a program to foster proper, legal handgun ownership in this state. The statute therefore represents both an exercise of the state\u2019s police power and an attempt to limit legislative power of a municipal corporation to set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Prescription of a Rule of Conduct for Citizens</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">{\u00b6 51} This inquiry requires little discussion. R.C. 2923.126 prescribes a rule of conduct for any citizen seeking to carry a concealed handgun. The right to keep and bear arms is a \u201cfundamental individual right that predates the United States Constitution and Ohio Constitution,\u201d R.C. 9.68, but any citizen seeking to exercise this right must comply with the requirements of R.C. 2923.126.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">{\u00b6 52} Accordingly, R.C. 2923.126 is a general law because it is \u201cpart of a statewide and comprehensive legislative enactment, (2) applies] to all parts of the state alike and operated uniformly throughout the state, (3) set[s] forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations, rather than purport[s] only to grant or limit legislative power of a municipal corporation to set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations, and (4) prescribed a rule of conduct upon citizens generally.\u201d <em>Canton v. State, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Conflict Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">{\u00b6 53} The final step in a home-rule analysis is the conflict test, which asks whether the ordinance prohibits that which the statute permits, or vice versa. See <em>Struthers, </em>108 Ohio St. 263, 140 N.E. 519, at paragraph two of the syllabus. Here, the statute creates a right subject to specific exceptions that do not include public parks. Thus, the statute permits a licensed gun owner to carry a concealed handgun in a Clyde city park \u2014 indeed, in any municipal park across the state \u2014 the very conduct prohibited by the Clyde city ordinance. We therefore hold that the Clyde ordinance is in conflict with R.C. 2923.126.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">{\u00b6 54} Clyde City Ordinance No. 2004-41 is an exercise of the municipality\u2019s police power that conflicts with R.C. 2923.126, a general law. The ordinance is therefore unconstitutional. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b340-5\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b340-6\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A03\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">{\u00b6 55} The General Assembly\u2019s stated purpose in enacting R.C. 2923.126 was \u201cto ensure uniformity throughout the state regarding * * * the authority granted to a person holding a [concealed-handgun] license.\u201d 2004 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 12, Section 9, 150 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3390. To effectuate this intent, R.C. 2923.126(A) offers the general rule that persons holding concealed-handgun licenses \u201cmay carry a concealed handgun anywhere in this state,\u201d subject to the numerous exceptions in subsections (B) and (C) of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">{\u00b6 56} However, these exceptions generally treat private property owners (as well as private persons leasing public land) as a separate class, giving them the authority to decide in most circumstances whether concealed handguns will be allowed on their property. R.C. 2923.126(C)(3). This distinction creates arbitrary and unreasonable results, such that the statute does not operate uniformly throughout the state. I therefore respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to allow R.C. 2923.126 to take precedence over Clyde Ordinance 2004-41, which prohibits carrying a concealed handgun in Clyde city parks.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">{\u00b6 57} Pursuant to Section 3 of the Home Rule Amendment, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution, a state statute will take precedence over a local ordinance only if \u201c(1) the ordinance is in conflict with the statute, (2) the ordinance is an exercise of the police power, rather than of local self-government, and (3) the statute is a general law.\u201d <em>Canton v. State, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-0hio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, \u00b6 9. To qualify as a general law, \u201ca statute must (1) be part of a statewide and comprehensive legislative enactment, (2) apply to all parts of the state alike and operate uniformly throughout the state, (3) set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations, rather than purport only to grant or limit legislative power of a municipal corporation to set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations, and (4) prescribe a rule of conduct upon citizens generally.\u201d Id. at syllabus. I agree that the first, third, and fourth factors apply to R.C. 2923.126 and do not dispute that it applies to all parts of the state alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">{\u00b6 58} However, I do not agree that R.C. 2923.126 operates uniformly throughout the state. Given the exception for private property owners, the general rules on where a person may carry a concealed handgun fluctuate depending on who owns the property at issue; R.C. 2923.126 divides the state by creating different rules for public and private property. A statute that makes such a nonuniform classification can still qualify as a general law under the home-rule analysis, so long as the classification is not \u201c \u2018arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious,\u2019 \u201d but R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>2923.126 does not meet that standard. <em>Canton, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, \u00b6 30, quoting <em>Garcia v. Siffrin Residential Assn. </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 259, 272, 17 O.O.3d 167, 407 N.E.2d 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">{\u00b6 59} In fact, this case provides a prime example of the types of arbitrary and unreasonable conduct discussed in <em>Canton. </em>Suppose that there are two parks in Clyde on opposite sides of the street; Park A is owned by the city, and Park B is owned by a private corporation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At Park A, a person with the requisite license could carry a concealed handgun at the park, as the statute does not prohibit the carrying of a concealed handgun in public parks. The city is powerless to change this fact; concealed handguns must be allowed in the park, unless one of the limited exceptions applies (e.g., a school holds an event at the park, thereby invoking the exception for school safety zones in R.C. 2923.126(B)(2)). At Park B, a person\u2019s right to carry a concealed handgun depends on whether the owner of the park posts a sign forbidding the carrying of a concealed handgun. R.C. 2923.126(C)(3). The owner of the park can decide to forbid concealed handguns for any reason or no reason, and anyone who violates that decision could be charged with criminal trespass, a fourth-degree misdemeanor. If there are other privately owned parks in the area, the owners could each set his own rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">{\u00b6 60} The single fact that Park A is publicly owned and Park B is privately owned changes the rules for whether concealed handguns will be allowed in the parks. The statute completely regulates public property while having essentially no effect on most forms of private property (with rare exceptions like R.C. 2923.126(B)(4), which prohibits concealed handguns when the private property has a liquor permit).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">{\u00b6 61} This different treatment of public and private property is patently arbitrary and unreasonable; it affects one class of land solely on the basis of ownership, which has little to do with the relative safety of allowing concealed handguns on a particular type of property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We held that a similarly selective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>enactment was not a general law in <em>Canton. </em>95 Ohio St.3d 149, 2002-Ohio-2005, 766 N.E.2d 963, \u00b6 30 (determining that a statute was not a general law because it would in effect apply only in older areas of the state). I would come to the same result in this case, because the rules in R.C. 29231.26 for when and where concealed handguns can be carried apply only (and arbitrarily) to public property.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">{\u00b6 62} The majority tries to sidestep these problems by citing our decision in <em>Marich v. Bob Bennett Constr. Co., </em>116 Ohio St.3d 553, 2008-Ohio-92, 880 N.E.2d 906. In <em>Marich, </em>we resolved a challenge to a statutory system that generally limited vehicles traveling on public roads to a certain width but allowed persons wishing to operate a wider vehicle within a municipality to apply for a permit from that municipality. Id. at \u00b6 3. The permit statute, R.C. 4513.34(A), said that the municipality could issue a permit \u201cupon application in writing and for good cause shown.\u201d The appellant there argued that different municipalities might interpret \u201cgood cause shown\u201d in different ways and thus the statute would not operate uniformly throughout the state. <em>Marich </em>at \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">{\u00b6 63} We answered this concern by holding that a statutory system that varies \u201cto some degree from jurisdiction to jurisdiction\u201d can still be a general law, as \u201cmere differences in the interpretation and application of the statutory language are not enough to prevent a statute from applying to all parts of the state and operating uniformly throughout it.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 22, 25. We acknowledged that different municipalities might interpret \u201cgood cause shown\u201d to mean different things, but held that the basic process for receiving a permit was the same throughout the state. Id. at \u00b6 25, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">{\u00b6 64} With R.C. 2923.126, though, the basic process for determining where concealed handguns may be carried varies greatly throughout the state because rulemaking for private property is generally left to the discretion of private landowners. By separating public and private property and leaving largely unfettered the discretion of private property owners to determine what limitations to place on their property, the General Assembly has created a system of restrictions that fluctuates much more dramatically across jurisdictions than the statutory scheme in <em>Marich, </em>which left open the possibility that the words \u201cgood cause shown\u201d could have slightly different meanings in different parts of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">{\u00b6 65} Given the arbitrary and unreasonable distinction between public and private landowners, the fact that the law is subject to the will of private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>landowners, and the fact that the statute fails to meet its stated objective of establishing uniformity in its designation of those places in which persons may carry concealed handguns, I would hold that R.C. 2923.126 is not a general law and that it therefore does not take precedence over Clyde Ordinance 2004-41.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b343-7\">Lydy &amp; Moan, Daniel T.

Implementation of the state statute strikes a severe blow to the underlying principles of local self-government.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">{\u00b6 b} It is unfortunate that the passion of those who believe in the right of virtually any adult to carry a concealed weapon (subject to the statutory exceptions) has pushed aside the fundamental belief in Ohio that matters that directly affect the safety of a community may be determined by local government, where the voices of those citizens most directly affected may be heard and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>considered. No one outside the city of Clyde, or perhaps the county of Sandusky, has any legitimate interest in the regulations placed upon the use of a city park in the municipality of Clyde. We can only hope that those who believe that dogs should run unleashed in city parks or those who believe that alcohol should be consumed in city parks are not able to convince a majority of the General Assembly of the merits of then* cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b343-5\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ai3\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">{\u00b6 66} In <em>E.

I would hold that 2004 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 12 violates those Equal Protection Clauses. There is no rational basis to distinguish between private and public property owners in regard to their statutory ability to prevent persons from carrying firearms onto their property. Clyde owns its municipal park.
