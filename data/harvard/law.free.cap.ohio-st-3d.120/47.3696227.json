Lager as administrator of the estate of his daughter, Sara Lager (\u201cSara\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">{\u00b6 3} We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">{\u00b6 4} Sara died from injuries sustained in an automobile accident that occurred while she was a passenger in her own car, which was then being driven by her boyfriend, Ryan Miller-Gonzalez. There is no dispute that Sara\u2019s death was caused by injuries sustained in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-16\">{\u00b6 5} At the time of the accident, Sara\u2019s vehicle was insured by a policy issued to her by Nationwide. The policy provided UM coverage of $50,000 for each person and $100,000 for each occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-17\">{\u00b6 6} Sara\u2019s parents, Fred and Cathy Lager (\u201cthe Lagers\u201d), also had a vehicle that was insured by Nationwide through a separate motor vehicle policy. The Lagers\u2019 policy provided UM coverage of $300,000 for each person and $300,000 for each occurrence for the Lagers or a \u201crelative.\u201d For purposes here, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>no dispute that Sara was a \u201crelative\u201d of the Lagers and that her vehicle was \u201cuninsured\u201d under the terms of the Lagers\u2019 policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">{\u00b6 7} The UM endorsement in the Lagers\u2019 policy stated: \u201cWe will pay compensatory damages, including derivative claims, that you or a relative are legally entitled to recover from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle under the tort law of the state where the motor vehicle accident occurred, <em>because of bodily injury </em>suffered by you or a relative and resulting from the motor vehicle accident. Damages must result from a motor vehicle accident arising out of the: 1. ownership; 2. maintenance; or 3. use; of the uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d (Boldface sic; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">{\u00b6 8} The policy defined \u201cBODILY INJURY\u201d as \u201ca) physical injury; b) sickness; c) disease; or d) resultant death; of any person which results directly from a motor vehicle accident.\u201d (Boldface sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">{\u00b6 9} The Lagers\u2019 policy also contained an \u201cother owned auto\u201d exclusion that is critical to our analysis. That exclusion states that \u201ccoverage does not apply to anyone <em>for bodily injury </em>or derivative claims: * * * 3. While any insured operates or occupies a motor vehicle: a) owned by: b) furnished to; or c) available for the regular use of; you or a relative, but not insured for Auto Liability coverage under this policy.\u201d (Boldface sic; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">{\u00b6 10} After Nationwide denied coverage under the Lagers\u2019 policy, appellee filed suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Lucas County.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nationwide argued various theories to support the denial, only one of which is relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">{\u00b6 11} On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court rejected Nationwide\u2019s assertion that coverage was not available to the Lagers because of the other-owned-auto exclusion. The court reasoned that the other-owned-auto exclusion was ambiguous because it stated that coverage did not apply to claims <em>for </em>bodily injury while, at the same time, the policy also stated that UM coverage was available for claims <em>because of </em>bodily injury. Citing the Tenth District\u2019s opinion in another wrongful-death case in which similar policy language was at issue, see <em>Hall v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>10th Dist. No. 05AP-305, 2005-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Ohio-4572, 2005 WL 2100627, the trial court found that the policy language was ambiguous. It construed the policy in favor of coverage and held that the Lagers were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">{\u00b6 12} In summary fashion, the Sixth District affirmed. Its analysis of <em>Hall </em>was limited to three sentences: <em>\u201cHall </em>examined the exact same policy language applied in circumstances materially the same as those presented here. The <em>Hall </em>court found this language ambiguous. * * * We are persuaded that this is the proper interpretation of this insurance contract.\u201d <em>Lager v. Gonzalez, </em>Lucas App. No. L-07-1022, 2007-Ohio-4094, \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">{\u00b6 13} The Sixth District subsequently certified its decision in this case as in conflict with the Third District\u2019s decision in <em>Tuohy v. Taylor, </em>Defiance App. No. 4-06-23, 2007-Ohio-3597, 2007 WL 2027909. We recognized the conflict, 116 Ohio St.3d 1435, 2007-Ohio-6518, 877 N.E.2d 988, and asserted discretionary jurisdiction as well, 116 Ohio St.3d 1438, 2007-Ohio-6518, 877 N.E.2d 990, to address whether an other-owned-auto exclusion that excludes coverage \u201cfor bodily injury\u201d is ambiguous if the policy also contains language that provides UM coverage \u201cbecause of bodily injury suffered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">{\u00b6 14} Our analysis of this question of insurance law is governed by familiar principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cAn insurance policy is a contract whose interpretation is a matter of law. <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 7 O.O.3d 403, 374 N.E.2d 146, paragraph one of the syllabus. Contract terms are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Gomolka v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 166, 167-168, 24 O.O.3d 274, 436 N.E.2d 1347. If provisions are susceptible of more than one interpretation, they \u2018will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured.\u2019 <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus. Additionally, \u2018an exclusion in an insurance policy will be interpreted as applying only to that which is <em>clearly </em>intended to be excluded.\u2019 (Emphasis sic.) <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 657, 665, 597 N.E.2d 1096.\u201d <em>Sharonville v. Am. Emps. Ins. Co., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-2180, 846 N.E.2d 833, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">{\u00b6 16} Although ambiguous provisions in an insurance policy must be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured, see, e.g., <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus, it is equally well settled that a court cannot create ambiguity in a contract where there is none. See, e.g., <em>Hacker v. Dickman </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 118, 119, 661 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>1005. Ambiguity exists only when a provision at issue is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation. Id. at 119-120, 661 N.E.2d 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">{\u00b6 17} As we have observed, the Sixth District\u2019s conclusion that Nationwide\u2019s policy is ambiguous was based on the Tenth District\u2019s decision in <em>Hall. </em>Because the Sixth District cited <em>Hall </em>but did not interpret it, we turn to <em>Hall </em>itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">{\u00b6 18} Although the Tenth District decided <em>Hall </em>in 2005, the analysis in that case was driven by two cases that the Tenth District had decided more than ten years earlier, <em>Newsome v. Grange Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(Feb. 23, 1993), Franklin App. No. 92AP-1172, 1993 WL 51140, and <em>Leonhard v. Motorists Mut. Ins. </em>Co. (Mar. 3, 1994), Franklin App. No. 93AP-449, 1994 WL 67716. Those cases arose in an era governed by statutes and case law that since have been amended, revised, and abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">{\u00b6 19} Indeed, at the time that <em>Newsome </em>and <em>Leonhard </em>were decided, this court was holding that exclusions from UM coverage were void and unenforceable because they eliminated or reduced coverage that was required by statute. See, e.g., <em>Stanton v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 111, 623 N.E.2d 1197, syllabus (\u201cfor fee\u201d exclusion to UM coverage was unenforceable); <em>State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Alexander </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 397, 583 N.E.2d 309, syllabus (\u201cAn automobile insurance policy may not eliminate or reduce uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, required by R.C. 3937.18, to persons injured in a motor vehicle accident, where the claim or claims of such persons arise from causes of action that are recognized by Ohio tort law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">{\u00b6 20} At that time, there was significant uncertainty in Ohio law about the validity of any exclusion, including other-owned-vehicle exclusions, because of our decisions in cases such as <em>Alexander </em>and <em>Martin v. Midwestern Group Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 478, 639 N.E.2d 438, paragraph three of the syllabus (invalidating other-owned-vehicle exclusions in UM coverage).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">{\u00b6 21} In response to those judicial decisions and their progeny, the General Assembly has repeatedly amended R.C. 3937.18 to supersede our holdings. See, e.g., <em>Baughman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 480, 484, 727 N.E.2d 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">{\u00b6 22} At oral argument, Nationwide suggested that it had developed the language of its policy from the statutory language of R.C. 3937.18(A)(1) as it was amended in 1997. See Section 1, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 261, 147 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2372, 2372-2377.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The 1997 amendments were designed to allow insurers to limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>UM coverage to accidents in which an insured suffers bodily injury. <em>Hedges v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-1926, 846 N.E.2d 16, \u00b6 25. Nationwide asserts that it was proper for insurers to use the statutory phrases \u201cfor bodily injury\u201d and \u201cbecause of bodily injury\u201d in its policy because those phrases were significant for defining coverage properly during a period in which the law was in constant flux.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">{\u00b6 23} That argument has some intuitive appeal, and we agree generally that precedent from the era in which <em>Newsome </em>and <em>Leonhard </em>arose is not compelling in the area of current Ohio insurance law. It is not necessary for us to reach Nationwide\u2019s argument regarding the source of the wording in its policy, however, because we find that the policy\u2019s definitions of bodily injury are dispositive of the issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">{\u00b6 24} As noted earlier, the policy defines bodily injury to include death. Thus, there is no question that the claim here arises from a \u201cbodily injury,\u201d i.e., Sara\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">{\u00b625} As Nationwide conceded at oral argument, by operation of the UM endorsement, the Lagers\u2019 policy would have afforded them that coverage because they and Sara were insureds who suffered losses because of bodily injury, i.e., Sara\u2019s death, caused by an underinsured driver. But the Lagers\u2019 policy also contained a valid exclusion that disclaimed coverage to anyone for bodily injury or derivative claims while an insured was operating or occupying a vehicle owned by the Lagers or a relative that was not insured for liability coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">{\u00b6 26} There is nothing ambiguous, uncertain, or unclear about the meaning of that exclusion. As the Third District properly recognized in the conflict case, other-owned-auto exclusions that disclaim UM coverage represent a clear intent to limit coverage for bodily injuries incurred in \u201cthe vehicles specifically covered under the insurance policy.\u201d <em>Tuohy, </em>2007-Ohio-3597, 2007 WL 2027909, \u00b6 19. See also <em>Kotlarczyk v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>Lucas App. No. L-03-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>1103, 2004-Ohio-3447, 2004 WL 1468336, at \u00b6 61 (Lanzinger, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe stated intent is to limit coverage to vehicles specifically identified to the policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">{\u00b6 27} Here, there is no dispute that Sara was occupying a vehicle that was not insured under the Lagers\u2019 policy when she sustained bodily injury. Thus, the exclusion operated as it was intended: to limit the policy\u2019s coverage under the clearly defined conditions set forth in the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">{\u00b6 28} The Lagers are correct that they are legally entitled to recover under Ohio tort law from Miller-Gonzalez for the presumptive damages they sustained as the result of Sara\u2019s death. See R.C. 2125.02(A). But that does not mean that Nation-wide must pay for those damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">{\u00b6 29} The opinions rendered by the Sixth and Tenth Districts have stated that in some scenarios there may be meaningful distinctions between \u201cfor bodily injury\u201d and \u201cbecause of bodily injury,\u201d but that assertion has not been sufficiently established by their analyses. The mere potential for ambiguity in a clause in a contract is not sufficient to establish that the provision is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">{\u00b6 30} Moreover, the Lagers\u2019 argument that their injuries are \u201cbecause of\u2019 Sara\u2019s bodily injury, not \u201cfor\u201d Sara\u2019s bodily injuries, is a semantic distinction. Though their wrongful-death claim arose \u201cbecause of\u2019 Sara bodily injury, i.e., her death, any coverage \u201cfor\u201d her bodily injury was extinguished because her bodily injury arose when she was in a motor vehicle that was not an insured vehicle under the Lagers\u2019 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">{\u00b6 31} The purpose of UM insurance is to put an injured policyholder in the same position he would have been in if the tortfeasor had carried sufficient liability insurance. See <em>Martin v. Midwestern Group Ins. Co., </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 485, 639 N.E.2d 438 (Moyer, C.J., dissenting), citing <em>Sexton v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 431, 436, 23 O.O.3d 385, 433 N.E.2d 555. To permit coverage in circumstances like those presented here would improperly allow \u201ca person who owns more than one motor vehicle [to] choose not to insure one vehicle and bear no financial risk for the decision because he will be deemed to have in effect purchased liability coverage for the vehicle he decided not to insure if he is struck by another uninsured motorist.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>id.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">{\u00b6 32} We therefore answer the certified question in the negative and hold that the other-owned-auto exclusion clearly and unambiguously applied to this claim and that Nationwide\u2019s motion for summary judgment should have been granted on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-11\">Lundberg Stratton, Cunningham, and Slaby, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b287-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b287-6\">Moyer, C.J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b287-7\">Pfeifer, J., dissents with opinion.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b287-8\">Penelope R.

The parties agreed that Sara\u2019s vehicle was uninsured under this definition, but there was a continuing dispute in the trial court and in the court of appeals regarding Sara\u2019s status as a \u201crelative.\u201d The court of appeals affirmed the finding that Sara was a \u201crelative,\u201d and that issue is not before us.

The insurance company, not the Lagers, crafted the insurance contract using different words, even though the insurer now contends, because it pleases the insurer, that \u201cthere is no rational distinction between the phrases \u2018for bodily injury\u2019 and \u2018because of bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d If there is no rational distinction, why didn\u2019t the insurance company use the same phrase \u2014 was it intentionally attempting to confuse its policy holders? Insurance contracts are difficult enough to understand, even for professionals, without the insertion of different phrases to purportedly mean the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">{\u00b6 34} There could be a difference between \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cbecause of\u2019 in this policy. If a person was injured and received $100 in compensation and the person\u2019s mother, who witnessed the injury, received $50 in compensation, most third-grade students would recognize that the injured person received compensation \u201cfor\u201d her injury and that the mother received compensation \u201cbecause of\u2019 the injury to her daughter. \u201cFor\u201d and \u201cbecause of\u2019 are not synonymous; for example, people do not read legal opinions or insurance contracts \u201cbecause of\u2019 hours, but they can read them \u201cfor\u201d hours. And yet this court sees only the \u201cmere potential for ambiguity\u201d between \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cbecause of.\u201d I readily admit that \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cbecause of\u2019 can mean the same thing, as in \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d and \u201cvoid because of vagueness.\u201d But \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cbecause of\u2019 do not always mean the same thing, and there is no way to know whether they do in this insurance contract. When \u201c \u2018provisions are susceptible of more than one interpretation, they \u201cwill be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured,\u201d \u2019 \u201d except, apparently, today.
