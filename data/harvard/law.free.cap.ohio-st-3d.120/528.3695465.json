Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b762-16\">{\u00b6 1} The appellant was convicted of having a weapon while under a disability under R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) because he was \u201cunder indictment\u201d on drug charges at the time he possessed a weapon. The question before this court is \u201c[wjhether knowledge of the pending indictment is required for a conviction for having a weapon under disability pursuant to R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) when the disability is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>based on a pending indictment.\u201d We answer that question in the negative. But we also find that the General Assembly did not intend R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) to impose strict liability. Therefore, pursuant to R.C. 2901.21(B), we hold that the mental state of recklessness applies in determining whether a defendant is aware that he or she is \u201cunder indictment.\u201d Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">II. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">{\u00b6 2} On March 5, 2006, at approximately 1:00 a.m. outside the Gin-Gin bar in Cleveland, appellant, Howard Clay, shot and wounded Christopher Graham. At the time of the shooting, Clay was under indictment for possession and trafficking of drugs. For the 2006 shooting, a grand jury indicted Clay on charges of felonious assault under R.C. 2903.11, firearm specifications under R.C. 2941.141 and 2941.145, and having a weapon under a disability under R.C. 2923.13, i.e., using a weapon while under indictment for possession and trafficking of drugs under R.C. 2923.13(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">{\u00b6 3} Clay waived his right to have his case decided by a jury and tried his case to a judge. Clay argued that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of having a weapon while under a disability because he was unaware that he was under indictment at the time of the shooting. The court disagreed, holding that R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) does not require a defendant to have knowledge of the indictment. Thus, the trial judge found Clay guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">{\u00b6 4} The court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction, holding that R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) is a strict-liability offense. The court of appeals certified that its judgment conflicted with <em>State v. Burks </em>(June 22, 1990), Sandusky App. No. S-89-13, 1990 WL 85126, in which the court held that a defendant must have notice of a prior indictment before he or she can be convicted of having a weapon while under a disability. R.C. 2923.13(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">{\u00b6 5} We determined that a conflict existed. We also accepted Clay\u2019s discretionary appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and sua sponte consolidated the two appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">{\u00b6 6} Clay was convicted of having a weapon while under a disability. Therefore, we first examine R.C. 2923.13, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>{\u00b6 7} \u201c(A) Unless relieved from disability as provided in section 2923.14 of the Revised Code, no person shall <em>knowingly </em>acquire, have, carry, or use any firearm or dangerous ordnance, if any of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(3) The person is <em>under indictment </em>for or has been convicted of any offense involving the illegal possession, use, sale, administration, distribution, or trafficking in any drug of abuse or has been adjudicated a delinquent child for the commission of an offense that, if committed by an adult, would have been an offense involving the illegal possession, use, sale, administration, distribution, or trafficking in any drug of abuse.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">{\u00b6 10} It can be seen from the above language that the General Assembly did not provide a specific mental state in R.C. 2923.13(A)(3). Thus, we must examine R.C. 2901.21(B), which addresses the treatment of criminal statutes that have no culpable mental state. R.C. 2901.21(B) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cWhen the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThus, recklessness is the catchall culpable mental state for criminal statutes that fail to mention any degree of culpability, except for strict liability statutes, where the accused\u2019s mental state is irrelevant.\u201d <em>State v. Lozier, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 161, 2004-Ohio-732, 803 N.E.2d 770, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">{\u00b6 13} Clay argues that the word \u201cknowingly\u201d within R.C. 2923.13(A) modifies the phrase \u201cunder indictment\u201d within R.C. 2923.13(A)(3). Therefore, Clay argues, the state must prove that he was aware of the indictment at the time that he possessed the gun in order to convict him of having a weapon while under a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">{\u00b6 14} In examining the structure of R.C. 2923.13, we find that the General Assembly intended the word \u201cknowingly\u201d within R.C. 2923.13(A) to modify only the phrase \u201cacquire, have, carry or use any firearm or dangerous ordnance.\u201d Thus, \u201cknowingly\u201d does not provide a culpable mental state for the phrase \u201cunder indictment\u201d in R.C. 2923.13(A)(3). See generally <em>State v. Maxwell, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 254, 2002-Ohio-2121, 767 N.E.2d 242, \u00b6 29 (in examining a statute structured similarly to the one herein, the court determined that \u201cknowledge is a requirement only for the discrete clause within which it resides\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">{\u00b6 15} Because R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) has no culpable mental state, the question now becomes whether the General Assembly plainly intended R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>to impose strict liability or whether R.C. 2901.21(B) supplies the culpable mental state of recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">{\u00b6 16} In the past, legislative silence as to a culpable mental state was interpreted as imposing strict liability. <em>State v. Lisbon Sales Book Co. </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 482, 27 O.O.2d 443, 200 N.E.2d 590, paragraph two of the syllabus. But that changed in 1974, when the legislature repealed former R.C. 2901.21 and enacted a new version of that statute, which imposes the culpable mental state of recklessness when no culpable mental state is specified, unless the legislature \u201cplainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability.\u201d Am.Sub.H.B. No. 511, 134 Ohio Laws, Part II, 1866, 1897-1898. See also <em>State v. Buehler Food Markets, Inc. </em>(1989), 50 Ohio App.3d 29, 30, 552 N.E.2d 680. Thus, \u201c[i]t is not enough that the General Assembly in fact intended imposition of liability without proof of mental culpability. Rather, the General Assembly must plainly indicate that intention in the language of the statute.\u201d <em>State v. Collins </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 524, 530, 733 N.E.2d 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">{\u00b6 17} The General Assembly knows how to define a strict-liability offense when it so desires, as evidenced in <em>State v. Lozier, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 161, 2004-Ohio-732, 803 N.E.2d 770. In <em>Lozier, </em>we considered whether R.C. 2925.03(C)(5)(b), which elevates trafficking in LSD to a fourth-degree felony if the offense is committed \u201cin the vicinity of a school,\u201d imposes strict criminal liability. This subsection does not assign a culpable mental state. We looked to R.C. 2925.01, the definitional section for R.C. Chapter 2925. R.C. 2925.01(BB) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cAn offense is \u2018committed in the vicinity of a juvenile\u2019 if the offender commits the offense within one hundred feet of a juvenile or within view of a juvenile, <em>regardless </em>of whether the <em>offender knows </em>the age of the juvenile, whether the <em>offender knows </em>the offense is being committed within one hundred feet of or within view of the juvenile, or <em>whether the juvenile actually views the commission of the offense.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">{\u00b6 19} We stated that \u201cR.C. 2925.01(BB) makes it abundantly clear that the offender\u2019s mental state is irrelevant in determining whether an offender has committed an offense \u2018in the vicinity of a juvenile,\u2019 \u201d and therefore it imposes strict liability. Id. at \u00b6 36. In the instant case, we find no similar language in R.C. 2913.13(A)(3), or elsewhere in the Revised Code, that the General Assembly plainly intended to impose strict liability for this offense. Thus, we hold that R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) has no culpable mental state, nor does it contain any language that plainly indicates an intent to impose strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">{\u00b620} Nevertheless, the state argues that R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) imposes strict liability pursuant to <em>State v. Maxwell, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 254, 2002-Ohio-2121, 767 N.E.2d 242. In <em>Maxwell, </em>the defendant was convicted of pandering obscenity involving a minor under R.C. 2907.321(A)(6). The issue was whether R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>2907.321(A)(6) imposed strict liability with regard to the importing of obscene material into the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. 2907.321 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(A) No person, with <em>knowledge </em>of the character of the material or performance involved, shall do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(6) <em>Bring </em>or <em>cause to be brought into this state </em>any obscene material that has a minor as one of its participants or portrayed observers.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Maxwell, </em>we reasoned that the inclusion of a culpable mental state in R.C. 2907.321(A) and the absence of one in R.C. 2907.321(A)(6) meant that the General Assembly intended R.C. 2907.321(A)(6) to be a strict-liability offense. Id. at \u00b6 23-29. However, we also reasoned that other \u201cindications outside the statute\u201d supported the conclusion that R.C. 2907.321(A)(6) imposed strict liability. <em>Maxwell, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 254, 2002-Ohio-2121, 767 N.E.2d 242, \u00b6 30. The \u201cother indications\u201d included the General Assembly\u2019s \u201cstrong stance against sex-related acts involving minors, as evidenced by the numerous statutes in the Ohio Revised Code providing for criminal liability for those acts.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">{\u00b6 26} While the statutory structure at issue in <em>Maxwell </em>is similar to the structure of the statute herein, <em>Maxwell </em>is distinguishable from the instant case. The crime in <em>Maxwell, </em>possession of obscene material involving a minor, is not protected by the Constitution. But possessing a weapon, when the weapon is a firearm, is a constitutionally protected right subject only to limited restrictions. <em>Arnold v. Cleveland </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 35, 616 N.E.2d 163 (the Ohio Constitution confers the right to bear arms, but that right may be limited through use of the police power). And in the instant case, it is only the additional fact of being \u201cunder indictment\u201d that made possessing the firearm a crime under R.C. 2923.13. Thus, the acts addressed in <em>Maxwell </em>are very different from the act addressed in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">{\u00b6 27} Further, unlike in <em>Maxwell, </em>there are no \u201cother indications outside\u201d the language of R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) that <em>plainly indicate </em>an intent to impose strict liability. Specifically, we find no \u201cstrong stance\u201d by the General Assembly against possession of firearms per se, as we found in <em>Maxwell </em>with regard to possession of child pornography. Accordingly, we find that <em>Maxwell </em>is distinguishable from the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">{\u00b6 28} We find that R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) contains no culpable mental state and that the General Assembly did not plainly intend to impose strict liability. Where a statute lacks a mental state and the General Assembly did not intend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>strict liability, the mental state of recklessness applies under R.C. 2901.21(B). Accordingly, for purposes of proving the offense of having a weapon while under a disability pursuant to R.C. 2923.13(A)(3), the mental state of recklessness applies in determining whether the defendant was aware that he or she was \u201cunder indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">{\u00b6 29} Because the trial court never determined whether Clay acted recklessly with regard to being aware that he was \u201cunder indictment,\u201d we remand the cause to the trial court to determine that issue. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b767-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A1n\">Lanzinger, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b767-8\">O\u2019Connor, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AUA\">O\u2019Donnell, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-12\">. Clay asserted two propositions of law in his discretionary appeal: (1) whether knowledge of the disabling condition (e.g., a pending indictment for a drug offense) is an essential element of having a weapon while under a disability and (2) whether, as a matter of due process, a criminal defendant may not be convicted of having a weapon while under a disability unless he or she has received notice of the disabling condition. We find that the questions presented in these propositions are resolved when we answer the certified question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b767-9\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AL9\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">{\u00b6 30} I believe that it is important to emphasize that a defendant\u2019s awareness of the possibility of an existing indictment is a necessary element in proving recklessness pursuant to R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) when the disability alleged is based on a pending indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">{\u00b6 31} The definitions of the mental states of \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201crecklessly\u201d are somewhat blurred. \u201cA person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, he <em>perversely disregards a known risk </em>that his conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, he <em>perversely disregards a known risk </em>that such circumstances are likely to exist.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2901.22(C). In other words, because a person who acts with recklessness acts with indifference to a <em>known </em>risk, some knowledge is required to satisfy the definition of recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">{\u00b6 32} With respect to the mental state of \u201cknowingly,\u201d \u201c[a] person acts <em>knowingly, </em>regardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2901.22(B). Awareness, then, is key to both definitions. It is the level of awareness, however, that separates the two levels: \u201c \u2018If the result is probable, the person acts \u201cknowingly\u201d; if it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>probable, but only possible, the person acts \u201crecklessly\u201d if he chooses to ignore the risk.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Judicial Campaign Complaint Against Emrich </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 1517, 1519, 665 N.E.2d 1133, quoting <em>State v.
