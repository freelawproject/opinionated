Recognized by his rural community as an expert in muzzle-loading firearms, McGraw and his wife, Mary, have been muzzle-loading enthusiasts for decades, and much of their social life revolves around these activities. We must determine whether his involvement with Stumptown Muzzle-loading Supplies (\u201cSMS\u201d) after he was declared to be permanently and totally disabled warrants the termination of those benefits and a declaration of overpayment and fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">{\u00b6 2} SMS began in the mid-1980s when Mary was approached by a neighbor with the idea of building a shooting range on some of their adjoining land. In 1990, the McGraws\u2019 garage was converted into a small machine shop with a counter/service area in front. The machines were owned first by Gary Parsons and later by Keith Phillips, who succeeded Parsons as SMS\u2019s gunsmith.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">{\u00b6 3} SMS was originally a three-person partnership of Mary McGraw, Gary Parsons, and Aan Shepherd. Ill health and travel distance eventually caused Parsons and Shepherd to leave the partnership, and by 1997, Mary was sole proprietor of SMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">{\u00b6 4} Ml of the business, ammunition, and firearms licenses (and accounts) were in Mary\u2019s name. McGraw and Mary were listed as \u201cresponsible persons\u201d for the Bureau of Mcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, meaning they had \u201cthe power to direct the management and policies of the applicant pertaining to explosive materials.\u201d Mary testified that her husband\u2019s designation was technical and was confined to the handling of black powder.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>{\u00b6 5} SMS did not advertise and did not have a phone. There was only a sign outside with the SMS name and McGraw\u2019s nickname, which was included because of his local name recognition. Hours were posted on the door in compliance with federal firearms-licensing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">{\u00b6 6} Gary Parsons stated that McGraw \u201ctinkered around\u201d in the shop a lot. McGraw confirmed that he enjoyed being in the shop most days because he \u201ccould talk to the guys that come in. Friends would come in.\u201d There is no evidence that McGraw did any machine work or gunsmithing. Parsons stated that Parsons did most of the work involving the building of muzzle-loaders. Phillips eventually took over those duties when Parsons left. Additional testimony revealed that McGraw, who was renowned for making muzzle-loaders, including the parts, by hand, did not know how to make them by machine. Moreover, he has end-stage glaucoma in both eyes and has been legally blind since 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">{\u00b6 7} Bureau investigators posing as gun enthusiasts twice visited SMS. These visits consisted primarily of small talk about guns and ammo. McGraw discussed some pistols that he had recently sold and invited one of the investigators to bring in an allegedly defective gun, telling them he would \u201ctake a look at it.\u201d He also sold a small item to the investigators on each occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">{\u00b6 8} Financially, investigation revealed that the SMS bank account listed Mary as sole proprietor. Bank records did not show any transfer from the business account to the McGraws\u2019 personal account, and there were no checks written from the business account to McGraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant, AT <em>&amp; </em>T, Inc., the amenable employer in this case, filed a motion for termination of compensation and declarations of fraud and overpayment with appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio. Before a staff hearing officer, AT <em>&amp; </em>T argued that McGraw\u2019s activities were incompatible with his receipt of permanent total disability compensation. The staff hearing officer was not persuaded. In a lengthy order, the hearing officer found that McGraw\u2019s activities were neither remunerated nor inconsistent with his physical restrictions. The staff hearing officer was ultimately persuaded by \u201cclaimant\u2019s assertion that he was merely keeping busy with permitted sedentary activity related to a hobby he has had for over 50 years\u201d and concluded that McGraw \u201cwas <em>not </em>engaged in <em>nor </em>capable of sustained remunerative employment from 05/02/1997 to date.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">{\u00b6 10} AT <em>&amp; </em>T filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the commission had abused its discretion in failing to terminate permanent total disability compensation and declare overpayment and fraud. AT &amp; T argued that if McGraw could interact with customers for free as a hobby, he could do so for pay, and was thus capable of sustained remunerative employment. The court of appeals disagreed, holding that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>evidence that McGraw was capable of engaging in the disputed activities on a <em>sustained </em>basis. The writ was accordingly denied. <em>State ex rel. AT &amp; T, Inc. v. McGraw, </em>Franklin App. No. 06AP-1103, 2007-Ohio-3794, 2007 WL 2153210.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">{\u00b6 11} This cause is now before this court on appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">{\u00b6 12} Permanent total disability compensation cannot be paid to a claimant who is (1) engaged in sustained remunerative employment, (2) medically able to engage in sustained remunerative employment, or (3) engaged in activities so medically inconsistent with the purported disability as to impeach the medical evidence underlying the award. <em>State ex rel. Lawson v. Mondie Forge, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 39, 2004-Ohio-6086, 817 N.E.2d 880, \u00b6 16. AT <em>&amp; </em>T does not allege that McGraw was paid for his activities, nor does it allege that those activities are medically incompatible with the claimed disability. It instead relies on Lawson\u2019s second criterion and argues that if McGraw can perform these activities as a volunteer, he is medically capable of doing them for pay. This activity, according to AT &amp; T, demonstrates a medical capacity for sustained remunerative employment that should bar permanent total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">{\u00b6 13} Two responses have been offered. The first is that McGraw\u2019s activities do not constitute work. The second is that even if they do, there is no evidence that McGraw can do them on a sustained basis. The commission relied on the former, the court of appeals on the latter, and both have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">{\u00b6 14} Addressing the commission\u2019s position first, two cases are particularly meaningful. <em>Lawson </em>was also a case involving the termination of permanent total disability compensation and involved a claimant who had performed civic, but largely sedentary, activities in connection with his position as a village councilman. The bureau learned of this situation in the claimant\u2019s small community and succeeded in having permanent total disability compensation stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">{\u00b6 15} In reinstating compensation, we addressed the mentality that seemed to underlie the commission\u2019s termination order:</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cOne of the most enduring (though not often explicitly stated) misconceptions about PTD is that once it is granted, the recipient must thereafter remain virtually housebound. This is a fallacy. PTD exempts no one from life\u2019s daily demands. Groceries must be purchased and meals cooked. Errands must be run and appointments kept. The yard must be tended and the dog walked. Where children are involved, there may be significant chauffeur time. For some, family and friends shoulder much of the burden. Others, on the other hand, lack such support, leaving the onus of these chores on the PTD claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThese simple activities can nevertheless often generate considerable controversy. That is because all of these tasks are potentially remunerative. From the school cafeteria to the four-star restaurant, people are paid to prepare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>meals. People are paid for lawn and child care. Many people earn their living behind the wheel. <em>State ex rel. Parma Comm. Gen. Hosp. v. Jankowski, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 340, 2002-Ohio-2336, 767 N.E.2d 1143, acknowledged this and cautioned against an automatic disqualification from compensation based on the performance of routine tasks, regardless of their potential for payment.\u201d <em>Lawson, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 39, 2004-0hio-6086, 817 N.E.2d 880, \u00b6 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">{\u00b6 18} Many of McGraw\u2019s observed activities fit this description. People are paid to talk, to share expertise, opinion, and advice, and to interact with others, but these activities are also integral to everyday life. They should, therefore, be thoughtfully considered and should not automatically disqualify McGraw from permanent total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">{\u00b6 19} The second case of note is <em>State ex rel. Honda of Am. Mfg. Co. v. Indus. Comm., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 5, 2007-Ohio-969, 862 N.E.2d 478. In that case, Edith Anderson, a recipient of temporary total disability compensation, opened a small scrapbooking shop with proceeds from her late husband\u2019s life insurance policy. Id. at \u00b6 1. The store was staffed by others, but Anderson, a scrapbooking hobbyist, occasionally visited the store to chat. Id. at \u00b6 2. Just as did McGraw, Anderson eventually came under investigation. She was twice approached in the store by undercover investigators posing as customers. Id. at \u00b6 4. Anderson answered scrapbooking questions, suggested Mother\u2019s Day gifts, and described classes offered by the store. Id. Based on this evidence, Honda sought to terminate temporary total disability compensation, alleging that Anderson\u2019s activities constituted work. Id. at \u00b6 15. The commission denied the motion after finding no evidence that Anderson was paid or that her activities were inconsistent with her alleged disability. Id. at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">{\u00b6 20} We upheld that order. We stressed that Anderson\u2019s \u201cmere presence at the store is not itself disqualifying.\u201d <em>Honda, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 5, 2007-Ohio-969, 862 N.E.2d 478, \u00b6 28. We also found that the activities were insignificant, both in number and character:</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c[0]ver a three-month period, Anderson was viewed just five times. On three of those occasions, she assisted no customers. On the other two, she apparently helped a single customer by answering questions and pointing out displays and once used a cash register for an unknown purpose. This was the sum total of her observed activities at My Crop Shop.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">{\u00b6 22} Our final comments on Anderson\u2019s activities, very similar to McGraw\u2019s, are instructive:</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe commission found that Anderson\u2019s activities \u2014 to the extent that they generated any income at all \u2014 did so only secondarily because they were geared more towards promoting the goodwill of the business. We again defer to that finding. Most of the disputed activities consisted of answering customer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>questions. Certainly, Anderson cannot be required to ignore customer inquiries in order to maintain eligibility for compensation. That would indeed destroy the business\u2019s goodwill. As to the operation of the cash register, it occurred just once, without any evidence that it was connected to a sale, and does not justify termination of Anderson\u2019s temporary total disability compensation.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">{\u00b6 24} Unlike the instant case, <em>Honda </em>involved temporary total, rather than permanent total, disability. Despite distinctions between the two, one common feature is the applicable definition of \u201cwork.\u201d Both temporary total disability compensation and permanent total disability compensation define it as labor exchanged for pay, <em>Lawson, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 39, 2004-Ohio-6086, 817 N.E.2d 880, at \u00b6 19, which makes <em>Honda </em>instructive here. Anderson\u2019s activities were very similar to McGraw\u2019s, and because the former\u2019s activities did not constitute work, we are not convinced that McGraw\u2019s performance of comparable activities demonstrates a capacity for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 25} In summary, there are three important points to consider from these two decisions. <em>Lawson </em>teaches that tasks that potentially fall into the category of \u201croutine life activities\u201d will be thoughtfully considered and will not easily be deemed to preclude permanent total disability. <em>Honda </em>undermines AT <em>&amp; </em>T\u2019s suggestions that McGraw\u2019s mere presence in the store is inherently suspect and that his interactions with investigators constituted work.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">{\u00b626} <em>Honda </em>and <em>Lawson </em>illustrate a second point \u2014 the importance of the commission\u2019s exclusive ability to evaluate evidentiary weight and credibility. Much of the evidence submitted to terminate the disability compensation in these cases was derived from surveillance. Surveillance evidence can be challenging to evaluate because the cost of obtaining it means it is generally limited to a few days of observation. Consequently, resolution often depends on inference: does the evidence suggest a pattern of regular activity or does it imply an isolated occurrence?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">{\u00b6 27} The commission is in the best position to address this question because it alone has observed the demeanor and heard the testimony of the claimant, investigators, and other witnesses. In the present case, the commission considered the documentary evidence and heard testimony from the McGraws and others. At the conclusion of the hearing, the commission determined that David McGraw\u2019s activities were consistent with a hobby, not a job, and did not bar permanent total disability compensation. We defer to that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">{\u00b6 28} The court of appeals affirmed the commission on a slightly different basis, in effect holding that regardless of the character of the activities, there was no evidence that McGraw could do them on a sustained basis. In <em>Lawson, </em>that same finding was an important element of our reinstatement of compensation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>permanent total disability, and we agree that it also supports the commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b240-7\">Porter, Wright, Morris &amp; Arthur, L.L.P., Darrell R.

Plymale, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee Industrial Commission.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">{\u00b6 29} The commission\u2019s order is well reasoned and is supported by evidence. The court of appeals upheld that order, and we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b240-6\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
