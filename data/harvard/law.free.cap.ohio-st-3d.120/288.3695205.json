We, however, find that respondent also lost a client\u2019s malpractice claim through neglect and inadequate preparation by missing the statute of limitations. Moreover, he intentionally prejudiced his client\u2019s interests by repeatedly missing established deadlines and, in the meantime, canceling his legal-malpractice insurance without warning to her. For these violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility, we suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice for six months, but stay the suspension on remedial conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">{\u00b6 3} Relator, Cuyahoga County Bar Association, charged respondent in a two-count complaint with professional misconduct, including violations of DR 1-104(A) (requiring a lawyer to inform the client \u201cat any time subsequent to the engagement if the lawyer does not maintain professional liability insurance\u201d), 6-101(A)(2) (prohibiting a lawyer from handling a legal matter without adequate preparation under the circumstances), 6-101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from neglecting a legal matter), and 7-101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from intentionally damaging or prejudicing a client during the professional relationship). A panel of the board heard the case, including the parties\u2019 extensive stipulations, found violations of those Disciplinary Rules except for DR 7-101(A)(3), and recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>mended a public reprimand. The board found a violation of only DR 1-104(A) and adopted the panel\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">{\u00b6 4} Neither party has filed objections to the board\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">I. Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">{\u00b6 5} From mid-January 2002 until mid-February 2006, respondent represented Robin Kiefer on a contingent-fee basis in a dental-malpractice case against Mark Domo, D.D.S. Kiefer claimed that she had sustained a neurological injury to her tongue from Dr. Domo\u2019s professional negligence during dental treatment on November 2, 2001. Early on in the representation, respondent advised Kiefer that she was required to file her malpractice claim against Dr. Domo within a one-year statute of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">\n<em>A. The First Complaint Filed on Kiefer\u2019s Behalf</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">{\u00b6 6} On November 1, 2002, one day before the filing deadline, respondent directed a \u201c180-day letter\u201d to Dr. Domo, pursuant to former R.C. 2305.11(B)(1), Sub.S.B. No. 108, 149 Ohio Laws, Part I, 382, 413, thereby extending the time for filing Kiefer\u2019s complaint by six months. Because of the close timing, respondent\u2019s associate hand-delivered the letter to the doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">{\u00b6 7} Respondent did not file Kiefer\u2019s complaint, however, until June 23, 2003, more than one month after the 180-day extension had expired. During the weeks before this late filing, respondent had consulted Kiefer about the missed deadline, telling her that he would try to salvage the claim, and for the rest of 2003, Kiefer\u2019s case remained active on the trial court docket. Then on January 12, 2004, respondent missed another deadline \u2014 the court-ordered date for filing the report of the plaintiffs expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">{\u00b6 8} Respondent moved on Kiefer\u2019s behalf for an extension to file her expert\u2019s report; Dr. Domo\u2019s counsel moved for summary judgment. In March 2004, the trial court denied the motion for the extension as untimely and denied the motion for summary judgment because a factual dispute existed as to whether Kiefer knew or should have known about her injury as of her November 2, 2001 dental appointment. Respondent, doubting that his client could prevail without an expert witness, thereafter voluntarily dismissed Kiefer\u2019s case without prejudice under Civ.R. 41(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">\n<em>B. The Second Complaint Filed on Kiefer\u2019s Behalf</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">{\u00b6 9} Respondent refiled the Kiefer complaint in early May 2004 and this time obtained her expert\u2019s report long before the court-ordered deadline for filing it. On January 31, 2005, however, Domo moved for summary judgment, again asserting that the complaint was time-barred. Respondent missed another deadline when he failed to timely oppose the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>{\u00b6 10} In early March 2005, respondent filed an untimely motion for an extension to respond to the motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied the extension and on March 18, 2005, granted summary judgment for the defense, citing respondent\u2019s failure to file the complaint within the time limit. The trial court also denied respondent\u2019s motions to file instanter his brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment and for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">{\u00b6 11} Respondent appealed on April 15, 2005, still trying to salvage Kiefer\u2019s claim. The appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. As a result, Kiefer lost her claim for damages, not for lack of merit but for an avoidable failure to file the claim on time.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\n<em>C. Respondent\u2019s Explanations for His Neglect and Lack of Preparation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">{\u00b6 12} Respondent advised Kiefer that he had missed the 180-day extension for filing her malpractice claim. He acknowledged having missed that deadline by mistake and through his administrative oversight. Confirming this, respondent\u2019s administrative assistant at the time testified that though respondent had prepared the complaint on time, \u201csomehow it must have [fallen] through the cracks.\u201d Respondent further blamed himself for his failure to file the expert report, although he also cited the expert\u2019s demanding schedule and frequent unavailability.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">{\u00b6 13} Respondent said nothing to Kiefer about dismissing her first case, which the court had already set for trial, or about refiling the complaint. Respondent accepted responsibility for his failure to oppose the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the refiled action but offered a variety of rationalizations. He blamed the overwhelming task of managing his two law offices. He also claimed that as a long-time practitioner in Cuyahoga County, he was accustomed \u201cto things taking a long time and * * * nobody observing deadlines.\u201d Respondent additionally cited his overconfidence, after coming off his earlier success, in being able to again overcome a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">\n<em>D. Respondent\u2019s Lack of Malpractice Insurance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">{\u00b6 14} Respondent ceased representing Kiefer on February 17, 2006, shortly after he apprised Kiefer of the decision of the court of appeals. He did not at any time tell her that he had canceled his malpractice insurance, a claims-made policy, on March 8, 2005, in anticipation of accepting employment as a judge\u2019s law clerk. Without providing notice to either Kiefer or his carrier of her potential claim, respondent canceled his insurance just after he filed his request for an extension to respond to the second defense motion for summary judgment and just before the court granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">{\u00b6 15} When respondent canceled his insurance, he was in Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which he had been in since July 15, 2004. Respondent has not listed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Kiefer as a potential creditor in the bankruptcy. She has since consulted another lawyer, who declined to represent her in a malpractice claim against respondent because respondent had no assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\n<em>E. Disciplinary Rule Violations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">{\u00b6 16} Respondent failed to file Kiefer\u2019s first lawsuit timely, even after barely preserving it with the 180-day extension. He failed to file the plaintiffs expert\u2019s report in a timely fashion or seek an extension before the court-ordered deadline. Respondent also failed to timely oppose the defense\u2019s second motion for summary judgment or to seek an extension within the time prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">{\u00b6 17} These failures, as the panel found, showed lack of adequate preparation and established the neglect prohibited by DR 6-101(A)(2) and 6-101(A)(3). Moreover, respondent\u2019s failure to advise Kiefer that he no longer carried malpractice insurance warranted the findings by the panel and the board that he had violated DR 1-104(A). These failures, however, do not completely cover respondent\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">{\u00b6 18} Respondent repeatedly missed deadlines before and after canceling his malpractice insurance, all the while remaining confident, by his own admission, that he could salvage Kiefer\u2019s case. From the proximity of these events, we conclude that respondent knowingly ignored the odds that his arguments on Kiefer\u2019s behalf might fail, leaving her without any recourse. We therefore find clear and convincing proof that respondent intentionally prejudiced his client and thereby violated DR 7-101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">II. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u2018When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the duties violated and sanctions imposed in similar cases.\u201d <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Mullaney, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 412, 2008-Ohio-4541, 894 N.E.2d 1210, \u00b6 28. \u201cBefore making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u2018BCGD Proc.Reg.\u2019). <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Glatki </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 381, 384, 726 N.E.2d 993.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">{\u00b6 20} We have already discussed how respondent breached ethical duties owed to his client. Though he realized he had neglected and failed to adequately prepare his client\u2019s case, respondent nevertheless canceled his malpractice insurance, a claims-made policy, destroying virtually all of Kiefer\u2019s prospects for recovery. Because of the intentional element of this misconduct, we find <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Norton, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 226, 2007-Ohio-6038, 877 N.E.2d 964, instructive.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b526-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>McCarthy, Lebit, Crystal &amp; Liffman Co. and Richard A. Rabb; and Ellen S. Mandell, Bar Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Norton, </em>the attorney neglected two clients\u2019 cases, failed to advise them that he lacked malpractice insurance, and initially failed to cooperate in the investigation of his misconduct. We found the lawyer in violation of DR 1-104(A) for his failure to disclose his lack of malpractice insurance, DR 6 \u2014 101 (A)(3) for his neglect, DR 7-101(A)(1) for his intentional failure to seek a client\u2019s lawful objectives, DR 7-101(A)(2) for his intentional failure to carry out a contract of professional employment, and DR 2 \u2014 110(A)(2) and (C)(5) for his concomitant failure to properly withdraw. Consistent with cases in which such misconduct resulted largely from poor law-office management, we suspended the lawyer\u2019s license to practice for six months but stayed the suspension on conditions that he take relevant continuing-legal-education (\u201cCLE\u201d) courses and commit no further misconduct during the suspension period. Id., 116 Ohio St.3d 226, 2007-Ohio-6038, 877 N.E.2d 964, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">{\u00b6 22} Respondent\u2019s misconduct is comparable to the wrongdoing in <em>Norton, </em>as are the mitigating and aggravating circumstances of his case. Respondent has expressed remorse and acknowledged wrongdoing, as Norton did. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(d). Norton had no prior disciplinary record, and neither does respondent. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a). And like Norton, respondent has established his good character and reputation apart from the underlying misconduct, by showing, among other things, that he has been a dedicated volunteer for the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program for many years. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(e). Respondent did not mismanage his client\u2019s case for financial gain as did the respondent in <em>Norton, </em>2007-Ohio-6038, \u00b6 22; however, he has apparently made no efforts to compensate Kiefer for her loss, which is an aggravating factor. See'BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(l)(i). Finally, neither respondent nor Norton acted dishonestly, and both later obtained malpractice insurance. See BCGD Proc. Reg. 10(B)(1)(b). We therefore follow <em>Norton </em>and impose the same sanction on respondent as we imposed on the lawyer in <em>Norton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">{\u00b6 23} Respondent is suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months; however, the suspension is stayed on the conditions that respondent (1) complete six hours of CLE in law-office and case-file management and (2) commit no further misconduct during the suspension period. If respondent fails to comply with the conditions of the stay, the stay will be lifted, and respondent will serve the entire six-month suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b526-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AXB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>John Michael Drain Jr., pro se.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
