I think there is a third option between requiring Leach to seek something she does not .believe is necessary and preventing her from doing anything. Based on the reasoning in my dissent in <em>In re Guardianship of Santrucek, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 67, 2008-Ohio-4915, 896 N.E.2d 683, I believe we should allow Leach to appeal because, even though she was not a party below, she was treated as if she were a party (her attorney was allowed to call and examine witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">{\u00b6 3} I believe that we should follow the example of the federal circuit courts and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which often allow nonparties to appeal. <em>In re Orshansky </em>(D.C.App.2002), 804 A.2d 1077, 1090; <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Comm. v. Forex Asset Mgmt., L.L.C. </em>(C.A.5, 2001), 242 F.3d 325, 329; <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Comm. v. Wencke </em>(C.A.9, 1986), 783 F.2d 829, 834-835 (a nonparty may appeal when (1) the party participated in the proceedings below and (2) the equities favor hearing the appeal). See also the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Devlin v. Scardelletti </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 1, 7, 122 S.Ct. 2005, 153 L.Ed.2d 27 (\u201cWe have never * * * restricted the right to appeal to named parties to the htigation\u201d).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b674-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Falke &amp; Dunphy, L.L.C., and Lee C.

Beyoglides Jr., for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">{\u00b6 4} Fortunately, the majority\u2019s ruling does not affect the ultimate outcome of the court of appeals\u2019 decision, since it does not reverse the court of appeals\u2019 decision regarding Richardson\u2019s ability to appeal. Thus, the court of appeals\u2019 determination that the probate court lacked jurisdiction because the ward was not a resident of Ohio at the time the application was granted remains intact.</p>\n<judges id=\"b674-5\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
