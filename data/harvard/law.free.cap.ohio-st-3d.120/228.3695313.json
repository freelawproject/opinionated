Although Aekison advanced other claims in her complaint, the only cause of action at issue in this appeal is her claim for nonmalignant asbestosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">{\u00b6 3} On September 2, 2004, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 292 (\u201cH.B. 292\u201d) became effective. 150 Ohio Laws, Part III, 3970. This legislation extensively revised state laws governing asbestos litigation and was in response to the legislative finding that \u201c[t]he current asbestos personal injury litigation system is unfair and inefficient, imposing a severe burden on litigants and taxpayers alike.\u201d H.B. 292, Section 3(A)(2), 150 Ohio Laws, Part III, 3988.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">{\u00b6 4} Among other sections, this bill enacted R.C. 2307.91 (definitions), 2307.92 (requirements for prima facie showing of physical impairment in certain asbestos claims), and 2307.93 (filing of reports and test results showing physical impairment; dismissals). These provisions establish certain threshold requirements. Among these requirements are that no person shall bring or maintain certain kinds of asbestos claims (including claims alleging a nonmalignant condition) without filing with the court certain qualifying medical evidence of physical impairment, and that such evidence must be supported by the written opinion of a competent medical authority stating that the claimant\u2019s exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing factor to his medical condition. R.C. 2307.92. The claim of any plaintiff who does not file the required preliminary medical evidence and physician\u2019s statement is to be administratively dismissed \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d with the court retaining jurisdiction, meaning that a plaintiff would not be barred from reinstating the claim in the future when and if the plaintiff could meet the threshold evidentiary requirements. R.C. 2307.93(C). The legislation also provides that the threshold evidentiary requirements and administrative-dismissal provision be applied to all asbestos cases pending in Ohio courts, regardless of whether they were filed before or after the effective date of H.B. 292. R.C. 2307.93(A)(2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court determined that the revised asbestos legislation applied to Aekison and that the legislation did not impair any substantive rights so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>violate Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. The trial court also administratively dismissed Ackison\u2019s claims because Ackison had failed to file the statutorily required documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 6} Ackison appealed the trial court\u2019s ruling. The court of appeals reversed and reinstated the case. In its opinion, the court of appeals held that the retroactive application to Ackison\u2019s claim of the H.B. 292 evidentiary requirements was unconstitutional. The court stated that because Ackison\u2019s suit had been filed prior to the effective date of the statutory changes, she had a vested substantive right to pursue recovery for her husband\u2019s illness and death under the statutes that were in effect at the time her complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 7} The court of appeals certified that its decision conflicted with three cases from the Twelfth District Court of Appeals, each of which held that retroactive application of the H.B. 292 standards was not unconstitutional. See <em>Wilson v. AC&amp;S, Inc., </em>169 Ohio App.3d 720, 2006-Ohio-6704, 864 N.E.2d 682; <em>Staley v. AC&amp;S, Inc., </em>Butler App. No. CA2006-06-133, 2006-Ohio-7033, 2006 WL 3833883; and <em>Stahlheber v. Lac D\u2019Amiante Du Quebec, LTEE., </em>Butler App. No. CA200606-134, 2006-Ohio-7034, 2006 WL 3833888.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 8} We accepted jurisdiction and recognized the conflict on the following question: \u201cCan R.C. 2307.91, 2307.92, and 2307.93 be applied to cases already pending on September 2, 2004?\u201d <em>Ackison v. Anchor Packing Co., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 1465, 2007-Ohio-1722, 864 N.E.2d 652, 113 Ohio St.3d 1464, 2007-Ohio-1722, 864 N.E.2d 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">{\u00b6 9} The essential question in this case is whether R.C. 2307.91, 2307.92, and 2307.93 can validly be applied to Ackison\u2019s claims or whether these statutory provisions are unconstitutionally retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">{\u00b6 10} The Ohio Constitution provides that the \u201cgeneral assembly shall have no power to pass retroactive laws * * Section 28, Article II, Constitution. Yet \u201cretroactivity itself is not always forbidden by Ohio law. Though the language of Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution provides that the General Assembly \u2018shall have no power to pass retroactive laws,\u2019 Ohio courts have long recognized that there is a crucial distinction between statutes that merely apply retroactively (or \u2018retrospectively\u2019) and those that do so in a manner that offends our Constitution.\u201d <em>Bielat v. Bielat </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 350, 353, 721 N.E.2d 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">{\u00b6 11} Guided by R.C. 1.48, which provides that a statute is presumed to apply prospectively unless expressly declared to be retroactive, this court has developed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>a two-part inquiry to determine whether a statute is unconstitutionally retroactive. We recently summarized this test as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cFirst, the reviewing court must determine as a thrfeshold matter whether the statute is expressly made retroactive. <em>[State </em>v.] <em>LaSalle, </em>96 Ohio St.3d [178, 2002-Ohio-4009], 772 N.E.2d 1172, citing <em>Van Fossen [v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. </em>(1988) ], 36 Ohio St.3d 100, 522 N.E.2d 489, at paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. The General Assembly\u2019s failure to clearly enunciate retroactivity ends the analysis, and the relevant statute may be applied only prospectively. Id. If a statute is clearly retroactive, though, the reviewing court must then determine whether it is substantive or remedial in nature. <em>LaSalle </em>[96 Ohio St.3d 178, 2002-Ohio-4009], 772 N.E.2d 1172.\u201d <em>State v. Consilio, 114 </em>Ohio St.3d 295, 2007-Ohio-4163, 871 N.E.2d 1167, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 13} In this case, the General Assembly expressly directed that the prima facie filing requirements at issue apply to cases pending on \u2014 and thus filed before \u2014 the effective date of the legislation. R.C. 2307.93(A)(2) and (3). Because the General Assembly so specified, we must next consider \u201cwhether the statute is substantive, rendering it <em>unconstitutionally </em>retroactive, as opposed to merely remedial.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Bielat, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 353, 721 N.E.2d 28, citing <em>State v. Cook </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 404, 410-11, 700 N.E.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 14} In determining whether a statute is substantive or remedial, we have established the following parameters:</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cA statute is \u2018substantive\u2019 if it impairs or takes away vested rights, affects an accrued substantive right, imposes new or additional burdens, duties, obligation[s], or liabilities as to a past transaction, or creates a new right. * * * Conversely, remedial laws are those affecting only the remedy provided, and include laws that merely substitute a new or more appropriate remedy for the enforcement of an existing right.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 411, 700 N.E.2d 570, citing <em>Van Fossen, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 107, 522 N.E.2d 489. \u201cFurther, while we have recognized the occasional substantive effect, we have found that it is generally true that laws that relate to procedures are ordinarily remedial in nature.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">{\u00b6 16} We have previously concluded that R.C. 2307.92 and 2307.93 \u201cdo not relate to the rights and duties that give rise to this cause of action or otherwise make it more difficult for a claimant to succeed on the merits of a claim. Rather, they pertain to the machinery for carrying on a suit. They are therefore procedural in nature, not substantive.\u201d <em>Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Bogle, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 455, 2007-Ohio-5248, 875 N.E.2d 919, \u00b6 17. We reiterate today that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>requirements in R.C. 2307.92 and 2307.93 are remedial and procedural in nature and are, therefore, not unconstitutionally retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">{\u00b6 17} As we have previously recognized, these two statutes establish \u201ca procedural prioritization\u201d of asbestos-related cases. Id. at \u00b6 16. \u201cSimply put, these statutes create a procedure to prioritize the administration and resolution of a cause of action that already exists. No new substantive burdens are placed on claimants * * *.\u201d Id. Instead, the enactments \u201cmerely substitute a new or more appropriate remedy for the enforcement of an existing right.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 411, 700 N.E.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">{\u00b6 18} Despite our conclusions in <em>Bogle, </em>Ackison argues that various provisions of H.B. 292 are unconstitutional as applied to her claim because they impair vested rights and affect accrued substantive rights by altering substantive common-law rules pertaining to asbestos claims. Because Ackison asserts an \u201cas applied\u201d challenge to the statute, she \u201cbears the burden of presenting clear and convincing evidence of a presently existing set of facts that make the statutes unconstitutional and void when applied to those facts.\u201d <em>Groch v. Gen. Motors Corp., 117 </em>Ohio St.3d 192, 2008-Ohio-546, 883 N.E.2d 377, \u00b6 181, citing <em>Harrold v. Collier, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 44, 2005-Ohio-5334, 836 N.E.2d 1165, \u00b6 38, and <em>Belden v. Union Cent. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 329, 28 O.O. 295, 55 N.E.2d 629, paragraph six of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 19} Ackison\u2019s chief argument in this regard is that before the enactment of H.B. 292, asbestos-related conditions were compensable under Ohio law when there was merely an alteration of the lungs (such as pleural thickening), irrespective of whether any impairment or disease had developed. Assuming for purposes of argument that the common law can be sufficiently settled to give rise to a vested right to its application, we must find, in order to accept her argument, that common-law liability existed in Ohio for asymptomatic pleural thickening at the time Ackison\u2019s claim was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">{\u00b6 20} Before the enactment of H.B. 292, there was no statewide standard for what constituted an \u201cinjury\u201d giving rise to an asbestos claim. Indeed, this court did not address that question when it reviewed former R.C. 2305.10 with respect to when an asbestos claim accrues. <em>O\u2019Stricker v. Jim Walter Corp. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 84, 4 OBR 335, 447 N.E.2d 727. Although this court held in <em>O\u2019Stricker </em>that an asbestos plaintiffs cause of action arises \u201cupon the date on which the plaintiff is informed by competent medical authority that he has been injured, or upon the date on which, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, he should have become aware that he had been injured, whichever date occurs first,\u201d id. at 91, 4 OBR 335, 447 N.E.2d 727, the court did not define what constitutes an injury in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>asbestos-exposure claim. Only two Ohio appellate court decisions address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Verbryke v. Owens-Coming Fiberglas Corp. </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 388, 616 N.E.2d 1162, the Sixth District Court of Appeals stated that \u201cpleural plaque or pleural thickening is an alteration to the lining of the lung. Accordingly, pleural plaque or thickening meets the definition of \u2018bodily harm,\u2019 which is a subspecies of \u2018physical harm\u2019 and thus satisfies the injury requirements of Sections 388 and 402A of the Restatement [of the Law 2d, Torts (1965)].\u201d Id. at 395, 616 N.E.2d 1162. This principle was later cited approvingly by the Eight District Court of Appeals in <em>In re Cuyahoga Cty. Asbestos Cases </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 358, 364, 713 N.E.2d 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 22} The <em>Verbryke </em>court\u2019s analysis was predicated upon a reading of several sections of the Restatement of Torts together (Sections 388, 402A, 7, and 15), with the conclusion that impairment to the body consists of an \u201calteration to the structure of the body even though no other harm is caused.\u201d <em>Verbryke, </em>84 Ohio App.3d at 395, 616 N.E.2d 1162 (citing Comment a to Section 15 of the Restatement). In doing so, the <em>Verbryke </em>court rejected the analysis of a Maryland court that reached the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Armstrong </em>(1991), 87 Md.App. 699, 591 A.2d 544, reversed in part on other grounds (1992), 326 Md. 107, 604 A.2d 47, the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland held that the Restatement did not support the conclusion that pleural plaque and pleural thickening alone were sufficient to constitute harm. Id. at 732-735, 591 A.2d 544. The Maryland court noted that Section 15 of the Restatement was inapposite \u201cbecause it broadly defines bodily harm only in the context of an action based on the intentional tort of battery.\u201d Id. at 735, 591 A.2d 544. Indeed, Section 15 of the Restatement relates to harm caused by intentional torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">{\u00b6 24} We determine that the Maryland court\u2019s approach is the better-reasoned one. The <em>Verbryke </em>court\u2019s incorporation of Section 15 into its chain of logic incorrectly imputed intentional-tort principles into an analysis of negligence. Thus, the <em>Verbryke </em>decision is based upon a faulty interpretation of the Restatement \u2014 an interpretation that also has been rejected by courts in other states. In fact, the latest draft of the Restatement offers the following comment to Section 4, which defines physical harm: \u201c \u2018Bodily harm\u2019 is employed to mean <em>physical impairment </em>to the human body and includes physical injury, illness, disease, and death.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Proposed Final Draft No. 1, Restatement of the Law 3d, Torts (Apr. 6, 2005), Section 4, Comment a. A Reporter\u2019s Note contains the following discussion specifically related to asbestos claims:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cAn unfortunate and aberrational exception to the [general tendency] of small or trivial harms [to remain unlitigated] explained in this Comment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>asbestos claims by plaintiffs who suffer no clinical symptoms but who have abnormal lung X-rays, a condition known as pleural plaque. These claims exist only because of the massive number of such claimants and the efficiencies of aggregating such claims to make them economically viable for litigation. Some courts have responded by requiring that an asbestos plaintiff prove the existence of clinical symptoms before sufficient bodily injury exists. See, e.g., <em>In re Haw. Fed. Asbestos Cases, </em>734 F.Supp. 1563 (D.Haw.1990) (pleural plaque does not constitute legally cognizable injury); <em>Owens-Ill. v. Armstrong, </em>87 Md.App. 699, 591 A.2d 544 (1991) (pleural scarring does not entail physical harm that is compensable in tort), affd in relevant part, 326 Md. 107, 604 A.2d 47 (1992); <em>Giffear v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>429 Pa.Super. 327, 632 A.2d 880 (1993) (pleural plaque is not a legally cognizable injury). * * * But see <em>Gideon v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>761 F.2d 1129 (5th Cir.1985) (applying Texas law) (cause of action accrued when plaintiff suffered pleural plaque).\u201d Reporter\u2019s Note, Tentative Draft, Restatement of Torts 3d, Section 4, Comment c.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 26} The <em>Verbryke </em>court\u2019s holding that pleural thickening alone is sufficient to constitute an injury was not the common law of this state such that Ackison had a vested right to its application in her case. This court has never held that asymptomatic pleural thickening is, by itself, sufficient to establish a compensable injury for asbestos exposure. <em>Verbryke </em>and <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Asbestos Cases, </em>127 Ohio App.3d 358, 713 N.E.2d 20, are the only two appellate decisions that have addressed the issue in Ohio, but those decisions rest on a misreading of the Restatement. Accordingly, we conclude that Ackison has not established that the settled common law in Ohio permitted tort recovery for asymptomatic pleural thickening in asbestos exposure cases prior to the enactment of H.B. 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 27} Moreover, with respect to this case specifically, although there was evidence of pleural thickening in Mr. Ackison\u2019s lungs, he had not been diagnosed with any asbestos-related illness or impairment. The provisions of H.B. 292 at issue here did not prevent Ackison from pursuing her claim. Although the legislation caused a hold to be placed on the claim, the hold did not by itself extinguish the claim. Thus, Ackison has failed to carry her burden of proving that the statute was unconstitutional and void when applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">{\u00b6 28} Ackison\u2019s remaining arguments generally relate to the definition of certain terms in R.C. 2307.91, as enacted by H.B. 292. First, Ackison claims that the definition of \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d contained in R.C. 2307.91(Z) substantively alters evidentiary requirements for asbestos claims. (See Appendix for text of R.C. 2307.91(Z).)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>{\u00b6 29} Before the enactment of R.C. 2307.91, the term \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d was not defined by either statute or case law. By choosing to define that term, the legislature did not take away Ackison\u2019s right to pursue her claim. Nor did the definition alter the quantum of proof necessary for a plaintiff to prevail in an asbestos-related claim. Rather, it merely defined the procedural framework by which trial courts are to adjudicate such claims. The definition of competent medical authority pertains to the witness\u2019s competence to testify and is, in essence, more akin to a rule of evidence. As such, it is procedural in nature. Compare <em>Denicola v. Providence Hosp. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 115, 11 O.O.3d 290, 387 N.E.2d 231 (new statute defining qualifications of expert witnesses in a medical claim is procedural rather than substantive). Therefore, the definition does not alter a vested substantive right possessed by Ackison; she did not have a vested right to have the undefined term remain undefined.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">{\u00b6 30} Second, Ackison contends that the statutory changes affected her accrued substantive rights in that they altered the substantive elements of causation that must be established to recover on a claim. Specifically, Ackison takes exception to the requirement in R.C. 2307.92 that a claimant provide prima facie evidence that the claimant\u2019s exposure to asbestos was a \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d to the claimant\u2019s medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">{\u00b6 31} R.C. 2307.91(FF) defines \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c \u2018Substantial contributing factor\u2019 means both of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(1) Exposure to asbestos is the predominate cause of the physical impairment alleged in the asbestos claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(2) A competent medical authority has determined with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that without the asbestos exposures the physical impairment of the exposed person would not have occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">{\u00b6 35} Ackison contends that the requirement that exposure to asbestos be the \u201cpredominate cause\u201d of the alleged impairment is a departure from the common-law standard for proximate cause in tort. Specifically, Ackison contends that the General Assembly\u2019s choice of the word \u201cpredominate\u201d requires a plaintiff to prove that all other potential causes of injury are insignificant, thereby altering the common-law standard for proximate causation in asbestos claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">{\u00b6 36} The General Assembly\u2019s choice of the word \u201cpredominate\u201d in R.C. 2307.91(FF)(1) is indeed perplexing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The word \u201cpredominate\u201d is a verb, but it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>used in that subsection as an adjective. As a result, it is susceptible of more than one meaning and is therefore ambiguous. \u201c \u2018The object of judicial investigation in the construction of a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the law-making body which enacted it.\u2019 <em>Slingluff v. Weaver </em>(1902), 66 Ohio St. 621, 64 N.E. 574, paragraph one of the syllabus. This court may engage in statutory interpretation when the statute under review is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Tomasik v. Tomasik, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 481, 2006-Ohio-6109, 857 N.E.2d 127, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">{\u00b6 37} In construing such a statute, we are guided by the principles of construction found in R.C. 1.49, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cIf a statute is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention of the legislature, may consider among other matters:</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c(A) The object sought to be attained;</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c(B) The circumstances under which the statute was enacted;</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c(C) The legislative history;</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c(D) The common law or former statutory provisions, including laws upon the same or similar subjects;</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c(E) The consequences of a particular construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">{\u00b6 44} Following these principles, we observe that one possible construction of the word \u201cpredominate\u201d is the adjective \u201cpredominant,\u201d which is an apparent variation. See Bryan A. Garner, A Dictionary of Modem Legal Usage (2d Ed. 1995) 682.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But interpreting the term in that way would alter the common-law element of proximate causation and render the statute unconstitutionally retroactive in this case. R.C. 1.47 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cIn enacting a statute, it is presumed that:</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c(A) Compliance with the constitutions of the state and of the United States is intended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">{\u00b6 47} Accordingly, we will not construe the term predominate, as used in R.C. 2307.91(FF)(1), to mean predominant. Doing so would render the provision unconstitutionally retroactive, contrary to the guideline in R.C. 1.47(A). Furthermore, we observe that the General Assembly, in enacting this comprehensive reform legislation, was careful to make substantive changes prospective only. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>See, e.g., R.C. 2307.96(C). Thus, it does not appear to us that the General Assembly intended a substantive change by using the term \u201cpredominate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">{\u00b6 48} Rather than impose a construction that results in unconstitutional application, we construe the statute to be consistent with the common law. The phrase \u201cpredominate cause\u201d contained in R.C. 2307.91(FF)(1) must be read in pari materia with R.C. 2307.91(FF)(2) because both are elements of the statutory definition of \u201csubstantial contributing factor.\u201d R.C. 2307.91(FF)(2) requires that a competent medical authority determine that \u201cwithout the asbestos exposures the physical impairment of the exposed person would not have occurred.\u201d This requirement is, in essence, a \u201cbut for\u201d test of causation, which is the standard test for establishing cause in fact. See <em>Anderson v. St. Francis</em>\u2014St. <em>George Hosp., Inc. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 82, 84-85, 671 N.E.2d 225. Cause in fact is distinct from proximate, or legal, cause. Once cause in fact is established, a plaintiff then must establish proximate cause in order to hold a defendant liable. See id. at 86, 671 N.E.2d 225, citing Prosser &amp; Keeton, Law of Torts (5 Ed.1984) 265-266. See also Prosser <em>&amp; </em>Keeton, id., at 272-273.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">{\u00b6 49} When R.C. 2307.91(FF)(1) and (2) are read in pari materia, it appears that the two subsections were intended to require that asbestos exposure be a significant, direct cause of the injury to the degree that without the exposure to asbestos, the injury would not have occurred. Thus, the statute reflects the common-law requirement that asbestos exposure be both a cause in fact and the direct cause of the plaintiffs illness. This is an embodiment of the common law, not an alteration of it. Because we hold that R.C. 2307.91(FF) does not alter the common law that existed at the time Ackison filed her claim, the statute is not unconstitutionally retroactive and may be applied to her pending claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">{\u00b6 50} Ackison also contends that R.C. 2307.91(FF) alters the standard of causation for asbestos-exposure cases specifically, as established in <em>Horton v. Harwick Chem. Corp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 679, 653 N.E.2d 1196. We disagree. <em>Horton </em>addressed a multidefendant situation, in which the issue was the degree of exposure to the product of a particular defendant that the plaintiff must prove to avoid summary judgment. We held that in such a multidefendant asbestos case, the plaintiff has the burden of proving both exposure to each defendant\u2019s product and that the product was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in causing the plaintiffs injury. Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. We further held that in proving that the product was a substantial factor in causing his injury, the plaintiff \u201cneed not prove that he was exposed to a specific product on a regular basis over some extended period of time in close proximity to where the plaintiff actually worked.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus (declining to follow <em>Lohrmann v. Pittsburgh Coming Corp. </em>(C.A.4, 1986), 782 F.2d 1156).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>{\u00b6 51} However, <em>Horton </em>did not address the issue here, which is whether exposure to asbestos was \u201cthe predominate cause of the physical impairment\u201d without which \u201cthe physical impairment * * * would not have occurred.\u201d R.C. 2307.91(FF). The <em>Horton </em>inquiry, rather, pertained to determining which exposure to a particular defendant\u2019s asbestos-containing product, in a case involving multiple defendants, was sufficient to hold that defendant legally responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">{\u00b6 52} Consequently, there is no inconsistency between R.C. 2307.91(FF) and the substantive law as set forth in <em>Horton. </em>The provisions of H.B. 292 at issue address only the prima facie showing of whether a plaintiffs claimed injuries are genuinely asbestos-related. The provisions do not involve the more detailed inquiry of whether a <em>particular </em>defendant\u2019s product is the cause of the plaintiffs illness. The definition of \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d does not alter the proof necessary to establish particular causation by a particular defendant when the trier of fact reviews the merits of a claim. Therefore, the definition does not affect accrued substantive rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">{\u00b6 53} Finally, Aekison takes exception to the definition of the term \u201csubstantial occupational exposure\u201d contained in R.C. 2307.91(GG), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">{\u00b6 54} \u201c \u2018Substantial occupational exposure to asbestos\u2019 means employment for a cumulative period of at least five years in an industry and an occupation in which, for a substantial portion of a normal work year for that occupation, the exposed person did any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c(1) Handled raw asbestos fibers;</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c(2) Fabricated asbestos-containing products so that the person was exposed to raw asbestos fibers in the fabrication process;</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c(3) Altered, repaired, or otherwise worked with an asbestos-containing product in a manner that exposed the person on a regular basis to asbestos fibers;</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c(4) Worked in close proximity to other workers engaged in any of the activities described in division (GG)(1), (2), or (3) of this section in a manner that exposed the person on a regular basis to asbestos fibers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">{\u00b6 59} Aekison argues that the statutory definition of \u201csubstantial occupational exposure\u201d is a legislative attempt to adopt the so-called <em>Lohrmann </em>test, 782 F.2d 1156, which this court specifically rejected in <em>Horton. </em>If this claim is true, then the provision could not be retroactively applied without offending the Constitution. Aekison fails to demonstrate how this definition affects her claim. The requirement of showing \u201csubstantial occupational exposure\u201d applies only to claims alleging lung cancer caused by exposure to asbestos when the victim is a smoker and to wrongful-death claims, neither of which is the case here. See R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>2307.92(C)(1)(c)(i) and (D)(1)(c)(i). In any event, we disagree that the definition is an adoption of the <em>Lohrmann </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">{\u00b6 60} The <em>Lohrmann </em>test was specifically directed at the merits of an asbestos claim. In sum, it holds that in order to establish causation, \u201cthere must be evidence of exposure to a specific product on a regular basis over some extended period of time in proximity to where the plaintiff actually worked.\u201d <em>Lohrmann, </em>782 F.2d at 1162-1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 61} While H.B. 292 defined the term \u201csubstantial occupational exposure\u201d in R.C. 2307.91(GG), the bill simultaneously enacted R.C. 2307.96. The latter provision legislatively adopted the <em>Lohrmann </em>test as a <em>substantive </em>requirement for proving an asbestos-related claim. R.C. 2307.96(B); H.B. 292, Section 5, 150 Ohio Laws, Part III, 3992-3993. The General Assembly expressly acknowledged that its specific intent was to adopt the <em>Lohrmann </em>test and that doing so was contrary to our syllabus language in <em>Horton. </em>Id. Consequently, the General Assembly explicitly made that provision prospective only, reflecting the substantive nature of the change. R.C. 2307.96(C). Because the General Assembly confined its adoption of the <em>Lohrmann </em>test to the prospective provisions of R.C. 2307.96, we cannot conclude that its simultaneous adoption of R.C. 2307.91(GG) was substantive in nature. The definition, as it relates to the \u201cprocedural prioritization\u201d of asbestos claims, <em>Bogle, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 455, 2007-Ohio-5248, 875 N.E.2d 919, \u00b6 16, does not alter the substantive law of causation in the same vein as the adoption of R.C. 2307.96. We conclude that R.C. 2307.91(GG) is consistent with common law and not unconstitutionally retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">{\u00b6 62} For the reasons expressed herein, we hold that the requirements in R.C. 2307.91, 2307.92, and 2307.93 pertaining to asbestos-exposure claims are remedial and procedural and may be applied without offending the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution to cases pending on September 2, 2004. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b473-10\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b473-11\">Moyer, C.J., dissents without opinion.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b473-12\">Pfeifer, J., dissents with opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-12\">. The phrase \u201cpredominate cause\u201d is not a phrase common to Ohio law.

Do one man\u2019s injuries matter in the midst of a crusade?</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">{\u00b6 64} The General Assembly, deciding that a crisis existed in Ohio regarding the administration of claims for alleged injuries caused by exposure to asbestos, radically changed the nature of asbestos litigation with 2003 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 292, 150 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3970 (\u201cH.B. 292\u201d). In <em>Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Bogle, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 455, 2007-Ohio-5248, 875 N.E.2d 919, \u00b6 2, this court set forth the General Assembly\u2019s stated motivation behind the bill:</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cBased on its belief that \u2018[t]he current asbestos personal injury litigation system is unfair and inefficient, imposing a severe burden on litigants and taxpayers alike,\u2019 the General Assembly enacted H.B. 292. H.B. 292, Section 3(A)(2), 150 Ohio Laws, Part III, 3970, 3988. By the end of 2000, \u2018over six hundred thousand people [had] filed asbestos claims\u2019 nationwide, and Ohio had \u2018become a haven for asbestos claims and, as a result, is one of the top five state court venues for asbestos filings.\u2019 Id. at Section 3(A)(3)(a) and (b), 150 Ohio Laws, Part III, 3989. The General Assembly further noted that in Cuyahoga County alone, the asbestos docket increased from approximately 12,800 cases in 1999 to over 39,000 cases by October 2003. Id. at Section 3(A)(3)(e), 150 Ohio Laws, Part III, 3989. Eighty-nine percent of claimants do not allege that they suffer from cancer, and \u2018[s]ixty-six to ninety per cent of these non-cancer claimants are not sick.\u2019 Id. at Section 3(A)(5), 150 Ohio Laws, Part III, 3990.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">{\u00b6 66} That Ohio is in the \u201ctop five\u201d of claims filed should not be surprising: Ohio was in the top five most populous states from the start of World War II until the 1970 census (and was seventh in the 2000 census) and has historically been a center for industry. Nonetheless, the General Assembly has declared a crisis, and since the crisis lies in the number of cases pending in Ohio courts, the crisis cannot be lessened unless the number of pending cases is dramatically reduced. The crisis cannot go away unless cases go away, unless people go away. The people who must go away include plaintiffs with cases that were viable before September 4, 2004; H.B. 292 requires it. But this court does not have to let it happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">{\u00b6 67} H.B. 292 changes the law so that people who had viable claims before its passage no longer have viable claims afterward. It achieves its end by changing the substance of what constitutes a valid injury, altering the nature of the medical proof necessary to prove a claim, modifying what constitutes causation in an asbestos-exposure claim, and essentially overruling this court in establishing new requirements for the extent of exposure to asbestos that is necessary to prove a claim. There is no way around it: H.B. 292 places new, substantive burdens on people with asbestos-exposure claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>{\u00b6 68} The General Assembly, at least, offered a lifeline to claimants whose cause of action arose before the date of the passage of H.B. 292. Pursuant to R.C. 2307.93(A)(3), the requirements of H.B. 292 do not apply if they impair the substantive rights of the plaintiff and that impairment \u201cis otherwise in violation of Section 28 of Article II, Ohio Constitution.\u201d The majority, however, cuts that lifeline today for all plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">{\u00b6 69} The scapegoat of H.B. 292 is the injury generally known as pleural thickening, an alteration to the lining of the lungs that can be asymptomatic. Claimants with this injury are part of the so-called \u201c \u2018[sjixty-six to ninety per cent [of claimants who] are <em>not </em>sick.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Bogle, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 455, 2007-Ohio-5248, 875 N.E.2d 919, at \u00b6 2, quoting H.B. 292, Section 3(A)(5), 150 Ohio Laws, Part III, 3990. Contrary to the General Assembly\u2019s and the majority\u2019s characterization, however, in Ohio, a person who has suffered an alteration to the lining of his lungs is indeed sick. In Cuyahoga County, where 39,000 cases were pending when H.B. 292 was enacted, the Eighth District Court of Appeals court held over a decade ago that \u201cin Ohio the asbestos-related pleural thickening or pleural plaque, which is an alteration to the lining of the lung, constitutes physical harm, and as such satisfies the injury requirement for a cause of action for negligent failure to warn or for a strict products liability claim, even if no other harm is caused by asbestos.\u201d <em>In re Cuyahoga Cty. Asbestos Cases </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 358, 364, 713 N.E.2d 20. That holding is no trifle \u2014 it is the law in the Ohio appellate district where the vast majority of asbestos cases are litigated, it was never appealed to this court, and no Ohio appellate court has ever held differently. The court in <em>In re Cuyahoga Cty. Asbestos Cases </em>also held that plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cknowledge that they possess nondysfunc-tional asbestos-related changes in their lungs places them on sufficient notice to start running the statute of limitations time-clock.\u201d 127 Ohio App.3d at 364-365, 713 N.E.2d 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">{\u00b6 70} The alleged litigation crisis exists because Ohio <em>has </em>recognized that asbestos-related pleural thickening is an injury and had recognized it as an injury when Ackison was first diagnosed in 2000, when he died in 2003, and when his estate filed its lawsuit in April 2004. But the only way for H.B. 292 to alleviate the asbestos litigation crisis is not only to stop recognizing pleural thickening as an injury, but to declare that it was not an injury after people like Ackison had already sought redress for it. H.B. 292 stepped back in time, requiring certain claimants with matters pending on the effective date of the statute to establish a prima facie showing that the claimant suffered from a <em>newly defined </em>injury. That injury found its basis in tests and procedures that plaintiffs of Danny Ackison\u2019s era had no reason to undergo.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>{\u00b6 71} After the enactment of H.B. 292, a plaintiff who seeks compensation for previously recognized nonmalignant injuries from asbestos exposure is required to provide the trial court with very specific and detailed information, above and beyond anything previously required. That information is not designed for those plaintiffs to prove the injury for which they have already sued, but to prove a <em>different </em>injury. Specifically, R.C. 2307.92(B) requires that a prima facie showing shall include all of the following minimum requirements:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 72} \u201c(3) A diagnosis by a competent medical authority, based on a medical examination and pulmonary function testing of the exposed person, that all of the following apply to the exposed person:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">{\u00b6 73} \u201c(a) The exposed person has a permanent respiratory impairment rating of at least class 2 as defined by and evaluated pursuant to the AMA guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">{\u00b6 74} \u201c(b) Either of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">{\u00b6 75} \u201c(i) The exposed person has asbestosis or diffuse pleural thickening, based at a minimum on radiological or pathological evidence of asbestosis or radiological evidence of diffuse pleural thickening. The asbestosis or diffuse pleural thickening described in this division, rather than solely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a substantial contributing factor to the exposed person\u2019s physical impairment, based at a minimum on a determination that the exposed person has any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">{\u00b6 76} \u201c(I) A forced vital capacity below the predicted lower limit of normal and a ratio of FEV1 to FVC that is equal to or greater than the predicted lower limit of normal;</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">{\u00b6 77} \u201c(II) A total lung capacity, by plethysmography or timed gas dilution, below the predicted lower limit of normal;</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">{\u00b6 78} \u201c(III) A chest x-ray showing small, irregular opacities (s, t) graded by a certified B-reader at least 2/1 on the ILO scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">{\u00b6 79} \u201c(ii) If the exposed person has a chest x-ray showing small, irregular opacities (s, t) graded by a certified B-reader as only a 1/0 on the ILO scale, then in order to establish that the exposed person has asbestosis, rather than solely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, that is a substantial contributing factor to the exposed person\u2019s physical impairment the plaintiff must establish that the exposed person has both of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">{\u00b6 80} \u201c(I) A forced vital capacity below the predicted lower limit of normal and a ratio of FEV1 to FVC that is equal to or greater than the predicted lower limit of normal;</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">{\u00b6 81} \u201c(II) A total lung capacity, by plethysmography or timed gas dilution, below the predicted lower limit of normal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>{\u00b6 82} When Ackison\u2019s widow filed her claim, there was no requirement that her husband have \u201ca permanent respiratory impairment rating of at least a class 2 as defined by and evaluated pursuant to AMA guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment.\u201d But under H.B. 292, any claimant with nonmalignant asbestos-related disease whose impairment does not reach the class 2 stage as defined by the AMA guides has his claim administratively dismissed. R.C. 2307.93(A)(3)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 83} Prior to H.B. 292, a plaintiff would have to prove that he was exposed to the product, that the product injured him, and that those injuries affected his life. Was that an unreasonable standard? Or is it a standard that we would place on any plaintiff for any injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 84} The majority writes that in Ackison\u2019s case, \u201c[although the legislation caused a hold to be placed on the claim, the hold did not by itself extinguish the claim.\u201d True. But claimants like Danny Ackison will not get a chance to avail themselves of R.C. 2307.93(A)(3)(c)\u2019s \u201ccome back when you\u2019re sicker\u201d provision. Danny Ackison will not be getting sicker. And he will never have the opportunity to vindicate his rights that existed on the day he learned that his workplace exposure to asbestos had made him sick. H.B. 292 established that Ackison\u2019s compensable harm was no longer a compensable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Competent Mledical Authority</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">{\u00b6 85} The majority claims that the term \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d was not defined by either statute or case law before the enactment of R.C. 2307.91. The majority writes that \u201c[b]y choosing to define that term, the legislature did not take away Ackison\u2019s [executor\u2019s] right to pursue her claim. Nor did the definition alter the quantum of proof necessary for a plaintiff to prevail in an asbestos-related claim. Rather, it merely defined the procedural framework by which trial courts are to adjudicate such claims.\u201d That is a bit like saying that the Blitzkrieg was merely Germany\u2019s way to define its border with Poland.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">{\u00b6 86} The definition of \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d adds requirements for proof of an injury. The majority does not set forth these specific requirements in its opinion, allowing it to more easily make the statement \u201cThe definition of competent medical authority pertains to the witness\u2019s competence to testify and is, in essence, more akin to a rule of evidence.\u201d R.C. 2307.91(Z) provides that a \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d must meet the following requirements:</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">{\u00b6 87} \u201c(1) The medical doctor is a board-certified internist, pulmonary specialist, oncologist, pathologist, or occupational medicine specialist.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">{\u00b6 88} \u201c(2) The medical doctor is actually treating or has treated the exposed person and has or had a doctor-patient relationship with the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>{\u00b6 89} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">{\u00b6 90} \u201c(4) The medical doctor spends not more than twenty-five percent of the medical doctor\u2019s professional practice time in providing consulting or expert services in connection with actual or potential tort actions, and the medical doctor\u2019s medical group, professional corporation, clinic, or other affiliated group earns not more than twenty percent of its revenues from providing those services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">{\u00b6 91} R.C. 2307.91(Z) has nothing to do with the <em>competence </em>of physicians to testify, as a rule of evidence might. No matter the expertise or experience of the doctor, if the doctor is not the claimant\u2019s treating physician, or if he makes too much money consulting with tort victims, he may not testify on behalf of the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">{\u00b6 92} R.C. 2307.91(Z) is a special rule for asbestos plaintiffs only and is designed to attack the way their cases are brought. It changes the type of evidence necessary to prosecute a claim. It requires Danny Ackison, <em>a dead man, </em>to find an internist, pulmonary specialist, oncologist, pathologist, or occupational medicine specialist to become his <em>treating </em>physician. Without that relationship, there is no claim. No statute or rule of evidence anywhere approaching that kind of evidentiary requirement existed at the time Ackison filed his claim. It adds an element to proving a claim that for Ackison is impossible to achieve. That requirement kills his cause of action by redefining it into oblivion.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Substantial Contributing Factor</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">{\u00b6 93} R.C. 2307.92 requires a claimant to provide prima facie evidence that the claimant\u2019s exposure to asbestos was a \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d to the claimant\u2019s medical condition; R.C. 2307.91(FF) defines \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d as including both of the following factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">{\u00b6 94} \u201c(1) Exposure to asbestos is the predominate cause of the physical impairment alleged in the asbestos claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">{\u00b6 95} \u201c(2) A competent medical authority has determined with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that without the asbestos exposures the physical impairment of the exposed person would not have occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">{\u00b6 96} The majority saves the General Assembly from itself, finding that interpreting the term \u201cpredominate cause\u201d in the way the General Assembly obviously intended \u201cwould alter the common-law element of proximate causation and render the statute unconstitutionally retroactive in this case.\u201d The General Assembly could not have meant to do <em>that, </em>the majority concludes. Latching on to the idea that the grammatically shaky word \u201cpredominate\u201d might or might not mean \u201cpredominant,\u201d the majority finds that the word is ambiguous and decides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>to interpret the statute in a manner \u201cconsistent with the common law.\u201d To do so, it excises \u201cpredominate\u201d from the statute:</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">{\u00b6 97} \u201c[W]e observe that the General Assembly, in enacting this comprehensive reform legislation, was careful to make substantive changes prospective only. * * * Thus, it does not appear that the General Assembly intended a substantive change by using the term \u2018predominate.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">{\u00b6 98} So much for the vital skepticism underlying the separation of powers. The majority imputes constitutional motives to the General Assembly even though the General Assembly\u2019s true motives were revealed in the language the majority has seen fit to remove. I would find R.C. 2307.91(FF) unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Substantial Occupational Exposure</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">{\u00b6 99} The majority is correct that the term \u201csubstantial occupational exposure\u201d in R.C. 2307.91(GG) applies only to lung cancer claims brought either by wrongful-death claimants or by claimants who smoked. Instead of ignoring the definition of \u201csubstantial occupational exposure\u201d as irrelevant to this cause of action, however, the majority grants the phrase its imprimatur.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">{\u00b6 100} R.C. 2307.91(GG) sets forth specific requirements for the claimant\u2019s length of exposure to asbestos and the types of exposure necessary to state a claim:</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">{\u00b6 101} \u201c(GG) \u2018Substantial occupational exposure to asbestos\u2019 means employment for a cumulative period of at least five years in an industry and an occupation in which, for a substantial portion of a normal work year for that occupation, the exposed person did any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">{\u00b6 102} \u201c(1) Handled raw asbestos fibers;</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">{\u00b6 103} \u201c(2) Fabricated asbestos-containing products so that the person was exposed to raw asbestos fibers in the fabrication process;</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">{\u00b6 104} \u201c(3) Altered, repaired, or otherwise worked with an asbestos-containing product in a manner that exposed the person on a regular basis to asbestos fibers;</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">{\u00b6 105} \u201c(4) Worked in close proximity to other workers engaged in any of the activities described in division (GG)(1), (2), or (3) of this section in a manner that exposed the person on a regular basis to asbestos fibers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">{\u00b6 106} This court held in <em>Horton v. Harwick Chem. Corp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 679, 653 N.E.2d 1196, paragraph two of the syllabus, that \u201c[a] plaintiff need not prove that he was exposed to a specific product on a regular basis over some extended period of time in close proximity to where the plaintiff actually worked in order to prove that the product was a substantial factor in causing his injury.\u201d In so holding, we specifically disapproved the test enumerated in <em>Lohrmann v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>Pittsburgh Corning Corp. </em>(C.A.4, 1986), 782 F.2d 1156. \u201cUnder the <em>Lohrmann </em>test, to escape summary judgment a plaintiff must present evidence of \u2018exposure to a specific product on a regular basis over some extended period of time in proximity to where the plaintiff actually worked.\u2019 \u201d <em>Horton, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 681, 653 N.E.2d 1196, quoting <em>Lohrmann, </em>782 F.2d at 1162-1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 107} The majority argues that since the General Assembly did not expressly adopt the <em>Lohrmann </em>test in regard to R.C. 2307.91(GG), the statute did not violate the Constitution. However, the requirements of R.C. 2307.91(GG) are even more stringent than the <em>Lohrmann </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">{\u00b6 108} The majority writes that since the General Assembly made it known that it intended to adopt the <em>Lohrmann </em>test in R.C. 2307.96 and expressly made it prospective in R.C. 2307.96(C), \u201cwe cannot conclude that its simultaneous adoption of R.C. 2307.91(GG) was substantive in nature.\u201d The majority seems to say that R.C. 2307.91(GG) is not substantive because in R.C. 2307.96(C), the General Assembly admitted it was altering a substantive requirement, whereas it did not make such an admission in regard to R.C. 2307.91(GG). In other words, if R.C. 2307.91(GG) were substantive, the General Assembly would surely admit to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 109} But the requirements of R.C. 2307.91(GG) are indeed substantive\u2014 they kick certain plaintiffs out of the courthouse. A claimant cannot make a claim for wrongful death or lung cancer without proving five years of exposure to asbestos. Prior to H.B. 292, there was nothing remotely like that requirement in the law. A person with four and a half years of exposure could state a claim prior to the passage of H.B. 292; now that same person would have no claim. In <em>Horton, </em>this court \u201cdecline[d] to establish a formulaic approach in an area which defies that kind of analysis.\u201d Id., 73 Ohio St.3d at 687, 653 N.E.2d 1196. Today, the majority finds that the General Assembly\u2019s adoption of a formulaic approach does not constitute a substantive change in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">{\u00b6 110} The majority says that a retroactive adoption of the <em>Lohrmann </em>test would be a substantive change. However, R.C. 2307.91(GG) adopts a more stringent version of the <em>Lohrmann </em>test, and the majority calls that change merely procedural. Why? No reason is given.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The Past and Future of Asbestos Litigation in Ohio</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">{\u00b6 111} Appellants submit that there are potentially 200,000 asbestos claimants in Ohio, about a five-fold increase from the time H.B. 292 was passed. Even if this court were to find its retroactive application unconstitutional, H.B. 292 would still be applicable to all of those new cases, and thus the vast majority of all cases. H.B. 292 would not go away.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>{\u00b6 112} Further, could it be that the General Assembly\u2019s declaration of an asbestos-litigation crisis is overblown? This court, speaking through its Chief Justice and senior staff, thought so around the time the bill was passed:</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">{\u00b6 113} \u201cOhio Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas Moyer, in a letter to the bill\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Scott Oelslager, a Canton Republican, said the judicial system was being administered \u2018very efficiently.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">{\u00b6 114} \u201cDoug Stephens, director of the Supreme Court\u2019s judicial services, said asbestos cases are not bogged down.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">{\u00b6 115} \u201c \u2018They do a good job of moving cases through the system,\u2019 Stephens said. We have not received complaints that the asbestos docket is holding anybody up.\u2019 \u201d Brown, Measure Aims to Halt Asbestos-Exposure Suits; Proof-of-Injury Requirement May Clear Half of Cases, Cleveland Plain Dealer (Dec. 12, 2003) Al.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">{\u00b6 116} The fact is that the judicial system on its own, and especially in Cuyahoga County, has found a way to effectively administer asbestos litigation. Prioritization of claims already occurred long before H.B. 292; <em>In re Cuyahoga Cty. Asbestos Cases, </em>decided a decade ago, characterized the trial court\u2019s method of prioritizing of asbestos claims as a \u201ctraditional exercise of the court\u2019s authority to control its docket.\u201d Id., 127 Ohio App.3d at 366, 713 N.E.2d 20. Three visiting judges currently sit in Cuyahoga County to preside over asbestos cases exclusively. There is no reason to believe that the most injured plaintiffs are not getting redress the most swiftly.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">{\u00b6 117} This court\u2019s job in this case is not to fix a crisis declared by the General Assembly; our duty is to determine what is right for Danny Ackison under the Ohio Constitution. Our role in this state is to protect the rights guaranteed by the Constitution, not to guide along what might or might not be a good legislative idea. This court\u2019s complicity with the General Assembly when it violates the Constitution is not judicial restraint; it is doing the work of the legislature from the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">{\u00b6 118} R.C. 2307.91(Z) reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">{\u00b6 119} \u201cCompetent medical authority\u201d means a medical doctor who is providing a diagnosis for purposes of constituting prima-facie evidence of an exposed person\u2019s physical impairment that meets the requirements specified in section 2307.92 of the Revised Code and who meets the following requirements:</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">{\u00b6 120} \u201c(1) The medical doctor is a board-certified internist, pulmonary specialist, oncologist, pathologist, or occupational medicine specialist.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b482-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Motley Rice, L.L.C., and John J.
