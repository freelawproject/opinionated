Appellants Cleveland Clinic Foundation and Fairview Hospital (together, \u201cCCF\u201d) have filed a notice of appeal from an interim order of the BTA dated January 25, 2008. That order denied a portion of CCF\u2019s motion for protective order. Specifically, although the BTA adopted a stipulated confidentiality order between the parties, the BTA declined to rule on the trade-secret status of particular documents. CCF asserts that unless the BTA issues a prehearing ruling that confers trade-secret protection on particular documents, its confidentiality rights may suffer irretrievable loss. The Tax Commissioner has moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, claiming that the interlocutory order is not final and appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">{\u00b6 2} This case involves a claim of tax exemption for real property based on alleged charitable use of the property. R.C. 5709.12(B) and 5709.121. CCF applied to exempt three healthcare facilities. For its Taussig Cancer Center and Fairview Hospital, CCF sought exemption for the 2002 tax year along with remission of taxes for 2001, 1999, and 1998. For the Beachwood Family Health and Surgery Center, CCF sought exemption for the 2004 tax year along with remission of taxes for 2003, 2002, and 2001. The Tax Commissioner granted exemption to the Taussig Center and Fairview Hospital, but denied exemption to the Beachwood facility. The Cleveland Municipal School District Board of Education (\u201cCleveland BOE\u201d) appealed the exemptions that the commissioner had granted, and CCF appealed the denied application. The Cleveland BOE and the Beachwood City School District Board of Education (together, the \u201cschool boards\u201d) pursued extensive written discovery at the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>{\u00b6 3} At issue are interrogatories and document requests served by the school boards that, as the BTA stated, \u201crelat[e] to, inter alia, CCF\u2019s physician and executive compensation, joint ventures, spin-offs, conflicts of interest, pricing and debt collection, and marketing\u201d during the period for which exemption is claimed. <em>Cleveland Clinic Found, v. Levin </em>(Jan. 25, 2008), BTA Nos. 2005-V-1726, 2006-V-99, and 2006-H-117, at 3-4. CCF has claimed that a number of such documents contain or constitute trade secrets protected from disclosure by R.C. 1333.61 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">{\u00b6 4} In the January 25, 2008 interim order, the BTA ruled on a motion to compel and a motion for protective order. Having previously held a hearing that concerned the confidential status of categories of documents, the BTA ordered CCF to produce a large number of the requested documents. To protect confidentiality during discovery, the BTA adopted and reinforced a stipulated confidentiality order to which the school boards and CCF had agreed. The BTA also limited the Tax Commissioner\u2019s access to the documents to the extent that he would decline to sign the stipulated confidentiality order. CCF contests the BTA\u2019s' refusal to make a definitive determination that certain documents are confidential and to order that such documents should be produced under seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">{\u00b6 5} Although the parties analyze the order\u2019s finality and appealability under R.C. 2505.02(B)(4), we have held that the appealability of an interim order of the BTA should be analyzed under R.C. 2505.02(B)(2). <em>Southside Community Dev. Corp. v. Levin, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 1209, 2007-Ohio-6665, 878 N.E.2d 1048, \u00b6 5. As we stated in <em>Southside, </em>quoting R.C. 2505.02(B)(2), an interim order of the BTA is final and appealable if it is an \u201c \u2018order that affects a substantial right.\u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">{\u00b6 6} Furthermore, an order qualifies as one that \u201caffects a substantial right\u201d if it satisfies a two-pronged test. First, the order must implicate \u201ca right\u201d that \u201ca statute [or other law] * * * entitles a person to enforce or protect.\u201d R.C. 2505.02(A)(1). Because the Revised Code at Sections 1333.61 et seq. defines and provides remedies for protecting trade secrets, the BTA order satisfies the first prong of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">{\u00b6 7} More difficult is the analysis under the second prong. An interim order of the BTA qualifies as one that affects a substantial right only when it is an order that \u201c \u2018if not immediately appealable, would foreclose appropriate relief in the future.\u2019 \u201d <em>Southside, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 1209, 2007-Ohio-6665, 878 N.E.2d 1048, \u00b6 7, quoting <em>Bell v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 60, 63, 616 N.E.2d 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>{\u00b6 8} CCF asserts two reasons that the January 25, 2008 order in this case might expose its trade secrets to irretrievable loss. We reject the first but accept the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">{\u00b6 9} First, CCF fears a loss of confidentiality during the discovery process. To be sure, the BTA adopted and reinforced the stipulated confidentiality order of the parties, and that order furnishes various protections that even CCF might regard as sufficient in a case involving only private litigants. The source of CCF\u2019s concern lies in the nature of the school boards as \u201cpublic offices.\u201d Because the school boards are subject to the Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43, CCF fears that they might disclose \u2014 or be compelled to disclose \u2014 the documents obtained through discovery in response to a public-records request.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">{\u00b6 10} We hold that with respect to the protection of documents during the discovery process, the January 25, 2008 interim order is not final and appealable pursuant to R.C. 2505.02(B)(2). That is so because, as all parties have opined, documents that a public office obtains through civil discovery as a litigant do not constitute \u201cpublic records,\u201d at least not during the discovery process. In making this determination, we assume without deciding that such documents would constitute \u201crecords\u201d as defined at R.C. 149.011(G). Given that assumption, documents that a public office obtains as a litigant through discovery will ordinarily qualify as \u201ctrial preparation records\u201d pursuant to R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(g) throughout the discovery phase of the litigation. Accord <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 420, 431-432, 639 N.E.2d 83 (prosecutor\u2019s file that contained \u201cmaterial compiled in anticipation of a specific criminal proceeding or the personal trial preparation of the prosecutor\u201d constituted \u201ctrial preparation records\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">{\u00b6 11} It follows that because those documents are exempt from public-records disclosure during discovery, the public-office litigant is no less bound by the terms of the stipulated confidentiality order than a private litigant would be. Because the BTA adopted the stipulated order that the parties drafted and agreed to, it has afforded a great measure of protection to CCF\u2019s alleged confidentiality rights during the discovery process. As a result, the discovery process presents no threat of a loss of confidentiality that is grave enough to justify an immediate appeal from the January 25, 2008 order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">{\u00b6 12} As a second ground for immediate appeal, CCF states that if discovered documents are introduced as evidence at the BTA hearing, it would have \u201cno remedy,\u201d because CCF \u201ccannot adjourn the hearing to appeal the BTA\u2019s ruling or otherwise shield the documents until an appeal can be taken.\u201d Under this scenario, CCF could ask that documents be sealed if they are offered into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>evidence, but if the BTA refuses, those documents would become public records in the hands of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">{\u00b6 13} We agree that this scenario creates the possibility that confidentiality may be irretrievably lost at the BTA hearing. As a result, the January 25, 2008 interim order, to the extent that it raises such a possibility, constitutes a final and appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2505.02(B)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore accept jurisdiction over this appeal and deny the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">{\u00b6 14} We also find it appropriate to decide CCF\u2019s appeal on its merits without further briefing and argument. Our review of the record and the case law persuades us that under the particular circumstances presented, the BTA has erred by not proceeding with a determination of the trade-secret status of particular documents. CCF has strenuously and consistently sought this remedy, and the BTA held a hearing at which CCF presented evidence on the trade-secret status of particular categories of documents. In the January 25, 2008 order, the BTA acknowledged that \u201cCCF has demonstrated that portions of the requested material may qualify as confidential commercial information * * <em>Cleveland Clinic Found, v. Levin, </em>BTA Nos. 2005-V-1726, 2006-V-99, and 2006-H-117, at 8. Yet the BTA persisted in declaring itself \u201cunwilling to go so far as to seal those documents as trade secrets.\u201d Id. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">{\u00b6 15} Under similar circumstances, two appellate courts have ordered trial courts that they must proceed to rule on the confidential status of documents. See <em>Mulkerin v. Cho, </em>Medina App. No. 07CA007-M, 2007-Ohio-6550, 2007 WL 4292756, \u00b6 3, 5, 7; <em>GZK, Inc. v. Schumaker Ltd. Partnership, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 106, 2006-Ohio-3744, 858 N.E.2d 867, \u00b6 34. Applying the reasoning of these appellate courts, we hold that the BTA has a legal obligation to determine the confidential status of particular documents and to provide appropriate relief, such as sealing the documents, if it finds that the documents qualify as confidential trade secrets. In making that determination, the BTA should consider all the arguments raised, including the question whether CCF, by pursuing its exemption applications, has waived trade-secret protection as to the documents that must be produced in these proceedings. See R.C. 5715.27(G); <em>State ex rel. Allright Parking, Inc. v. Cleveland </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 772, 776, 591 N.E.2d 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">{\u00b6 16} The motion to dismiss is denied. The January 25, 2008 interim order of the BTA is vacated to the extent that the BTA declined to determine the trade-secret status of particular documents, but it otherwise remains in force. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>remand to the BTA for further proceedings, with instructions to (1) determine the trade-secret status of particular documents, (2) determine whether CCF\u2019s pursuit of the exemption applications constitutes a waiver of its trade-secret rights in these proceedings, and (3) afford adequate protection such as the sealing of particular documents, to the extent that trade-secret status has been properly-established and has not been waived.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b802-7\">Jones Day, Stephen G.

R.C. 2605.02(B)(4) refers on its face to a \u201cprovisional remedy\u201d in an \u201caction,\u201d rather than orders issued in a \u201cspecial proceeding.\u201d Because of our disposition of the question of appealability under R.C. 2505.02(B)(2), we need not reach the issue of whether R.C. 2505.02(B)(4) applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b801-9\">. We reject the Tax Commissioner\u2019s contention that CCF should have appealed the April 6, 2007 interim order and that, therefore, this appeal is untimely. Such an appeal would have been premature, because the earlier order preserved the possibility that the BTA might require trade secrets to be produced under seal. See Civ.R. 26(C)(7) (protective order may require that trade-secret information \u201cbe disclosed only in a designated way\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
