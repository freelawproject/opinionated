We hold that App.R. 4(B)(5) does not apply and that an appeal of a juvenile court\u2019s adjudication order of abuse, dependency, or neglect and the award of temporary custody pursuant to R.C. 2151.353(A)(2) must be filed within 30 days of the judgment entry pursuant to App.R. 4(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Case Background</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">{\u00b6 2} On February 6, 2006, appellant, Cuyahoga County Department of Children and Family Services (\u201cCCDCFS\u201d), removed H.F. from the custody of his father, appellee S.F., and filed a complaint for neglect and temporary custody.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Eight days later, CCDCFS filed a separate complaint for abuse, neglect, dependency, and temporary custody of R.F.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The children\u2019s mother did not appear at the adjudication hearing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and appellee admitted the allegations in the amended complaints. The magistrate recommended that H.F. be found neglected, that R.F. be found abused, neglected, and dependent, and that both children be placed in the temporary custody of CCDCFS. The juvenile court considered the matters in May 2006, approved the magistrate\u2019s decisions, placed H.F. and R.F. in temporary custody, and notified appellee of his right to appeal. The order concerning H.F. was entered on June 5, 2006, and the order concerning R.F. was entered on June 7, 2006. No appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">{\u00b6 3} On May 4, 2007, CCDCFS filed motions to modify temporary custody to permanent custody.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court held a hearing on the motions on July 26, 2007; although he was represented by counsel, appellee did not appear. After receiving testimony and reviewing the recommendation of the guardian ad litem, the juvenile court terminated appellee\u2019s parental rights and granted permanent custody to CCDCFS.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">{\u00b6 4} Three days after the juvenile court entered its orders, appellee filed an appeal with the Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals. In his first assignment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>error, appellee contended that when the juvenile court accepted his admission at the February 2006 adjudicatory hearing, the court failed to comply with Juv.R. 29, which requires the court to personally address a party to ascertain whether admissions are made voluntarily and with an understanding of the rights being relinquished. In opposition, CCDCFS argued that the appeal of this issue was untimely because the adjudication of neglect, abuse, and dependency had not been appealed within 30 days of the juvenile court\u2019s orders. Relying on <em>In re A.C., </em>160 Ohio App.3d 457, 2005-Ohio-1742, 827 N.E.2d 824, and <em>In re S.G., </em>8th Dist. No. 84228, 2005-Ohio-1163, 2005 WL 616115, the court of appeals held that appellee could appeal at two points: either after the juvenile court\u2019s orders adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision concerning the adjudication hearing or after the juvenile court\u2019s orders from the final dispositional hearing that terminated his parental rights. <em>In re H.F., </em>176 Ohio App.3d 106, 2008-Ohio-1627, 890 N.E.2d 341, \u00b6 32. Concluding that the trial court violated Juv.R. 29(D) when accepting appellee\u2019s admissions, the court of appeals reversed the adjudication orders, held appellee\u2019s remaining assignments of error moot, and remanded the matter for further proceedings. Id. at \u00b6 45, 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">{\u00b6 5} At the request of CCDCFS, the Eighth District Court of Appeals certified its decision as being in conflict with the Fourth District Court of Appeals decision of <em>In re P.N.M., </em>4th Dist. Nos. 07CA841 and 07CA842, 2007-Ohio-4976, 2007 WL 2758708, and the Twelfth District Court of Appeals decision of <em>In re C.G., </em>12th Dist. Nos. CA2007-03-005 and CA2007-03-006, 2007-Ohio-4361, 2007 WL 2410714, on the following issue: \u201cWhether App.R. 4(B)(5) provides an exception to App.R. 4(A), and authorizes an appeal of an adjudication order, determining abuse, neglect, or dependency, alternatively thirty days after the court renders a final order on all issues in the case, including final disposition as to parental rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">{\u00b6 6} We accepted the conflict and CCDCFS\u2019s discretionary appeal on the same issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Final Order</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">{\u00b6 7} Section 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution states that appellate courts have jurisdiction only over the judgments or final orders of inferior courts. R.C. 2501.02 specifically provides appellate courts with jurisdiction \u201cupon an appeal upon questions of law to review, affirm, modify, set aside, or reverse judgments or final orders of courts of record inferior to the court of appeals within the district, <em>including the finding, order, or judgment of a juvenile court that a child is delinquent, neglected, abused, or dependent, </em>for prejudicial error committed by such lower court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">{\u00b6 8} A \u201cfinal order\u201d (1) \u201caffects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment\u201d; (2) \u201caffects a substantial right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment\u201d; (3) \u201cvacates or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial\u201d; (4) \u201cgrants or denies a provisional remedy\u201d that \u201cprevents a judgment in the action in favor of the appealing party with respect to the provisional remedy\u201d and denies \u201ca meaningful or effective remedy by an appeal following final judgment as to all proceedings, issues, claims, and parties in the action\u201d; (5) \u201cdetermines that an action may or may not be maintained as a class action\u201d; (6) determines \u201cthe constitutionality of any changes to the Revised Code made by Am. Sub. S.B. 281 of the 124th general assembly\u201d; or (7) results from \u201can appropriation proceeding that may be appealed\u201d pursuant to R.C. 163.09(B)(3). R.C. 2505.02(B). This court discussed whether a juvenile court\u2019s adjudication order could be a substantial right that determined an action as set forth in the first definition of final orders in <em>In re Murray </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 155, 556 N.E.2d 1169.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We held, \u201cAn adjudication by a juvenile court that a child is \u2018neglected\u2019 or \u2018dependent\u2019 as defined by R.C. Chapter 2151 followed by a disposition awarding temporary custody to a public children services agency pursuant to R.C. 2151.353(A)(2) constitutes a \u2018final order\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 2505.02 and is appealable to the court of appeals pursuant to R.C. 2501.02.\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">{\u00b6 9} In this case, the juvenile court filed a journal entry that approved the magistrate\u2019s decision finding H.F. to be neglected and placing him in the temporary custody of CCDCFS on June 5, 2006. A similar journal entry that approved the magistrate\u2019s decision that R.F. was abused, neglected, and dependent and placing her in temporary custody was filed on June 7, 2006. Pursuant to <em>In re Murray </em>and R.C. 2505.02, these entries are final orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Time to Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">{\u00b6 10} Generally, an appeal of a judgment or final order must be filed within 30 days from the entry of the judgment or order. App.R. 4(A). Under this rule, appellee should have appealed the juvenile court\u2019s order concerning adjudication of abuse, dependency, or neglect and the grant of temporary custody by July 5, 2006, for H.F. and by July 7, 2006, for R.F.; appellee, however, did not file his notices of appeal until August 13, 2007, three days after the juvenile court terminated his parental rights. In many appellate districts, his appeal of the adjudication issues would have been dismissed as untimely. See <em>In re Harris, </em>1st Dist. No. C-020512, 2003-Ohio-672, 2003 WL 327996, \u00b6 12; <em>In re P.N.M., </em>4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Dist. Nos. 07CA841 and 07CA842, 2007-Ohio-4976, 2007 WL 2758708, \u00b6 39-40; <em>In re Calvert Children, </em>5th Dist. Nos. 05-CA-19 and 05-CA-20, 2005-Ohio-5653, 2005 WL 2746329, \u00b6 29-30; <em>In re Christopher B. </em>(July 3, 1997), 6th Dist. No. L-96-046, 1997 WL 379631, *4; <em>In re A.L., </em>10th Dist. Nos. 07AP-638 and 07AP-647, 2008-Ohio-800, 2008 WL 525421, IT 43; <em>In re C.G., </em>12th Dist. Nos. CA200703-005 and CA2007-03-006, 2007-Ohio-4361, 2007 WL 2410714, \u00b6 11-12. The Eighth District Court of Appeals, however, held that the exception to the 30-day rule in App.R. 4(B)(5) applied, providing appellee a second opportunity to appeal the adjudication orders within 30 days of the entry of the juvenile court\u2019s August 10, 2007 orders placing H.F. and R.F. in the permanent custody of CCDCFS.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">{\u00b6 11} App.R. 4(B)(5) provides: <em>\u201cPartial final judgment or order. </em>If an appeal is permitted from a judgment or order entered in a case in which the trial court has not disposed of all claims as to all parties, other than a judgment or order entered under Civ.R. 54(B) [which addresses judgment upon multiple claims or involving multiple parties], a party may file a notice of appeal within thirty days of entry of the judgment or order appealed or the judgment or order that disposes of the remaining claims. Division (A) of this rule applies to a judgment or order entered under Civ.R. 54(B).\u201d We adopted this subsection in 1992 following the review we recommended in <em>Dayton Women\u2019s Health Ctr. v. Enix </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 67, 70, 555 N.E.2d 956, fn. 3, due to the difficulties that attorneys were having in determining whether a partial final judgment or order met the requirements of R.C. 2505.02 in class action suits, as set forth in <em>Amato v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 253, 21 O.O.3d 158, 423 N.E.2d 452. 1992 Staff Note to App.R. 4, 64 Ohio St.3d CXXXI. \u201c[App.R. 4(B)(5)] is designed for situations such as an order affecting a substantial right made in a special proceeding * * <em>Grabill v. Worthington Industries, Inc. </em>(1993), 91 Ohio App.3d 469, 473, 632 N.E.2d 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">{\u00b6 12} For App.R. 4(B)(5) to apply, an order must meet two requirements: (1) it must be a final order that does not dispose of all claims for all parties and (2) it must not be entered under Civ.R. 54(B). Here, we have already determined that the June 2006 adjudication orders are final orders. The next question is whether the adjudication orders are partial final orders \u2014 that is, whether any claim remained pending between the parties following the juvenile court\u2019s adjudication order of neglect, abuse, and dependency and grant of temporary custody of the two children to CCDCFS. We conclude that there was not and, therefore, that App.R. 4(B)(5) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">{\u00b6 13} The complaints filed by CCDCFS asked for two things: (1) a finding of abuse, neglect, and/or dependency and (2) a grant of temporary custody to the agency. The June 2006 adjudication orders resolved both of these issues in favor of CCDCFS. As we noted in <em>In re Murray, </em>\u201cthe designation of the custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>award as \u2018temporary\u2019 is not controlling.\u201d 52 Ohio St.3d at 157, 556 N.E.2d 1169. Although some future action is contemplated in a temporary custody order, the immediate action between the parties is concluded. Id. at 158, 556 N.E.2d 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">{\u00b6 14} Bolstering the idea of complete finality, we also note that there is no assurance that a parent would have an alternative opportunity to appeal an adjudication order. As we recently reiterated in <em>In re Adams, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 86, 2007-Ohio-4840, 873 N.E.2d 886, \u00b6 44, a children services agency is not required to seek permanent custody unless statutorily required to do so under R.C. 2151.413(D)(1). A children services agency has several options upon the expiration of a temporary custody order besides seeking permanent custody. It can request that the child be returned home without any restrictions, be placed under protective supervision, be placed in the legal custody of a relative or other interested individual, or be placed in a planned permanent living arrangement. R.C. 2151.415.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">{\u00b6 15} Furthermore, the neglect, abuse, and dependency finding and the award of temporary custody are not subject to readjudication if a children services agency later seeks permanent custody of the child. R.C. 2151.414(A). These factors, which led us to conclude in <em>In re Murray </em>that \u201ca finding of neglect or dependency followed by a disposition awarding temporary custody to a public children services agency pursuant to R.C. 2151.353(A)(2) is an order which, in effect, determines the action,\u201d also lead us to conclude that there are no issues left pending after a juvenile court issues an adjudication order. <em>Murray, </em>52 Ohio St.3d at 159, 556 N.E.2d 1169. Therefore, App.R. 4(B)(5) does not apply to adjudication orders that include a finding of neglect, abuse, or dependency and a grant of temporary custody to a children services agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">{\u00b6 16} Appellee\u2019s argument that issues remain pending because the juvenile court retains jurisdiction over the case and is required to conduct reviews of a children services agency\u2019s case plan for the child is not persuasive. These obligations do not involve an active controversy or claim between the parents and the children services agency. They arise out of the children services agency\u2019s designation as the child\u2019s legal custodian and remain part of the juvenile court\u2019s duty to determine the child\u2019s best interests. They continue even after a children services agency has been granted permanent custody. R.C. 2151.415(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">{\u00b6 17} Appellee raises a number of policy reasons for allowing more than one opportunity to appeal the award of temporary custody based on a finding of abuse, dependency, or neglect,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which we reject. App.R. 4 governs the timing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>appeals and must be carefully followed because failure to file a timely notice of appeal under App.R 4(A) is a jurisdictional defect. <em>State ex rel. Pendell v. Adams Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 58, 60, 531 N.E.2d 713. We are not abrogating the right to appeal a juvenile court\u2019s adjudication order but simply clarifying when an appeal of this type must be filed: within 30 days of the entry of the adjudication order. Furthermore, even if no one appeals an adjudication order entered pursuant to R.C. 2151.353(A)(2), the parent still retains the right to appeal any award of permanent custody to a children services agency, and that appeal would include issues that arose after the adjudication order.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b739-11\">William D.
