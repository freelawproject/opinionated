INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this securities fraud class action suit, Plaintiffs allege that executive officers of Defendant Gigamon Inc. (\"Gigamon\" or \"Company\") made false and misleading statements about the Company's revenue and sales backlog in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"). Defendants Gigamon, Paul A. Hooper (\"Hooper\"), and Michael J. Burns (\"Burns\") move to dismiss the Amended Class Action Complaint for Violation of the Federal Securities Laws (\"Complaint\"). The Court finds it appropriate to take the motion under submission for decision without oral argument pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-1(b). Based upon all pleadings filed to date\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs purport to bring this securities fraud suit on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the securities of Gigamon between October 27, 2016 and February 2, 2017 (the \"Class Period\"). Complaint, \u00b6 1. Gigamon is a technology company that provides software and services to other companies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. Gigamon's products are designed to monitor and control data traveling across internet networks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Hooper is Gigamon's Chief Executive Officer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. Burns is Gigamon's Chief Financial Officer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Hooper and Burns routinely provided investors with estimates concerning Gigamon's future revenue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 27, 2016, the Company held a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss the Company's third quarter 2016 financial results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 46. During that call, Defendants provided the public with estimates concerning the Company's revenue and backlog for the fourth quarter, which was almost halfway complete.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Hooper stated, \"As we enter our fourth quarter with a healthy backlog, we are on track to deliver our second consecutive year of accelerating top-line revenue growth and expanding profitability.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 32, 46. Defendants estimated fourth quarter revenue to be \"in the range of $91 million to $93 million.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   More specifically, Burns stated in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Now for our Q4 outlook. We're excited to provide the following guidance, using our same disciplined guidance methodology for our fiscal fourth quarter ending December 31, 2016. It's based on non-GAAP results and excludes any stock-based compensation and related expenses. Our large deferred service, healthy product backlog, and consistent quarterly linearity continue to provide good visibility on growth, profits and execution.\n   <em>\n    We expect fourth quarter revenue in the range of $91 million to $93 million\n   </em>\n   , 37% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. As we continue to execute\n   on the profit drivers in all aspects of our business, we are confident that we will sustain gross margins at approximately the range of 82% to 83%. We continue to believe that now is a great time for us to invest in our business. We are investing with conviction to expand our security portfolio, deliver next generation technology, and increase sales capacity to ensure continued strong growth next year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   In the fourth quarter of 2016 we also expect to accrue accelerated year-end commissions due to our strong performance throughout the year. As a result, we are forecasting fourth-quarter operating expenses in the range of $54.5 million to $55.5 million. We expect to book a 32% non-GAAP tax provision, and with the diluted share count of approximately 39 million, we expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.36 to $0.38. Achieving the midpoint of our fourth-quarter guidance will bring our 2016 annual revenue growth to 43%, our second consecutive year of accelerating revenue growth. We would deliver annual EPS growth of 56% and would result in annual gross margin above 82% and annual operating margin of 22%.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   In summary, the third quarter was another great quarter of execution and we are well-positioned for a strong finish to the year. We continue to see significant demand for our solutions across all of our verticals and plan to next update you on our progress during our fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 conference call preliminarily scheduled for Thursday, February 2, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47 (emphasis added). These statements led investors to believe that Gigamon \"had significant unrecognized revenue, that there were product bookings in the backlog which would significantly increase revenue, and that, overall, increased revenue was guaranteed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. On October 28, 2016, the first trading day following the conference call, the price of Gigamon's common stock increased from $47.38 per share to $55.01 per share.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Unbeknownst to investors, Defendants did not have a reasonable basis in fact for the revenue estimate that they provided.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. \"As of October 27, 201[6], Defendants knew that key customers were in the process of deferring purchases that were likely to have a significant negative impact on the Company's revenue for the quarter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Moreover, Defendants were aware that Gigamon's sales 'backlog' would not be sufficient to compensate for the deferred purchase from this customer,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Company would not be able to meet its revised revenue estimate by relying on its 'backlog.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 2, 2016, Hooper mentioned in an interview that Gigamon was expecting $315 million in revenue for the year, \"which meant that revenue for the fourth quarter was expected to be approximately $89 million.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. Plaintiffs allege that Hooper's November 2, 2016 statement showed Gigamon was expecting less revenue than what was publicly stated just a few days earlier on October 27.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' knowledge about Gigamon's true revenue estimates was materially adverse and not public.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. A number of Gigamon's insiders sold stock while in possession of the material, non-public information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In total, the proceeds from the insider sales amounted to more than $14.5 million, not including Burns' sale of over 20,000 shares of stock.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that these sales were atypical in timing and size and support a strong inference that Defendants acted with scienter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The truth about Gigamon's fourth quarter revenue emerged on January 17, 2017, when the Company issued a press release\n   entitled \"Gigamon Announces Preliminary Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Results.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. The press release disclosed preliminary fourth quarter 2016 revenue of $84.5 million to $85.0 million, compared to the Company's prior guidance of $91 million to $93 million.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The press release also quoted Hooper stating that \"fourth quarter revenue was below our prior guidance\" and that \"[f]ourth quarter revenue fell short primarily due to lower than expected product bookings in our North America West region, as several significant existing customer accounts deferred purchasing decisions into 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The price of Gigamon's common stock fell $12.65 per share (or 28.7%) to close at $31.40 per share on January 18, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Two weeks later, during an investor call on February 2, 2017, Defendant Hooper explained that the shortfall was \"due to lower than expected bookings in our North America west region, as several significant larger accounts deferred purchasing decisions into 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Hooper also stated: \"We understand that the reasons for the deferrals range from changes in their purchasing patterns to network upgrade decisions that we believe are unrelated to our customer's commitments to add solutions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56. Rex Jackson, the Chief Financial Officer that replaced Burns, stated further that \"product backlog at quarter end was $3.1 below our range of approximately $6 million to $8.5 million of proceeding six quarters.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Between February 2, 2017 and February 3, 2017, Gigamon's common stock declined from $32.10 to $30.40 (or 5.3%).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss the Complaint for two fundamental reasons: the challenged statements are not actionable and the Complaint lacks sufficient facts to support a strong inference of scienter. As to the first argument, Defendants contend that the challenged statements are forward-looking and protected by the PSLRA's Safe Harbor, vague statements of corporate optimism, and that Plaintiffs have failed to allege particular facts showing that any alleged misstatement was false or misleading when made. As to the second argument, Defendants contend that neither Hooper's November 2 statement nor the stock sales allegations, viewed individual or holistically, are sufficient to support a compelling inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether The Challenged Statements Are Forward-Looking\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Safe Harbor of the PSLRA immunizes forward-looking statements from liability if the statements are (i) \"identified as forward-looking\" and (ii) \"accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(c)(1)(A)(i) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Cutera Securities Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696207\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/610/1103/#p1112\">\n    610 F.3d 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1112-13 (9th Cir. 2010) ;\n   <em>\n    City of Royal Oak Ret.

In\n   <em>\n    Quality Systems\n   </em>\n   , the defendants repeatedly made revenue and earnings projections based upon Quality Systems, Inc.'s (\"QS\") \"pipeline\" of future business. One individual defendant stated that \"opportunities\" for sales to first-time electronic healthcare system purchasers \"are plentiful,\" and predicted a revenue range and earnings per share. The defendant characterized these predictions as \"quite conservative\" given QS's \"large\" pipeline. Other individual defendants similarly made predictions for revenue growth and earnings per share that were based upon, among other things, QS's pipeline.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275782\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/1130/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275782\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/1130/\">\n    at 1147-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"growing\" pipeline; \"the state of the current sales pipeline\"; \"[y]ou wouldn't know that by our pipeline\"; \"$183 million worth of pipeline\"; \"the sales pipeline has grown every quarter ... since February of 2009 and we view it as continually growing\").

Burns made a forward-looking prediction about fourth quarter revenue. Burns' forward-looking prediction was accompanied by a non-forward-looking statement regarding Gigamon's \"large deferred service,\" \"healthy product backlog,\" and \"consistent quarterly linearity,\" which provided the factual predicate for Burns' revenue prediction. Plaintiffs contend that the \"large deferred service,\" \"healthy product backlog,\" and \"consistent quarterly linearity\" refer to the present business conditions at Gigamon. Plaintiffs' Opposition at 15:4-5 (\"This refers to a present state of affairs, and is not a projection or forecast.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants nevertheless contend that the Safe Harbor provision applies because the \"large deferred service,\" \"healthy product backlog,\" and \"consistent quarterly linearity\" are \"assumptions\" underlying the revenue prediction that are protected pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(i)(1)(A) &amp; (D).\n   <em>\n    Westley v.

Construing the Complaint liberally in favor of Plaintiffs, the Court treats the \"orders\" included in the backlog as firm commitments to purchase that existed as of the date of Defendants' alleged misstatements. Defendants do not explain how Gigamon's cautionary statement about the potential failure to \"close\" transactions, which presumably refers to future transactions, provides a meaningful warning about orders existing at the time of Defendants' alleged misstatements. Defendants also do not explain how a cautionary statement about the \"timing of orders\" and \"the budgeting cycles and internal purchasing priorities\" of customers, which also presumably refer to future orders and future purchasing priorities of customers, provides a meaningful warning about orders existing at the time of Defendants' alleged misstatements. Because it is not apparent from the pleadings that Defendants' cautionary language corrected the alleged misstatement regarding Gigamon's backlog, it is premature to decide whether the Safe Harbor immunizes Defendants' from liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bodri v.
