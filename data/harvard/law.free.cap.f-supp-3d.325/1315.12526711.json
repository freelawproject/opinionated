WILLIAMS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   is before the Court on Defendant Phillip Frost's fully-briefed motion to dismiss with prejudice Plaintiffs' complaint (\"Complaint\"). (DE 20). The Court has considered the pleadings, the briefing, and relevant authorities. The Complaint sets forth one derivative claim against Defendant pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Act\"), alleging that Defendant purchased and sold securities of OPKO Health, Inc. (\"OPKO,\" a nominal defendant in this action) within a six-month period in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78p(b). (DE 1 at 2). For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Plaintiffs' claim is dismissed with prejudice because it is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Parties agree that Defendant is an officer of OPKO and is therefore an \"insider\" subject to the requirements of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78p. (DE 1 at 2; DE 20 at 3, 5). Plaintiffs are stockholders of OPKO. (DE 20 at 3; DE 20-1 at 4). Plaintiffs allege that Defendant purchased and sold stock in OPKO within a six-month period and that these transactions resulted in profits to Defendant totaling $3,190,254. (DE 1 at 4). Plaintiffs contend that the OPKO shares Defendant purchased on January 31, 2015 \"were market transactions non-exempt from Section 16(b)\" because: (1) \"[t]he share dispositions to OPKO were for exercise price payments for warrants exercised two years prior to their expiration at the sole discretion of Dr. Frost;\" (2) \"[n]one of the dispositions were approved with the required specificity to achieve an exemption from Section 16(b) via SEC Rule 16(b)(3)(e);\" (3) \"Dr. Frost had discretion as to the timing of the exercise of the warrants and, therefore, had discretion of the timing of the dispositions to the issuer, OPKO;\" and (4) \"Dr. Frost has 'superior footing' regarding the dispositions since the issuer, OPKO, was required to accept the dispositions.\" (DE 1 at 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 26, 2016, Plaintiffs notified Defendant and OPKO that they were requesting that OPKO recover the profits from Defendant because the profits resulted from transactions that violated Section 16(b) of the Act. (DE 20-1 at 2-4; DE 1 at 4). Plaintiffs allege that \"OPKO refused to request disgorgement of the profits from Dr. Frost and entities he controls and refused to file suit to recover such profits totaling $3,190,254 after sixty (60) days had passed from the 60-day notices that were received by OPKO.\" (DE 1 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 23, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their first suit against Defendant in this District before Judge Jose E. Martinez,\n   <em>\n    Olagues v. Frost\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 17-20287-CIV-JEM (Jan. 23, 2017). (DE 20 at 4). The allegations in that complaint are substantially identical to the allegations in the present case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 8, 2017, Judge\n   Martinez entered an order stating that\n   <strong>\n    \"WITHIN TWENTY (20) DAYS OF THE APPEARANCE OF A DEFENDANT,\n   </strong>\n   counsel and\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigants shall file a Joint Scheduling Report and Joint Proposed Scheduling Order pursuant to Local Rule 16.1(b)....\"\n   <em>\n    Olagues\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 17-20287-CIV-JEM (DE 6). The parties did not file the required scheduling report or proposed scheduling order and did not otherwise seek an extension of time from Judge Martinez. On April 28, 2017, defendant Phillip Frost filed a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Olagues\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 17-20287-CIV-JEM (DE 18). On August 28, 2017, Judge Martinez entered a paperless order dismissing the case without prejudice and quoting his prior order requiring a scheduling report: \"the Order cautioned that 'the parties' failure to file a joint scheduling report or otherwise comply with this Order shall result in dismissal, default, or the imposition of other appropriate sanctions, including attorney's fees and costs.' The deadline for filing a joint scheduling report has long passed and no extension of time has been requested.\"\n   <em>\n    Olagues\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 17-20287-CIV-JEM (DE 24). On September 6, 2017, Plaintiffs filed the second, identical action that is now before this Court. (DE 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' complaint must be dismissed with prejudice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because (1) Plaintiffs' claim is barred by the statute of limitations set forth in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78p(b), and (2), even if the suit were not time-barred, the transactions are exempt under SEC Rule 16b-3(e) because the transactions were \"fully approved in advance by OPKO's Board of Directors.\" (DE 20 at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under the notice pleading standards, a complaint must contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The purpose of a motion to dismiss filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is to test the facial sufficiency of a complaint. The rule permits dismissal of a complaint that fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Although a complaint challenged by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss need not contain detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff is still obligated to provide the \"grounds\" for his entitlement to relief, and a \"formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v.
