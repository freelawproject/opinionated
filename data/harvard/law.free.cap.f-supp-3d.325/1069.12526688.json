Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court assumes for purposes of this motion, and defendants do not dispute, that plaintiff has a serious medical need. The record, however, amply demonstrates that Dr. Leighton provided plaintiff adequate care. Dr. Leighton, along with other physicians, examined plaintiff on multiple occasions and provided him treatment for his pain and other health issues. In particular, the record shows that, for the period encompassing plaintiff's complaint - specifically 2014-2015 - Dr. Leighton treated plaintiff on at least eleven occasions. During this time, Dr. Leighton evaluated plaintiff's condition, created a pain treatment plan, prescribed non-narcotic medication, prescribed TENS treatment, approved plaintiff for injections for his back pain, instructed plaintiff on exercises and proper care for his knee, shoulder and back, and referred plaintiff for physical therapy and to pain specialists. The undisputed evidence demonstrates that Dr. Leighton continuously assessed plaintiff's symptoms and recommended\n   treatment according to his clinical presentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   At the crux of plaintiff's complaint is his contention that Dr. Leighton acted with deliberate indifference when she decided to taper plaintiff off of morphine. However, the record shows that Dr. Leighton observed plaintiff for well over a year before making the medical decision to taper down his prescription for morphine.

A at 129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Further, the record shows that Dr. Leighton conducted the taper gradually. Specifically, she tapered plaintiff's dosage down to a complete discontinuance over the course of more than thirteen months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63-86, Ex. A at 109-59. This was an exceedingly cautious approach, done to most effectively minimize the risks of adverse symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 127;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Pratt Decl. \u00b6 15. At one point, Dr. Leighton even paused the taper so that plaintiff could work on his back exercise program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64, Ex. A at 111-12. Finally, both during and after the taper, Dr. Leighton consistently provided plaintiff with alternative pain management treatments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Although the assertions in plaintiff's opposition are not entirely clear, it appears plaintiff bases his medical indifference claim on the following three arguments: 1) Dr. Leighton discontinued his opioid medication as part of a statewide cost-saving measure; (2) Dr. Leighton overstated plaintiff's history of illegal drug use in her medical notes; and (3) plaintiff experienced significant delays in receiving his back injections and physical therapy. These contentions are not persuasive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First, plaintiff argues that budget cuts were the \"only logical conclusion\" for the morphine taper. Pl's Opp'n at 12. But he provides no evidence to support this claim. To the contrary, defendants show that discontinuing morphine medication does not make sense from a cost-reduction perspective because opioid medication is significantly less expensive than the alternative treatments of physical therapy, injections, and neurosurgical consultation, all of which plaintiff received. Leighton Decl. \u00b6 134; Pratt Decl. \u00b6 18; Barnett Decl. \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, regarding plaintiff's history of illegal drug use, plaintiff contends that he never tested positive for illegal substances during his twenty years in prison. Pl's Opp'n at 4. Plaintiff's opposition is unverified, and he provides no evidence to support this contention. Plaintiff does not dispute a May 14, 2015 medical record from a different health provider setting forth his illegal drug use \"relapse\" in prison. Leighton Decl. Ex. A at 164. Nor does he dispute his Central File records setting forth drug use. Ross Decl. Ex. C at 23, 26-28. In any event, even accepting as true plaintiff's assertion that Dr. Leighton overstated his drug history, this does not create a material dispute. While Dr. Leighton noted plaintiff's history of illegal drug use in her medical notes, this was only one of several factors she considered in deciding to discontinue plaintiff's morphine prescription, and it was never the primary consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Leighton Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 61-104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Third, plaintiff argues that, due to delays, Dr. Leighton did not follow through on her plan for plaintiff to have a pain injection before the morphine taper began. Pl's Opp'n at 7-8. However, the evidence shows that it was on December 10, 2013 when Dr. Leighton indicated her plan to give plaintiff an injection prior to the morphine taper. Leighton Decl. \u00b6 60, Ex, A at 101-02. And the evidence shows that she followed through on this plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 62-63, Ex. A at 106-10 (showing plaintiff received a pain injection on February 18, 2014, and the morphine taper began on February 28, 2014). Finally, the evidence shows that both during and after the morphine taper, Dr. Leighton continued the pain-injection treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 66, 69-70, 73, 75, 97, 99, 101, 105, Ex. A at 117-18, 120, 126-30, 136-37, 140-41, 143, 172-75, 179-83, 185-88, 200-04. Plaintiff appears to blame delays in his physical therapy appointments on prison bureaucracy, not Dr. Leighton.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl's. Opp'n at 8-9 (noting double-booking and lack of medical escort). In any event, plaintiff does not dispute that Dr. Leighton referred him for physical therapy and that he ultimately received physical therapy along with a range of other pain treatments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Benjamin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9418637\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/293/1030/#p1038\">\n    293 F.3d 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1038 (7th Cir. 2002) (doctor entitled to summary judgment where plaintiff presented no evidence that delays between plaintiff's initial visit, diagnosis and visit to the specialist were within the doctor's control or that the delay contributed to plaintiff's injuries).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The undisputed evidence supports Dr. Leighton's morphine-taper decision, and plaintiff fails to show the \"sufficiently culpable state of mind\" or \"unnecessary and wanton\" pain infliction necessary to sustain a deliberate-indifference claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p837\">\n    511 U.S. at 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p837\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In sum, plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of fact that the care he received at the hands of Dr. Leighton amounted to deliberate indifference to plaintiff's serious medical needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The only allegations against defendants Dr. Tootell, J. Lewis, and Dr. Pratt are that they denied plaintiff's inmate grievance concerning the medical care he received from Dr. Leighton. As there was no constitutional violation in Dr. Leighton's treatment, these defendants cannot have been deliberately indifferent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, in support of the motion for summary judgment, defendants provide the independent medical opinion of Dr. Barnett. Dr. Barnett currently works as the chief medical consultant for the California Correctional Health-Care Services' Receiver's Office of Legal Affairs. Barnett Decl. \u00b6 1. Dr. Barnett reviewed plaintiff's medical records and concluded that plaintiff received considerate and appropriate medical care and did not require morphine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6, 12, 15, 17, 19-22. Defendants have also produced evidence of the growing medical consensus (as set forth by, among others, the Centers for Disease Control, the Surgeon General, the Department of Health and Human Services, industry articles, and the California Prison Health Care Services (CPHCS) pain-management guidelines) that opiate medication is dangerous and not advised for treating non-cancer chronic pain. Leighton Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 114-135, Exs. C-E; Pratt Decl. \u00b6 16, Exs. B-C; Tootell Decl. \u00b6 12; Barnett Decl. \u00b6 25, Ex. D. Plaintiff produces no evidence to dispute these conclusions. His claim of a need for morphine, or any treatment other than the treatment he received, is based entirely on self-diagnosis and has no medical support. He thus fails to show any unmet medical need, much less deliberate indifference.\n   <em>\n    Parlin v. Sodhi\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-6120 VBF MRW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205411710\">\n    2012 WL 5411710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 8, 2012) (\"At its core, Plaintiff's claim is that he did not receive the type of treatment and pain medication that he\n   wanted when he wanted it. His preference for stronger medication - Vicodin, Tramadol, etc. - represents precisely the type of difference in medical opinion between a lay prisoner and medical personnel that is insufficient to establish a constitutional violation.\");\n   <em>\n    Womack v.

Cal. June 19, 2013) (\"In this regard, plaintiff's disagreement with defendants about the type and strength of his pain medication does not reflect a conscious disregard of plaintiff's serious medical needs.
