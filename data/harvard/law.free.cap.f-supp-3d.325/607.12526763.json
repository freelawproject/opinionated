For the reasons set forth more fully below, Defendants' Motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendants infringed claims 31 and 32 of the '850 Patent and claims 1, 12, and 23 of the '996 Patent. (Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-44, Doc. 58.) The patent claims are allegedly directed to \"special purpose remote cardiac monitoring systems\" that are useful in treating patients with arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation. (Pls.' Opp'n Defs.' Mot. J. Pleadings 1, Doc. 207.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 2, 2017, Defendants filed the instant Motion arguing that Plaintiff is collaterally estopped from alleging infringement of claim 31 of the '850 Patent and claim 12 of the '996 Patent following the district court's decision in\n   <em>\n    CardioNet, LLC, et al. v.

In that case, in ruling on defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, the court determined that claim 31 of the '850 Patent and claim 12 of the '996 Patent are patent ineligible pursuant\n   to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    InfoBionic, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that claim 31 of the '850 Patent and claim 12 of the '996 Patent are directed to a common-sense \"abstract idea of correlating one set of data to another.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at *21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The claimed system is analogous to a medical professional analyzing the physiological data and comparing his or her assessment with a colleague's second opinion. The medical professional also consolidates his or her assessment with that of his or her colleague, based on the same physiological data, to arrive at a more accurate diagnosis. This suggests that the claims are directed to the abstract idea of \"a longstanding, well-known method of organizing human behavior,\" where a computer only facilitates such existing practices.\n   <em>\n    Bascom\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Glob.

After considering the additional briefing, the court found that claim 31 of the '850 Patent and claim 12 of the '996 Patent were representative of all of Plaintiffs' claims in the '850 and '996 Patents. (Ex.

Pursuant to the Parties' Stipulation, ScottCare agreed that it would \"not assert in this action invalidity of: (a) any claims of CardionNet's United States Patent Nos. 7,907,996....\" (Stipulation \u00b6 4, Doc. 165.) ScottCare also stipulated that it would not challenge the validity of any claim of Patent '850 except claims 31 and 32. (Stipulation \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4, Doc. 165.)

In\n   <em>\n    Blonder-Tongue\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court unanimously held that where a patent had been declared invalid in a prior adjudication, an unrelated defendant in a subsequent action for infringement may assert a collateral estoppel defense based on the previous judgment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11733536\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/313/\">\n    402 U.S. at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11733536\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/313/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Kaiser Indus.

Thus, the Court's discussion will focus on this element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Issue Was Determined By A Final Judgment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court finds that the Massachusetts District Court's decision, finding Plaintiffs' asserted claims in the '850 and '996 Patents patent -ineligible, constitutes a final judgment for collateral estoppel purposes because the Parties were fully heard on the issues, the Massachusetts District Court issued well-reasoned opinions, and although the orders were not\n   immediately appealable, Plaintiffs have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   There is no bright-line rule regarding what constitutes a \"final judgment\" for issue preclusion purposes.\n   <em>\n    Free Speech Coalition, Inc. v.

When determining whether a prior ruling was sufficiently firm for preclusion purposes courts consider the following factors: (1) whether the parties were fully heard; (2) whether a reasoned opinion was filed; and (3) whether that decision could have been, or actually was, appealed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871477\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/519/#p541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   None of these factors alone are determinative.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871477\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/519/#p541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, Plaintiffs were fully heard on the question of the validity of the '850 and '996 Patents. The Massachusetts District Court order addressed the same issues that are now before this Court. Plaintiffs were represented by competent counsel before the Massachusetts District Court and had a full opportunity to brief those issues. In fact, Plaintiffs put forth the same arguments before this Court as they did before the Massachusetts District Court in support of its position. Thus, Plaintiffs were fully heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, the Massachusetts District Court issued two well-reasoned opinions in support of its decisions. \"Reasoned supporting opinions reveal whether or not particular issues were actually decided in the prior adjudication, leading subsequent adjudicators to more readily apply issue preclusion in the presence of 'thorough and thoughtful opinion[s.]' \"\n   <em>\n    NCAA v.

In a thirty-one page opinion, the Massachusetts District Court conducted its\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   analysis and clearly articulated its basis for concluding that claim 31 of the '850 Patent and claim 12 of the '996 Patent are patent-ineligible.\n   <em>\n    Alice Corp.

The court then issued a second well-reasoned opinion wherein it concluded that claim 31 and claim 12 are representative of all of Plaintiffs' claims in the '850 and '996 Patents because all of the claims for the respective Patents are substantially similar and linked to the same abstract ideas.

However, this fact is not dispositive of the issue of finality. In light of the strong policy\n   considerations behind the issue preclusion doctrine, the Court finds that Defendants have satisfied the finality element. \"[P]reclusion is necessary to serve the interest of judicial economy and comity.

Judicial economy would not be served were this Court to undertake an independent review of the patentability of the '850 and '996 Patents because the Court is satisfied that the Massachusetts District Court conducted an appropriate assessment of Plaintiffs' claims and have concluded that said claims are patent-ineligible. Therefore, the Court finds that the Massachusetts District Court's order granting judgment on the pleadings constitutes a final judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J. R.

Remaining Elements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although Plaintiffs' have not contested the remaining elements of issue preclusion, the Court has determined that Defendants have satisfied each of the remaining elements of issue preclusion. In addition to finality, the doctrine of issue preclusion requires the issue in the present litigation to be identical to the issue previously adjudicated, the issue to have been actually litigated, the previous determination of the issue to have been necessary to the decision, and the party being precluded from relitigating the issue to have been fully represented in the prior action.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4248362\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/608/126/#p127\">\n    608 F.

This is precisely the same issue that this Court has been asked to adjudicate in the present matter. Second, the Massachusetts District Court's adjudication came after the Parties had a full and fair opportunity to brief and argue the issues; thus the issues were actually litigated. Third, the Massachusetts District Court's decision granting defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings was based on that court's determination that claims 12 and 31 were patent-ineligible. Thus, the determination of the invalidity of claims 12 and 31 were necessary to the Massachusetts District Court's decision to grant defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The requirement that a preclusive finding must have been necessary to a judgment is rooted in principles of fairness. \"[P]arties should be estopped only on issues they actually deem important, and not on incidental matters.\" Because litigants are likely to view an issue that is necessary to the resolution of a case as important and to litigate it vigorously, it is fair to give such a determination preclusive effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    L'Oreal USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3386447\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/244/#p249\">\n    458 F.3d at 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lynne Carol Fashions, Inc. v.

Finally, Plaintiffs, against whom estoppel is asserted in this matter, were the same plaintiffs in the prior litigation.
