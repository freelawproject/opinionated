Ahead of his trial, Mr. Nguyen moved to suppress the statements he made to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") agents during two interviews conducted in October 2016. Because these interviews were not custodial interrogations, and because his statements were made voluntarily, the Court denies the Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Government contends that Mr. Nguyen misused his position as an ICE Assistant Attach\u00e9 to conceal, transport, and avoid reporting over $80,000 in cash in 2016.

They interviewed Mr. Nguyen twice. Def.'s Mot. to Suppress 2. The first interview was conducted on October 27, 2016, at two locations in the District of Columbia - ICE headquarters and OPR's building in L'Enfant Plaza.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Nguyen requested the second interview. It was held the next day at the OPR building. Pl.'s Opp. to Def.'s Mot. to Suppress 2. Before each interview began, the ICE agents provided Mr. Nguyen several warnings and notices, including \"a\n   <em>\n    Beckwith\n   </em>\n   Warning, Disclosure Warning, General Notice, and a Title 18 United States Code \u00a7 1001 Advisement.\" Def.'s Mot. to Suppress 2.

Therefore, because the ICE agents failed \"to advise Mr. Nguyen of the full panoply of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights - especially his right to have counsel present during the interviews - [they] denied him his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Nguyen also claims that the ICE agents \"intimated\" him \"by using his position as an [ICE] 'employee' against him to coerce him into signing the waiver forms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.

His interviews were non-custodial. Moreover, he received multiple verbal and written warnings making it clear that answers to the agents' questions were optional. These warnings, combined with his experience as a law enforcement official, further weigh against a finding that Mr. Nguyen was owed a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   It would be highly implausible for a reasonable person in Mr. Nguyen's circumstances to conclude that he was \"not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\"\n   <em>\n    Howes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186663\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/499/#p508\">\n    565 U.S. at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186663\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/499/#p508\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As an initial matter, the second interview was initiated \"\n   <em>\n    at the Defendant's own request.\n   </em>\n   \" Pl.'s Opp. to Def.'s Mot. to Suppress 5 (emphasis in original). Agent Keck testified that Mr. Nguyen \"wanted to meet again to clarify some issues.\" Hr'g Tr. 22:3-4. The Defendant concedes that he \"asked to meet with [the ICE agents] again after having had some sleep.\" Def.'s Mot. to Suppress 9. \"[S]uspect-initiated contact\" with law enforcement \"is not custody for\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Schreane v.

That Mr. Nguyen actively sought the interview thus indicates that he was not in custody during the second interview and is suggestive of the voluntary nature of the first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Application of the\n   <em>\n    Howes\n   </em>\n   factors further demonstrates that Mr. Nguyen was not in custody for either interview. Consider first the location of the questioning. The October 27, 2016 interview began at ICE's headquarters. Def.'s Mot. to Suppress 2. There, Mr. Nguyen met with the ICE agents, who \"walked with him to a conference room on a lower floor.\" Pl.'s Opp. to Def.'s Mot. to Suppress 1. The conference room \"had windows, a conference table, and several chairs,\" and the door \"was closed but unlocked.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275746\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/446/#p452\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Nguyen sat at the head of the table \"in the chair closest to the door.\" Hr'g Tr. 9:23-10:1. In short, this professional setting was a far cry from the paradigmatic locked and windowless interrogation cell typically utilized for a stationhouse grilling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After about an hour, the agents moved the interview to the nearby OPR building because \"the conference room had only been reserved for basically an hour.\" Hr'g Tr. 36:14-15. The participants \"walked a short distance\" to the building, where they \"sat in an office with a desk and chairs.\" Pl.'s Opp. to Def.'s Mot. to Suppress 2. The interview conducted the next day was also held in an office at the OPR building. Hr'g Tr. 22:20-24. It was in a \"regular office\" with \"windows ... [and] a desk in there that would be equivalent to an employee's desk.\" Hr'g Tr. 23:23-24:5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Defendant contends that he had \"limited exposure\" to the \"intimidating confines\" of ICE buildings before the interviews. Def.'s Mot. to Suppress 7. But Mr. Nguyen was an ICE employee for over twenty years and, by his own admission, was \"detailed to ICE headquarters for a short period in 2008.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The interviews were \"not [at] a police station or any other characteristically police-dominated or coercive location, but w[ere] instead [at] office[s] inside of Defendant's own place of work.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273416\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/15/#p26\">\n    256 F.Supp.3d 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (D.D.C. 2017). Because of Mr. Nguyen's familiarity with ICE's headquarters, and the fact that the interviews were held in a conference room and employee offices, the location of the questioning weighs against finding that he was in custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The questioning's duration does not suggest that Mr. Nguyen was in custody either. The first interview began at or around 11:02 a.m., \"was paused for twenty minutes between noon and 12:20 p.m.,\" and finished at about 2:00 p.m. Def.'s Mot. to Suppress 7. The second interview \"lasted less than one hour.\" Pl.'s Opp. to Def.'s Mot. to Suppress 5. While these interviews \"were not short, they also were not unduly lengthy.\"\n   <em>\n    Holland v.

Unit Chief Larrabee \"advis[ed] the defendant prior to the start of the [first] interview that it was strictly voluntary, that he didn't have to answer any questions.\" Hr'g Tr. 18:24-19:2. He provided this warning \"several times.\" Hr'g Tr. 19:13-14. Agent Keck, who was \"new to OPR,\" believed that Chief Larrabee \"went overboard to advise the defendant that it was strictly voluntary.\" Indeed, he feared that the warnings might \"push [Mr. Nguyen] away\" rather than induce him to \"cooperate and talk.\" Hr'g Tr. 19:21-20:3. This powerfully contradicts Mr. Nguyen's claims of custody and coercion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The agents supplemented the verbal advice with written warnings before each interview:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Mr. Nguyen read and signed a \"General Notice,\" which stated that the agents were \"investigating the alleged Bank Secrecy Act violation that you engaged in when you removed over $80,000 USD from the U.S. without declaring it.\" Def.'s Mot. to Suppress, Ex.

Both of Mr. Nguyen's arguments are unavailing, and his statements are therefore admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Nguyen contends that ICE tricked him into participating in the interviews. He alleges that, \"en route from his duty station in Bangkok, Thailand to his new duty station in the Dallas area,\" ICE \"re-routed him to Washington, D.C., ostensibly to accept an award.\" Def.'s Mot. to Suppress at 6. The initial interview was conducted following a \"hurriedly put together award ceremony,\" and Mr. Nguyen \"was not advised of the interview prior to traveling to Washington, D.C.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11175414\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/235/1124/#p1132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   While the Defendant offered no evidence to support these contentions, they do not, even if true, suggest that he was in custody.

He was aware that he was being asked to voluntarily cooperate in an ongoing investigation. And, armed with that awareness, Mr. Nguyen did not decline to answer questions or seek to end the interview.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 13:20-14:12; 20:4-16. In fact, he asked the investigators for a second interview. Hr'g Tr. 44:11-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A cursory comparison of Mr. Nguyen's interview circumstances to those producing truly involuntary statements demonstrates his argument's shortcomings. In\n   <em>\n    Mincey v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   , a suspect was determined to have made involuntary statements during questioning because he \"had been seriously wounded just a few hours earlier,\" was \"lying on his back on a hospital bed,\" and was in a \"debilitated and helpless condition.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180644\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/385/#p398\">\n    437 U.S. 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398-99,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180644\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/385/#p398\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180644\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/385/#p398\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978). In\n   <em>\n    Beecher v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   , the suspect made involuntary statements when he was \"ordered [by investigators] at gunpoint to speak his guilt or be killed.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11333825\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/35/#p38\">\n    389 U.S. 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11333825\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/35/#p38\">\n    88 S.Ct. 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11333825\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/35/#p38\">\n    19 L.Ed.2d 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967). Here, by contrast, there is simply no reason to doubt that Mr. Nguyen \"was treated well during his relatively brief interrogation[s], and that he seemed eager to talk\" to the ICE agents.\n   <em>\n    Mohammed\n   </em>\n   , 639 F.3d at 198.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Nguyen suggests that he was \"interrogated without rest, after having arrived in Washington, D.C. following a 20-hour flight from Thailand,\" and that the ICE agents \"took advantage of [his] 'employee' status by intimidating him with the very language of the consent forms.\" Def.'s Mot. to Suppress 11. These forms, he contends, featured \"language which clearly threatened his employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The evidence belies his arguments. When Agent Keck encountered him, Mr. Nguyen \"seemed to be well engaged and quite frankly, seemed to be in a good mood.\" Hr'g Tr. 33:5-7. The tone of the interviews was \"very professional on both sides,\" there \"seemed to be a free flow of information,\" and \"everybody seemed to be very professional and engaged each other in conversation.\" Hr'g Tr. 20:13-16. The second interview was \"very cordial,\" and there was \"no shouting or screaming.\" Hr'g Tr. 29:14-15. This unrebutted evidence of a low-key, professional discussion strongly undercuts Mr. Nguyen's allegations as to both the custodial nature of the meetings and the voluntariness of his responses. And the forms that Mr. Nguyen signed twice stated that \"No disciplinary action will be taken against you solely for refusing to answer questions.\" Def.'s Mot. to Suppress, Ex. B at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   If anything, Mr. Nguyen's status as an ICE employee further distances this case from any Fifth Amendment violation. The custody inquiry requires the Court to ask whether, \"given [the] circumstances, would a reasonable person have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\"\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. Keohane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"326006\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/99/#p113\">\n    516 U.S. 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 113,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"326006\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/99/#p113\">\n    116 S.Ct. 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"326006\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/99/#p113\">\n    133 L.Ed.2d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). In other words, would \"a reasonable person in the\n   <em>\n    defendant's position\n   </em>\n   \" consider himself to be in custody?\n   <em>\n    LeBrun\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9268540\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/363/715/#p723\">\n    363 F.3d at 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Mr. Nguyen's \"past experience and dealings\" with ICE suggest he understood that his participation in the interviews was voluntary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9268540\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/363/715/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is highly unlikely that, with over twenty years of experience as a federal law enforcement official, Mr. Nguyen was unfamiliar with the process of questioning suspects and the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights accorded to these suspects during custodial interrogations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Mr. Nguyen came to the interviews armed with a knowledge of his rights and law enforcement techniques that few criminal suspects could match. And he was accorded professional courtesies that most suspects will never receive. The record here does not begin to make out a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   violation, much less evidence of an involuntary statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court finds that Mr. Nguyen was not in custody during the two interviews conducted on October 27 and 28, 2016. He was free to leave, spoke to the ICE agents voluntarily, and was provided ample opportunity, through verbal and written warnings, to consider the consequences of his decision to participate. Accordingly, the agents were not required to provide Mr. Nguyen with a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning, and the statements he made will not be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Defendant's Motion to Suppress Statements is hereby DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The Court credits Agent Keck's testimony. Agent Keck provided candid responses, acknowledging that he did not know or remember certain details in response to the questions he was asked. The Defendant's cross-examination largely sought to clarify or amplify, rather than impeach, the substance of Agent Keck's testimony.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The parties agree that the relevant\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    issue here is whether Mr. Nguyen was in custody.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Hr'g Tr. 45:25-46:2. Because the Court finds that that he was not, it need not determine whether the questioning can fairly be characterized as an \"interrogation.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
