Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 23, 2015, Meriwether County issued citations to Plaintiff Paul Vandiver for violations of zoning ordinances related to business registration and noise regulation. It can be inferred from the complaint that sometime thereafter the County referred the violations to the office of Peter Skandalakis, district attorney for the Coweta Judicial Circuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 17, assistant district attorney Robert Peterkin obtained a twenty-four count indictment in Meriwether County Superior Court for the ordinance violations. Two days later, the County dismissed four of the County-issued citations against Vandiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Based on the remaining counts in the indictment, Peterkin moved on behalf of the State\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to place Vandiver in custody and set a $10,000 bond. The superior court granted the motion and Vandiver was arrested. Vandiver posted bond, which was subsequently revoked on the State's motion. He was, once again, arrested. He was later released on a supersedeas bond order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After this, on March 10, 2016, Beth Neely-Hadley, Chairman of the Meriwether County Board of Commissioners, sent a letter purporting to represent the entire commission. The letter was addressed to district attorney Skandalakis and states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   This letter is in reference to the Vandiver case that is currently being heard in Superior Court, Coweta Judicial Circuit, Meriwether County, Georgia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Meriwether County Board of Commissioners is aware that the District Attorney's office is representing Meriwether County in this matter, and have consented to this representation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Please accept this letter as the Board of Commissioner's formal request for your office to continue your representation of this case on behalf of Meriwether County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Should you have questions or need additional information, please contact our office. Thanks again for your assistance to our County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [1-4] at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The case proceeded until the Superior Court dismissed the indictment on April 21, 2016, because proceedings for violation of county ordinances are required to be by citation or accusation-not indictment-under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-10-62(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 17, 2017, Vandiver filed this\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   action against the County for false arrest (Count I) and malicious prosecution (Count II).

Comparing the laws of Texas and Louisiana to Georgia, the Eleventh Circuit found that Georgia district attorneys are primarily paid by state funds, elected in judicial circuits generally composed of multiple counties, and root their law-enforcement authority in the repository of power ultimately vested in the Georgia attorney general.\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539371\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/877/947/#p950\">\n    877 F.2d at 950-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He was instead attempting to enforce county ordinances, allegedly at the behest of the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This distinction could arguably compel a different outcome than\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   , i.e., that he was acting on behalf of the County. That is except for the fact that when he sought to enforce the ordinance he did so by\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   indictment, rather than by citation or accusation in the name of the County. The proceedings in the Meriwether Superior Court make clear that the indictment and subsequent proceedings were done in the name of the State of Georgia.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , [1-3] at 1 (listing \"STATE OF GEORGIA\" as the prosecuting party in the case caption);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11592387\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/37/1371/#p1376\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"COMES NOW, the STATE of GEORGIA, by and through the District Attorney for the Coweta Judicial Circuit....\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (\"[T]he State of Georgia files this motion so that the Court may revoke the Defendant's bond.\"). While the County may have referred the violations to the district attorney, when he drew up the indictment he put on his State of Georgia hat and proceeded in his capacity as an officer of the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court acknowledges that it appears to be somewhat unusual for a Georgia district attorney to enforce a county ordinance (especially by indictment). But it is not clear that such an act is totally foreclosed to the office of district attorney. It is possible that he had\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   authority to attempt to enforce a county ordinance by virtue of his state office, rather than simply as an instrumentality of the County.

And though a proceeding by indictment was foreclosed here by O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-10-62 -even by the district attorney-this blunder was effected through exercise of state, rather than county, authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This conclusion is necessary in light of the Eleventh Circuit's instruction that resolving the issue of final policymaking authority requires a determination as to who is the ultimate repository of county power with respect to the allegedly unlawful action. Vandiver argues that the district attorney\n   was appointed as the County's agent to enforce the county ordinances under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-10-62(a), and was therefore the ultimate repository of County authority with respect this act. But once again, the complaint shows that the district attorney drew up the indictment in the name of the State. And the power to draw up indictments is vested in the district attorney\n   <em>\n    by state law. See\n   </em>\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-18-6(4). Thus, the district attorney was not acting as the ultimate repository of County authority when he pursued Vandiver by indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court finds further support for this holding in the Eleventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Turquitt\n   </em>\n   , which overruled a previous opinion in\n   <em>\n    Parker v.

Like Georgia, Alabama sheriffs are generally considered state actors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McMillian v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051507\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/1573/#p1578\">\n    88 F.3d 1573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1578 (11th Cir. 1996). The Eleventh Circuit found that\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided in part because the county government had no authority to control the actions of the sheriff that hired the abusive jailer.\n   <em>\n    Turquitt\n   </em>\n   reiterated that a \"local government 'must have power in an area in order to be held liable for an official's acts in that area.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051507\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/1573/#p1578\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    McMillian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051507\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/1573/#p1578\">\n    88 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1578 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Upon review of Alabama law, the court concluded that the county defendant in\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   had no power over the administration of the jail; rather, its power extended only to \"maintaining the jail's physical plant and providing operational funding.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1291. This not only affected the policy or custom issue, but it also defeated\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   causation because \"a local government can only be liable under \u00a7 1983 for injuries which the government itself caused and causation necessarily implies control.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1292 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Similarly, the County here has no inherent power over the district attorney when he draws up an indictment in the name of the State. Rather, this function is performed pursuant to his state-derived power, and he is responsible to the State in his performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   This case also entails an issue of causation. It cannot be fairly said that the County caused the alleged malicious prosecution. This is because it was the district attorney, acting in his capacity as a state prosecutor, who brought the criminal charges against Vandiver. The chain of causation between the County and the alleged injury broke when the district attorney exercised his power to proceed against Vandiver by way of a state indictment. Even though the County may have asked the district attorney to prosecute the violations, it had no power to make him do it by way of state indictment. Again, that power is vested in him from the State, and thus it is the State that has the authority to control the district attorney in this respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Aggravating the causation deficiency is that there is no suggestion that the County has the power to prevent or alter the district attorney's prosecutorial decision to bring the state indictment; that is, it has no say in the manner in which the district attorney exercises his authority to bring criminal prosecutions\n   <em>\n    on behalf of the State.\n   </em>\n   It therefore should not be held liable for actions it does not control or direct.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grech v.

The answer is no. The idea is that not only must there be approval of the alleged subordinate's unconstitutional conduct, but the approval must also be within the sphere of the final policymaker's authority. Here, as discussed above, the County's approval, to the extent it is manifest in the March 10 letter, has no authoritative relationship to the criminal proceedings by the district attorney. Its approval of the district attorney's actions, which were instigated on behalf of the state, did nothing\n   <em>\n    authoritative\n   </em>\n   to affect the proceedings because the County has no authority over the district attorney in this instance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Thus, the Court holds that Vandiver's ratification theory fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
