The Insurance Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties stipulate to the factual record, which is composed of three insurance policies and the operative complaint. ZAIC issued two insurance policies (\"\n   <strong>\n    the Zurich Policies\n   </strong>\n   \") and is a successor by merger to Assurance Company of America (\"\n   <strong>\n    ACA\n   </strong>\n   \") with respect to a third insurance policy (\"\n   <strong>\n    the Assurance Policy\n   </strong>\n   \"). Specifically:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1. The ACA issued a commercial insurance policy to Electricity Maine, effective November 1, 2011-November 1, 2012. Ex. B (ECF Nos. 39-4-39-7). This Assurance Policy included commercial general liability coverage and commercial umbrella coverage. The ACA and Electricity Maine cancelled this policy April 25, 2012, however ZAIC has since succeeded to the remaining rights and responsibilities under the Assurance Policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2. ZAIC issued a commercial insurance policy to Nudevco Partners, LLC, effective April 27, 2015-April 27, 2016 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Zurich Policy # 1\n   </strong>\n   \"). Ex. C (ECF Nos. 39-8-39-9). This policy included commercial general liability coverage. Spark Holdco was added as a named insured on this policy, effective July 8, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   3. ZAIC issued a commercial insurance policy to TexEx Energy Investments, LLC, effective April 27, 2016-April 27, 2017. This policy included commercial general liability coverage. Electricity Maine was added as a named insured, effective July 14, 2016. (\"\n   <strong>\n    Zurich Policy # 2\n   </strong>\n   \"). Ex. D (ECF No. 39-10).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   All three policies provide commercial liability coverage for \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" caused by an \"occurrence.\" Ex. B \u00a7 I(A)(1); Ex. C at 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Assurance Policy and Zurich Polices define bodily injury as \"bodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person. This includes mental anguish, mental injury, shock, fright or death resulting from bodily injury, sickness or disease.\" Ex. B \u00a7 V(3); Ex. C at 6. All three polices define an \"occurrence\" as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" Ex. B \u00a7 I(1)(a); Ex. C \u00a7 V(13). The policies exclude from coverage \" '[b]odily injury' or 'property damage' expected or\n   intended from the standpoint of the insured.\" Ex. B. \u00a7 I(2)(a); Ex. C \u00a7 I(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Pending Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The operative SAC in the lawsuit against the Defendants includes eight counts: violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"\n   <strong>\n    RICO\n   </strong>\n   \") and conspiracy to violate RICO (Counts I and II); violation of the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"\n   <strong>\n    UTPA\n   </strong>\n   \") (Count III); negligence (Count IV); negligent misrepresentation (Count V); fraudulent misrepresentation (Count VI); unjust enrichment (Count VII); and breach of contract (Count VIII). SAC (No. 16-cv-571-NT, ECF No. 50).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Defendants argue that because they are \"sued for claims of negligence and negligent misrepresentation,\" ZAIC owes them a duty to defend in the pending lawsuit. Defs.' Mot. 2. (ECF No. 40). ZAIC argues that the allegations do not fall within the insurance policy's requirement of an \"occurrence\" because the conduct was not accidental nor is there a possibility that the events giving rise to the lawsuit are within the policy coverage for \"bodily injury.\" Pl.'s Mot. 5, 13-14 (ECF No. 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Defendants' motion turns primarily on the negligence claim, and therefore I begin by applying the comparison test to the negligence count\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the insurance policy. The inquiry is whether the SAC \"reveals the existence of any legal or factual basis that could potentially be developed at trial and result in an award of damages covered by the terms of the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Harlor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193801\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/793/#p797\">\n    150 A.3d at 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ZAIC contends that the SAC forecloses the possibility of either an \"occurrence\" or of any \"bodily injury,\" both of which are required for coverage under the policies. With regard to an occurrence, defined in the policy as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions,\" Ex. B \u00a7 I(1)(a); Ex. C \u00a7 V(13), the SAC's negligence claim alleges that the Defendants breached their duty \"not to engage in fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive conduct, and not to misrepresent the cost of their services.\" SAC \u00b6 112. ZAIC asserts that the SAC is exclusively focused on intentional (as opposed to negligent) conduct, as it describes the Defendants' \"scheme,\" \"fraud,\" and \"deception\" to rope electricity customers into long-term and above-market-rate service contracts. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 1, 17-38. Because the conduct alleged is intentional, ZAIC argues, the negligence count is a throwaway. The Defendants rightly respond, however, that parties are permitted to plead in the alternative, Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(2)-(3), and that the duty to defend is so broadly conceived that even legally insufficient claims may give rise to a duty to defend if it possibly fits within the policy.\n   <em>\n    Travelers Indem. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11288445,11288471\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/414/220/\">\n    414 A.2d at 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The SAC's negligence-based Counts signal the plaintiffs' intent to seek relief from the Defendants even if the plaintiffs are unable to prove that the Defendants' alleged misconduct was intentional. And while fraudulent and deceptive conduct seems to embody intent, theoretically a party can mislead another without intending to do so. Accordingly, the SAC alleges an \"occurrence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11288445,11288471\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/414/220/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   I turn to whether there exists a possibility of recovery for bodily injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The injury articulated under the negligence count is \"significant economic harm in that Plaintiffs and Class Members have substantially overpaid for electricity supply services\" and the relief requested includes \"actual damages ... and any other relief that the Court deems just and proper.\" SAC \u00b6\u00b6 114-15. The SAC does not mention any kind of bodily injury expressly, including mental anguish. The Defendants contend, however, that the SAC's silence does not preclude the possibility of recovery. \"Although the terms 'emotional distress' and 'mental anguish' were not pled in the underlying class action complaint, the prayer for relief requests 'actual damages in an amount to be proven at trial,' \" and, the Defendants argue, it is possible that this relief would include emotional distress damages. Defs.' Mot. 9 (quoting SAC \u00b6 115).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Defendants rely particularly on\n   <em>\n    Harlor\n   </em>\n   , a Maine case in which emotional distress damages were not plead, but recovery of emotional damages was found to be possible.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193801\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/793/#p797\">\n    150 A.3d at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, too, the insurance policy included coverage for liability for bodily injury caused by an occurrence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193801\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/793/#p797\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193801\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/793/#p797\">\n    at 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the policy defined bodily injury as \"bodily harm, sickness or disease, including required care, loss of services and death that results\"). The defendant faced a lawsuit for interference with an advantageous relationship, which required the court to consider whether the complaint \"alleged facts that could give rise to the type of damages that would invoke [the insurance company's] duty to defend.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193801\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/793/#p797\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193801\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/793/#p797\">\n    at 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Declining to \"sp[eak] definitively\" on whether emotional distress damages were available on a claim of interference with an advantageous relationship, the court noted that the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 774(A)(1)(c) provided for emotional distress damages for an interference with a contract or prospective contractual\n   relationship, and the Law Court had previously found emotional distress damages available on a claim for interference with an expectancy of inheritance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193801\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/793/#p797\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court then turned back to the plaintiffs' allegations that they were damaged by the defendant's interference and unable to sell their house. The court found these allegations \"could have resulted in harm to the [plaintiffs], including bodily harm due to emotional distress.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193801\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/793/#p797\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193801\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/793/#p797\">\n    at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ZAIC \"agrees ... [that] the correct test for determining the duty to defend in this case\" is whether \"the claims asserted in the [SAC] can give rise to emotional distress damages.\" Pl.'s Reply 6 (ECF No. 47).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ZAIC does not dispute that in the context of a negligence action, \"a plaintiff may recover for emotional harm, including emotional distress, mental anguish, and loss of the enjoyment of life as part of the recovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Curran v.

Me. 2006). Instead, ZAIC attempts to side-step this point by reprising its argument, addressed above, that the SAC does not actually assert a simple negligence claim. This time, ZAIC insists that I must ignore the SAC's simple negligence count for the purposes of this motion because it is duplicative of the count for negligent misrepresentation. Pl.'s Opp'n 9 (ECF No. 43). I disagree. While the SAC's negligence claim may ultimately be \"legally insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss,\" it nevertheless \"shows an intent to state a claim within the insurance coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Travelers Indem.
