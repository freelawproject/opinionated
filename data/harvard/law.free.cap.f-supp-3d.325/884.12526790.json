HHS removed the motion (Dkt. 1), and moved to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). (Dkt. 6). The Director opposed dismissal and moved to remand. (Dkt. 14).

(Dkt. 1-1) at 2; (Dkt. 28) at 1-3. The Risk Adjustment Program is permanent, while the Reinsurance and Risk Corridor Programs were in effect for the years 2014, 2015, and 2016 only.

The Risk Adjustment Program is budget neutral, allocating only as much as is assessed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018042\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018042\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the meantime, Dowling, as the then-Acting Director of Insurance (\"Director\"), decided that Land of Lincoln's financial condition could be upended by its requirement to make the Risk Adjustment payment before receiving the Risk Corridor payments and therefore, on June 30, 2016, she informed HHS that she was exercising her authority under Illinois law to place Land of Lincoln under a \"state solvency payment restriction.\" This effectively prohibited HHS from \"offsetting\" future payments and required HHS to disburse to Land of Lincoln the outstanding Risk Corridor payments prior to Land of Lincoln making any the Risk Adjustment payments owed. (Dkt. 1-1) at 6. However, on July 11, 2016, HHS notified the Director that all future payments owed to Land of Lincoln would be offset by its outstanding Risk Adjustment liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 14, 2016, the Director, exercising her authority under state law, entered into an agreed order of rehabilitation with Land of Lincoln in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Chancery Division.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Pursuant to the order of rehabilitation, the state court enjoined \"[a]ny and all claimants and creditors of Land of Lincoln ... whether an individual ... [or] government entity ... from setting off or netting monies owed Land of Lincoln without the prior leave of this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.

On August 18, 2016, HHS reported to Land of Lincoln that it was withholding over $13 million in Reinsurance and other payments, applying that amount instead to Land of Lincoln's outstanding Risk Adjustment account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. On September 29, 2016, the state court entered an agreed order of liquidation; Land of Lincoln ceased operations as of October 1, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Director filed a motion for declaratory relief on December 23, 2016, seeking the state court to declare that HHS violated the rehabilitation order by unilaterally offsetting money owed to Land of Lincoln without first getting leave of the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt 1-1). The Director further requested the court, if it found HHS violated the order, to \"provide her with leave thereafter to seek an appropriate remedy if necessary or schedule a hearing on whether to allow [HHS's] offsets.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. In other words, the Director did not ask the state court to order that HHS release the funds, but only to declare that HHS had violated the court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   HHS removed the motion for declaratory relief on January 23, 2017, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

In its August 25, 2017 Order, the Court remanded the case to state court, finding that a motion for declaratory relief in a liquidation proceeding was not an \"ancillary proceeding\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1442. (Dkt. 36) at 3. The Court further found that the state court proceeding was not a \"civil action ... against or directed to\" the United States or any agency or officer thereof within the meaning of \u00a7 1442, because the underlying action constitutes a liquidation proceeding and merely involves the United States as a creditor with an interest in the insolvent estate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After the parties presented lengthy arguments concerning HHS's request for a stay of the remand pending appeal to the Seventh Circuit, the Court permitted the parties to submit additional position papers on the issue and deferred its written ruling to fully consider the stay issue, which was not addressed in substance in HHS's reconsideration briefing.

However, as the Director correctly points out ( (Dkt. 42) at 3-4), the reasoning relied on by the Court was raised by the Director (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 24) at 20-21 &amp; n.8), and was responded to by HHS in its reply brief. (Dkt. 28) at 16-17. In addition, recognizing the complexity of the jurisdiction question at hand, the Court finds no manifest error of law in its earlier conclusion that HHS failed to meet its burden of showing that this matter is removable under \u00a7 1442(a). Through its motion for reconsideration, HHS does little more than rehash arguments from its prior briefing and in doing so, HHS fails to demonstrate manifest error in Court's remand order concluding that Congress did not intend to permit the removal of matters such as the Motion for Declaratory Relief in a liquidation proceeding as an \"ancillary proceeding\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1442.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236862\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/224/601/#p606\">\n    224 F.3d at 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"manifest error\" is not demonstrated by the disappointment of the losing party, but instead by disregard, misapplication or failure to recognize controlling precedent).

The court elucidated four criteria to help determine whether a federal court should exercise its jurisdiction within the context of this industry: (1) whether the suit is based on a cause of action that is exclusively federal; (2) whether the suit requires the court to determine issues that are directly relevant to state policy in the regulation of the insurance industry; (3) whether state procedures indicate a desire to create special state forums to regulate and adjudicate the issues; (4) whether there are difficult or unusual state laws at issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534192\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/419/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 425 (citing\n   <em>\n    Grimes v.

This is an insurance insolvency case, which arises out of state law-HHS seeks only to raise federal law defenses.

Removal of (and subsequent disposal of) this matter will ultimately be disruptive of the state's efforts to establish a single, efficient, and uniform system of rehabilitating and liquidating insolvent insurance companies by encouraging the federal government to remove piecemeal portions relating to federal interests.

HHS makes an interesting argument in its stay position paper that the AC A is itself a \"federal regulation of insurance\" that cannot be subject to reverse-preemption, but this argument is not further developed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. 48) at 6.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hartland Lakeside Joint No. 3 Sch.

Regardless, and without venturing into the issue of whether Act reverse-preempts the removal statute, the Court recognizes the strong policy in favor of deferring to Illinois for the regulation of insurance. Piecemeal removal of this state insurance liquidation proceeding undoubtedly is disruptive to state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to insurance. Specifically, it would impair the comprehensive regulatory scheme for the rehabilitation and liquidation of defunct domestic insurance companies by frustrating the Director's ability to marshal the remaining funds and pay policyholders and creditors. Thus, the Act further weighs in favor of abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As a final point in favor of abstention, the Court notes that the Director seeks a declaration that HHS violated an earlier state court injunction-an order that barred\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of Land of Lincoln's creditors\n   from offsetting (or netting) future payments to the entity. Ostensibly, this is common practice in state insurance rehabilitation and liquidation actions to consolidate all of the distressed company's assets and to ensure creditors are paid pursuant to state law dictating priority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   215 ILCS 5/205 (laying out the priority of distribution of general assets of a liquidated Illinois insurance company). Injunctions of this sort are meant to prevent creditors from circumventing priority statutes-in essence, getting paid without getting in line-depriving higher priority creditors from money they are otherwise entitled to. What the Director is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   seeking is a declaration that HHS owes it millions of dollars in delinquent Risk Corridor payments, which is the subject of the case currently before the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. The\n   <em>\n    Hartford\n   </em>\n   court, in applying\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   abstention, recognized the importance to keeping liquidation proceedings together in state court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   In effect, Hartford is attempting to jump ahead of Centaur's other creditors by filing a lawsuit outside the state rehabilitation proceedings.... For a federal court to hear Hartford's present claim, however, it would have to determine the deficiency that Centaur will owe-an issue that will also be decided in the state rehabilitation court. The probability of inconsistent decisions between the state and federal systems would lead to incongruous results, with Hartford perhaps receiving more than it should have been entitled to receive. Allowing suits similar to Hartford's action to proceed would lead to a system where the states would not control the ultimate distribution to creditors of insolvent insurers. Such a federal usurpation of state control over insolvent insurers would be inconsistent with the McCarran-Ferguson Act and general notions of comity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Hartford Cas.

(Dkt. 48) at 4. Admittedly, this case involves complex issues of federal jurisdiction and statutory interpretation and the Court did not arrive at its conclusion lightly. Nevertheless, the this case must be remanded to state court because Congress did not intend to permit the removal of matters such\n   as Motion for Declaratory Relief in a liquidation proceeding as an \"ancillary proceeding\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1442 ; and even if this matter were properly removed, abstention is appropriate because of the \"the exercise of federal review ... would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy\" in state insurance rehabilitation and liquidation matters.\n   <em>\n    New Orleans Public Serv.

A movant's fear of harm occurring that is only speculative is insufficient to meet the definition of an irreparable injury.\n   <em>\n    In re Heotis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204310513\">\n    2017 WL 4310513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (citation and quotation omitted). \"Not only must the harm alleged rise above being speculative in nature, but to be considered irreparable, economic injury alone is ordinarily not enough.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204310513\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   HHS argues that it will suffer two distinct irreparable injuries absent a stay. First, HHS argues that the denial of a stay will undermine (or be inconsistent with) the policy embodied in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), which specifically permits an appeal of \"an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1442....\" According to HHS, the direct access to an appeal by a federal actor under \u00a7 1447(d)\"underscores the sovereign and institutional interests at stake in denying a federal actor's removal request when a state court order is sought against it,\" and that \"[d]enying a stay subverts this policy and inflicts the irreparable harm that \u00a7\u00a7 1442 and 1447(d) seek to avoid-deprivation of the federal forum.\" (Dkt. 48) at 4. But denial of a stay during appeal does not injure HHS's \"sovereign and institutional\" interests that are purportedly embodied in \u00a7 1447(d), yet alone irreparably injure them. Nothing in the language of \u00a7 1447(d) militates in favor of a stay pending appeal. Congress merely provided the Government or its Officers the right to appeal a district court's order remanding a case removed from state court under \u00a7 1442 or \u00a7 1443, a right denied parties seeking to remove to federal court on diversity grounds. And it was only with the 2011 amendment to \u00a7 1447 that an order remanding a case removed under \u00a7 1442 was granted a direct right of appeal. While there can be no doubt that HHS may appeal this order remanding the case to state court pursuant to the 2011 amendment, the overall policy embodied in \u00a7 1447(d) remains unchanged: \"Congress ... established the policy of not permitting interrupting of the litigation of the merits of a removed cause by prolonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is removed.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"414123\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/327/742/#p751\">\n    327 U.S. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 751,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"414123\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/327/742/#p751\">\n    66 S.Ct. 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"414123\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/327/742/#p751\">\n    90 L.Ed. 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1946). Had Congress seen fit, it could have required district courts to stay order remanding a case removed under \u00a7 1442, but it did not. Moreover, HHS may move the appellate court for a stay pending its decision if it chooses to appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(2)(A)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Second, HHS contends that on remand, an adverse judgment against it in the state liquidation proceeding \"could cast doubt on HHS's administration of the risk-adjustment program and create uncertainty for issuers that depend on the integrity of this program,\" because \"the risk-adjustment charges owed by Land of Lincoln and collected by HHS via offset have already\n   been paid to other issuers in the Illinois market....\" (Dkt. 48) at 5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Gerhart v. HHS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208839016\">\n    2016 WL 8839016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *8 (S.D. Iowa Aug. 12, 2016) ). In other words, HHS raises the specter that an adverse ruling against it in the state liquidation proceeding will call into question the validity of the Risk Adjustment Program and the ACA as a whole by preventing it from enforcing its own regulations, particularly those relating to netting or offsetting. As is evident, this argument is based on speculation and fear that the state court will reject all of the defenses HHS raises there and rules against it. This is insufficient to establish irreparable harm in this analysis.\n   <em>\n    In re Heotis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204310513\">\n    2017 WL 4310513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   11A Charles A. Wright\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   , Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 2948.1 (3d ed.) (\"Speculative injury is not sufficient; there must be more than an unfounded fear.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For this point, HHS relies on\n   <em>\n    Gerhart v. HHS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208839016\">\n    2016 WL 8839016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Iowa Aug. 12, 2016). As an initial matter, the posture of the parties in\n   <em>\n    Gerhart\n   </em>\n   was substantively different than presented here. In\n   <em>\n    Gerhart\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff-liquidator filed a motion for preliminary injunction and declaratory judgment in federal court seeking relief that would require HHS to engage in Iowa state court proceedings; therefore, the liquidator, not HHS, bore the burden of proof to establish an irreparable harm. On this point, the court found that the liquidator's alleged harms-inability to conduct the liquidation process and prejudice to other creditors (similar to the arguments made by the Director here)-was not irreparable as required for preliminary relief, particularly because money damages for retroactive payments would be sufficient to address them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7-8. The court noted that the injunctive relief could be denied on this basis alone, but continued to balance the harms presented by both parties. In doing so, the court found that the harm to HHS in the interrupted administration of the ACA was greater than the harm presented by the liquidators.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. Even if the Court were to adopt the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Gerhart\n   </em>\n   regarding the balancing of the harms, the point remains that-as discussed above-HHS has not carried its burden to demonstrate that any\n   <em>\n    irreparable\n   </em>\n   harm will result absent a stay pending its potential appeal to the Seventh Circuit. Even the\n   <em>\n    Gerhart\n   </em>\n   court noted that the harm to HHS there was HHS's potential inability to collect payments from the bankrupt insurance company which would have been \"burdensome\" and which would have \"hamper[ed] the administration of the risk adjustment program in Iowa and of the ACA as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Gerhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208839016\">\n    2016 WL 8839016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. Even this language does not suggest an irreparable injury that lacks any remedy at law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In refuting the Director's claim of hardship and in support of a stay, HHS cites to a case in which it claims the liquidator's interests \"are not meaningfully different\" from the Director's interests here:\n   <em>\n    Farmer v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323702\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/132/343/\">\n    132 Fed.Cl. 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ct. Cl. 2017), where in the Court of Federal Claims granted the government's motion to stay the proceedings. But the circumstances under which the stay was granted in\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   are markedly different from those faced by the Director and HHS in the present matter. In\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   , the insurance-liquidator plaintiffs are seeking the recovery of approximately $92 million in Risk Corridor payments. After the case was filed, the government nearly immediately moved for a stay of the proceedings pending the Federal Circuit's forthcoming decisions in two on-point cases-the relevance of which was not disputed by either party in\n   <em>\n    Farmer.\n   </em>\n   \"[G]iven the symmetry of issues involved\" and the \"advanced stage\" of the appeals at issue, the court granted the stay because it would \"serve the valuable\n   purpose of preserving the resources of both the parties and the court. These cases will proceed more efficiently and more productively with the forthcoming guidance from the Federal Circuit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323702\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/132/343/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323702\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/132/343/\">\n    at 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the liquidators in\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   and the Director here may have similar interests, the circumstances underlying the stay requests in that case and this case are so different that the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   is wholly inapplicable. For one thing, the stay in\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   was said to promote efficiency and conservation of resources; a stay in this proceeding would have the opposite effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Here, the state court still must adjudicate the motion for declaratory relief filed by the Director. As the Director points out in her stay position paper, the next step following a declaration in state court could be a hearing to determine if HHS should be allowed to offset the credits as it did, offset the credits and debts differently, or not. (Dkt. 49) at 5. Even assuming the possibility that the state court enters an adverse judgment against it, HHS may avail itself of the state appellate process, and ultimately seek review by the Supreme Court. In addition, it may seek direct appeal of this Order by the Seventh Circuit. Accordingly, HHS's alleged harm is neither immediate nor irreparable. The harm alleged by the Director includes further impairing the efficient administration of the liquidated estate to the detriment of Land of Lincoln's former policyholders, as discussed below. Considering the alleged harms, the balance tips in favor of the Director.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At the time the Director filed her state court motion for declaratory relief, HHS had set-off over $13 million that otherwise would have been paid to the estate and subsequently to policyholders that incurred additional deductible and co-payments as a result of Land of Lincoln insolvency three months prior to the end of the plan year. (Dkt. 49) at 12-13. HHS has continued to offset payments, and has now withheld a total of more than $27 million.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323702\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/132/343/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The projected outstanding claims for reimbursement made by former Land of Lincoln policyholders totals some $50 million. In the absence of the offset amount, the Director only has been able to distribute approximately 25% of the claim payments to date.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323702\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/fed-cl/132/343/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is a concrete public interest in continuation of the liquidation proceedings to ensure those policyholders that were forced to endure additional healthcare expenses as a result are compensated. For brief background, Land of Lincoln entered into liquidation three months prior to the end of the policy year, requiring policyholders to find coverage for the remainder of that year. (Dkt. 42) at 13-14. Some policyholders were placed in the unenviable position of finding short-term health coverage and restarting their co-payment and deductible amounts from zero. In contrast, the Court finds public interest invoked by HHS harder to wrap its head around-that somehow an adverse ruling in a state liquidation proceeding will bring the entire insurance market to its knees. (Dkt. 48) at 8-9. The line of causation is too tenuous. Thus, this factor weighs in the Director's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Defendant HHS's motion to reconsider (Dkt. 38), including its request for a stay pending appeal, is denied.
