VANCE, Chair\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    Before the Panel:\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs in three actions pending in the Middle District of Florida move under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to centralize pretrial proceedings in this litigation in the Southern District of Florida. The motion involves nine actions pending in the Middle District of Florida and one action pending in the Northern District of Florida, as listed on Schedule A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties have notified the Panel of 49 additional actions involving related issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Plaintiffs in two tag-along actions pending in the Middle District of Florida support centralization.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff in another Middle District of Florida tag-along opposes centralization. All responding defendants also oppose centralization.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On the basis of the papers filed and the hearing session held, we deny plaintiffs' motion. These actions possess only a superficial factual commonality-all plaintiffs allege that they suffered property damage as a result of one or another of several hurricanes, and that their respective insurance companies breached the terms of plaintiffs' policies by settling plaintiffs' claims for amounts lower than the losses actually sustained. Each case necessarily involves a different property, different insureds, different witnesses, different proofs of loss, and different damages. The\n   very nature of the cases ensures that unique issues concerning each plaintiff's loss, claim, investigation, and claim handling will predominate, and will overwhelm any efficiencies that centralization might achieve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The widely varying procedural posture of the cases further weighs against centralization. In four of the ten actions, discovery has either been completed or is scheduled to be completed by early July. The ostensibly related actions, too, are not all newly-filed cases. Eighteen of them were commenced in 2017. And thirteen others have been either dismissed via settlement or otherwise resolved, as have two of the original twelve constituent actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the motion for centralization of these actions is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    SCHEDULE A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   MDL No. 2844 -\n   <strong>\n    IN RE: FLORIDA, PUERTO RICO, AND U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS 2016 AND 2017 HURRICANE SEASONS FLOOD CLAIMS LITIGATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Middle District of Florida\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   NETKA v.
