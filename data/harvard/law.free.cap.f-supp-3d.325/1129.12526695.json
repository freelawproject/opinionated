Langhoff, P.C., Denver, CO, for Defendant.\n   </attorneys>\n   <opinion id=\"p-25\">\n    Plaintiffs assert two theories to support Mr. Woodward's claim that he is a member of a protected class under Title VII. The first theory is that Mr. Woodward was not hired because of sex-stereotyping discrimination. That is, he experienced discrimination because his appearance (that of a stereotypical male) did not conform to social expectations of a person with his birth sex (female). The second theory is that Title VII prohibitions of discrimination \"because of...sex\" protect transgender individuals categorically.\n   </opinion>\n   <opinion id=\"p-33\">\n    Here, plaintiffs allege facts that plausibly suggest sex-based consideration played a role in the decision not to hire Mr. Woodward. Plaintiffs allege that at Mr. Woodward's interview, the manager and Mr. Woodward got along well and the manager offered Mr. Woodward the job upon his completion of pre-employment testing. ECF No. 1 \u00b6 33 &amp; 40. After Mr. Woodward left this meeting, he received a call from the manager who inquired about Mr. Woodward indicating his sex as female on his background check form. ECF No.1 \u00b6 46. After Mr. Woodward confirmed this information, the manager ended the call with no further follow-up questions regarding Mr. Woodward's candidacy. A &amp; E Tires then accepted an application from a different applicant, interviewed this other applicant, and hired him.

Factual Background\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-12\">\n     For present purposes the Court construes the well-pleaded allegations of fact in plaintiffs' complaints as true. Plaintiffs allege that on May 15, 2014 A &amp; E posted an ad for a managerial position online. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 16. Mr. Woodward, a transgender man, completed an application and provided A &amp; E with a copy of his resume on May 16, 2014.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 17-18. On the same day, an A &amp; E manager interviewed Mr. Woodward for roughly 45 minutes.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 21-23, 25. During said interview, Mr. Woodward wore traditional male attire and a goatee, and the manager did not recognize that Mr. Woodward was transgender.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 24, 25. Mr. Woodward and the manager apparently got along well during the interview and connected over their Midwestern roots.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 26-27, 29.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-13\">\n     The two discussed salary expectations, and the manager stated at least twice that Mr. Woodward had the job if he could pass pre-employment testing such as a drug test and criminal background check.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 30-33, 40. The manager then gave Mr. Woodward a tour of the company's premises, taking Mr. Woodward to various locations around the property and introducing him as the new manager to any employees they met along the way.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 36. The manager also asked Mr. Woodward for design input on the new offices, asking him to draw up some plans.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-14\">\n     Mr. Woodward completed a screening consent form which authorized the background check.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 42. In response to questions on that form, Mr. Woodward provided the name he was assigned at birth, which is typically associated with the female sex, and also checked a box indicating that his sex was female.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 42-44. After Mr. Woodward left A &amp; E Tire, he received a phone call from the manager who said something to the effect of \"I see on your drug test that you checked female.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 46. Mr. Woodward confirmed that this was correct, and the manager stated \"Oh, that's all I need\" and abruptly hung up.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 47-48.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-15\">\n     In the following weeks, Mr. Woodward contacted A &amp; E several times in order to discuss completing the background screenings and starting work.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 49. On June 10, 2014-a little less than a month since he was loosely promised the job-Mr. Woodward finally spoke with the manager.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 51. Mr. Woodward was informed that the position was given to another applicant, who had applied on May 21, interviewed on June 6, and began work on June 10, 2014.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 52-54.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-16\">\n     <strong>\n      B. Procedural Background\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-17\">\n     Mr. Woodward filed a charge with the EEOC alleging violations of Title VII by A &amp; E Tire. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 6. Title VII of the Civil Rights Acts prohibits discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion, or national origin.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1) (providing, in relevant part, \"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer...to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge...or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his [or her] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race,\n     color, religion, sex, or national origin.\"). The EEOC is a governmental agency charged with the administration, interpretation and enforcement of Title VII and is expressly authorized to bring federal actions for violations of such.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1) and (3).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-18\">\n     Here, after Mr. Woodward filed a charge with the EEOC, the EEOC provided A &amp; E Tire with notice of the charge against it. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 7-8. After conducting its own investigation, the Commission issued a determination on June 30, 2016, informing A &amp; E that the EEOC had reasonable cause to believe that A &amp; E Tire had violated Title VII when it failed to hire Mr. Woodward \"because of his sex, male, and/or transgender status.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 9-10. The EEOC invited A &amp; E Tire to join it in informal methods of conciliation in an effort to eliminate the unlawful employment practices and provide appropriate relief.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 11. A &amp; E Tire participated in conciliation, but ultimately the EEOC and A &amp; E Tire were unable to reach an agreement acceptable to the EEOC.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 12-13. As such, on June 27, 2017, the Commission issued A &amp; E Tire a Notice of Failure of Conciliation.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 14.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-19\">\n     On September 29, 2017, the EEOC filed this suit against A &amp; E Tire. ECF No. 1. On November 10, 2017 Mr. Woodward filed an unopposed motion to intervene, ECF No. 9, which was granted. ECF No. 10. On November 13, 2017 Mr. Woodward filed his complaint. ECF No. 11. On December 15, 2017 A &amp; E Tire filed motions to dismiss both complaints. ECF Nos. 18, 19. The EEOC and Mr. Woodward filed a joint response, ECF No. 27, and A &amp; E Tire filed a reply.

ECF No. 18 at 2.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-24\">\n     To establish a prima facie case in the failure to hire context under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that: (1) plaintiff belongs to a protected class; (2) the plaintiff applied for and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (3) despite being qualified, the plaintiff was rejected; and (4) after the plaintiff's rejection, the position remained open\n     and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of plaintiff's qualifications.\n     <em>\n      Garrison v.

City of Salem\n     </em>\n     , which explained that \"sex stereotyping based on a person's gender nonconforming behavior is impermissible discrimination, irrespective of the cause of that behavior; a label, such as 'transsexual,' is not fatal to a sex discrimination claim where the victim has suffered discrimination because of his or her gender non-conformity.\"\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9214399\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/378/566/#p575\">\n      378 F.3d 566\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 575 (6th Cir. 2004).

Plaintiffs allege that the manager asked Mr. Woodward one follow-up question between the informal employment offer and the decision not to hire Mr. Woodward. This question concerned Mr. Woodward's sex. Mr. Woodward's appearance at his interview was that of a stereotypical male. On his background check form he indicated that his sex was female. These alleged facts permit a reasonable inference that Mr. Woodward's traits, behavior, or appearance at the interview, in not conforming to the stereotypical expectations of the sex he indicated on his background check form, affected the manager's decision. Defendant claims that the logical connection between the manager's \"innocent inquiry\" and the conclusion that this inquiry played a role in the hiring decision is \"nothing more than surmise.\" ECF. No. 34 at n.1, 4. The Court disagrees - at the motion to dismiss stage, plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim, and defendant will have ample opportunity to contest the motivations underlying the inquiry.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-35\">\n     Defendant also argues that plaintiffs' reference to\n     <em>\n      Smith\n     </em>\n     and\n     <em>\n      Tudor\n     </em>\n     is misplaced, because in those cases the plaintiffs had numerous and detailed examples of workplace discrimination, while Mr. Woodward's factual allegations are comparatively bare. ECF No. 34 at 2-3 (referring to\n     <em>\n      Tudor v. SE. Okla. State Univ.\n     </em>\n     , CIV-15-324-C,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204606079\">\n      2015 WL 4606079\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (W.D. Okla., July 10, 2015) ;\n     <em>\n      Smith v. City of Salem,\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9214399\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/378/566/#p575\">\n      378 F.3d 566\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (6th Cir. 2004) ). This argument fails for two reasons. First, the plaintiffs in the cited cases were bringing claims of harassment and discrimination in jobs they held, as opposed to claiming a discriminatory failure to hire. Presumably the\n     <em>\n      Smith\n     </em>\n     and\n     <em>\n      Tudor\n     </em>\n     plaintiffs would have more experiences with discrimination in a workplace they spend their days in than in a 45-minute interview and follow-up phone call. To require Mr. Woodward to allege a similar record of discrimination would essentially preclude failure to hire claims. The issue in Title VII is 'was the employment decision based on sex?' not 'how much harassment did plaintiff experience?' While the second question may be useful in proving the first, it's not dispositive here.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-36\">\n     Second, the defendant argues that in both cited cases there are many examples of how the plaintiffs were subjected to discrimination because of nonconformance with sex-based stereotypes, whereas Mr. Woodward only alleges he is a transgender man to support his claim. ECF No. 34, at 4. In resolving this motion, the Court need not ignore common sense. Mr. Woodward did not conform to the sex-based expectations of a person born a woman-the manager wouldn't have called him in confusion about the sex he indicated on his background check form if he did. Perhaps the manager did not take Mr. Woodward's gender nonconformance into account when deciding not to hire him. But, at the motion to dismiss stage, the Court believes that the plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-37\">\n     <strong>\n      B. Transgender Identity as a Protected Class - Scope of Title VII\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-38\">\n     <em>\n      Etsitty\n     </em>\n     held that Title VII's prohibition on discrimination \"based on...sex\" did not include transgender people as a class.\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5524776\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/1215/#p1222\">\n      502 F.3d at 1222\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . Plaintiffs suggest that \"[i]f the Court finds it necessary to look beyond a sex-stereotyping theory, the Complaints also plausibly allege a claim of discrimination because of sex under Title VII.\" ECF No. 27 at 10. They argue that\n     <em>\n      Etsitty\n     </em>\n     left space \"for arguments regarding the evolving understanding of the definition of 'sex',\" and that while it is not necessary to resolving the motion to dismiss, \"the portion of\n     <em>\n      Etsitty\n     </em>\n     that addresses the definition\n     of sex should also be reconsidered.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 12.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-39\">\n     I decline the invitation to weigh in on the issue in this case. It is not for this Court to modify or reconsider a Tenth Circuit order. Nor in any event is it necessary to the decision on the pending motion, as plaintiffs themselves acknowledge. The Court finds that plaintiffs' Complaints provide sufficient factual material to state a viable claim that is plausible on its face. Accordingly, defendant's motions to dismiss [ECF Nos. 18, 19] are DENIED.\n    </p>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
