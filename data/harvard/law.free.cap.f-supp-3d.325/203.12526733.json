Summers is the President of Jeffrey's House, a non-profit entity that operates four sober houses at 499 Water Street, 10 Burnett Street, 33 Garnett Street and 205/207 High Street in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. D. 54, \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. The sober houses offer living quarters to a group of people recovering from drug and/or alcohol addiction to provide peer support and maintain their sobriety. D. 54, \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 2, 2013, the Worcester Telegram and Gazette Published an article about the 499 Water Street property after local health inspectors were not permitted to inspect the property. D. 54, \u00b6 10. On April 17, 2013, Stephens, a Fitchburg health inspector, inspected the 499 Water Street house. D. 54, \u00b6 12. After discovering numerous violations of Massachusetts sanitary code, Stephens sent Plaintiffs a letter describing the violations and that they must take action to correct them within thirty days of the notice. D. 54, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. On May 13, 2013, Stephens and Moran, a Fitchburg building inspector, inspected 499 Water Street again and confirmed that most of the violations had been fixed, but some repair of handrails still needed to be completed. D. 54, \u00b6 14. On August 21, 2013, Summers met with Stephens, Moran and Lanciani, the former Fitchburg Building Commissioner. D. 54, \u00b6 15. Stephens, Moran and Lanciani told Summers that the sober houses were violating local zoning ordinances and asked him to cease operating them, which Summers refused to do. D. 54, \u00b6 16. On September 11, 2013, Fitchburg officials inspected 499 Water Street again, confirming that all the issues identified in the April 2013 inspection had been corrected. D. 54, \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 5, 2013, Fitchburg sent Summers a letter notifying him that the 10 Burnett Street house was being operated as a rooming or boarding house and was thus in violation of local zoning ordinances. D. 54, \u00b6 18. On January 22, 2015, Fitchburg sent Summers another letter notifying him that the 33 Garnett Street house was also violating local zoning ordinances. D. 54, \u00b6 19. After Summers took no action to correct these violations, Goldstein, the Assistant City Solicitor, filed an enforcement action in Worcester Housing Court. D. 54, \u00b6 20. At a hearing addressing all outstanding violations in the sober houses, Summers asked that Fitchburg provide reasonable accommodation from the zoning laws on the basis of the residents' disabilities due to alcohol or drug dependency. D. 54, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. Summers agreed to send a letter to Fitchburg, which he did on May 5, 2014, memorializing his request at the hearing and giving other information about the sober houses, including the number of occupants. D. 54, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24. On May 30, 2014, Lanciani sent a letter to Summers granting the reasonable accommodation request. D. 54, \u00b6 25. Goldstein then voluntarily dismissed the pending action in Worcester Housing Court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9368129\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/97/#p102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 10, 2014, Tata, a member of the Fitchburg Fire Prevention Bureau, sent Summers a letter informing him that three of the sober houses, classified as lodging homes, were required to install fire suppression or sprinkler systems under Mass. Gen. L. c. 148, \u00a7 26H (the \"Sprinkler Law\"), which requires lodging or boarding homes housing six or more individuals not\n   within the second degree of kindred to the person conducting it to install a fire suppression system, D. 54, \u00b6 26. The letter provided a six-month period to install the fire suppression system, consistent with the Sprinkler Law, but Plaintiffs did not install the system or appeal the determination. D. 54, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. On February 20, 2015, Tata sent a second letter to Plaintiffs notifying them that they had been fined $1,000 due to the failure to comply by installing a fire suppression system. D. 54, \u00b6 30. Plaintiffs still did not install a fire suppression system, nor did they pay the fine, after which Goldstein began a new enforcement action in Worcester Housing Court on April 9, 2015. D. 54, \u00b6 31. The housing court determined that Plaintiffs were obligated to comply with the Sprinkler Law by installing a fire suppression system in each of the sober houses. D. 54, \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 17, 2015, at a subsequent hearing, Summers proposed lowering the occupancy of each of the sober houses to five or fewer people to become exempted from the requirements of the Sprinkler Law until the dispute could be fully adjudicated. D. 54, \u00b6 33. On July 28, 2015, Goldstein sent Summers a letter asking that he memorialize this representation of his intent to lower the occupancy levels, and that he also agree to allow the Fire Department to conduct \"sporadic inspections\" to verify occupancy. D. 54, \u00b6 34. Viewing the proposed inspections as a violation of the sober houses' occupants' rights as disabled individuals, Summers decided not lower the occupancy levels of the sober houses, and maintained his refusal to install fire suppression systems. D. 54, \u00b6\u00b6 35-37, 39. Summers represented to Goldstein in a phone call that he believed the inspections would be disruptive for the occupants and would potentially cause them anxiety due to their disabilities. D. 54, \u00b6 37. Summers also viewed the cost of installing fire suppression systems, which he estimated to be between $35,000 and $40,000 per house, as prohibitive. D. 54, \u00b6 38. Summers did not consider any alternative mechanism by which Fitchburg could be permitted to verify the proposed lowered occupancy levels. D. 54, \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs instituted this action on September 14, 2015. D. 1. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint (the \"FAC\") on February 18, 2016. D. 18. On September 15, 2016, the Court allowed in part and denied in part Defendants' motion to dismiss the FAC, dismissing Plaintiffs' claims for attorney's fees and costs (Count I), abuse of process (Count II), private nuisance (FAC Count III), intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count VI), and interference with advantageous business relations (Count VII), leaving Counts IV and V as the only remaining claims. D. 31. On December 16, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint (\"SAC\"), which reasserted Counts I, II, IV, V, VI, and VII,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as a new claim for civil conspiracy to interfere with civil rights (SAC Count III). D. 44. The parties proceeded with discovery. The Court heard the parties on the pending motion and took this matter under advisement. D. 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Counts III, IV and V Are The Only Remaining Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court clarifies that there are only three claims remaining in this case. Plaintiffs reasserted Counts I,\n   II, IV, V, VI, and VII in the SAC, but pursuant to its Memorandum and Order allowing in part and denying in part Defendants' motion to dismiss, D. 31, the Court dismissed Counts I, II, VI and VII. Although the Court dismissed Counts II, VI and VII without prejudice, contemplating the possibility of an amendment, D. 31 at 11, there are no new allegations in the SAC that would distinguish the reasserted claims from those the Court had previously dismissed in the FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs have also reasserted Counts IV and V under theories of discrimination or disparate impact in the imposition of the fines, D. 44, \u00b6\u00b6 34-40, which the Court dismissed, D. 31 at 17, but do not include any new factual allegations that would support these claims. Moreover, it appears that Plaintiffs' brief concedes that the only remaining active claims are SAC Count III, and Counts IV and V under a reasonable accommodation theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. 64 at 10-13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court considers only SAC Count III and Counts IV and V under a reasonable accommodation theory as the remaining live claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Counts IV And V-Reasonable Accommodation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   under a reasonable accommodation theory requires: \"(1) a qualifying disability; (2) knowledge on the part of the defendant of the disability ...; (3) a request for accommodation that is both reasonable and necessary to allow equal opportunity for use and enjoyment of the housing; and (4) [ ] the defendant refused to make the requested accommodation.\"\n   <em>\n    PSI, LLC v.
