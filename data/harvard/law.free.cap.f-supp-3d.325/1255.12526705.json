(Doc. 1). Ms. Glennon also brings claims for libel, invasion of privacy, outrage, and tortious interference with business relations under Alabama law. (Doc. 1). Defendant Mollie Rosenblum has not appeared or otherwise defended this case. On June 20, 2017, the Clerk made an entry of default against Ms. Rosenblum. (Doc. 27). Ms. Glennon since has filed a motion for summary judgment against Ms. Rosenblum. (Doc. 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On April 23, 2018, the Court notified Ms. Glennon that, in light of the Clerk's entry of default against Ms. Rosenblum, the Court was inclined to construe her motion for summary judgment as a motion for default judgment. (Doc. 37). Because Ms. Glennon has not objected to this approach, the Court construes her motion as one for default judgment. For the reasons stated below, the Court grants Ms. Glennon's motion and enters judgment in her favor on her claims against Ms. Rosenblum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Second, after entry of the clerk's default, if the defendant is not an infant or an incompetent person, a court may enter a default judgment against the defendant because of the defendant's failure to appear or defend. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2). \"A default judgment must not differ in kind from, or exceed in amount, what is demanded in the pleadings.\" Fed. R. Civ.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although Ms. Rosenblum has not appeared in this action, she has submitted an affidavit to Ms. Glennon's counsel in which she recounts her role in the facts underlying this case. (Doc. 33-2). The Court relies on Ms. Rosenblum's affidavit, Ms. Glennon's affidavit, and the allegations in Ms. Glennon's second amended complaint to establish the facts examined in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Monika Glennon is a real estate agent with RE/MAX Alliance in Huntsville, Alabama. (Doc. 18, \u00b6 10). In 2013, Ms. Glennon hired a photographer to take a professional portrait of her which Ms. Glennon since has used to promote her business in paper and digital media. (Doc. 18, \u00b6 11; Doc. 18-2, p. 2). The photographer later transferred ownership of the image to Ms. Glennon, and Ms. Glennon copyrighted the image. (Doc. 18, \u00b6 12; Doc. 18-2, p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 16, 2015, Ms. Rosenblum anonymously posted a story purportedly about Ms. Glennon to a website called \"She's a Homewrecker.\" (Doc. 18, \u00b6 14; Doc. 33-2, \u00b6 4). The website markets itself as a forum in which aggrieved wives can publically shame women who allegedly have committed adultery with their husbands. (Doc. 18, \u00b6 13; Doc. 18-3, pp. 2-3.) Ms. Rosenblum narrated her tale of salacious events from the perspective of such a wife and included Ms. Glennon's full name and her professional portrait in the posting. (Doc. 18, \u00b6 14; Doc. 18-3, p. 2; Doc. 33-2, \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Rosenblum asserted that she and her husband hired Ms. Glennon to help with their search for a new home in the Huntsville area. (Doc. 18-2, p. 2; Doc. 33-2, \u00b6 5). According to Ms. Rosenblum, when she arrived at a potential property, she found her husband inside the house engaging in sexual acts with Ms. Glennon. (Doc. 18-3, pp. 2-3; Doc. 33-2, \u00b6 5). In the story\n   that she posted, Ms. Rosenblum graphically recounted the details of the alleged adulterous encounter, referring to Ms. Glennon as \"a nasty slut,\" and \"a disgusting skank of a woman.\" (Doc. 18-3, p. 3; Doc. 33-2, \u00b6 6). Ms. Rosenblum concluded the post by telling readers: \"DO NOT USE THIS WOMAN AS A REALTOR.\" (Doc. 18-3, p. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As both the complaint and the parties' affidavits indicate, the story was false. (Doc. 18, \u00b6 18; Doc. 33-2, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 17, 18). In fact, when she posted the story, Ms. Rosenblum had not met Ms. Glennon. (Doc. 33-1, \u00b6 5; Doc. 33-2, \u00b6 13). Neither Ms. Rosenblum nor her husband, who was deceased at the time of the alleged encounter, ever hired Ms. Glennon as a realtor. (Doc. 33-1, \u00b6 5; Doc. 33-2, \u00b6 13). Although Ms. Rosenblum's motives for targeting Ms. Glennon are not clear, she alludes to having read online posts by Ms. Glennon which led Ms. Rosenblum to believe, incorrectly, that Ms. Glennon was anti-Semitic. (Doc. 33-2, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The false story about Ms. Glennon became one of the most popular pieces on \"She's a Homewrecker,\" and it attracted a substantial amount of commentary from readers of the site who referred to Ms. Glennon as a \"tramp,\" among other things. (Doc. 18, \u00b6 16; Doc. 18-3, pp. 3-6; Doc. 33-2, \u00b6 9). Readers then shared the story in other online forums including Facebook and the website \"BadBiz Report.\" (Doc. 33-2, \u00b6 9). The story reached the height of its popularity when it was picked up by the news outlet AL.com and by a local television station. (Doc. 33-1, \u00b6 7; Doc. 33-2, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 12). Ms. Rosenblum's story also was reposted on RE/MAX's website. (Doc. 33-1, \u00b6 11; Doc. 33-2, \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sometime after posting the story, Ms. Rosenblum relented and contacted various websites where the story was posted in an unsuccessful attempt to have it removed. (Doc. 33-2, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21). The websites that continue to make the story available have informed both Ms. Glennon and Ms. Rosenblum that they will not de-index the story without a court order declaring the story to be false. (Doc. 33-1, \u00b6 14; Doc. 33-2, \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

(Doc. 18, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 20). Ms. Rosenblum's publication of the false story to which the image was attached is the basic factual nucleus underlying each of Ms. Glennon's state law tort claims.

As evidence of this unauthorized publication, Ms. Glennon offers a copy of the webpage displaying Ms. Rosenblum's story including the protected image of Ms. Glennon. (Doc. 18-3, p. 2). Ms. Rosenblum admits that she copied and posted the image without authorization, and she does not contend that the image lacks the requisite originality to qualify for copyright protection.

Invasion of Privacy (False Light)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Ms. Glennon's third claim against Ms. Rosenblum is for invasion of privacy. Conduct that places \"the plaintiff in a false, but not necessarily defamatory, position in the public eye\" may be actionable under Alabama law as a tortious invasion of the plaintiff's privacy.\n   <em>\n    Johnston v.

(Doc. 18, \u00b6 16; Doc. 33-2, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11, 12). There is little doubt that the reasonable person would find it highly offensive to be portrayed as adulterous and unprofessional, the manner in which Ms. Rosenblum' s story portrayed Ms. Glennon.

Ms. Rosenblum admits that she \"posted the story on public websites maliciously and with the intent to cause harm to Mrs. Glennon.\" (Doc. 33-2, \u00b6 5). To cause the intended harm, Ms. Rosenblum crafted a story with explicit details that portrayed Ms. Glennon as a shameful, untrustworthy person. (Doc. 33-2, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6, 17). Ms. Rosenblum published this story in a public forum and responded to her own story with comments aimed at causing further damage to Ms. Glennon. (Doc. 33-1, \u00b6 7; Doc. 33-2, \u00b6 4). Ms. Glennon testifies that she suffered severe emotional distress and anxiety as she attempted to defend her reputation as a wife, a mother, and a professional against the attacks of strangers who had read the story online. (Doc. 33-1, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 12-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Public internet forums abound. It is intolerable in a civilized society for an individual to use these platforms to broadcast scandalous lies about a complete stranger. As this case illustrates, the internet amplifies the reach of such corrosive falsehoods while obscuring their source and support or the lack thereof. Not every case of\n   internet cruelty will surmount the high bar for outrage. But here, Ms. Rosenblum went through the trouble of couching her lies in an elaborate story, giving them an air of plausibility by setting them in the real estate context in which Ms. Glennon actually works. Ms. Rosenblum concedes that she published these lascivious falsehoods solely to inflict emotional and professional harm upon a woman she had never met. Ms. Rosenblum also chose a website that was public and evidently did not verify the content it offers so that the story would be broadly read. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that the elements of outrage have been satisfied. Therefore, Ms. Glennon is entitled to judgment on her claim for outrage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    g. Tortious Interference with Business Relationships\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Ms. Glennon's fifth cause of action against Ms. Rosenblum is for tortious interference with business relations. (Doc. 18, p. 8). Ms. Glennon alleges that \"much of her business depends on potential clients finding her through internet searches.\" (Doc. 18, \u00b6 18). And as a result of the story's popularity, the fictitious account her adulterous behavior is now among the top results produced by a search for Ms. Glennon's name. (Doc. 18, \u00b6 17). Ms. Glennon also points out that, in addition to relating the details of the fictitious encounter, Ms. Rosenblum admonished readers of the story \"DO NOT USE THIS WOMAN AS A REALTOR.\" (Doc. 18-3, p. 3 emphasis original). Ms. Rosenblum concedes that she harmed Ms. Glennon professionally. (Doc. 33-2, \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   To establish a prima facie case for tortious interference, Ms. Glennon must demonstrate \"(1) the existence of a protectable [sic] business relationship; (2) of which the defendant knew; (3) to which the defendant was a stranger; (4) with which the defendant intentionally interfered; and (5) damage.\"\n   <em>\n    White Sands Grp., L.L.C. v. PRS II, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7040394\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/5/#p14\">\n    32 So.3d 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 14 (Ala. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In her second amended complaint, Ms. Glennon alleges that she \"lost a significant amount of business during the months following the post directly related to her tarnished reputation.\" (Doc. 18, \u00b6 18). She elaborates on the nature of these lost relationships in her motion when she argues that she \"had a business relationship (or at least potential relationship) with the public as a real estate agent working for RE/MAX.\" (Doc. 34, p. 20). This theory and the underlying allegation are not adequate to show that Ms. Glennon is entitled to relief because she does not identify the existence a business relationship worthy of the law's protection. Although a business relationship need not be formalized in a contract to warrant protection,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White Sands\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7040394\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/5/#p14\">\n    32 So.3d at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a business person does not have a legally protectable relationship with every potential participant in their local market. Ms. Glennon may have lost certain opportunities because of Ms. Rosenblum's story, but without more in the way of factual detail, the Court cannot assess whether legally protectable relationships existed between Ms. Glennon and these potential clients. Thus, Ms. Glennon's general reference to the local real estate market does not establish the requisite business relationship without additional evidence indicating that Ms. Glennon had a connection with particular persons or opportunities that Ms. Rosenblum damaged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Ms. Glennon's testimony as to her existing clients is another matter. In her affidavit, Ms. Glennon testifies that she \"lost clients who were working with [her] at the time that the post was publicized on the internet, who later decided, as a result of Rosenblum's false and defamatory story, that they no longer wished to work with [her].\" (Doc. 33-1, \u00b6 11). Here,\n   Ms. Glennon's testimony indicates that the story cost her existing relationships with specific people or particular deals. Ms. Glennon testifies that she was already \"working with\" these people, suggesting that sufficiently definite business relationships had developed regardless of whether those relationships involved a binding commitment from either party.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teitel v.

Smyth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8943593\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/420/1225/\">\n    420 F.3d 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1232 n.13 (11th Cir. 2005). Thus, although a defaulted defendant admits well-pleaded allegations of liability, \"allegations relating to the amount of damages are not admitted by virtue of default.\"\n   <em>\n    PNCEF, LLC v. Hendricks Bldg. Supply, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4155454\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/740/1287/#p1292\">\n    740 F.Supp.2d 1287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1292 (S.D. Ala. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In her second amended complaint, Ms. Glennon requests several forms of monetary recovery: actual damages for the copyright infringement, compensatory and punitive damages, and the costs of filing\n   and sustaining this action. (Doc. 18, pp. 10-11). Ms. Glennon does not request a specific amount of damages. Ms. Glennon also asks the Court for a declaration that Ms. Rosenblum's story is defamatory and injunctive relief ordering the websites and outlets posting the story to deindex the story. (Doc. 18, p. 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court has already concluded that Ms. Rosenblum's story is defamatory. Therefore, the Court orders those websites still carrying Ms. Rosenblum's story to remove it from their platforms. The Court also orders that search engines, such as Google, de-index the story to ensure that it does not appear as a search result when Ms. Glennon's name is searched. The Court will set a hearing to discuss the issue of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court enters judgment in Ms. Glennon's favor on her claim for copyright infringement, her claim for libel, her claim for invasion of privacy, her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and her claim for tortious interference with business relations. In light of the defamatory nature of Ms. Rosenblum's story, the Court grants Ms. Glennon the injunctive relief described above. The Court sets the issue of damages for a telephone conference at 2:00 p.m. on July 11, 2018. Counsel for Ms. Glennon shall dial 877-873-8018 and enter access code 5313999 to participate in the call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   DONE and ORDERED this 3rd day of July, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    At issue here is the concept of statutory standing which concerns the limitations that Congress places on a party's ability to bring a case rather than the Constitution's limitation on the Court's power to hear the case under the case or controversy requirement of Article III.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v.
