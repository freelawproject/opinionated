They move for preliminary injunction and seek to enjoin Defendants to provide bilingual ballots, sample ballots, absentee and early voting applications and ballots, provisional ballots, voter registration forms, voting instructions, voter information, polling place notifications, and polling place signage, to all be created by a certified translator, and to ensure that all election information is digitally available in Spanish.

Additionally, Dr. Smith examined the number of Florida voters born in Puerto Rico. In November 2017, there were approximately 200,000 registered voters in Florida who were born in Puerto Rico. More than 36,500 of them currently live in one of the 32 counties at issue in this case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant Detzner argues these numbers fail to clearly establish a likelihood of success on the merits because Dr. Smith's analysis involved estimates, degrees of uncertainty, and qualifying language such as \"more likely than not.\" ECF No. 42, at 17. This argument is faulty for the simple reason that large datasets of populations almost always include estimates or degrees of uncertainty. Taking Defendant's argument to its logical endpoint would mean that the American Community Survey-or any data that includes estimates or degrees of uncertainty, even if they run through the analysis of a respected political scientist-can never be used as evidence in a court's consideration of a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This Court recognizes some caveats about the numbers Plaintiffs' expert proffers. First, there is likely significant overlap between two groups of Puerto Rican individuals Dr. Smith identifies; many of the registered voters identified as born in Puerto Rico may also speak English less than \"very well.\" Second, this Court recognizes these numbers represent conservative estimates.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Smith Rep., at 12 (noting that some registration forms analyzed are more than six months old and do not include any Puerto Ricans who relocated after Hurricane Maria). It is no secret that thousands of Puerto Ricans have moved to Florida in recent years, particularly in the devastating wake of Hurricane Maria and the controversial government response to the disaster.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Many, like Ms.\n   Rivera Madera, have moved here permanently. The American Community Survey from 2015 necessarily does not include these 2017 and 2018 transplants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As noted above, Section 4(e) does not contain a numerical threshold to trigger its protections. There may be understandable consternation about expending resources to accommodate what may be a handful of registered voters. For example, Dr. Smith identifies 24 adults of Puerto Rican heritage who speak English less than \"very well\" in Wakulla County, Florida; just four voters in Taylor County were born in Puerto Rico.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 &amp; 9. Even so, this Court cannot read any numerical requirements into Section 4(e)'s plain language. Moreover, Plaintiffs have tailored their claims to only 32 counties. In addition to 13 counties covered by another provision of the Voting Rights Act,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 3, and two counties not covered by this provision that nevertheless provide Spanish ballots, there remain 20 counties that are not impacted by Plaintiffs' claims.
