The Court held a sentencing hearing on\n   October 3, 2017. The primary issue is whether the vulnerable victim enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(b)(1) applies to Defendant Charley Joe, whose victim had cerebral palsy and could use only the right side of his body. The Court will overrule Joe's Objection to the application of the vulnerable victim enhancement in the Presentence Investigation Report, filed June 7, 2017 (Doc. 31)(\"PSR\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Joe and his brother, the victim, are registered members of the Navajo Nation and lived on the Navajo Nation Indian Reservation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 10, at 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The two brothers had a bad relationship; Joe \"drank a lot, which would cause frequent arguments with the victim.\" PSR \u00b6 12, at 4. One day, they got into an altercation, in which the victim \"started hitting\" Joe, \"punching him in the mouth, nose, and eye.\" PSR \u00b6 16, at 5. Eventually, Joe used an axe against his brother, killing him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 17, at 5. The Office of the Medical Investigator determined that the cause of death was \"chop wounds.\" PSR \u00b6 18, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The victim \"was born with cerebral palsy and only had the use of the right side of his body.\" Addendum to the Presentence Report at 1, filed September 27, 2017 (Doc. 39)(\"Addendum\").

He further argues that the vulnerable victim enhancement \"does not apply because\n   the government has not shown that the victim in this matter was unusually vulnerable due to some other characteristic.\" Objection at 4.

The argument is frivolous. We have already stated on several occasions that section 3A1.1(b) does not require a finding that the defendant intentionally targeted the victim because of the victim's vulnerability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    United States v. Checora\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1720032\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/175/782/\">\n    175 F.3d 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 789 n.4 (10th Cir. 1999). That interpretation is consistent with the Guidelines' text. The Guidelines state: \"If the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim, increase by 2 levels.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(b)(1). The relevant Guideline does not say that the defendant must have selected the victim\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   the victim's vulnerability. In contrast, the sentencing guideline listed immediately before the vulnerable victim enhancement states that, if\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   the court at sentencing determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\n   <em>\n    intentionally selected\n   </em>\n   any victim or any property as the object of the offense of conviction\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, gender identity,\n   <em>\n    disability\n   </em>\n   , or sexual orientation of any person, increase by 3 levels.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(a) (emphasis added). In other words, the Guidelines specifically create different sentencing enhancements based on a defendant's mens rea. If the defendant intentionally selected the victim because of the victim's disability, a 3-level enhancement applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(a). If the defendant only knew or should have known of the victim's vulnerability, a 2-level enhancement applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(b)(1). Joe's argument thus only shows why the 3-level enhancement, not at issue in this case, does not apply; his argument says nothing about whether the 2-level vulnerable victim enhancement applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scalia: Portrait of a Man and Jurist at 46:26-46:37, YOUTUBE (Jan 13, 2018), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlX1vNcZCkg (in which Justice Clarence Thomas explains Justice Antonin Scalia's view that \"words matter, syntax matters ... structure matters, it all matters\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the objections in the Sentencing Memorandum and Objections to Presentence Report, filed September 19, 2017 (Doc. 38), are overruled to the extent that they object to the applicability of the vulnerable victim enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    At the sentencing hearing, there were no objections to the factual findings in the PSR, and the Court adopted them as its own factual findings.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Draft Transcript of Sentencing Hearing at 46:11-13 (taken October 3, 2017)(Court).
