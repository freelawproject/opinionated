(\"Monastery\") against Everest's insured Gessner Engineering, LLC (\"Gessner\"). Specifically pending before the Court is the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [Doc. # 15] filed by Defendant Monastery and the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [Doc. # 18] filed by Defendant Gessner Engineering, LLC (\"Gessner\"). Defendants argue that Everest owes Gessner a duty to defend. Everest filed a consolidated Response [Doc. # 26] to the two motions. The Monastery filed a Reply [Doc. # 28], and Gessner filed a separate Reply [Doc. # 31].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Also pending is Everest's Motion for Final Summary Judgment [Doc. # 17], in which it argues that it does not owe Gessner a duty to defend. The Monastery filed a Response [Doc. # 22], and Gessner filed a separate Response [Doc. # 23]. Everest filed a Reply [Doc. # 29].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Having reviewed the record and applicable legal authorities, the Court\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   Everest's Motion for Summary Judgment and\n   <strong>\n    grants\n   </strong>\n   the Motions for Partial Summary Judgment filed by Gessner and the Monastery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Everest issued an Architects and Engineers Professional Liability Insurance Policy (\"Policy\") to Gessner for the policy period August 1, 2015 to August 1, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy, Joint Exh. 1 [Doc. # 20-3].

The Policy requires Everest to defend Gessner against \"any covered claim, even if such claim is groundless, false or fraudulent.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   , Section I(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Monastery hired Gessner to provide civil, geotechnical, and structural engineering for a dining hall construction project referred to as the \"Trapeza Project.\" Construction began in late February 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Beginning in the spring of 2014, the Monastery noticed intermittent water seepage near the walls in the basement area of the dining hall building. In February 2015, the Monastery filed a lawsuit against Gessner and various contractors on\n   the Trapeza Project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Original Petition in Cause No. 35694, Exh. C to Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Monastery voluntarily nonsuited and dismissed Gessner from the lawsuit. In January 2016, the Monastery filed a First Amended Petition in Cause No. 35694, again naming Gessner as a defendant. In February 2016, the Monastery nonsuited Cause No. 35694.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2015, the Monastery noticed water infiltration into the basement from underneath the slab. On February 18, 2016, the Monastery filed a second lawsuit against Gessner, Cause No. 35918. Based on the Monastery's failure to attach the correct certificate of merit to the Original Petition in that case, Gessner moved to dismiss the lawsuit. On March 31, 2016, the state court dismissed Cause No. 35918 without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 1, 2016, the Monastery filed a new lawsuit against Gessner, Cause No. 35961. On May 2, 2016, Gessner filed its Original Answer and Plea in Abatement in Cause No. 35961. On July 17, 2017, the Monastery filed its Second Amended Petition in Cause No. 35961. On September 14, 2016, Gessner notified Everest of Cause No. 35961 and requested a defense and indemnity under the Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Everest agreed to provide a defense for Cause No. 35961 subject to a reservation of rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 5, 2017, Everest filed this lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that it does not owe Gessner a duty to defend in Cause No. 35961. Everest named Gessner and the Monastery as Defendants. Gessner filed a Counterclaim [Doc. # 9], seeking a declaratory judgment that Everest owes it a duty to defend. The parties then filed the pending motions for summary judgment, which have been fully briefed and are now ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL PRINCIPLES FOR DUTY TO DEFEND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   An insurer owes its insured a duty to defend if, in the underlying lawsuit, \"the plaintiff's factual allegations potentially support a covered claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Zurich Am.

The Monastery alleges in the state court petition that it learned at some point in 2015 that Gessner's engineering services had been deficient, causing water to seep into the dining hall basement through the foundation slab.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Amended Petition in Cause No. 35961, Joint Exh. 30 [Doc. # 20-32], \u00b6 15. There is no allegation in Cause No. 35961, however, that the Monastery gave Gessner notice of this belief prior to the Policy inception date of August 1, 2015. There are no allegations that Gessner, prior to the inception date of the Policy, had knowledge of the wrongful act discovered by the Monastery in early 2015 or that Gessner had a basis to reasonably anticipate that the Monastery would assert a claim based on that wrongful act involving water seeping through the foundation slab. Indeed, although the Monastery alleges that it began to notice intermittent water seepage in the basement area of the dining hall in the spring of 2014, one of the Monastery's allegations is that Gessner\n   failed \"to identify the role of its own error in causing the water infiltration problems.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127568\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/365/#p368\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14.

There are no allegations in Cause No. 35961 that Gessner had knowledge, prior to the inception date of the Policy, of the alleged wrongful act relating to the water infiltration through the foundation slab or had a basis reasonably to anticipate that the Monastery would assert a claim against it regarding the water seeping into the dining hall basement through the slab.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, based only on the Policy language and the allegations in Cause No. 35961, the Monastery's professional negligence claim against Gessner is potentially within the Policy's scope of coverage and Everest has a duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Exception to Eight-Corners Rule\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Everest argues that the Court should apply an exception to the eight-corners rule to allow extrinsic evidence of the prior lawsuits by the Monastery against Gessner. \"Despite various requests over the years to recognize exceptions to the eight-corners rule, the Supreme Court of Texas has never done so.\"\n   <em>\n    Allstate Cnty.
