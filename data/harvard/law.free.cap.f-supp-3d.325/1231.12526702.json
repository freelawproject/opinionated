PALK, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court is Plaintiff United Specialty Insurance Company's Motion for Summary Judgment and Brief in Support [Doc. No. 26]. Defendant Homeco, LLC has responded [Doc. No. 35] and Plaintiff has replied [Doc. No. 36]. Briefing is complete and the matter is ready for determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Introduction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   United seeks declaratory relief that, as a matter of law, no coverage exists under a commercial general liability insurance policy issued to Homeco for injuries sustained by Dr. Bob Palmer, an artist. Homeco owns certain commercial property and allowed Dr. Palmer to paint a mural on the exterior of one of its buildings. Homeco then caused the mural to be painted over without Dr. Palmer's knowledge or consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The issue before the Court is whether the destruction of the mural is property damage caused by an occurrence, defined under the insurance policy as an accident. United focuses on the intentional act of painting over the mural and argues Dr. Palmer's injuries were not the result of an accident. Conversely, Homeco argues the policy's use of the term \"accident\" is ambiguous. Homeco contends the resulting injuries to Dr. Palmer were not expected or intended by it and, therefore, the act of painting over the mural was accidental.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   United further contends a certain policy exclusion applies for property damage expected or intended by the insured. And, United claims injuries to Dr. Palmer's integrity, reputation and prestige do not qualify as bodily injury under the policy and, therefore are not covered. Additionally, United claims Dr. Palmer's injuries do not qualify as \"personal and advertising injury\" as that term is defined in an endorsement to the policy. Finally, United claims punitive damages are not recoverable under the policy as a matter of Oklahoma law and pursuant to applicable exclusions under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Homeco argues the policy's exclusion for property damage expected or intended by the insured does not apply and further, that this exclusion purportedly demonstrates the ambiguity of the word accident in the policy. However, in its briefing, Homeco does not contest: (1) that damage to Dr. Palmer's integrity, reputation and prestige does not qualify as bodily injury under the policy; (2) that coverage does not exist for personal and advertising injury; or (3) that punitive damages are not covered under the policy. As these issues are not disputed by Homeco, United is entitled to declarations in its favor as to these issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any event, the Court finds the intentional act of painting over the mural does not constitute an occurrence under the policy. Therefore, no coverage exists and United has no duty to defend or indemnify Homeco under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Governing Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

This position is in accord with Oklahoma law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7646456\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/1291/#p1297\">\n    77 F.3d at 1296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying Oklahoma law and holding that the act which constitutes the occurrence must \"be resolved by focusing on the injury and its immediately attendant causative circumstances\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Homeco does not contest that the painting over of the mural was intentional. Instead, Homeco insists that because it did not expect or intend to injure Dr. Palmer when it painted over the mural, the act was accidental. Homeco relies on the reasonable expectation doctrine to support its position-but that doctrine does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion supra, n. 4. Notably, Homeco cites no Oklahoma law to support its position and improperly rejects\n   <em>\n    Briscoe\n   </em>\n   as \"archaic\" without demonstrating that\n   <em>\n    Briscoe\n   </em>\n   does not apply or is otherwise distinguishable on its facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court concludes the painting over of the mural was not an accident. It did not take place by some unexpected happening. In reaching this result, the Court finds instructive the Tenth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   In that case, the Tenth Circuit addressed policy language that defined an occurrence as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which result in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\" The Court held that \"[t]he plain language of this definition indicates a two-part requirement. First, the incident at issue must have been 'an accident.' Second, the resulting injury must have been 'neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7646456\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/1291/#p1297\">\n    77 F.3d at 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the conduct at issue-a murder-was not an accident, the court found no coverage existed under the policy. Further, because the first requirement was not satisfied, the court deemed it unnecessary to determine whether the second requirement was met, i.e., whether the resulting injury was expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Here, the policy language does not contain the second requirement. Rather, the policy's definition of occurrence is limited to \"an accident.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like the conduct at issue in\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   , here the act of painting over the mural does not fit the definition of accident under Oklahoma law. Therefore, there was no occurrence within the plain language of the policy and coverage was not triggered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Moreover, this result is consistent with other cases applying\n   <em>\n    Briscoe\n   </em>\n   to define \"accident\" which have rejected the argument made by Homeco that it neither expected nor intended the injuries sustained by Dr. Palmer.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shelter Mut.

Therefore, no coverage exists under the policy. This conclusion deems it unnecessary for the Court to determine whether the policy's exclusion applies for property damage expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured. As set forth above, Homeco has not disputed, and therefore, has conceded that the policy does not provide coverage for: (1) damages to Dr. Palmer's honor, integrity and prestige; (2) personal and advertising injury liability; or (3) punitive damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In sum, United is entitled to a declaration that it is not obligated to defend or indemnify Homeco under the policy in connection with Dr. Palmer's claims brought against it in the underlying lawsuit,\n   <em>\n    Palmer v.
