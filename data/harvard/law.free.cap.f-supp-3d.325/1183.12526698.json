Generally, petitioner attacks respondent the Kansas Prison Review Board's decision to deny petitioner parole on three grounds: lack of due process, lack of equal protection, and violation of his First Amendment rights. For reasons explained below, the court denies the Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Kansas Court of Appeals summarized the facts of petitioner's state-court case this way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [Petitioner] is an inmate at the Lansing Correctional Facility. On June 28, 1996, [petitioner] was sentenced to life imprisonment for committing first-degree felony murder and to 68 months for committing abuse of a child. The facts of [petitioner's] 1996 convictions [are] as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   On the morning of October 21, 1995, [petitioner] was caring for Cain Baker, the 2-year-old son of [petitioner's] live-in girlfriend. Because the child was vomiting, [petitioner] called 911. Emergency personnel responded and transported the child to the hospital. The doctors there soon realized that Cain was not just ill; he was badly injured and bleeding internally. The police almost immediately suspected that [petitioner] had inflicted Cain's injuries. The police arrested [petitioner] later that same day. He has been in custody continuously\n   since October 21, 1995. On October 23, 1995, Cain died as the result of internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma to his abdomen. [A surgeon who operated on Cain described the injury as comparable to falling from a two-story building onto a chair leg].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The State charged [petitioner] with first-degree felony murder, an off-grid offense, and a count of felony child abuse. At trial in 1996, the jury found [petitioner] guilty on each count. The district court sentenced [petitioner] to life in prison on the felony-murder count. The district court found that the aggravating circumstances of the felony child abuse offense (Cain was particularly vulnerable due to age and [petitioner's] conduct during the commission of the offense manifested excessive brutality to the victim not normally present in child abuse) were substantial and compelling reasons to depart upward on sentence duration. On that count, the district court imposed a sentence of 68 months to run consecutively to [petitioner's] life sentence. On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the felony-murder conviction and sentence. However, the Supreme Court reversed [petitioner's] conviction for child abuse and vacated that sentence. Because only one act formed the basis for both the child abuse and the murder convictions, double jeopardy principles required that the offenses be merged into the felony murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Petitioner] became eligible for parole on October 21, 2010. In April 2011, he appeared before the Kansas Parole Board (now the Kansas Prisoner Review Board) and was denied parole. The Parole Board cited the serious nature/circumstances of the crime; violent nature of the crime; and objections as reasons for denying parole.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [Petitioner] challenged the denial of parole on [ Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7] 60-1501 habeas corpus grounds, claiming the denial of parole violated his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Specifically, he alleged the Parole Board acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by using vague stock language in the Action Notice denying parole. [Petitioner] also alleged that the Parole Board should not have considered the facts of his overturned child abuse conviction, and he disputed the finding that he was not behaviorally disposed for parole. Ultimately, a panel of this court affirmed the district court's dismissal of his habeas corpus petition and agreed the Parole Board did not act beyond its discretion or on an inaccurate record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   On or before August 6, 2015, [petitioner] filed an apology letter with the Apology Repository in the Kansas Department of Corrections. At some point, [petitioner] also submitted a letter to the Kansas Prisoner Review Board, explaining his position on the convictions. In that letter, he claimed that his conviction for murder was improper and unsupported by the facts. Nevertheless, [petitioner] acknowledged that he had failed to protect the child and stated that he accepted the judgment whether or not it is correct, right, and fair or just. On August 21, 2015, the Review Board held a public comment session regarding the question of whether it should parole [petitioner]. Multiple people objected to his parole and requested that [petitioner] remain in prison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 2, 2015, [petitioner] appeared before the Review Board. At the hearing, [petitioner] indicated that he lied to police initially about the events leading to the child's injuries; however, when asked by the Review Board about the time before the crime, he denied intentionally abusing or injuring the child. He further suggested that the evidence regarding the cause of the child's\n   injuries was inconclusive. [Petitioner] denied responsibility and instead told the Review Board that he thought the child was injured at a neighborhood park.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The Review Board noted [petitioner] had no disciplinary violations during his incarceration. Moreover, [petitioner] described various personal advancements he had made while in prison. In particular, he mentioned that he and his wife purchased a home, that he had a job lined up should he be released, and that he had \"used every opportunity to progress\" while in prison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 14, 2015, the Review Board denied [petitioner's] request for parole. In doing so, it cited the serious nature and circumstances of [petitioner's] crime; his denial of responsibility for injuring the child; and the objections received from the public. Thereafter, [petitioner] filed a pro se [ Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7] 60-1501 petition and memorandum in support in the district court. On November 16, 2015, the district court issued a writ of habeas corpus and set the matter for hearing. Subsequently, the State filed a response and motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The State argued that the Review Board had followed all statutory requirements and that its decision to deny parole was not arbitrary or capricious. In response, [petitioner] argued there was insufficient evidence to support finding him guilty of felony murder. Among other arguments, he also indicated that his clean record in prison and his pursuit and completion of self-help courses demonstrated his ability to return to society successfully.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The district court held a hearing on February 16, 2016. After hearing the arguments presented, the district court granted the State's motion to dismiss. Specifically, the district court focused on the ability of the Review Board to consider the facts of the conviction in determining the nature of the crime. The district court further noted the inability of a reviewing court to substitute its judgement for that of the Review Board and found that the Review Board had adequately followed the statutory requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Heath v.

Ct. App. Dec. 16, 2016) (unpublished table decision) (internal citations, alterations, and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Petitioner timely appealed the Kansas state district court's decision to the Kansas Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. In his appeal, petitioner raised a variety of issues. They included the due process, equal protection, and First Amendment issues he raises here. In the end, the Kansas Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. On April 26, 2017, the Kansas Supreme Court denied review. From the date the Review Board denied petitioner parole, he has served 21 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Petitioner is not the only person convicted of felony-murder for the death of a child whose parole status the Review Board considered recently. The Review Board recently granted two other inmates-Vincent Altum and Kelly Williams-parole. Mr. Altum was convicted of killing his girlfriend's 14-month old son after he struck the child multiple times in the head and shook him. Mr. Williams was convicted of killing his girlfriend's three-year old daughter after violently shaking her and beating her. Both inmates had disciplinary actions taken against them during their time in prison. The Review Board released Mr. Altum on parole after he served 18 years. Mr. Williams served 19 years before the Review Board granted him parole. The Review Board also has released a prisoner who, like petitioner, maintains that he is innocent of the crime for which he was convicted. In particular,\n   Mr. Craig Wilson was convicted of sodomizing a child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the court is not certain how long Mr. Wilson spent in prison, he has served more time than petitioner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Three months after the Kansas Supreme Court denied review of the Kansas Court of Appeals decision, petitioner filed a writ of habeas corpus with our court. While his filings are difficult to follow at times, the Petition alleges three grounds for support. First, it argues that the Review Board\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   violated petitioner's due process and equal protection rights. Second, it contends that petitioner has a contractual right to parole under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2075-5201\">\n    Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 75-5201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and 22-3717(g)(2) and (h). And thus, it contends, the Review Board must support its decision with evidence. Failure to do so, it argues, amounts to a due process violation. Third, petitioner argues that the Review Board's actions were arbitrary and capricious. He also raises a First Amendment claim in his Memorandum in Support of his Petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After sifting through petitioner's filings, the court organizes the grounds for relief slightly differently than the Petition does. Under the court's formulation, the first ground of relief argues that the Review Board denied petitioner's due process rights by acting arbitrarily and capriciously and refusing to disclose the evidence on which it based its decision. It contends that petitioner has a right to due process because he has a liberty interest created by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2075-5201\">\n    Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 75-5201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and \u00a7 22-3717(g)(2) and (h). Also, it argues that the Ninth Amendment creates a liberty interest in parole. Second, the Petition contends that the Review Board denied petitioner parole even though it granted parole to similarly situated prisoners, thus violating the Equal Protection Clause. Third, the Petition contends, the Review Board conditioned his parole status on him asserting a government message. This compulsion, petitioner contends, violates the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For reasons explained below, none of these provide a basis to issue a writ of habeas corpus. The court begins its discussion with an overview of the correct standard of review. Then, the court addresses, in turn, each ground for relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Like petitioner, both were convicted for killing young children. But petitioner argues several facts made them even less qualified for release than he is. For example, the other prisoners presented a \"higher risk\" for release because of their behavior in prison. Specifically, Mr. Altum and Mr. Williams each received four disciplinary reports in prison while petitioner received none. Doc. 1 at 21. And, petitioner contends, their convictions involved much more brutal facts. Mr. Williams shook a three-year old so forcefully that she died. Mr. Altum struck a 14-month old on the head several times, which caused the child's death. Despite the brutality of their crimes, both inmates served less time before parole than petitioner has served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Petitioner also asserts that his situation is like another inmate's situation-Mr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Wilson's. Both petitioner and Mr. Wilson have maintained their innocence, yet the Review Board released Mr. Wilson on parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Petitioner, however, fails to identify any other similarities with the other prisoners. For instance, petitioner fails to specify whether the public or the victim's family expressed significant opposition to their release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2022-3717\">\n    Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 22-3717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) (requiring the Review Board to consider the public and victim's family's statements when deciding whether to release a prisoner on parole). Also, while both Mr. Altum and Mr. Williams were convicted for killing children, the facts of their convictions and petitioner's conviction differ. Importantly, petitioner struck a child with the same amount of force as if the child fell from a two-story building onto a chair leg. Neither Mr. Altum nor Mr. Williams exerted as much force in one blow. Mr. Wilson was convicted of sodomizing a child, so his conviction-while serious-also involved different conduct than the facts supporting petitioner's conviction. Mr. Wilson also served more time in prison when the Review Board released him than petitioner had served when the Review Board considered his request. Finally, nothing in the record indicates Mr. Altum or Mr. Williams denied responsibility for their crimes when the Review Board released them. So, the court cannot conclude that petitioner and the other inmates are similarly situated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Petitioner also fails to establish the second prong on the class of one test,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the Review Board had no rational basis for denying him parole while releasing the other inmates based on their differences. A decision has a rational basis when an objectively reasonable basis exists to treat petitioner and those he compares himself with differently based on the differences between them.\n   <em>\n    Jicarilla Apache Nation v. Rio Arriba Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"82131\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/440/1202/#p1211\">\n    440 F.3d 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1211 (10th Cir. 2006). As already identified, two notable differences exist between Mr. Altum and Mr. William's cases and petitioner's case. And these differences provide a rational basis for the differing decisions. First, petitioner refuses to accept responsibility for his crime. And second, the public and the victim's family opposed granting petitioner parole. No similar objections existed for Mr. Altum or Mr. Williams. Given these differences, the court cannot say that the Review Board acted irrationally based. Indeed, the Kansas parole statute requires the Review Board to consider the comments of the public and the victim's family about the potential parolee, as well as the inmate's acceptance of responsibility for his crime.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2022-3717\">\n    Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 22-3717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Petitioner argues that the Review Board acted irrationally because it granted parole to Mr. Altum and Mr. Williams, who committed more brutal crimes. The court disagrees. The medical expert who testified at petitioner's trial described the amount of force needed to cause the injury that ultimately led to the child's death as equivalent to the child falling from a \"two-story building onto the bottom of the leg of a chair.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Heath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1360797\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/264/557/\">\n    264 Kan. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1360797\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/264/557/\">\n    957 P.2d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 457 (1998). While the other prisoners may have struck the child they killed multiple times, the Review Board is not required to conclude that their conduct was more brutal simply because the other inmates struck the child more times. This is particularly true because the amount of force described in petitioner's case was not presented by Mr. Altum or Mr. Williams's case. And, regardless, the nature of circumstances of the crime is only one factor among many the Review Board considers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Kan.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2022-3717\">\n    Kan.
