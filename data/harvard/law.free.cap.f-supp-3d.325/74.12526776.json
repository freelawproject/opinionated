Shortly before the effective date, however, the California Association of Private Postsecondary Schools (\"CAPPS\"), brought suit challenging the regulations, and, a week later, CAPPS sought a preliminary injunction blocking the implementation of two changes. That motion was never fully briefed or decided because the Department, on its own accord, issued a stay under \u00a7 705 of the APA (\"Section 705 Stay\"), postponing not only the effective date of the two changes that CAPPS had asked the Court preliminarily to enjoin, but most of the other portions of the regulations as well. While the\n   <em>\n    CAPPS\n   </em>\n   litigation continued, the Department issued an interim final rule on October 24, 2017 that delayed the effective date of the Borrower Defense Regulations to July 1, 2018, and a notice of proposed rulemaking to further delay the effective date to July 1, 2019. Then, on February 14, 2018, the Department issued a final rule delaying the effective date of the Borrower Defense Regulations until July 1, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Within weeks of the issuance of the Section 705 Stay, Bauer and Del Rose (student borrowers who allege that they would benefit from the Borrower Defense Regulations) and the coalition of nineteen states and the District of Columbia filed separate suits seeking to invalidate the stay. Over the course of the last year, both sets of plaintiffs have amended their complaints to challenge the additional delay actions taken in October 2017 and February 2018. On March 1, 2018, the Court consolidated the student borrower and state cases, stayed the\n   <em>\n    CAPPS\n   </em>\n   case pending resolution of this case, and ordered a final round of summary judgment briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The matter is now before the Court on cross-motions for summary judgment filed by the state plaintiffs, Dkt. 55, the student borrower plaintiffs, Dkt. 56, and the Department, Dkt. 58; Dkt. 59. In brief, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the delay actions; that the October 24, 2017 Interim Final Rule is based on an unlawful construction of the Higher Education Act of 1965; that the February 14, 2018 Final Delay Rule is procedurally invalid; that the Section 705 Stay is judicially reviewable; and that the Department's Section 705 Stay is arbitrary and capricious. The Court, accordingly, will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   the state plaintiffs' and the student borrower plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment, Dkt. 55; Dkt. 56, and will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the Department's cross-motion, Dkt. 66.

In other words, under the Department's reading, the Master Calendar Provision allows applicable rules to take effect on only one day every year-July 1. Applied to the present circumstances, the Department posited that as soon as the Section 705 Stay delayed the effective date of the Borrower Defense Regulations beyond July 1, 2017, it lacked discretion to implement the regulations before July 1, 2018, even if the Section 705 Stay was lifted before that date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Department also relied on this reasoning to justify why it had good cause to forgo notice-and-comment and negotiated rulemaking; the Department concluded that because \"it was impracticable\" to do so between the initiation of the\n   <em>\n    CAPPS\n   </em>\n   litigation on May 24, 2017 and the July 1, 2017 effective date of the Borrower Defense Regulations, it \"did not have any discretion to set an effective date earlier than July 1, 2018.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On October 24, 2017, the Department also issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to further delay the effective date of the Borrower Defense Regulations to July 1, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   William D.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiffs seek to vacate the Section 705 Stay, the Interim Final Rule, and the Final Delay Rule. They assert that these regulatory actions were arbitrary and capricious, not in accordance with law, and taken without observance of the required procedures. Broadly, Plaintiffs argue that the Department impermissibly took these actions for the purpose of securing time to replace the Borrower Defense Regulations (functionally rescinding the earlier rule); that it did not adequately consider benefits to student borrowers lost through the delays; that it relied on internally inconsistent assumptions and omitted key considerations when justifying the delay rules; that it misinterpreted the HEA; and, that it failed to comply with the HEA's requirement that public consultation and negotiated rulemaking be conducted prior to the promulgation of rules affecting federal student\n   loans. The Department, for its part, contests each of these assertions and argues that Plaintiffs lack standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On the threshold question of standing, the Court concludes that it need not decide whether the state plaintiffs have carried their burden because, as the Department concedes and as the record demonstrates, the student borrower plaintiffs have standing to seek the entirety of the relief sought by all parties to the litigation. The Court then considers Plaintiffs' challenge to the Interim Final Rule-which expired on July 1, 2018-and concludes that it is moot, except for one issue, and, as to that issue, the Court concludes that the Department's interpretation of the Master Calendar Provision is contrary to law. Next, the Court examines Plaintiffs' substantive and procedural challenges to the Final Delay Rule and concludes that the Department failed to justify adequately its invocation of the good cause exception to the negotiated rulemaking requirement. Given that procedural flaw, the Court does not reach Plaintiffs' substantive challenges to the rule.

In short, although announced in a rule that has now expired, the Department's interpretation of the Master Calendar Provision has carried through to a regulation that remains operative\n   today and that is causing Plaintiffs a cognizable injury.

According to the Interim Final Rule-and as subsequently reflected in the October 24, 2017 NPRM and Final Delay Rule-two conclusions necessarily follow from this language: First, \"a regulatory change\" must be \"published in final form on or before November 1\" in order to take effect at the start of the next award year. Interim Final Rule, 82 Fed. Reg. at 49,115 ; Final Delay Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%206%2C458\">\n    83 Fed.

As used in the Master Calendar Provision, \"until\" is a preposition and thus \"indicate[s] continuance ... of an action or condition ... to a specified time.\" Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 1297 (10th ed. 1996).

But, even putting that aside, the argument has little force. The Department reads too much into Congress's use of the singular form: \"effective date.\" It is plain that, in the context of the title, \"effective date\" does not reference a specific day-July 1-but rather, the date on which a new rule is to come into effect. In other words, the title simply indicates that whatever \"effective date\" the Department might have otherwise planned must be \"delay[ed]\" if the regulatory change is published \"late.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201089\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Department also purports to find textual ambiguity \"in the statute's inclusion of both the word 'until,' ... and the phrase 'beginning of the [award year].' \" Dkt. 58-1 at 68.

Rather than creating ambiguity, the reference to the \"beginning of the\" award year adds clarity. Just as it is clearer to say, \"I will not arrive until the beginning of July\" than it is to say, \"I will not arrive until July,\" it adds clarity to refer to the \"beginning of\" the award year. To be sure, most readers could probably figure out what Congress meant without this added clause, but that is not the test for superfluity. And even if the Department was right, the canon against surplusage, like reliance on section headings, cannot overcome clear statutory text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Great Lakes Comnet, Inc. v.

In that case, the Department declined to extend the comment period for final regulations combatting \"troubling practices\" in the \"student financial products marketplace.\" Program Integrity and Improvement,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2067%2C126\">\n    80 Fed.

The Department chose to publish the final regulations on October 30, 2015, explaining that had it \"extended the comment period beyond 45 days, [it] would have been unable to comply with\" the November 1 deadline of \"the [M]aster [C]alendar [P]rovision.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2067%2C126\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2067%2C126\">\n    at 67,131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the words of the HEA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   All regulations pertaining to [Title IV of the HEA] ... shall be subject to a negotiated rulemaking (including the selection of the issues to be negotiated), unless the Secretary determines that applying such a requirement with respect to given regulations is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest (within the meaning of\n   section 553(b)(3)(B) of Title 5 ) and publishes the basis for such determination in the Federal Register at the same time as the proposed regulations in question are first published.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1098a(b)(2).

As the HEA makes clear, and as the Department acknowledged in the October 24, 2017 NPRM, the waiver provision requires the Department to set forth \"the basis for\" its determination that good cause exists \"at the same time\" that that the \"proposed regulations in question are first published.\" 82 Fed. Reg. at 49,157 (citing\n   20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1098a(b)(2) ). Yet, when the Department published the October 24, 2017 NPRM, it said almost nothing about the basis for its decision to waive the negotiated rulemaking requirement. The Department wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   For the reasons stated above, it would not be practicable, before the July 1, 2018 effective date specified in the [Interim Final Rule], to engage in negotiated rulemaking and publish final regulations.

The \"reasons stated above,\" moreover, shed little light on why the Department would have been \"unavoidably prevented\" from performing its functions had it complied with the negotiated rulemaking process,\n   <em>\n    N.J.

To the contrary, all that precedes the Department's waiver discussion is a discussion of the Master Calendar Provision and the timeline for completing the negotiated rulemaking process for reconsidering the Borrower Defense Regulations. The Department wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Given that the first negotiated rulemaking session is scheduled for November 13-15, 2017, we cannot complete the negotiated rulemaking process and the development of revised regulations by November 1, 201[7].\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the master calendar, a regulatory change that has been published in final form on or before November 1 prior to the start of an award year-which begins on July 1 of any given year-may take effect only at the beginning of the next award year, or in other words, on July 1 of the next year. In light of this requirement, the regulations resulting from negotiated rulemaking could not be effective before July 1, 2019.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49,156. Even liberally construed, this explanation for waiving the negotiated rulemaking requirement fails on multiple levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the October 24, 2017 NPRM addressed the wrong regulatory action for purposes of waiving the negotiated rulemaking requirement. The HEA, unsurprisingly, requires the Department to state in the relevant notice of proposed rulemaking why it cannot practicably comply with the negotiated rulemaking requirement \"\n   <em>\n    with respect to\" that rulemaking\n   </em>\n   . 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1098a(b)(2). The Department's October 24, 2017 NPRM, however, said nothing about whether it had sufficient time to comply with the negotiated rulemaking requirement \"with respect to\" the Final Delay Rule. To the contrary, the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   discussion addressed the time the Department needed to finalize its revisions, if any, to the Borrower Defense Regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   October 24, 2017 NPRM, 82 Fed. Reg. at 49,156. Because the October 24, 2017 NPRM said nothing about whether it could have conducted a negotiated rulemaking \"with respect to\" the delay rule, it failed to satisfy the waiver requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Department confronts this problem in its briefing before this Court and attempts to find an implicit finding of \"good cause\" to dispense with the negotiated rulemaking requirement. The Department asserts: \"It would make little sense ... to\n   subject the rule delaying\" the Borrower Defense Regulations \"to the same negotiated procedures that created, at least in part, the need for\" the delay rule \"in the first place.\" Dkt. 58-1 at 62. That contention, however, fails to account for the Department's unstated assumption that the Master Calendar Provision applies to the ongoing rulemaking regarding the Borrower Defense Regulations but does not apply to the delay rules. Without that assumption, the Final Delay Rule would be meaningless because it was finalized on February 14, 2018, and thus, under the Master Calendar Provision, could not have taken effect before July 1, 2019, the date that rule was due to expire. It is only by assuming that the Master Calendar Provision does not apply to delay rules that the Department can avoid this fate. Yet, once it takes that step, it can no longer draw even an implicit comparison between the discussion of the timeline for completing the substantive revisions to the Borrower Defense Regulations, which the Department discussed in the October 24, 2017 NPRM, and the timeline for completing the delay rule, which it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the October 24, 2017 NPRM did not identify any \"emergency\" or \"serious harm\" that would result absent a waiver.\n   <em>\n    Jifry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9244585,5662129\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/370/1174/\">\n    370 F.3d at 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the relevant \"inquiry ... 'is inevitably fact- or context-dependent,' \" the D.C. Circuit has found good cause, by way of example, when \"air travel security agencies\" would have otherwise been \"unable to address threats posing 'a possible imminent hazard to aircraft, persons, and property within the United States,' \" or when \"a rule ... of 'life-saving importance' to mine workers in the event of a mine explosion\" was at stake.\n   <em>\n    Mack Trucks, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3771777,3890789\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/87/\">\n    682 F.3d at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Here, in contrast, the Department merely stated, without elaboration, that the purpose of the Final Delay Rule was to maintain the \"status quo\" while it \"conduct[ed] [a] negotiated rulemaking and, as necessary, develop[ed] revised regulations.\" October 24, 2017 NPRM, 82 Fed. Reg. at 49,155 -56. That is\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the NPRM said, and, by any measure, that bare assertion provided insufficient cause to waive the negotiated rulemaking requirement. Indeed, if that was sufficient, it is difficult to imagine a circumstance in which an agency would be required to comply with the requirements of notice and comment and, where applicable, negotiated rulemaking, to delay the effective date of a regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Nor can the Department's subsequent efforts to supplement the October 24, 2017 NPRM save the rule. Each of these efforts fails either because the required findings were not included in the proposed delay rule, as required by the HEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1098a(b)(2), or because they constituted\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   justifications that appeared nowhere in the administrative record,\n   <em>\n    Chenery\n   </em>\n   , 332 U.S. at 196-97,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20S.%20Ct.%201760\">\n    67 S.Ct. 1760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan Stanley Capital Grp.

In the Final Delay Rule-but not in the October 24, 2017 NPRM-for example, the Department asserted that it \"typically takes ... over 12 months to complete\" a negotiated rulemaking and concluded that \"it would not have been feasible\" to complete that process in a timely manner, \"even if the Department had [begun] on May 24, 2017, when it learned of the CAPPS litigation.\" Final Delay Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%206%2C458\">\n    83 Fed.

It thus, once again, amended its theory of good cause, arguing that the Final Delay Rule\n   \"needed to be published well in advance of the culmination of the (still ongoing) process to revise the borrower defense regulations, as well as in advance of the July 1, 2018 date on which the [Borrower Defense Regulations] would otherwise [have] become effective.\" Dkt. 58-1 at 63;\n   <em>\n    cf\n   </em>\n   .

The problem with the rationale, as discussed further below,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   at 54-55, is that it is both unexplained and directly at odds with the determination that the Department made when it finalized the Borrower Defense Regulations that the arbitration and class action rules are lawful and that the \"case law gives strong support for the position that the Department has authority to impose limits of [this] kind ....\" Borrower Defense Regulations,\n   81 Fed.

On such conditions as may be required and to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable injury, the reviewing court, including the court to which a case may be taken on appeal from or on application for certiorari or other writ to a reviewing court, may issue all necessary and appropriate process to postpone the effective date of an agency action or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20705\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Department finds a commitment of discretion, first, in the fact that the statute does not say that an agency may postpone an effective date \"when justice so requires\" but, rather, says that an agency may do so \"when [the]\n   <em>\n    agency finds\n   </em>\n   that justice so requires.\" Dkt. 59-1 at 33 (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20705\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). To this, it adds that the phrase \"justice so requires\" is \"inherently flexible;\" that \u00a7 705's use of the word \"may\" further confirms that Congress intended to commit stay decisions to agency discretion; and that the text distinguished between the judicially manageable standard that courts must apply-\"to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable injury\"-and the less definite standard applicable to agency decisions. Dkt. 59-1 at 34-35, 42-43. In support of these textual arguments, the Department relies on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Webster v. Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/\">\n    486 U.S. 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/\">\n    100 L.Ed.2d 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). There, the Court held that a statute that allows the Director of the CIA to terminate CIA employees whenever the Director \"shall\n   <em>\n    deem\n   </em>\n   such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States\" commits those discharge decisions to the Director's discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/\">\n    at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, relying on the APA's structure, the Department argues that, because \u00a7 705 appears in a standalone provision of the APA, which \"is entirely separate from Section 704 ... ('[a]ctions reviewable'),\" it is appropriate to infer that Congress intended to make \u00a7 705 determinations \"unreviewable.\" Dkt. 59-1 at 36 n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Most of the Department's textual arguments are foreclosed by the D.C.

Although the Court acknowledged that the word \"may\" conveys an intent \"to confer some discretion on the agency,\" it disagreed that \"such language\" means that \"the matter is\n   <em>\n    committed\n   </em>\n   exclusively to agency discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The same holds true here; indeed, under both statutes, the agency may act only if it finds that the interest of justice standard is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Dickson\n   </em>\n   decision also undermines the Department's reliance on the \"agency finds\" and \"justice so requires\" language in \u00a7 705. Again, the language at issue in\n   <em>\n    Dickson\n   </em>\n   -if the Board \"finds it to be in the interest of justice\"-parallels the language at issue here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201552\">\n    at 1402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court found support for its conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Kreis v.

In\n   <em>\n    Dickson\n   </em>\n   and in\n   <em>\n    Kreis\n   </em>\n   , as in this case, the government argued that\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   stands for the broad proposition that a grant of authority to take an action if the agency \"finds\" or \"deems\" that action \"in the interest of justice\" or \"in the interests of the United States\" is sufficient to commit the relevant action to the discretion of the agency.\n   <em>\n    Dickson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5708666,7415909\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/68/1396/\">\n    68 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1403 ;\n   <em>\n    Kreis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538120,3464581\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/866/1508/\">\n    866 F.2d at 1508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, in both\n   <em>\n    Dickson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kreis\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit disagreed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538120,3464581\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/866/1508/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the Court of Appeals explained in\n   <em>\n    Dickson\n   </em>\n   , that contention ignores the \"context in which the statutory mandate [at issue in\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   ] operated,\"\n   <em>\n    Dickson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5708666,7415909\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/68/1396/\">\n    68 F.3d at 1403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted), and, as it stressed in\n   <em>\n    Kreis, Webster\n   </em>\n   involved a national security \"determination particularly unsuited to judicial assessment,\"\n   <em>\n    Kreis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538120,3464581\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/866/1508/\">\n    866 F.2d at 1514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short, outside of the context of national security or a similar context that raises doubts about judicial competence,\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   lacks the broad meaning that the Department urges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Department's remaining arguments fare no better. Pressing its final textual argument, the Department observes that \u00a7 705 describes the standard applicable to judicial stays in different terms and argues that, by distinguishing \"between agency action and court action,\" Congress \"commit[ed] each exclusively to the province of the entity taking action.\" Dkt. 58-1 at 31. But the Department offers no explanation for why the difference in language-short of the reasons rejected above-shows that Congress intended to commit the decision whether to grant a stay \"exclusively to the province of\" the agency or the court. Nor does the fact that Congress provided both agencies and courts with the authority to stay regulations pending judicial review support the Department's view. To the contrary, as the D.C. Circuit concluded in rejecting a similar argument regarding the Clean Air Act, \"[g]iven that Congress granted [courts] the power to enter a stay, it seems quite anomalous that it did not also confer upon [courts] the lesser power to review the [agency's] decision to issue a stay.\"\n   <em>\n    Clean Air Council v. Pruitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275779\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/1/#p7\">\n    862 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7 (D.C. Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The Department's structural argument is also unpersuasive. The Department contends that because \u00a7 705 falls between \u00a7\u00a7 704 and 706, which together delineate the scope and reach of judicial review, Congress intended a \u00a7 705 stay to be \"a limited form of relief\" that is itself immune from review. Dkt. 74 at 12. But the Department never explains why agency action taken pursuant to \u00a7 705 does not constitute \"final agency action\" subject to judicial review,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and does not identify where Congress might have situated \u00a7 705 to avoid any implication that its placement was \"intended to make the Section 705 stay ... unreviewable.\" Dkt. 58-1 at 32 n.3. A far more persuasive structure argument, moreover, points in the opposite direction. As noted above, \u00a7 701(a) contains two exceptions to judicial review under the APA: the first exception, which is not applicable here, applies where a \"statute[ ] preclude[s] judicial review,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and the second exception, which the Department argues is controlling here, applies where \"agency action is committed to agency discretion by law,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 701(a)(2). The first of these exceptions \"seems easy in application\" and merely requires courts \"to determine whether Congress intended to preclude judicial review,\" while the second applies \"even where Congress has not affirmatively precluded review.\"\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p830\">\n    470 U.S. at 828-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p830\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It seems improbable, to say the least, that Congress intended to preclude judicial review of agency decisions under \u00a7 705 of the APA, but did so in the roundabout way of committing those decisions to agency discretion instead of merely saying that administrative stays are not subject to judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Any remaining doubt regarding the reviewability of administrative stay decisions is put to rest by the fact that, despite the Department's arguments to the contrary, a \"judicially manageable standard[ ] [is] available for judging how and when an agency should exercise its discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p830\">\n    470 U.S. at 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/#p830\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robbins v.

Dkt. 55-1 at 37; Dkt. 56 at 36. According to Plaintiffs, the text of \u00a7 705, its legislative history, and this Court's precedent all support the conclusion that courts and agencies are bound to apply the same standard.

The Department, on the other hand, argues that nothing found in the text of \u00a7 705, or in any source, requires that agencies apply the judicially fashioned four-part test. Dkt. 58-1 at 38-39. Rather, in the Department's view, \u00a7 705 authorizes agencies to issue a stay when \"justice so requires,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20705\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -\"a broad, flexible standard conferring discretion to act,\" Dkt. 58-1 at 33.

Here, nothing in the text of \u00a7 705 provides sufficient cause to require that agencies apply the same four-factor test that courts apply. The statute uses different language to describe what an agency must find in order to issue a stay-\"that justice so requires\"-and to describe what a court must find-that the stay is \"necessary to prevent irreparable injury.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20705\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, not even every circuit applies precisely the same four-factor test; some, for example, apply a sliding scale, while others do not, and while still others have not resolved that question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sherley v.

But that is not the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   On the other hand, and despite the Department's arguments to the contrary, the text and legislative history of \u00a7 705\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   provide the Court with a framework for reviewing whether an agency's determination that a stay is \"require[d]\" in the interests of \"justice\" was arbitrary and capricious. Section 705 does not permit the Department to make its own untethered assessment of what is \"just.\" To begin, although the language differs in minor detail, the judicial and administrative authority to grant a stay is found in a single statutory provision that addresses a single topic-\"relief pending review.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20705\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The relevant standard, moreover, does not differ in significant respects.

The legislative history of \u00a7 705 makes just this point. It explains that \"[t]he authority granted is equitable and should be used by both agencies and courts to prevent irreparable injury or afford parties an adequate judicial remedy.\" S. Doc. No. 248, at 277. As such, even though an agency need not apply the same canonical four-factor test that courts do, it must-given the statute's \"equitable\" mandate-weigh the same equities.

Rather, just as when a court issues a stay, an agency stay\n   under \u00a7 705 should be imposed for one-and only one-reason: to maintain the status quo in order to allow judicial review of the underlying regulation to proceed in a \"just\" manner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4131904\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/833/11/#p34\">\n    833 F.Supp.2d at 27-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That is why the standard for an agency stay, like the four-part preliminary injunction test that courts apply, must be tethered to the litigation itself; to the extent the agency's action is intended to do more than preserve the status quo pending judicial review, it would \"prescribe law or policy,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4), and thus require notice and comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Finally, to justify a stay under \u00a7 705, an agency must do more than pay \"lip service\" to the pending litigation,\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4131904\" index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/833/11/#p34\">\n    833 F.Supp.2d at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or merely assert, \"without any specificity,\" that the litigation raises \"serious questions concerning the validity of certain provisions of the [r]ule,\"\n   <em>\n    California v.

Although the agency need not adhere to the specific contours of the four-factor preliminary injunction test, it must weigh the same kinds of equitable considerations that courts have long applied and must explain why, in light of the pending litigation, a stay is \"require[d]\" to ensure the parties will ultimately obtain an adequate and just judicial remedy.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20705\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; S.

The Department offered three rationales: the\n   <em>\n    CAPPS\n   </em>\n   litigation raised \"serious questions\" about the validity of the Borrower Defense Regulations; the delay would not cause the government any significant harm; and the Department was, in any event, reconsidering the regulations. Section 705 Stay, 82 Fed. Reg. at 27,621. None of these reasons withstands APA scrutiny. As explained further below, the first rationale is mere boilerplate; it is unsupported by any analysis, and it is at odds with the Department's prior conclusion to the contrary. The second and third rationales also lack any meaningful analysis and, more importantly, are unrelated to the pending\n   <em>\n    CAPPS\n   </em>\n   case and are thus beyond the scope of the relevant \u00a7 705 considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Department first posited in the Section 705 Stay that the plaintiff in the\n   <em>\n    CAPPS\n   </em>\n   case \"raised serious questions concerning the validity of certain provisions of the final regulations and [has] identified substantial injuries that could result if the final regulations go into effect before those questions are resolved.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Department then provided two examples in support of this conclusion. First, it asserted that \"if the final regulations are not postponed, institutions ... would be required, as of July 1, 2017, to modify their contracts in accordance with the arbitration and class action waiver regulations, which may be contrary to their interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Postponing the final regulations,\" would, in the Department's view, allow schools to avoid that cost \"while the regulation is subject to judicial review.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, it pointed out that, \"if the final regulations are not postponed, institutions would be subject to financial responsibility trigger provisions that could impose substantial costs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The mere fact that parties would avoid the costs of complying with the existing regulations, however, is plainly insufficient\n   to support a \u00a7 705 stay. As explained above, \u00a7 705 requires an agency to explain why, in light of the pending litigation, a stay is necessary to ensure that the parties ultimately obtain adequate and just relief. As a result, the Department's first rationale rises and falls based on the Department's reliance on the \"legal uncertainty\" that it contends is created by the \"serious questions\"\n   <em>\n    CAPPS\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs raise \"concerning the validity of certain provisions\" of the Borrower Defense regulations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For the reasons explained below, that rationale fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   As an initial matter, the Department failed to justify the scope of the Section 705 Stay. Although it covers twenty-two sections of the Borrower Defense Regulations, the Department never identifies whether a few, many, or all of these sections rest on legally questionable footing. The notion that the Department needed to stay the effective date of all twenty-two of these provisions-while exempting a handful of ministerial provisions-moreover, is difficult to square with the fact that CAPPS itself sought a preliminary injunction only with respect to the arbitration and class action provision. Dkt. 6,\n   <em>\n    CAPPS\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 17-999. Although the Department was not required to apply the four-factor test that courts apply, it was required to apply something akin to it-some standard that ties the stay to ensuring that the outcome of the pending litigation affords the parties adequate and just relief and that balances the relevant equities. The Department, however, offers no explanation for why it was necessary to stay twenty-two sections of the final rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Moreover, the provisions of the Borrower Defense Regulations that the Department did identify are, at best, mentioned only in a perfunctory manner. The Department observed, in passing, that \"if the final regulations are not postponed, institutions would be subject to financial responsibility trigger provisions that could impose substantial costs,\" Section 705 Stay, 82 Fed. Reg. at 27,621, but it failed to tie that observation to the litigation in any way, and it failed to consider how the public interest or the interest of student borrowers would be affected by its decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   It offered slightly more detail regarding the arbitration and class action provision, but, again, the Department simply asserted, without analysis, that CAPPS had \"raised serious questions concerning the validity of\" the provision and that postponing the effective date would save institutions the cost of making changes to their contracts \"while the regulation is subject to judicial review.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The arbitrary and capricious standard of the APA, however, requires that agencies \"provide an explanation that will enable the court to evaluate the agency's rationale at the time of decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <em>\n    Pension Benefit Guar.

To justify a \u00a7 705 stay, an agency must, in short, do more than simply assert-without elaboration-that the litigation raises unspecified \"serious questions\" for resolution and that a stay will save regulated parties the cost of compliance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4131904\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/833/11/#p34\">\n    833 F.Supp.2d at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The agency cannot use section 705 of the APA to stay the effectiveness of its rules ... simply because litigation ...\n   <em>\n    happens to be pending\n   </em>\n   .\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    California v.

As with the Final Delay Rule, the Department failed to acknowledge, much less to address, the inconsistency between its current view that those provisions stand on legally questionable footing, and its prior conclusion that they were legally sound. While the Borrower Defense Regulations were under consideration, \"[s]everal commenters objected that the Department lack[ed] the legal authority to ban either mandatory predispute arbitration agreements or class action waivers.\" Borrower Defense Regulations, 81 Fed.

It argues, however, that a Section 705 Stay is \"a purely procedural device\" that does not \"effectuate[ ] a substantive change in agency policy,\" and thus \"the Department was not required to 'display awareness that it is changing position and provide [a] reasoned explanation.' \" Dkt. 58-1 at 43. Because a Section 705 Stay is temporary in nature, is often issued on short notice, and is not a substantive rule requiring notice and comment, the Court is prepared to assume-without deciding-that a less demanding standard of review should apply. But the Department's argument still goes too far, and, in effect, rehashes its contention that \u00a7 705 stays lie beyond the reach of judicial review. The unacknowledged and unexplained inconsistency that Plaintiffs raise here could not be more apparent or more central to the Department's decision. Commenters argued that the Department lacked legal authority to issue the arbitration and class action waiver ban; the Department considered those objections in detail and concluded that it had the legal authority; and,\n   then, without acknowledging that conclusion or explaining why it believed its legal authority was questionable, the Department stayed the rule. That is, by any measure, a fundamental and unexplained inconsistency, and, by any measure, it runs afoul of the APA's arbitrary and capricious standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The Department's remaining two rationales fare no better. In the Department's view, the Section 705 Stay was also appropriate because \"the United States would suffer no significant harm from postponing the effectiveness of the final regulations while the litigation is pending,\" and, indeed, postponing the effective date would allow the federal government and taxpayers to avoid \"significant costs.\" Section 705 Stay, 82 Fed. Reg. at 27,621 -22. And, \"[s]eparately,\" the stay would \"allow the Department to consider and [to] conduct a rulemaking process to review and [to] revise the\" Borrower Defense Regulations, while \"ensur[ing] [that] regulated parties [would] not incur costs that could be eliminated under any future regulations the Department promulgates on these matters.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27,622. Both of these rationales suffer from the same defect-they are not tied to the pending litigation and thus exceed the limited scope of \u00a7 705. As the Department itself repeatedly observes, a Section 705 Stay is \"a purely procedural device that operates by temporarily freezing the status quo during the pendency of judicial review,\" Dkt. 581 at 43, and \"[i]t is not a substantive rule itself,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 44. But when an agency decides to delay the effective date of a rule to save the federal government money or to alleviate confusion or a burden on regulated parties while the agency decides whether to amend or to rescind the rule, its action is \"designed to implement ... policy,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4). Considerations of that type go beyond the limited reach of a \u00a7 705 stay and would have required the Department to proceed by rulemaking. As such, they cannot provide a reasoned basis for the Department's decision to issue the Section 705 Stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The Court, accordingly, concludes that the Department's rationale for issuing the Section 705 Stay is arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the appropriate remedy with respect to both the Final Delay Rule and the Section 705 Stay is immediate vacatur. Dkt. 55-1 at 79; Dkt. 56 at 72. They correctly note that, when a court concludes that a rule is unlawful, \"the practice ... is ordinarily to vacate the rule,\"\n   <em>\n    Ill. Pub. Telecomms.
