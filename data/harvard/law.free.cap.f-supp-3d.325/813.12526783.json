Hale, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In April 2012, a fire destroyed several units in an apartment building owned by Plaintiff Willowbrook Investments, LLC. (Docket No. 1-1) At the time of the fire, Willowbrook held an apartment owner's insurance policy issued by Defendants Maryland Casualty Company, Zurich American Insurance Company, and Farmers Insurance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Willowbrook brought this action against Defendants seeking to recover under the policy for the costs it incurred rebuilding the damaged apartments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants have filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that Willowbrook's contract claim is untimely because it was not brought within two years of the date of the physical loss as required by the policy. (D.N. 14; D.N. 14-1) Willowbrook responds that the two-year contractual limitation is unenforceable because it contravenes public policy and violates Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 304.14-370. (D.N. 15) For the reasons explained below, Defendants' motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(D.N. 1-1, PageID # 9-10) Under the policy, Defendants agreed to indemnify Willowbrook for losses it sustained on its property as a result of fire. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 10) In April 2012, while the policy was in effect, a fire destroyed nine units in the apartment building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Willowbrook notified Defendants of the loss, and Defendants paid Willowbrook \"for the depreciated cost of the damage\" to the building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Willowbrook was unable to rebuild the apartments until December 2016 due to \"delays caused by governmental agencies in granting the necessary building permits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After the rebuild was complete, Willowbrook requested payment for additional costs it incurred rebuilding the apartments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants denied the request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Willowbrook filed this action against Defendants in state court, alleging that Defendants breached the insurance policy and refused to pay in bad faith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 11) Defendants removed the action\n   to this Court. (D.N. 1) They have filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that Willowbrook's contract claim is untimely and that the bad-faith claim must be dismissed as derivative of the contract claim. (D.N. 14-1) Willowbrook contends that the two-year contractual limitation in the policy is unenforceable because it was impossible under the circumstances to file suit within two years of the fire.

(D.N. 1-1, PageID # 6-7, 10) Defendants argue that Willowbrook cannot prevail on a contract claim because it failed to file suit within two years of the fire as required by the policy. (D.N. 14-1, PageID # 220-22)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the event of loss, the policy gave Defendants the option to pay the value of the damaged property, pay the cost of replacing the damaged property, take the property at an appraised value, or rebuild the property. (D.N. 1-1, PageID # 71) In this case, Defendants opted to pay the cost of replacing the apartments. (D.N. 16, PageID\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   # 248; D.N. 15, PageID # 232) But under the policy, Defendants would not pay the replacement cost \"[u]ntil the lost or damaged property [was] actually repaired or replaced.\" (D.N. 1-1, PageID # 72) The complaint alleges that \"[d]ue to delays caused by governmental agencies in granting the necessary building permits,\" Willowbrook did not complete the rebuild until December 22, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 10) Because it was not entitled to payment until December 2016, more than two years after the fire, Willowbrook argues that it was \"impossible under the given circumstances\" to file suit within two years in accordance with the two-year contractual limitation. (D.N. 15, PageID # 233) Willowbrook maintains that if it had filed suit within two years of the fire, the suit \"would have been dismissed as premature\" because Willowbrook did not yet have the legal right to demand payment under the policy.
