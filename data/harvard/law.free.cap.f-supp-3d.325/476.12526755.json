The petitioner pleaded guilty on October 9, 2012, to an indictment in New York State Supreme Court, New York County, charging rape in the first degree, sodomy in the first degree, robbery in the first degree, burglary in the first degree, and attempted robbery in the first degree. The petitioner is currently incarcerated and is serving seven concurrent terms of fifteen years. The petitioner argues that his constitutional right to due process of law was violated as a result of his DNA indictment, an amendment to that indictment, and an allegedly delayed prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is\n   <strong>\n    denied.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following is a summary of the relevant facts. On November 8, 1998, a woman was attacked by a man as she was entering her apartment in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Holding a piece of broken glass to the victim's throat, the man raped and sodomized her. State Court Record (\"S.R.\") at 200. He then stole her wallet, took her to an ATM and forced her to withdraw money. S.R. at 200. The victim escaped and was brought to a hospital, where a rape kit was prepared. S.R. at 200. The police recovered the attacker's blood from the victim's coat, as well as an impression left on the ATM receipt by the joint area of a right index finger. Six usable fingerprints were also recovered from the crime scene. S.R. at 201. The police were also able to isolate the attacker's DNA profile from the rape kit. S.R. at 202.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\") conducted an extensive investigation into the incident in an attempt to find the attacker. S.R. at 201. However, the usable fingerprints yielded no match in the State ID system. Other avenues pursued by the police, such as canvassing the area, having the victim review mugshots, and distributing surveillance video to the public, were unsuccessful. S.R. at 201-202. The attacker was not found and the case was closed in July, 1999, when it was determined that all leads had been exhausted. S.R. at 202.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 13, 2005, a New York County grand jury, using the DNA profile obtained during the police investigation, charged the attacker by DNA indictment with rape in the first degree, two counts of sodomy in the first degree, burglary in the first degree, two counts of robbery in the first degree, and attempted robbery in the first degree. S.R. at 203.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In May 2011, while questioning the petitioner concerning an unrelated rape, investigators recovered his DNA from a cigarette he smoked during the interrogation and left in the police station. S.R. at 203. The DNA profile taken from the cigarette butt matched the DNA profile of the attacker who committed the 1998 rape. S.R. at 203. The finger joint impression taken from the crime scene was also matched to the petitioner. S.R. at 203.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 9, 2011, the 2005 indictment was amended to replace the identifying DNA profile with the petitioner's name. S.R. at 203-204. The petitioner was arrested on the amended indictment soon afterwards. S.R. at 9. On July 25, 2011, the petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds of insufficiency, improper amendment, and as a violation of the statute of limitations and the right to a speedy trial. S.R. at 60. On October 25, 2011, the motion was denied by the New York State Supreme Court. S.R. at 171. On October 9, 2012, the petitioner pleaded guilty to all counts of the indictment and executed a waiver of appellate rights. S.R. at 180-189. The petitioner was sentenced on October 23, 2012 to seven concurrent\n   terms of fifteen years of incarceration. S.R. at 35-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The petitioner appealed to the Appellate Division, First Department, claiming that the indictment and subsequent amendment violated several provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions and alleging several state statutory claims.\n   <em>\n    People v.

The Appellate Division affirmed the judgment of conviction. First, the court held that the speedy trial claims raised by the petitioner were meritless because the petitioner had not established prejudice, and the delay was explained by the people's practical inability to prosecute until the attacker's identity was known.\n   <em>\n    Guerrero I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4118832,4097284\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys3d/3/600/\">\n    3 N.Y.S.3d at 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While unclear from his petition, which does not set forth his claims distinctly, the petitioner appears to raise numerous claims regarding the original DNA indictment, the amendment of the indictment, the state statute of limitations, and the allegedly delayed prosecution.

Reading his petition in the light most favorable to his case, as the Court must for a\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   plaintiff, the petitioner alleges the following claims: (1) the John Doe indictment violated his state and federal constitutional rights to be charged by a grand jury, (2) the indictment was not supported by legally sufficient factual allegations, (3) the indictment was not supported by competent and admissible evidence, (4) the indictment was improperly amended, (5) the indictment did not give adequate notice of the charges, (6) the prosecution violated the state statute of limitations, and (7) he was deprived of his right to a speedy trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Resp't Br. 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   These claims can generally be categorized into three groups. First, the petitioner makes claims suggesting that the indictment process was deficient and that the statute of limitations was circumvented through the delayed process of amending the indictment (Claims 1-6). Second, the petitioner argues that the delay between the incident and the amendment of the indictment violated his speedy trial rights\n   under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments (Claim 7). Lastly, Guerrero contends that his constitutional right to due process was violated by the cumulative effect of the errors made by the state trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court will address each category of claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The respondent argues that the petitioner's claims relating to the Doe indictment and the statute of limitations must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, the respondent argues that the petitioner's claims relating to the indictment and state statute of limitations are not cognizable under federal habeas relief because the state court rejected those claims on an independent and adequate state ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Federal courts \"will not review a question of federal law decided by a state court if the decision of that court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

In this case, the length of the delay -- six years -- weighs in favor of the petitioner. However, the length of the delay is primarily a triggering mechanism, and is not dispositive of the merits of the claim.\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    407 U.S. at 530-531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The second factor, reason for delay, is \"closely related\" to the length of the delay. The Supreme Court, in recognizing this test, also stated that \"a valid reason ... should serve to justify appropriate delay.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, there was a plainly valid reason for the six-year delay: the petitioner had not been matched to his DNA profile in the indictment. As the Appellate Division explained, the prosecution lacked the \"practical [ ]ability to prosecute defendant until they obtained his DNA sample from another arrest.\"\n   <em>\n    Guerrero I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4118832,4097284\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys3d/3/600/\">\n    3 N.Y.S.3d at 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the second\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factor weighs against the petitioner. The third factor, the petitioner's assertion of his rights, weighs in favor of the petitioner because he immediately asserted his speedy trial rights after his 2011 arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Prejudice to the petitioner is the fourth\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factor, and it weighs heavily against him. There has been no prejudice shown in this case and the record shows no attempt to demonstrate prejudice. In assessing prejudice,\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   lays out three interests of the defendant to consider: (i) \"prevent[ing] oppressive pretrial incarceration,\" (ii) \"minimiz[ing] anxiety and concern of the accused,\" and (iii) \"limit[ing] the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 532,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . During the six-year period between the initial indictment and the amendment of the indictment, the petitioner was not incarcerated, and therefore was also not subjected to any anxiety or concern as an accused -- because he had not yet been accused. Further, due to the nature, and conclusiveness, of the DNA evidence, the defense was not impaired by the delay. In fact, there is no indication that the trial would have proceeded any differently if it had proceeded in 2005. Considering the\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   factors, it is plain that the delay between the filing of the original indictment and the trial was not a violation of the petitioner's rights under the Sixth Amendment. The accused did not want a trial -- and he benefitted from the delay by continuing to remain free for more than twelve years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Although not clear from his papers, the petitioner also apparently argues that the cumulative effect of many trial-court errors deprived him of due process of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   However, the state courts found not only that these claims were waived by the guilty plea, but also that the underlying indictment, and its subsequent amendment, were valid. There is no indication that there were any cognizable state law errors which cumulatively denied the petitioner\n   due process. Objections to the legal sufficiency of the indictment and its amendment were waived under state law.\n   <em>\n    Guerrero II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12281187\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/28/110/\">\n    42 N.Y.S.3d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12281187\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/28/110/\">\n    65 N.E.3d at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed above, the courts of the State of New York have found that, as a matter of state law, the petitioner's guilty plea barred each of the indictment and statute of limitations related claims. These claims made up the majority of the petitioner's cumulative due process violation claim -- and it is plain these claims are not meritorious. Therefore, the petitioner is not left with any substantial number of alleged trial-court errors on which he can rely to make a \"cumulative\" argument. Thus, there are no cognizable errors that accumulated to deny the petitioner due process of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the reasons explained above, the petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is\n   <strong>\n    denied.\n   </strong>\n   Because the petitioner has failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, the Court declines to issue a certificate of appealability pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).
