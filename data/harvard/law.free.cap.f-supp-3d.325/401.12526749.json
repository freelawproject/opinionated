Ex. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 22, 2018, prior to filing the Petition, Petitioner moved this Court (in its Part I capacity) for permission to file parts of the Petition under seal, to file the Petition anonymously, and for an emergency TRO staying her removal, releasing her from detention, and staying her transfer to a different detention facility. The Court held a brief conference, attended by counsel for Respondents. The Court denied the TRO application without prejudice but approved the application for provisional sealing and anonymous filing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order (Aug. 22, 2018), Dkt. 14; Tr. of Aug. 22, 2018 conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On August 23, 2018, Petitioner filed the Petition and, due to the unavailability of the case's assigned District Court Judge, again appeared before this Court in its Part I capacity and reapplied for the TRO. Respondents filed a letter-motion seeking to transfer the case to the District of New Jersey, arguing that this Court lacks jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ltr. (Aug. 23, 2018), Dkt. 6. The Court held a hearing, reserved decision on the motion to transfer, and denied the TRO without prejudice pending further briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order (Aug. 23, 2018), Dkt. 7. The parties filed further submissions on August 24, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ltrs., Dkts. 12, 13. Respondents' August 24 letter represented that Petitioner will not be removed from the United States before September 10, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ltr. (Aug. 24, 2018), Dkt. 12, at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Scope of Petitioner's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before turning to the parties' applications, it is worth clarifying the scope of relief that Petitioner is seeking. The Petition claims that Petitioner's removal from the United States would violate the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and procedural due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. at 40 (header to first cause of action), 45 (header to fourth cause of action). The primary basis for this claim is that removal would deprive Petitioner of the opportunity to pursue her T Nonimmigrant Status application and VAWA self-petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 101, 104, 118-120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Petitioner argues that if she were removed from the United States before USCIS could rule on her applications, she would become statutorily ineligible for those programs.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 100, 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Petitioner therefore seeks a stay of removal until USCIS can adjudicate her applications.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 103, 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Put differently, this claim effectively challenges the\n   <em>\n    timing\n   </em>\n   of the execution of Petitioner's order of removal; it does not appear to challenge the validity of the removal order itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In addition, Petitioner seeks release from detention pending removal,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 107-113, 122-128, 131, 133-135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or (presumably in the alternative) an order restraining Respondents from transferring her to detention facilities outside the New York City area prior to removal,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n    \u00b6 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Aug. 1, 2018). Put differently,\n   <em>\n    Calderon\n   </em>\n   analyzed the petition as a whole when applying the custodian rules, rather than applying the rules on a claim-by-claim basis. In\n   <em>\n    Mahmood v. Nielsen\n   </em>\n   , Judge Torres took a different approach: she found that venue was proper for the petitioner's \"non-core\" claims and then applied the doctrine of \"pendent venue\" to assert venue over the remaining \"core\" claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525399\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/312/417/#p423\">\n    312 F.Supp.3d 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423-24 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (reasoning that \"a federal court may in its discretion hear pendent claims which arise out of the same nucleus of operative facts as a properly venued federal claim, even if venue of the\n   pendent claim otherwise would not lie\" (emphasis omitted) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court finds neither of these approaches satisfactory.

The Court believes that this statement applies only to petitions that challenge a single type of custody. When a \"mixed\" petition challenges multiple forms of custody, and thus implicates a number of different custodians, it is unlikely that the Supreme Court would require only a single custodian as a respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

This Court does not have jurisdiction over these claims, as Petitioner has brought them in the Southern District of New York, outside of the \"district of confinement.\"\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , 542 U.S. at 443,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p434\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Turning to Petitioner's \"non-core\" claim, the form of custody challenged here is an order of removal.

(Aug. 23, 2018), Dkt. 6, Exs. D, E (citing\n    <em>\n     Alsomairi v. Dawson\n    </em>\n    , No. 18-CV-7000, Tr. of Aug. 8, 2018 conference;\n    <em>\n     Pastor v. Sessions\n    </em>\n    , No. 18-CV-6941, Tr. of Aug. 3, 2018 conference). These courts' rulings may have been based on sloppiness in the applicable petitions. In those cases' petitions-as in the Petition here-the prayers for relief asked only for a release from detention (a \"core\" claim), even though the petitions' causes of action also asked for a stay of removal (a \"non-core\" claim).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 130-135;\n    <em>\n     Alsomairi\n    </em>\n    , No. 18-CV-7000, Dkt. 1;\n    <em>\n     Pastor\n    </em>\n    , No. 18-CV-6941, Dkt. 1;\n    <em>\n     see also Alsomairi\n    </em>\n    , Tr. of Aug. 8, 2018 conference, at 15 (\"I think it's clear ... that the focus of the petition ... is detention, that is obvious from the prayer of relief at the end of the document where the petitioner requests relief from custody.\"). Because these rulings appear to have been premised on an unduly narrow reading of the applicable petitions, the Court does not find them persuasive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    There could be a situation in which no such single district exists. Because that is not likely the case here, the Court expresses no opinion as to whether the \"core\" and \"non-core\" claims in a petition could properly be split into two petitions filed in separate districts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    As the Court has discussed, by seeking a stay of removal, the Petition challenges the timing of the execution of the order of removal, not the validity of the removal order itself. The cases that hold that the Attorney General was a proper respondent mostly involved challenges to the validity of removal orders, not applications for stays of removal.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Somir\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030774\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/354/215/\">\n     354 F.Supp.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    217-18 ;\n    <em>\n     Batista-Taveras\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202149095\">\n     2004 WL 2149095\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *6. Because the Petition offers no reason why the Attorney General should not be the legal custodian in both types of cases, the Court will apply that principle to this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Petitioner has also named Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, ICE New York Field Office Director Thomas Decker, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as Respondents.
