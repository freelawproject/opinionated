He sought to recover for his injuries from the truck's insurer, Defendant Federated Mutual Insurance Co., under the Uninsured Motorist/Underinsured Motorist (\"UM/UIM\") provisions of Keystone's policy. Federated denied his claim because Keystone had rejected UM/UIM coverage for all those insured by its commercial policy, except owners, managers, and their families. Rarick brought this action challenging Federated's denial of benefits as a violation of Pennsylvania insurance law. This opinion addresses cross-motions for Summary Judgment filed by Rarick and Federated. For the reasons set forth below, this Court denies Rarick's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and grants Federated's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are taken from the Joint Stipulation of Facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 27, 2011, Rarick was driving a truck owned by his employer, Keystone Automotive Operations, Inc. (\"Keystone\"). Stip. Facts \u00b6 1, ECF No. 62. Keystone was the holder of a commercial automotive insurance policy issued by Federated, intended to cover the vehicles owned by Keystone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. It is important to note from the outset that a default insurance policy carries with it Uninsured Motorist and Underinsured Motorist (\"UM/UIM\") benefits pursuant to the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (\"MVFRL\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201731\">\n    75 Pa.

Stip. Facts \u00b6 1. Rarick filed a claim under the Federated policy on January 18, 2013, which Federated denied by letter on January 25, 2013 because the policy excluded UM/UIM benefits for employees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201731\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%201731\">\n    \u00b6 3, 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Federated provided the forms the following day, August 6, 2013.

Facts \u00b6 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rarick filed this action primarily claiming that the coverage scheme created by Federated is unlawful under the MVFRL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal Ex. A. \u00b6 37-38, ECF No. 1 [hereinafter \"Complaint\"].

When a corporation rejects UM/UIM coverage, the effective level of coverage for employees is $0.00. Thus, an employee's level of UM/UIM coverage may be $0.00 through a waiver that is compliant with \u00a7 1731(b) and (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Third, a rejection of UM/UIM benefits under \u00a7 1731 is not considered the same as a reduction of benefits under \u00a7 1734.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yocum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202743865\">\n    2007 WL 2743865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. In\n   <em>\n    Yocum\n   </em>\n   , Federated attempted to argue that \u00a7 1731 did not apply because its limiting of UM/UIM coverage to $0.00 for employees was merely a reduction in benefits under \u00a7 1734 and not a true rejection pursuant to \u00a7 1731.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202743865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court rejected this argument, finding that limiting the benefits to $0.00 was a rejection, not a reduction, and thus requires strict compliance with \u00a7 1731.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202743865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, because the level of coverage for employees at Keystone is $0.00, the Court does not need to apply \u00a7 1734; rather, the Court should look to the validity of the rejection under \u00a7 1731.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Fourth, as discussed above, the language of Federated's rejection complies with \u00a7 1731.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Because (1) Pennsylvania permits different levels of UM/UIM coverage among different personnel of the insured corporation, (2) the level of coverage for a specific group of personnel may be set to $0.00, (3) \u00a7 1734 does not apply where the limiting of benefits is a rejection and not a reduction, and (4) the rejection complies with \u00a7 1731, Federated's coverage structure is lawful under the MVFRL. Nothing in the language of \u00a7 1731 suggests that a waiver of UM/UIM must be an \"all-or-nothing\" waiver as Rarick would have it. As long as the waiver is compliant with the rejection form of the MVFRL, it is valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   This conclusion finds support in\n   <em>\n    Wiley v. Universal Underwriters\n   </em>\n   . In that case, the policy-holder, CarSense, rejected UM/UIM benefits for employees but elected $300,000 in UM/UIM coverage for Francis and Marion McGowan, the principals of CarSense.\n   <em>\n    Wiley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20495794\">\n    2017 WL 495794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. The court in\n   <em>\n    Wiley\n   </em>\n   held that the system of insurance was valid under the MVFRL and was not void as a matter of public policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-5. Rarick attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Wiley\n   </em>\n   by contending that the McGowans were named insureds, and that they exercised a separate option with regard to the UM/UIM rejection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Supp. Mem. 12. However, this attempt at a distinction is unpersuasive where the facts of\n   <em>\n    Wiley\n   </em>\n   read, \"\n   <em>\n    CarSense\n   </em>\n   also executed a Pennsylvania Underinsured Motorist Elective Options Form, expressly designating $300,000 of UIM coverage for the McGowans only....\"\n   <em>\n    Wiley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20495794\">\n    2017 WL 495794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (emphasis added). Therefore, the situation in\n   <em>\n    Wiley\n   </em>\n   is similar to the situation at bar insofar as the corporation, as a named insured, rejected UM/UIM benefits for one part of the corporation while electing UM/UIM benefits for selected individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Furthermore, the MVFRL's objectives support finding this system of coverage lawful. Under the system proposed by Rarick, a policy-holder would be required to purchase \"$15,000.00/$30,000.00\" of UM/UIM coverage for all of its employees if the corporation wanted UM/UIM coverage for its executives, directors, and owners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. 27, ECF No. 67-2. Similar to the prohibitive costs associated\n   with the mandatory stacking provision discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the increased costs of requiring UM/UIM coverage where an employer specifically seeks to reject it for certain groups of employees would defeat the cost-containment objective of the MVFRL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This consideration of cost-containment objectives is supported by a recent Pennsylvania Superior Court case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Byoung Suk An v.

Rather, the documents are clear. The UM Endorsement states that \"insureds\" are \"legally entitled to recover.\" Stip. Facts Ex. A. at 31 (A.1). It then states that an \"insured\" can be \"[a]nyone 'occupying' a covered 'motor vehicle' or a temporary substitute for a covered 'motor vehicle.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32 (B.2.a.). Then, in Section D.1., the Endorsement states that the amount the \"insured\" is legally entitled to recover is set forth in \"the Limit of Insurance for Uninsured Motorist Coverage shown in the Schedule or Declaration\" (\"Declaration\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (D.1.). In the subsequent Declaration, the amount is clearly set at $1,000,000 for \"directors, officers, partners or owners ... and their 'family members'....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. Just below, the amount of UM coverage for \"any other persons qualifying as 'insureds' under the WHO IS AN INSURED provision\" is left blank.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Declaration states that \"[i]f no limit is shown below, no coverage is afforded to any other person.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the blank line on the Declaration indicates that there is no UM coverage afforded to \"any\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   person qualifying as 'insureds.' \"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Rarick, by reason of his position in the company, falls into this second category of those not afforded UM coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Endorsement and subsequent Declaration of Limits of Insurance do not contradict the UM/UIM Rejection required by \u00a7 1731. Rather, they are in accord with one another. Both the \u00a7 1731 rejection and the Endorsement state that the policy will provide UM/UIM coverage for the owners, executives, and other upper-level personnel of the company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39; Stip.

Therefore, the rejection form required by \u00a7 1731 does not contradict or confuse the Endorsements that lay out the details of the policy with regard to UM/UIM benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Contrary to Rarick's contention, the terms are not susceptible to different constructions, nor are they indefinite such that they may be subject to multiple meanings.

J. \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   However, Rarick was on notice from his first communication with Federated that he was not covered by the policy and that his claim would be denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip.

In its letter dated January 25, 2013, Federated's claim agent stated that \"uninsured motorist insurance applies only to directors, officers, partners or owners of Keystone Automotive Operations, Inc. and their family members.

Facts Ex. F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Furthermore, it is difficult for Rarick to argue that the defense of the valid rejection form was not properly asserted when the rejection form is (1) mentioned six times in Federated's Answer to the Complaint and (2) listed in paragraph 74 of the \"Affirmative and Other Defenses\" section of the Answer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ans. 5-8, 11, ECF No. 8. Rarick's Memorandum in Support of his Motion for Summary Judgment alleges that Rarick \"assumed\" Federated was referencing a different document\n   when Federated stated that it obtained a valid \"Rejection of Uninsured Motorist Coverage\" in its Answer to the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Supp. Mem. 9 n.7. But the form Federated referenced seven total times in its Answer bears a name that is nearly\n   <em>\n    identical\n   </em>\n   in every way to the title of the statutorily provided form, changing only \"protection\" to \"coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ans. 5-8, 11,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1731(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Rarick's mistaken assumption does not support an estoppel claim. He was provided notice of the rejection of his claim and provided the relevant policy portion to support the rejection of his claim. Furthermore, Rarick had clear notice from the Answer that Federated had a valid rejection form and intended to raise it as a defense in the action. At that point, Rarick could have decided to change his position and elected to settle or withdraw the claims against Federated. However, Rarick has persisted for nearly five years in his claim that the system of coverage created is unlawful, and this claim is not affected by the presence or lack thereof of a valid waiver. This lack of connection between Rarick's arguments and the presence of a valid waiver weighs heavily against estoppel. At least one court has recognized that \"induce[ment] to file an unsuccessful lawsuit is not sufficient,\" on its own, to establish detrimental reliance.\n   <em>\n    Weintraub\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"117364\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/609/273/#p275\">\n    609 F.Supp. at 275-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Here, Federated is not estopped from asserting the rejection as a defense. Foremost, \u00a7 1731(c.1) contains no timing requirements, and therefore, Federated has sufficiently complied with the production requirement by keeping a valid waiver and producing it during discovery. Second, a finding of estoppel can be made only where there is actual detrimental reliance. Rarick alleges no other detrimental reliance beyond filing this suit, and such reliance does not warrant estoppel.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"117364\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/609/273/#p275\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rarick was on specific notice that his claim was not viable under the provided policy, and when Federated included the existence of a valid rejection form in its Answer seven times, Rarick should have been on notice of the existence of the form and made reasonable inquiries as to its existence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Furthermore, the inclusion of the defense has not altered Federated's position on coverage, nor has it altered Rarick's argument that the two-tiered system of coverage is unlawful.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Blofsen v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Summary judgment is warranted for Federated in this action because Federated is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n   law with regard to (1) the existence of a valid rejection of UM/UIM benefits under the MVFRL, (2) the existence of a valid coverage scheme with respect to the Keystone Policy under the MVFRL, and (3) the ability of Federated to assert the valid rejection as a defense. Federated has produced a valid rejection of UM/UIM benefits that complies with the requirements of the MVFRL. Nothing in the MVFRL prohibits a commercial policyholder from rejecting UM/UIM benefits for some and electing it for others. Finally, Federated is not estopped from asserting the valid UM/UIM rejection form as a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Therefore, this Court grants summary judgment in Federated's favor.

Here, the Court is not dealing with an insurer who is attempting to restrict coverage post facto and reduce the coverage rights of an insured. Rather, there is a contractual agreement, requested by the corporate policy-holder, which restricts coverage in the manner that the policy-holder desired. Contrary to Rarick's implications, the Court is capable of considering\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n    the \"goal of maximum feasible restoration to accident victims\" and the cost-containment purpose of the MVFRL.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Section D.1. of the Pennsylvania Uninsured Motorist Coverage-Non-Stacked Endorsement states in relevant part, \"the most we will pay for all damages resulting from one 'accident' is the Limit of Insurance for Uninsured Motorist Coverage shown in the Schedule or Declarations.\" Stip.
