PAULEY III, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Color of Change and the Center for Constitutional Rights (together, \"Plaintiffs\") and the United States Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") bring dueling motions for partial summary judgment in this Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") lawsuit. Plaintiffs seek disclosure of eight draft versions of a never-finalized intelligence assessment, as well as a portion of an e-mail regarding that assessment. DHS contends the documents are protected under FOIA Exemptions 3, 5, and 6. For the reasons that follow, DHS's\n   motion for partial summary judgment is granted and Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   DHS's Intelligence &amp; Analysis Office (\"I &amp; A\") \"gather[s] and share[s] intelligence information in support of DHS's broader counterterrorism, homeland security, and component-specific missions.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Arthur R. Sepeta, ECF No. 60 (\"Sepeta Decl.\") \u00b6 7.) As part of its mission, I &amp; A \"analyze[s] trends in terrorism affecting the United States, including domestic terrorism.\" (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The documents that Plaintiffs seek are drafts of a proposed intelligence assessment created by an I &amp; A analyst and intern in the spring of 2017. (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 22-23, 31.) The assessment was titled \"(U\\\\FOUO) Growing Frequency of Race-Related Domestic Terrorist Violence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \" and it \"contemplated a survey of violent, terroristic acts that were driven by race-related extremist ideologies of varying stripes in order to assess developing trends in this space.\" (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) Most of the drafts contain comments and edits. (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6 31.) No version was ever finalized or adopted. (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6 32.) Rather, after going through the preliminary steps of I &amp; A's editorial review process, the agency chose to abandon the assessment. (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In July 2016, Plaintiffs submitted a FOIA request to both DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking documents related to government surveillance and monitoring of the Movement for Black Lives (\"MBL\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sepeta Decl., Ex. A, at 1.) DHS referred the request to I &amp; A. (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6 12 &amp; Ex. B.) In September 2016, DHS informed Plaintiffs that it had located no responsive documents. (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6 13 &amp; Ex. C.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In October 2016, after administratively appealing DHS's determination, Plaintiffs filed this action. (Compl. \u00b6 10.) In April 2017, based on the parties' agreement, this Court entered a scheduling order directing I &amp; A to process or produce 500 pages of documents responsive to Plaintiffs' request per month. (Amended Scheduling Order, ECF No. 28.) The parties worked in good faith to resolve this action, and I &amp; A made six rounds of productions. (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In January 2018, the parties informed this Court that nearly all production issues had been resolved except for I &amp; A's withholding of the documents subject to this motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 25, 2018 Hearing Transcript, ECF No. 48, at 3:19-25.) DHS produced the drafts in fully redacted form. (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6 19.) DHS also withheld a portion of a March 3, 2017 email sent by a senior analyst to the paper's authors providing feedback and attaching an edited draft. (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6 25.) Through other documents that DHS produced, Plaintiffs learned that this assessment had been referred to internally as the \"Race Paper,\" and therefore believed it may contain information relevant to their request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In connection with its motion for partial summary judgment, DHS provided a\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   declaration prepared by Arthur R. Sepeta, Chief of the Privacy and Intelligence\n   Oversight Branch of I &amp; A. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Sepeta Decl.) Sepeta oversees I &amp; A's FOIA responses. (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6 3.) After oral argument, this Court also reviewed the disputed documents\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum &amp; Order, ECF No. 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   DHS asserts that three FOIA exemptions protect production: (1) Exemption 5, as to all materials, (2) Exemption 3, as to portions of the materials, and (3) Exemption 6, as to names of I &amp; A employees. Plaintiffs counter that DHS fails to show these exemptions apply and that this Court should order release of any segregable portions of the documents. As discussed below, Exemption 5 fully protects the documents Plaintiffs seek. Accordingly, this Court does not reach the other Exemptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   FOIA actions are typically resolved through summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

They were created by staff without \"final decision-making authority for [DHS],\" meaning release would \"expose the exchange of ideas and suggestions that accompany I &amp; A's ... preliminary assessments.\" (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 31, 33.) After they were drafted, the documents \"only went through part of I &amp; A's editorial review process and w[ere] not close to finalization\" before being terminated. (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Regarding whether they are deliberative, Sepeta represents that papers such as these are \"broadly disseminated [by I &amp; A] to inform policy decisions, threat prioritization, and resource planning and allocation\" among various policymakers, and provide guidance for \"DHS actions and intelligence collection efforts against violent extremist actors.\" (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6 30.)

Sept. 27, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The drafts at issue contain factual information-namely, references to and descriptions of domestic terrorism incidents. The paper's authors use those events to support and provide examples for the conclusions they reach. DHS contends that these facts still show \"which data [I &amp; A chose] to include or remove during the drafting process and how to weigh that data.\" (Sepeta Decl. \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After reviewing the documents, this Court agrees. Even the factual portions of the drafts demonstrate DHS's deliberative process. They show the authors' judgment in \"cull[ing] the relevant documents, extract[ing] pertinent facts, [and] organiz[ing] them to suit a specific purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Sec.

The factual materials do not exist in a vacuum. Rather, they are interwoven with the papers' policy judgments. Therefore, release would reveal the process by which \"factual material was assembled through an exercise of judgment in extracting pertinent material from a vast number of documents for the benefit of an official called upon to take discretionary action.\"\n   <em>\n    Mapother v.

Instead, \"the key question ... [is] whether the disclosure of materials would expose an agency's decisionmaking process in such a way as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and thereby undermine the agency's ability to perform its functions.\"\n   <em>\n    Dudman Commc'ns Corp. v.

Cir. 1987). Here, the factual portions may have originated from public sources. But an analyst and intern compiled and arranged those materials to support the positions they espoused. In such an amalgam, the factual portions of the drafts at issue are equally deliberative.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lead Indus. Ass'n, Inc. v.

But this would still show the authors' determinations of which facts were worthy of inclusion, regardless of what was included in earlier drafts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that this reading of segregability threatens to swallow the rule, meaning that an agency will always contend that segregable factual data displays its editorial judgments. However, there are certain situations where a factual narrative would not reveal editorial judgments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mapother\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724300,10518583\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/3/1533/\">\n    3 F.3d at 1539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying privilege to section of report that was \"in substance an inventory, presented in chronological order\");\n   <em>\n    Leopold v.
