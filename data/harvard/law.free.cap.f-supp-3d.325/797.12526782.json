Bertelsman, United States District Judge\n   This matter is before the Court on various motions for summary judgment (Docs. 199, 201, 208, 209).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court previously heard oral argument on these motions and took the matter under submission. After further study, the Court now issues the following Memorandum Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual and Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Sales of Rad-Chips to Valley Forge\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Valley Forge Composite Technologies, Inc. (\"Valley Forge\") was a publicly traded company with its principal place of business in Covington, Kentucky. Valley Forge was purportedly engaged in the production and sale of momentum wheels used by spacecraft for altitude control. In addition, following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Valley Forge stated in public filings that it was developing homeland security and counter-terrorism products, including a personal screening system called \"ODIN\" and a system to detect narcotics, explosives and bio-chemical weapons called \"THOR.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 215-17, Investor Information). Ultimately, however, the THOR and ODIN systems proved unviable, and Valley Forge never sold a THOR or ODIN device or generated sales, income or profit from them. (Brothers Plea Agreement, Doc. 199-18 at 5; Brothers Depo. Doc. 199-2 at 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At all relevant times, Louis Brothers (\"Brothers\") was Valley Forge's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Brothers' wife, Rosemary, was the company's bookkeeper. Other employees were Kyle Seeger, an engineer; Keith McClellan, General Counsel; Larry Wilhide, Vice-President of Engineering; and Jim Carr, a friend of Brothers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Avnet/Xilinx\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Avnet, Inc. serves customers in the electronics industry. At all relevant times, Avnet served as a manufacturing representative for a company called Xilinx, Inc. (\"Xilinx\"). In August 2009, Avnet extended credit to Valley Forge so it could purchase goods through Avnet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   From 2009 to 2013, Valley Forge purchased from Xilinx, through Avnet, electronic components known as radiation hardened chips (\"rad-chips\"). Rad-chips are designed to resist radiation levels found in space, high altitudes, and nuclear facilities. At the time of these sales, rad-chips were classified as defense articles and their export was regulated by the Arms Export Control Act (\"AECA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202778\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 80, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\"ITAR\"), 22 C.F.R. parts 120-30, the Export Administration Act of 1979 (\"EAA\"), 50 U.S.C. app \u00a7\u00a7 2401 -10, and the Export Administration Regulations (\"EAR\"), 15 C.F.R. parts 730-74. These regulations required any person intending to export defense articles to obtain governmental approval and to file\n   \"end-user\" certificates with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When Valley Forge purchased rad-chips from Avnet, Avnet would obtain the chips from Xilinx. Avnet managed the customer relationship between Xilinx and Valley Forge, and it provided salespeople and engineering personnel to work with Valley Forge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Xilinx also contracted with Bear VAI, an independent sales representative company based in Kentucky, to service the Valley Forge account. (Chetan Depo. Doc. 203-7 at 3185). Jason Meyer of Bear VAI occasionally visited Valley Forge's office, but Brothers never told Meyer what Valley Forge was doing with the microchips. (Brothers Depo. 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In July 2009, Valley Forge placed a large order with Avnet. On July 23, 2009, Avnet's customer care department emailed Brothers and asked for additional information, including end user data. Brothers responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   End User (OEM) is Valley Forge until we build it into our product. It could be shipped worldwide. We do not want restricted [ ] ITAR restricted product.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Project information: Momentum Wheels and control system for our miniature particle accelerators. May be used in our nuclear explosion detection product but that will be evaluated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Doc. 224-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In August 2009, Evelyn Morales of Xilinx circulated an email to Xilinx distributors, sales representatives, and customers informing them of new ITAR requirements for certain products. (Doc. 2203-18 at 3241-46). This email specifically noted that ITAR prohibited the export of certain products to China. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3243). It also attached a sample end-user certificate that customers would be required to complete, as well as a list of products subject to ITAR regulations. This email triggered queries about whether Valley Forge's order was subject to these requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On August 6, 2009, Jason Meyer of Bear VAI stated: \"If these are space-grade devices and being exported, then they will need to complete the forms before they can purchase. The customer will have to advise.\" (Doc. 203-18 at 3239).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 27, 2009, Kimberly Marriott of Avnet met with Valley Forge and reported back to Bear VAI:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I met with the customer today and here is what I found out. Valley Forge is a company that has been in a R &amp; D phase since 911 ...

Brothers responded \"All products.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In September 2010, Xilinx's Export Compliance department raised a question about one of the end-user certificates submitted by Valley Forge:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [A] statement of \"Research and Development for data acquisition system in radiated environment\" seems a little generic. Is our sales person knowing and comfortable with what they use these devices with, or do we happened [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] to know the end (satellite) program they are working on?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (Doc. 203-23 at 3283). This query was forwarded to Avnet and Bear VAI, who in turn communicated with Xilinx's Khona. Khona responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   To answer your question below, these devices are going into body and cargo scanner equipment. Body scanning as in airport scanner and cargo scanning as counter-terrorism equipment. These are not space applications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Attached is more info on the company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (Doc. 203-23 at 3281).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Upon receipt of this information, Xilinx's Export Compliance responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   So does Valley Forge develop and sell body and cargo scanners with our ITAR FPGAs? By signing our EUC, they have acknowledged that they would be responsible to inform their customers with the ITAR nature of our and their devices and apply ITAR license if their products are ever to be exported.\n   <strong>\n    I will approve the PO based on this understanding, please communicate this message to the customer if we have not yet.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (Doc. 203-23 at 3280) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   That same day, Gary Brady of Avnet emailed Brothers about the above questions from Xilinx:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Just a quick note that Xilinx questioned the End Use Cert. that you filled out. Thanks to Jason and Chetan; they gave some more details concerning your product and Xilinx did approve.\n   <strong>\n    However, Xilinx did want us to remind you that by signing their EUC you have acknowledged that you would be responsible to inform your customers with the ITAR nature of the product and apply ITAR license if your product is exported.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (Doc. 203-17 at 3234) (emphasis added). Brothers responded:\n   <strong>\n    \"[O]f course.\"\n   </strong>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On June 6, 2011, Kimberly Marriott of Avnet emailed Brothers and Kyle Seger at Valley Forge:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Peter Hache from Xilinx who is Chetan Konan's manager will be coming through the territory the week of July 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   .

May I ask if you both can allow a few minutes out of your busy schedule to meet with Peter for a quick introduction?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Doc. 224-1 at 4043).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The next morning, Seger forwarded the message to Brothers, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   This Peter guy is one of the top guys in Xilinx. He's Chetan's boss. While I was on the phone with Kim, she was saying he wants to come in because he's getting suspicious and is trying to find out what all the parts are being used for.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Figured I'd let you know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On October 2012, Jason Meyer of Bear VAI sent Brothers an email regarding an end-user certificate that Valley Forge had submitted for a purchase from Avnet:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Lou-here is the hold up. End user cannot state TBD. It has to state a US entity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   If you like, you could list Valley Forge, or state same as above, sign and date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   (Doc. 224-1 at 4044). Brothers responded that he would \"take care\" of it, and the next day Valley Forge submitted an end-user certificate that listed Valley Forge as the end user and \"THOR-LVX\" as the specific end use. (Doc. 203-6 at 3152).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   2.\n   <strong>\n    Aeroflex/Quality Components\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Another company called Aeroflex also sold rad chips to Valley Forge through its representative Quality Components (\"QC\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In an email dated January 14, 2008, Brothers requested a quote for certain chips from John McDonough at QC, stating \"We only want parts that are unregulated.\" (Doc. 199-27 at 2618). Aeroflex, through QC, responded with a quote that noted that completed State Department End User Certificates would be required for the purchase of any ITAR-regulated items. (Doc. 199-27 at 2617-2633). Those certificates required Valley Forge to agree to comply with U.S. export laws governed by ITAR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2633).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   This January 2008 inquiry did not result in any purchase by Valley Forge from Aeroflex. (Rush Decl. Doc. 215-4 at 3635). It was not until June 2009-a year and a half later-when Aeroflex shipped its first order to Valley Forge. (Rush Decl. Exh. B. Doc. 215-4 at 3640-43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On August 26, 2009, Jim Rush, Regional Sales Manager for Aeroflex, emailed Brothers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   I spoke to our Export Compliance manager to understand the rules with respect to exporting Aeroflex Colorado Springs devices. He sent me the attached regulations that I have included for your review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    He mentioned that the rules have gotten tighter over the last couple of years and virtually everything that Aeroflex Colorado Springs makes for space requires a state department license to ship out of country.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    I double checked the specific parts list that we quoted to you on 8/24/09 and all the parts fall under state department rules (including the devices with an \"L\" radiation designator).

(Rush Decl. Doc. 215-4 at 3636; Doc. 215-23 at 3850, internal Aeroflex email from Rush for Valley Forge order for Odin and Thor systems).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In January 2013, in response to a concern raised by an Aeroflex Regional Sales\n   Manager, Rush asked Brothers if any of the material Valley Forge purchased from Aeroflex was being exported to China, and Brothers stated that it was not. (Rush Decl. Doc. 215-4 at 3636, Doc. 215-8 at AERO0012712).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Valley Forge's Export of Chips and What It Told the Supplier Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Aeroflex and Avnet shipped the rad-chips to Valley Forge in Kentucky. Brothers' plea agreement describes what Valley Forge then did with the chips:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   VFCT's office contained an interior room with no windows and one entrance. This room was used to repackage the microcircuits for export. This room was secured by a lock the Defendant had installed on the door to safely store the microcircuits and limit access to them. When the microcircuits were delivered to the office, the Defendant and others would remove the microcircuits from their original packaging, which was designed to insure the integrity of the microcircuits during shipping. The Defendant and others would then repackage the microcircuits in Federal Express (FEDEX) packaging for export. They often marked the FEDEX packages as \"computer memory chips\" and understated the value of the contents. The Defendant and others insured the original packaging and labels were destroyed or shredded. The Defendant and others would then export the microcircuits to Hong Kong and the PRC by FEDEX.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   (Doc. 199-18 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Valley Forge did not tell the suppliers that the microchips were being purchased to sell to customers in Hong Kong. (Brothers Depo. 71-72, 79; Brothers Depo. Doc. 215-2 at 3619). Instead, Brothers falsely told the suppliers that the chips were being purchased for use in the THOR and ODIN systems. (Brothers Depo. 76; Marriott Depo., Doc. 203-10 at 3199; Rush Depo., Doc. 199-32 at 2657; Seger Depo. Doc. 231-4 at 5991). Seger testified that Brothers instructed him not to tell the suppliers that the chips were being repackaged and sold overseas. (Seger Depo. 203-11 at 79, 140). Carr also testified that he never told Avnet, Aeroflex, or Xilinx that the chips were going to be shipped overseas. (Carr Depo. Doc. 203-12 at 3207).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Brothers and Seger also submitted to Avnet and Xilinx \"End-User Certificates\" which stated, falsely, that the products would not be exported by Valley Forge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Brothers, who was ultimately prosecuted criminally, swore in his plea agreement that he falsified the end-user certificates that Valley Forge submitted to suppliers or that he failed to return them. (Doc. 199-18 at 5). He also so testified in his deposition in this matter:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Q. And you would falsify these end-user statements, stating the microcircuits were for application in THOR or ODIN and would not be exported from the United States, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (Brothers Depo. 66) (Doc. 203-3).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Brothers Depo. 75-76.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Brothers testified that from 2008 to 2013, Valley Forge never submitted end-user certificates to Aeroflex. (Brothers\n   Depo. Doc. 224-1 at 3999; Brothers Depo. Doc. 215-2 at 3618). Brothers further swore in his plea agreement that one end-user statement for a purchase from Aeroflex that showed the People's Republic of China as the intended destination of those products was never returned to Aeroflex. (Doc. 199-18 at 6; Brothers Depo. Doc. 215-2 at 3616). Brothers further swore that he falsified or failed to return the end-user statements to avoid detection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Brothers also swore in his plea agreement that Valley Forge falsified its public filings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   In general, Defendant represented to the SEC and investors that VFCT's revenues and profits were from the sale of various aerospace products and other mechanical devices including momentum wheels, but implied that sales of THOR and ODIN were imminent when they were not. In addition, the Defendant in March 2008, represented VFCT was in the business of buying and selling electronic parts for resale to foreign markets, primarily Japan. In fact, almost all of the revenues and profits of VFCT between 2009 and January, 2013 were from the export of microcircuits to Hong Kong and the PRC without a license or written permission of the Department of State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (Doc. 199-18 at 2541).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Valley Forge Form 10-K dated April 13, 2010 (Doc. 203-1) (touting the THOR and ODIN products).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In 2010, when Valley Forge's revenues jumped from $250,000 to $12 million, the company's auditor told Brothers that Valley Forge would have to disclose on its Form 10-K the source of this revenue. Brothers refused and fired the auditor. (Hawkins Depo. at 19-20, Doc. 199-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Between 2009 and 2012, most of the revenue that Valley Forge earned was from the illegal sale of the microchips overseas. (Brothers Depo. 46) (Doc. 203-3). Brothers testified that the revenue from those sales was around $37-$40 million, and that Valley Forge kept it all. (Brothers Depo. Doc. 199-2 at 81-82). The monies received from the sale of the microchips to Hong Kong were deposited into Valley Forge general accounts and used to pay the company's operating expenses, such as rent, employee compensation, professional services, working capital, and debt repayment.

Neblett was appointed as Trustee on February 18, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   On June 15, 2015, the Trustee in Bankruptcy filed an Adversary Complaint in the Bankruptcy Court, asserting claims against Brothers, Avnet, Aeroflex Inc., Aeroflex CS, Quality Components, Inc., and Xilinx, Inc. (Cov. Civil Case No. 15-168, Doc. 115-2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The claims asserted by the Trustee are:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Count I: Breach of fiduciary duty against Brothers;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Count II: Civil conspiracy/aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty against the other defendants;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Count III: Negligence against the defendants other than Brothers;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Counts IV &amp; V: Objections to Avnet's and Aeroflex's proofs of claim filed in the underlying bankruptcy case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Generally, the Trustee's claims are based on allegations that the supplier defendants were acting in concert with Brothers to circumvent the federal restrictions on the chips' export to China.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   On August 3, 2015, Avnet filed in the Bankruptcy Court a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint against it, arguing that the claims were barred by\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   because they were never asserted as counterclaims in Avnet's 2013 case in this Court. (Doc. 65). Avnet then filed a motion to withdraw the adversary claims against\n   it from reference to the Bankruptcy Court and to transfer venue of those claims to this Court under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (Case 15-168, Doc. 1). The District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania granted that motion on September 21, 2015. However, instead of transferring only the claims against Avnet, the Court withdrew the entire adversary action from the Bankruptcy Court and transferred it to this Court. (Case No. 15-168, Doc. 16).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Thereafter, the Clerk of Court created a new case for the transferred action, Covington Civil Action 15-168.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   After transfer, the Aeroflex defendants and Xilinx also filed a motion to dismiss. (Doc. 79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Following briefing and a hearing, the Court denied the motions to dismiss. (Doc. 126). The Court found that Avnet's\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   argument was without merit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court also held that it would be premature to apply the\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   defense at the pleading stage, but it noted that defendants could renew that defense on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Now, after these complex proceedings, the parties have conducted discovery and filed motions for summary judgment, which are ripe for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Count II: Civil Conspiracy/Aiding and Abetting Fiduciary Breach\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

On those occasions, Brother swore that he never told the supplier defendants that he was exporting the chips; that he instead falsely told them that the chips were being used in ODIN and THOR; that he falsified the end user certificates that he submitted to Avnet/Xilinx to show that Valley Forge was the end user; that he never submitted end user certificates to Aeroflex; that one Aeroflex end user certificate that showed the Hong Kong company as the end user was never returned to Aeroflex; and that he did these things to avoid detection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In opposition to summary judgment, however, the Trustee submitted a declaration in which Brothers declares that \"each of the Supplier Defendants knew and was fully aware, from the beginning of our relationship, that the micro-chip components which they supplied me were destined for overseas.\" (Doc. 226 at \u00b6 19).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Sixth Circuit has \"long held that a party may not create a factual issue by filing an affidavit, after a motion for summary judgment has been made, which contradicts [his] earlier testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Bush v.

The trustee alleged that the third parties-law firms who had represented the debtor and prepared many of the documents for the securities sales-knew or should have known of the illegal activities and failed to apprise the businesses of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The District Court dismissed the claims on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that the trustee's complaint on its face showed that \"the debtor's own actions were instrumental in perpetrating the fraud on the individuals choosing to invest in the Dublin Securities schemes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22481,11888261\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/377/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court stated that \"[s]uch \"purposeful conduct thus establishes conclusively that the debtors were\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   as culpable as the defendants in this matter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22481,11888261\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/377/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Here, it is abundantly clear that Brothers was the moving force in his scheme to acquire rad-chips and illegally export them to China, notwithstanding any alleged involvement by the supplier defendants. Indeed, the very first count in the complaint is against Brothers for breach of his fiduciary duties to Valley Forge due to his \"illegal and criminal activities.\" (Compl. \u00b6 94).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   And the Trustee conceded in interrogatory responses that Brothers \"provided untrue and deceptive information on the End Use Certificates\" provided to Xilinx. (Doc. 203-21 at 3264).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Further, as noted above, Brothers' plea agreement sets out in detail the deliberate actions he took to acquire the microchips and to falsify the end user forms provided to defendants to conceal his plans to export the chips to Hong Kong. Likewise, his deposition testimony confirms that he falsely told defendants that the chips were for use in the ODIN and THOR systems. And when directly asked by Jim Rush of Aeroflex whether Brothers was exporting the chips to China-one month before the government seized Valley Forge's business-Brothers lied and said he was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   As a matter of law, therefore, Brothers was thus \"at least as culpable\" as the defendants in the illegal export scheme, making this doctrine applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   To avoid this result, the Trustee invokes the \"adverse interest\" exception to the\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   doctrine. (Doc. 225 at 26-27). This exception provides that knowledge of the agent (Brothers) is not imputed to the principal (Valley Forge) when it is clear that the agent would not communicate the fact in controversy to the principal, such as where the communication would prevent the consummation of a fraudulent scheme the agent was perpetrating.\n   <em>\n    In re: Merv Properties, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344495\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/539/516/#p529\">\n    539 B.R. 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 529 (6th Cir.

Ky. 2011) (noting that Kentucky courts recognize exception to adverse interest exception where the corporation benefits by the transaction).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Valley Forge's SEC filings and the Trustee's adversary complaint against Valley Forge's attorneys and accountants reveal that Brothers' illegal export of the rad-chips directly benefitted the company. In the second adversary complaint, the Trustee alleges that \"all the revenue generated by Valley Forge during the period 2009 through January 2013 was from the\n   purchase and sale of rad-chips.\" (Doc. 79-2, \u00b6 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The undisputed record in this case also shows that, between 2009 and 2012, virtually all revenue earned by Valley Forge came from the microchip sales. (Brothers Depo. 46). Valley Forge retained approximately $37 to $40 million in those revenues and used them to pay the company's operating expenses and to purchase more microchips.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Brothers himself testified that the sale of the microchips to the Pacific Rim was a means of getting access to those markets in preparation for the sale of other products in the future:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   Q. So as you told Ben, it brought money into Valley Forge?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   A. In the prospects of future-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   Q. Right. And opened up business relationships?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   (Doc. 199-2 at 2377).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Further, in its public filings, Valley Forge disclosed that it was not making any money on the THOR and ODIN products that it claimed to be developing, but nonetheless the company's profits from 2009 to 2010 increased from $259,000 to $2.5 million. (Doc. 79-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Thus, no reasonable person could conclude that Valley Forge did not benefit from Brothers' illegal activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The Trustee attempts to create an issue of fact on the question of benefit through the declaration of Evan Levine, a person who became a board member in February 2013,\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Department of Justice seized Valley Forge's accounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Levine states in his proffered declaration that he performed an investigation that revealed that Brothers had \"diverted\" funds from the sale of the microchips to himself, his son, and another business he owned. (Doc. 224-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   This creates no triable issue. Levine's declaration is inadmissible because the Trustee never identified Levine as a witness during discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1) (\"If a party fails to ... identify a witness as required ..., the party is not allowed to use that ... witness to supply evidence on a motion ...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Second, even if Brothers later diverted some of the revenues to himself, it is undisputed that Valley Forge still benefitted to the tune of millions of dollars in revenues that allowed it to stay afloat for years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The Trustee argues that Brothers' scheme actually harmed Valley Forge because his scheme led to the ultimate downfall of the company. However, that ultimate outcome does not negate the fact that, for approximately four years, Valley Forge received millions of dollars in revenue as a result of the illegal rad-chip sales, absent which the company would likely have failed sooner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Moreover, Brothers' fraud was not directed at Valley Forge but rather at federal authorities whose export restrictions he violated. Rejecting a similar argument, another court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n   [W]hen an officer or director's actions were not undertaken to loot or defraud his corporation and the corporation derived some benefit from them, the actions are imputed to the corporation,\n   <em>\n    even if they ultimately resulted in the failure of the corporation\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   It is uncontested that BLI received the prevailing rate of interest for the triangular transactions and that, in some instances, BLI received an additional fee from BNLV attributable to the triangular\n   transactions.\n   <em>\n    As discussed above, the deception or fraud motivating the triangular transaction scheme was not targeted at BLI but at federal regulators. BLI, as well as its parent companies BLCA and BLNV, temporarily benefitted from the triangular transaction scheme.\n   </em>\n   Thus, Defendants' knowledge of the triangular transactions and their actions in executing the triangular transactions are imputed to BLI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <em>\n    Banco Latino Int'l v.
