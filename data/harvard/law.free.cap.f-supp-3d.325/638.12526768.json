The DOJ has withheld all materials requested by the Project and thus the parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment to resolve the dispute. (Docket Nos. 41 &amp; 47).

The Court will first consider whether the records contained in the Hard Drives are \"agency records\" under the FOIA, because if they are not \"agency records\" the Court does not have jurisdiction to compel the DOJ to produce the records. The Court will then address whether production of the documents on the Hard Drives is unduly burdensome even if the Hard Drive materials are deemed to be agency records. Next, the Court discusses the adequacy of the DOJ's search for records, and whether the DOJ has properly withheld the hard copy and email archive documents uncovered by that search. Finally, the Court addresses whether the EDMC protective orders prohibit the DOJ from disclosing any responsive records, specifically, the AI Dallas CD materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The EDMC Hard Drive Materials\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The DOJ argues that it has several legitimate bases for not turning over the requested EDMC Hard Drive materials to the Project. First, the DOJ argues that EDMC Hard Drive materials are not \"agency records\" subject to the FOIA. Second, if the Hard Drive materials are determined to be agency records the DOJ argues that it has properly withheld them because to comply with the Projects' FOIA request would be unduly burdensome. Finally, the DOJ argues that withholding of the EDMC Hard Drive materials is proper as they are subject to the protective orders, which is addressed separately below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    1. \"Agency Records\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The United States Supreme Court noted that Congress \"did not provide any definition of 'agency records' in [the] Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Forsham v.

The DOJ argues that \"control\" in this case is lacking by reference to three non-precedential tests for determining agency control articulated and employed by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the \"D.C.

Circuit Court in the\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts\n   </em>\n   opinion upheld by the Supreme Court used a four-factor test to determine if an agency had control of the FOIA-requested materials:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [1] the intent of the document's creator to retain or relinquish control over the records; [2] the ability of the agency to use and dispose of the record as it sees fit; [3] the extent to which agency personnel have read or relied upon the document; and [4] the degree to which the document was integrated into the agency's record system or files.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts v.

As a result, there is not a uniform standard for determining agency control of materials applied by the courts.

In all four cases the agency came into possession of the requested materials in the legitimate\n   conduct of its official duties, and each court made its ultimate determination of \"control\" on how the agency used or did not use the requested materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The DOJ acted as a mere conduit between EDMC and Relators' counsel at McKool Smith. EDMC delivered the Hard Drives to the DOJ pursuant to discovery requests. The DOJ states that it did not access the materials from the Hard Drives. As explained by the DOJ, when the DOJ received the Hard Drives it delivered them to McKool Smith, where the materials were uploaded from the Hard Drives onto an electronic information review platform. The DOJ states that at no time did the DOJ have access to EDMC Hard Drive materials on the McKool Smith electronic review platform. Compared to the AI Dallas CD materials, which were uploaded into the DOJ's electronic case file by lead counsel for the DOJ, the EDMC Hard Drive materials were never made accessible electronically or in hard copy form to the DOJ. What the DOJ possessed at the time of the FOIA request was the actual hard drives, less two that had already been destroyed, that McKool Smith had returned to the DOJ after uploading the materials. The DOJ did not maintain the materials for reference purposes or as a research tool, the DOJ's possession was less than that. Once the litigation had settled and McKool Smith had transferred the hard drives to the DOJ, the DOJ maintained the hard drives in storage awaiting return to EDMC. Under this description of the materials, they are akin to the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae documents transferred to the FHFA for storage. Both agencies came into possession of the materials in the legitimate conduct of other official business, but neither had read or relied on the documents in the course of their official duties, they just held the materials. Under these circumstances the Court concludes that at the time of the Project's FOIA request the EDMC Hard Drive materials were not \"agency records\" subject to the FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court's conclusion is supported by comparison to the AI Dallas CD materials. The AI Dallas CD materials share many characteristics and qualities with the EDMC Hard Drive materials. Since the DOJ concedes, however, that the AI Dallas CD materials do qualify as agency records responsive to the Project's FOIA request, there must be a difference between the materials to find one set constitutes agency records while the other does not. That distinguishing characteristic is how the DOJ used, or did not use, each set of materials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The DOJ uploaded the AI Dallas CD materials into the DOJ's electronic case file, and singled out certain documents from the CD to print, retain, comment\n   upon, and circulate by email. The DOJ's use of the AI Dallas CD materials in this manner qualifies as materials that once produced would \"put within public reach the information available to an agency in its decision-making processes.\"\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    492 U.S. at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p142\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, the EDMC Hard Drive materials were not relied upon by the DOJ in its decision making process and therefore the DOJ \"has not exercised the degree of control required to subject the document[s] to disclosure under FOIA.\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3417075,3557037\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/924/\">\n    646 F.3d at 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, the difference between the DOJ's use of the EDMC Hard Drive materials and the use of the AI Dallas CD materials is the primary distinction in the Court's decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The conclusion that the EDMC Hard Drive materials are not agency records is a close call. The DOJ was engaged in prosecuting, along with the Relators, a massive False Claims Act case focusing on unlawful methods EDMC used to recruit students. The reason why the DOJ sought to obtain the records in the first place was presumably to discover the logistics of how EDMC implemented its fraudulent student recruitment program. The DOJ was involved in discovery requests, received the discovery, and delivered the discovery to its litigation partner. The case eventually settled and it is reasonable to assume that EDMC's production of voluminous amounts of documents played a part in the ultimate settlement of the litigation. The Court finds that at no time though did the DOJ read or rely on the discovery materials, and significantly, at the time of the FOIA request the litigation had ceased and the DOJ was acting as a mere warehouse storing the EDMC Hard Drives, never having read or reviewed the materials. The Court finding that the EDMC Hard Drive materials are not agency records subject to FOIA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the DOJ's withholding of the EDMC Hard Drive materials is therefore not \"improper\" and the Court is without \"authority to order the\n   production of such records.\"\n   <em>\n    Kissinger\n   </em>\n   , 445 U.S. at 139,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777447\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/136/#p150\">\n    100 S.Ct. 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The DOJ explains with supporting affidavits that the Project's FOIA request with respect to the EDMC Hard Drive materials is unduly burdensome as the Hard Drives \"contain over nine terabytes of electronically stored information (in compressed form), and [the DOJ] does not have the technological capability to process the data ... to conform it to current specifications for review platforms, or to load, store, host, or review that volume of data on its servers.\" Decl. of Michael Comber, Nov. 17, 2017, at \u00b6 25 (Docket No. 44-1).

The Court finds that the affiants properly relied on information the attorneys learned during the course of their official duties.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   In the FOIA context, a declarant satisfies the personal knowledge requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e) if, \"in his declaration, [he] attest[s] to his personal knowledge of the procedures used in handling [a FOIA] request and his familiarity with the documents in question.\"\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

Counsel for EDMC is in the best position to provide estimates of the amount of data contained on EDMC-produced hard drives and provided the estimates in a court affidavit. The declarations by attorneys Comber and Kornmeier are properly \"based on information they have obtained in the course of their official duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnard,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3344778\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/598/1/#p19\">\n    598 F.Supp.2d at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Project's objection to the declarants' reliance on counsel for EDMC's approximate estimates of the amount of data involved is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Turning to the accuracy of the amount of data, the Project argues that the estimate cannot be accurate because it includes the amount of data on two hard drives that were destroyed by the McKool Smith law firm, but would not be a part of any DOJ search of the materials the DOJ presently possesses. This may be true but it does not undermine the DOJ's affiants' testimony as to what EDMC's counsel stated was the approximate amount of data that was electronically provided on hard drives. In any event, the amount of data included is so vast that even a 99% reduction in the quantity of data to be searched, as suggested by the DOJ, would still lead to the conclusion that it would be an unduly burdensome search as there would still be approximately 1.45 million pages of documents for the DOJ staff to review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Project also challenges the DOJ's factual basis for its claim that a search would be an undue burden. The Project argues that the DOJ's statement that it must search each document on the Hard Drives is not factually supported because there are other methods the DOJ could use to narrow the scope of documents to be reviewed. Specifically, the Project suggests that the DOJ could use the production cover letters EDMC provided to the DOJ during discovery, employ search terms and predictive coding, and make use of the documents' metadata to eliminate duplicates. These suggestions, while reasonable, are unavailing to undermine the DOJ's claims of undue burden. Yet, implementation of these suggestions presupposes that the DOJ has an appropriate and affordable electronic information review platform. Here, the DOJ has stated that it does not currently have such a platform, and that the cost of such a platform is prohibitive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Project's suggestions are predicated on employing methods designed to reduce the time it takes to search, the amount of data to be reviewed, and the time it takes to review the targeted documents. Again, the quantity of material at issue here is so vast that even if the DOJ could successfully employ the methods suggested by the Project and reduce the amount of material, as indicated above, by 99%, the task would still be unduly burdensome. Accordingly, assuming the materials are agency records, the Court finds that the DOJ has demonstrated that responding to the Project's FOIA request as it relates to the EDMC Hard Drive materials would be unduly burdensome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Comber Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-14. The DOJ searched the Civil Division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania as that office was where the EDMC litigation arose and was handled, and that office and division did not share or transmit documents or information received from EDMC during discovery with any other United States Attorney's Office or within the Western District office. Comber Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-13. Within the Civil Division the DOJ determined that only lead trial counsel Deputy Chief Christy C. Weigand, co-counsel Assistant United States Attorney Colin J. Callahan, and Civil Chief and settlement counsel Michael A. Comber, \"and no support staff, paralegals, or other attorneys,\" could reasonably be expected to possess records potentially responsive to the Project's FOIA request.

The email search was also limited to emails to or from the three attorneys working on the litigation and between EDMC's outside counsel at Jones Day, Relator's counsel at McKool Smith, and the Special Master and his law clerk.

The DOJ explained that from a review of the case file it determined that potentially responsive materials would not have been transmitted by email either before May 2, 2014, even though EDMC produced external media by hand delivery on October 15, 2013, or after November 16, 2015, the date of execution of the settlement agreement.

The DOJ's stated limitations as set forth above are a description of how the search was conducted. The DOJ reasonably explained that it limited its search to email attachments and that it limited its search to certain domains and a date range. The DOJ searched the limited domains within the stated time frame for emails containing attachments, and then once it found the emails with attachments it viewed those attachments to see if it was responsive to the Project's FOIA request. The DOJ's search of the email archives resulted in finding five documents produced by EDMC during discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Project's complaint that the DOJ inadequately explained the May 2, 2014 date limitation rests on speculation. The Project points to letters from counsel for the DOJ dated April 10, 2014, and January 22, 2014, that reference or describe discovery documents, to assert that maybe the referenced discovery documents \"might be contained\" in the email archives prior to May 2, 2014. Docket No. 48, at 30. As noted, the DOJ acknowledged that it did receive EDMC discovery as early as October 13, 2013, but that it had reviewed the case file and concluded that no discovery document would have been transmitted by email prior to May 2, 2014. The Project's pointing to letters that acknowledge the same fact-that discovery had occurred prior to May 2, 2014-does not counter the DOJ's assertion that no email transmission of discovery documents would have occurred prior to May 2, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, the Court concludes that the DOJ's email archive search was reasonably limited to the three attorneys involved in\n   the EDMC litigation in the Civil Division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, and the scope of the search included domains reasonably calculated to uncover documents responsive to the FOIA request. Despite the massive amounts of discovery material produced by EDMC, it is reasonable that the DOJ itself, having transferred the Hard Drive materials to McKool Smith, would only have limited discovery documents available in its hard case file, email archives, and electronic case file. The Court concludes that the Project's challenges to the search rest largely on \"speculation that as yet uncovered documents may exist.\"\n   <em>\n    SafeCard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546712,3488360\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1197/\">\n    926 F.2d at 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Documents Found in Hard Copy Case File and Email Archives\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As noted, the DOJ uncovered eleven potentially responsive documents through its search of email archives and the hard case file. The six documents found in the hard case file are copies of EDMC discovery documents produced on the AI Dallas CD. Def. Br. Supp. at 20 (Docket No. 42); Comber Decl. \u00b6 15. These copies contain handwritten notes of counsel, and are being withheld, in part, based on the work product doctrine. Def. Br. Supp. at 20-21; Def. Br. Opp. at 8 (Docket No. 65); Def. Surreply Br. at 11 (Docket No. 76); Comber Decl. \u00b6 15. The five documents found in the email archives are also copies of EDMC discovery documents. Def. Br. Supp. at 22. The DOJ is withholding four of the five documents based on the work product doctrine asserting that the documents were emailed among counsel. Comber Decl. \u00b6 17; Def. Br. Opp. at 8-9; Def. Surreply Br. at 11. The DOJ provides no further explanation as to how emailing a discovery document produced by an opposing party, without more, demonstrates litigation work product. The fifth document is a copy of an EDMC produced discovery document that is listed on the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index at entry 90, and apparently is being withheld solely on the basis of the Confidentiality Protective Order and under seal designation. Def. Br. Opp. at 9; Def. Surreply Br. at 11; Vaughn Index, at 14, Entry 90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The DOJ does not concede that any of the documents are agency records responsive to the Project's FOIA request because they were not directly produced from EDMC to the DOJ in response to specific discovery responses. The DOJ argues that these documents are derivative, that is, they are copies of documents produced by EDMC during discovery. The Project properly argues that there is no basis for the DOJ to withhold the documents simply because they are copies of documents. Although the DOJ may have other reasons for withholding the documents, the DOJ has not cited to any authority that would allow the DOJ to withhold copies of documents responsive to the FOIA request\n   <em>\n    merely\n   </em>\n   because they are copies. The DOJ is not being asked, much less compelled, to uncover\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   copy of a responsive document even once it has produced (or withheld) the original. Here the DOJ has not turned over any documents at all. The Court rejects the DOJ's argument that withholding of copies of responsive documents by itself is a proper justification for withholding a document under the FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   With regard to the six documents that contain handwritten attorney notes reflecting the mental impressions of counsel, the Project argues that the DOJ is required to provide a more detailed basis for the privilege. The Court disagrees. A discovery document with counsel's handwritten notes on it is\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence\n   that the document is work product. It is unclear what further description the Project would have the DOJ provide that would not be stating the same privilege in different words, or else compelling the DOJ to reveal the mental impressions of its attorneys. The DOJ has sufficiently identified that the documents contain handwritten notes of counsel, nothing would be added by compelling the DOJ to also state that such notes reflect professional opinions regarding the document or its impact on the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The DOJ could possibly provide a detailed description of the document itself;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , describe the EDMC document that an attorney wrote on, but that would not help the Project determine whether the claim of privilege is legitimate. The DOJ has identified the document as an EDMC document produced during discovery. The DOJ concedes that the original document without handwritten notes is responsive to the FOIA request, and the original is not protected by the privilege. Accordingly, the DOJ's claim of work product privilege for these six documents is upheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The same cannot be said about the four documents emailed among counsel. The Court is aware of no work product protection, without further explanation, that protects from disclosure an opposing party's discovery document solely because counsel passed it along to co-counsel. The DOJ is not being asked to produce the content of any email, just the EDMC produced discovery document. The DOJ's claim of work product privilege for the four emailed documents is denied. The DOJ has invoked no claim of privilege for withholding the fifth document found in the email archives, and that document is responsive to the FOIA request and must be turned over unless it cannot be due to the protective orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Protective Orders\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The DOJ identifies the AI Dallas CD materials as agency records responsive to the Project's FOIA request, but argues that the materials are properly withheld due to the protective orders. A subset of the AI Dallas CD documents has been designated as being withheld pursuant to FOIA exemption 6 to protect the personally identifiable information of students. Exemption 6 protects \"personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6). The DOJ acknowledges that although it would be possible to produce the non-exempt portions of such documents with the personal information redacted, the DOJ must withhold even the non-exempt portions because of the protective orders. The DOJ's argument relying on the protective orders as a basis for withholding documents encompasses all FOIA-requested documents, no matter whether the FOIA-requested documents are subject to withholding for any other reason. Thus, the DOJ argues that all documents at issue in this case are properly withheld because they are subject to the protective orders entered in the EDMC litigation. The DOJ argues that applicable case law demonstrates that where a court limits an agency's discretion such that the agency is prohibited from disclosing responsive records, the agency does not improperly withhold the requested materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The United States Supreme Court has held that it was error to permit a FOIA-requester to obtain requested materials \"when the agency with possession of the documents has been enjoined from disclosing them by a Federal District Court.\"\n   <em>\n    GTE Sylvania, Inc. v.

Confidentiality Protective Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The DOJ argues that it is prohibited from disclosing potentially responsive documents because of the Confidentiality Protective Order's requirement that \"Confidential Material may be disclosed only to ... Qualified Persons.\" Confidentiality Protective Order \u00b6 4. Applying the above principles to this case, the Court concludes\n   that the Confidentiality Protective Order does not operate as a prohibition on the DOJ's ability to disclose the records in the same way as the injunction in\n   <em>\n    GTE Sullivan\n   </em>\n   . The Confidentiality Protective Order explicitly anticipates requests for disclosure of material designated as Confidential by a third party, such as the Project, and provides a procedure for disclosure of the documents. Confidentiality Protective Order \u00b6 7. The Confidentiality Protective Order provides that \"[i]n the event of a request by a third party for disclosure of Confidential Material,\" the receiving party (in this case the DOJ) shall provide the third party with a copy of the Confidentiality Protective Order, and then proceed to contact the designating party (in this case EDMC) who is given ten days to seek a protective order to contest the production of the Confidential Materials.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542378,3487542\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/923/195/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In this case the content of the Confidentiality Protective Order itself demonstrates that the EDMC Court did not issue the orders with the intent to\n   <em>\n    prohibit\n   </em>\n   the DOJ from ever disclosing the records. The EDMC Court anticipated that a third party may request material designated as confidential and therefore provided a mechanism that would permit the agency to disclose the records. In fact, the Confidentiality Protective Order\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   that upon a third party's request, the DOJ must initiate certain actions. The DOJ must notify EDMC that a third party has requested the materials so that EDMC may, if it chooses, seek a further protective order. Significantly, if the DOJ complies with its duties under the Confidentiality Protective Order, and EDMC does not file a motion seeking a further protective order, the DOJ \"may produce the requested Confidential Material.\" Confidentiality Protective Order \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In addition, the Confidentiality Protective Order focuses on protection of properly designated \"Confidential Material,\" which the Order specifically defines as \"information protected by federal or state statute or regulation, personal identification information (e.g., social security number, date of birth), personnel information (e.g., employee employment records and compensation), financial, proprietary, and trade secret information that is produced by any party or third party and denominated by the producing party, in good faith, as 'Confidential.' \" Confidentiality Protective Order \u00b6 1. Thus, unlike an injunction that enjoins a party from releasing a document, the Confidentiality Protective Order only purports to protect \"Confidential Material\" contained within documents. Under these facts, the Court cannot conclude that the Confidentiality Protective Order \"prohibits\" the DOJ from disclosing the records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542378,3487542\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/923/195/\">\n    923 F.2d at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting mere existence of seal without inquiring into its intended effect is not sufficient);\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087657,12310133\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/380/\">\n    813 F.3d at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (test for determining whether an agency has improperly withheld records placed under seal requires court to examine factors including, but not limited to, the explicit order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    2. FERPA Protective Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The DOJ similarly argues that it is prohibited from disclosing documents under the FERPA Protective Order based on that Order's provision that \"[n]o disclosure of FERPA Confidential Material shall be made to any person unless that individual is authorized to receive such FERPA Confidential Material pursuant to the terms of this Order.\" EDMC Litigation, Docket No. 255, \u00b6 5. The DOJ argues that this language prohibits the DOJ from disclosing the documents designated as FERPA Confidential. The FERPA Protective Order, however, only prohibits the DOJ from disclosing the personally identifiable information (or FERPA Confidential Material)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    contained in\n   </em>\n   documents designated as FERPA Confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Examination of the FERPA Protective Order demonstrates that the intent of the court in issuing the order was to \"protect personally identifiable information from education records subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g, and ensure that protection is afforded to material so entitled.\" EDMC Litigation, Docket No. 255, at 1 (preamble). Throughout the FERPA Protective Order it is evident that the Court's concern is with protecting personally identifiable information about students and their families from education records subject to FERPA, referred to as \"FERPA Confidential Material.\" It is only FERPA Confidential Material that the Order seeks to protect from disclosure, and therefore the Court explicitly prohibits \"disclosure of FERPA Confidential Material ... to any person unless that individual is authorized to receive such FERPA Confidential Material pursuant to the terms of this Order.\" EDMC Litigation, Docket No. 255, \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The FERPA Protective Order also allows the DOJ discretion to disclose the documents with appropriate redactions. Demonstrating that the EDMC Court was concerned only with protection of personally identifiable student information, the FERPA Protective Order's express terms provide for the redaction of the \"FERPA Confidential Material contained in documents\" when documents containing such material were to be used during a deposition. EDMC Litigation, Docket No. 255, \u00b6 7. Thus, the Court contemplated that a document containing FERPA Confidential Material may be used during a deposition, but only provided for protection of the actual FERPA Confidential Material, not the entire document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The FERPA Protective Order also contemplates that if a document containing FERPA Confidential Material is submitted to the Court, or reproduced in court filings, that the document or filing \"or portions thereof containing FERPA Confidential Material\" must be placed under seal. EDMC Litigation, Docket No. 255, \u00b6 9. Finally, the FERPA Protective Order protects FERPA Confidential Material from disclosure by providing that before such information is presented in court filings or proceedings the parties \"shall consider (i) redacting confidential documents to remove personally identifiable information about students and their families, (ii) coding the documents to substitute a numerical or other designation for the student's name or other identifiable information about the student or his/her family, or (iii) introducing summary evidence where practicable which may be more easily redacted.\" EDMC Litigation, Docket No. 255, \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   By explicitly and narrowly focusing on protection of only FERPA Confidential Material contained within a document, the EDMC Court has demonstrated its intent was solely with protecting the student private information, not the portions of the document that do not contain FERPA Confidential Material. The Court cannot conclude that the FERPA Protective Order \"circumscribes [the] agency's ability to produce documents such that the agency has 'no discretion' to release the documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Agility Publishing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363453\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/313/#p335\">\n    113 F.Supp.3d at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As detailed above, the FERPA Protective Order only prohibits disclosure of personally identifiable information, not the documents themselves. The FERPA Protective Order was concerned with the production of FERPA Confidential Material during discovery in the EDMC litigation. Given the FERPA Protective Order's explicit focus only on a discrete type of information contained within documents, it\n   would be a narrow reading of the Order to interpret the EDMC Court's intent as seeking to prohibit disclosure of Non-FERPA Confidential Material. Therefore, the DOJ may produce the documents containing the FERPA Confidential Material so long as the FERPA Confidential Material is redacted and otherwise complies with the FERPA Protective Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Production of documents containing FERPA Confidential Material or Confidential Material under the Confidentiality Protective Order is dependent on the same limits as production of documents under Exemption 6 of the FOIA to the extent the document contains personally identifiable information. \"Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided [to a FOIA-requester] after deletion of the portions which are exempt.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). In all cases, personal and confidential information need not be released and must be appropriately redacted before the document is disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   It is unclear whether any of the documents the DOJ designates as being \"under seal\" in the EDMC Litigation were placed under seal for reasons separate and apart from a designation under either the Confidentiality Protective Order or the FERPA Protective Order. To the extent that the only reason such documents were placed under seal was pursuant to the protective orders then the analysis above applies with the addition that the DOJ must seek permission to unseal the documents, except for information contained within the document that would be subject to redaction under the analysis above. To the extent that documents were placed under seal for some other reason, the Court is without sufficient information at this time to determine whether such a document should be disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Project will be permitted to pursue its FOIA request as to the AI Dallas CD materials, the five documents found in the email archives, and the documents listed on the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index in accordance with the protective orders filed in the EDMC litigation, and if necessary, the filing of an appropriate motion (or renewal of an existing motion) in\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Washington v. Education Management LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:07-cv-461.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Project's Motion to Strike and for Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In the Project's Motion in the Alternative for Discovery Pursuant to Rule 56(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Docket No. 52), the Project sought limited discovery to challenge the DOJ's search and the DOJ's assertions as to why it would be unduly burdensome to search and review the EDMC Hard Drive materials. This motion is denied, as moot, in light of the Court's resolution of the cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Project's Motion to Strike Statements from the Declarations of John Kornmeier and Michael A. Comber (Docket No. 54), will be granted to the extent that the Court did not consider legal conclusions contained within said affidavits, and is denied in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   For the foregoing reasons the Court finds the EDMC Hard Drive materials are not \"agency records\" under the FOIA, and therefore the DOJ did not improperly withhold such records. Even if the materials were deemed to be \"agency records\" it would be unduly burdensome for the DOJ to search and produce such materials. The Court further finds that the DOJ's search for responsive records was sufficient, that the DOJ properly invoked the work product doctrine as to six documents found in the hard case file, and the DOJ improperly invoked the privilege with respect to four\n   documents that were emailed among counsel. The Court also concludes that the protective orders entered in the EDMC litigation do not prohibit the DOJ's ability to disclose responsive documents in accord with the procedures and requirements of the protective orders. Accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket No. 41) will be granted in part and denied in part, and Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket No. 47) will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Based on the DOJ's arguments regarding the issue of \"agency records\" it is equally true of both the EDMC Hard Drive materials and the AI Dallas CD materials that (i) they were created by EDMC; (ii) they were produced by EDMC during discovery; (iii) EDMC allegedly retained a possessory interest in them; (iv) EDMC allegedly intended to retain control of them; (v) the protective orders allegedly limit the DOJ's ability to use and dispose of the materials; (vi) that the content of the documents would allegedly reveal nothing about the operation of the DOJ under the purposes of the FOIA; (vii) that the DOJ was not reading or reviewing the materials\n    <em>\n     at the time of the FOIA request\n    </em>\n    (although the timing of the FOIA request in this case is important); and (viii) they are EDMC produced business documents and related documents. If any of these characteristics or combination of characteristics were determinative of the control issue the conclusion would necessarily apply to both the EDMC Hard Drive materials and the AI Dallas CD materials, but the DOJ does not make the same argument with respect to the AI Dallas CD materials. That is why the Court focuses on the use of the materials as the distinguishing characteristic.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The Court notes that the fact that the hard drives contain electronically stored information is irrelevant to the analysis. The same analysis would apply if the EDMC discovery materials were produced to the DOJ as hard copies in sealed boxes, the boxes were transferred to McKool Smith without the DOJ reading or reviewing the contents, and the DOJ took possession of the boxes (re-sealed), again without reading or reviewing the contents.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The DOJ also argues that the EDMC Hard Drive materials cannot be agency records in part because of EDMC's continuing possessory interest in the materials and the limitations on the DOJ's use of the materials. The DOJ's argument primarily relies on the fact that the materials were subject to protective orders that contemplated the return of the materials to EDMC. The DOJ's argument relies on a case distinguishable from the present case. In\n    <em>\n     Washington Post v. U.S. Dep't of Def.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3733945\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/766/1/#p17\">\n     766 F.Supp. 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 17 (D.D.C. 1991), the Court held that a congressional hearing transcript was not an agency record because Congress had not \"abandoned control\" over the transcript but only provided it temporarily for the limited purpose of having a witness review, supplement, and identify classified material.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3733945\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/766/1/#p17\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Here, EDMC did not transfer non-final documents to the DOJ for limited review with instructions to return the documents to EDMC. EDMC transferred records responsive to discovery requests subject only to the protection of confidential information as described in the two protective orders. The DOJ's argument is intertwined with the DOJ's separate argument that the protective orders by themselves render the DOJ's withholding of materials proper. The Court considers the effect of the protective orders later in this Opinion but notes that the Confidentiality Protective Order allows the DOJ, at its discretion, to return or destroy the EDMC materials at the close of litigation. Confidentiality Protective Order, \u00b6 13. Finally, if the DOJ's argument on this point was determinative of control, it would necessarily also apply to the AI Dallas CD materials, but the DOJ fails to argue that the AI Dallas CD materials are not agency records.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
