(\"Springboards\") against it under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (docket entry 61), and (2) the motion of the defendants KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools to dismiss Springboards's claims with prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b), or alternatively to dismiss the claims under Rule 12(b)(6) (docket entry 63). For the reasons stated below, KIPP Foundation's motion and KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools' motion are both granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A full recitation of the factual background of this case is provided in the court's memorandum opinion and order issued on September 7, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Opinion and Order (docket entry 55). In that order, the court dismissed with prejudice the plaintiff's state law claims against KIPP, Inc. because the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the court had subject matter jurisdiction over those claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The court then dismissed the remainder of the plaintiff's claims without prejudice, affording the plaintiff an opportunity to amend its complaint to cure the deficiencies contained therein.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. The court specified that the issue with Springboards's previous complaint was that while Springboards referred to the individual defendants collectively and indiscriminately, compliance with Rule 8(a) requires plaintiffs to \"attribute specific acts of infringement to each defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On September 22, 2017, in conformity with this court's order, Springboards filed a new amended complaint. Second Amended Complaint (docket entry 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 20, 2017, one defendant, the KIPP Foundation, filed a renewed motion\n   to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), contending that \"[a]gain, [Springboards] fails to distinguish the alleged acts of infringement that it seeks to attribute to each defendant.\" Defendant KIPP Foundation's Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint; Defendant KIPP Foundation's Brief in Support of Its Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6) (\"KIPP Foundation's Brief\") at 2 (docket entry 62). On the same day, the remaining two defendants, KIPP Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools, filed a similar motion to dismiss, maintaining that the amended complaint is \"premised entirely on conclusory allegations and implausible speculation.\" KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 41(b) ; KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools' Brief in Support of their Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 41(b) (\"KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools' Brief\") at 2 (docket entry 64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 10, 2017, Springboards filed two separate responses to address each of the pending motions to dismiss. Plaintiff's Response to Defendant KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 41(b) and Brief in Support (\"Springboards's Response to KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools' Motion\") (docket entry 65); Plaintiff's Response to Defendant KIPP Foundation's Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6) and Brief in Support (\"Springboards's Response to KIPP Foundation's Motion\") (docket entry 66). Thereafter, on December 4, 2017, KIPP Foundation filed its reply, and KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools filed their reply. KIPP Foundation's Reply Brief in Support of its Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) (docket entry 71); KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools' Reply Brief (docket entry 72).

As to confusion, KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools argue that because Springboards is a corporation as opposed to an educational institution, the goods are \"unrelated as a matter of law.\" KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools' Brief at 12 (quoting\n   <em>\n    MCW, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%20833595\">\n    2004 WL 833595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   To prevail on a Lanham Act claim for trademark counterfeiting, trademark infringement, or false designations of origin, a plaintiff must show the defendants' use of the mark is \"likely to cause confusion.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a), 1125(a)(1). The Fifth Circuit has provided a nonexhaustive list of factors to consider as indications of confusion: (1) the type of mark allegedly infringed, (2) the similarity between the two marks, (3) the similarity of products or services, (4) the identity of the retail outlets and purchasers, (5) the identity of the advertising media used, (6) the defendant's intent, and (7) any evidence of actual confusion.\n   <em>\n    Westchester Media v.

This court can find a likelihood of confusion even without a positive finding on a majority of these factors.\n   <em>\n    ADT, LLC v.

Tex. 2015) (Fish, Senior J.). The court concludes that Springboards has alleged several instances of sources of confusion between Springboards's goods and those of the KIPP defendants. Springboards has pleaded that both Springboards and the KIPP defendants use marks identical or similar to \"Millionaire Reader,\" \"Million Dollar Reader,\" and \"Millionaire's Reading Club.\" Second Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 22, 42, 43. In addition, Springboards has asserted that the parties provide similar educational services while employing a similar mark to \"Read a Million Words.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. The court concludes that Springboards has plausibly pleaded a likelihood of confusion between the KIPP defendants' goods and its own. For these reasons the court denies the motions to dismiss the plaintiff's trademark infringement claim and false designations of origin and false description claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   d. Famous or Distinctive Mark\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools assert that the court should dismiss Springboards's trademark dilution claim because the Second Amended Complaint fails to demonstrate how Springboards's marks are either \"famous\" or \"distinctive.\" KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools' Brief at 12. The defendants posit that Springboards's trademarks consist of generic phrases related to reading a millions words.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   But the Fifth Circuit has previously concluded that \"registration is\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   proof that [a] registered mark is distinctive.\"\n   <em>\n    Test Masters Educational Services, Inc. v.

This presumption can be overcome by showing that the mark is merely descriptive; if the presumption is rebutted, Springboards must then prove that its mark also possesses secondary meaning.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=164%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20397\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A secondary meaning occurs when \"in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a [mark] is to identify the source of the product rather than the product\n   itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 566 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

Springboards asserts that its marks, published on advertisements and promotional goods, have acquired notable recognition for the Springboards brand and the successful educational programs it offers. Second Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 26-29. Because Springboards has alleged that its marks are registered, and asserted that its marks possess a secondary meaning, the court denies the motions to dismiss the plaintiff's trademark dilution claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   e. Same Goods or Services\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools urge the court to dismiss Springboards's trademark counterfeiting claim because Springboards has failed to allege that the parties use the counterfeit marks for the same goods or services. KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools' Brief at 14. KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools have asked the court to interpret the Lanham Act's definition of \"counterfeit\" pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201116\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(B) to encompass only marks on the \"same goods or services\" as those covered by the plaintiff's registration.\n   <em>\n    Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v, Universal Tel-A-Talk, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No CIV. A. 96-CV-6961,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20288423\">\n    1998 WL 288423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (E.D. Pa. June 3, 1998) (dismissing trademark counterfeit claim because mark was not used for the same goods). This court, however, has not previously adopted the stringent interpretation that KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools advocate. The Lanham Act defines \"counterfeit\" as \"a spurious mark which is identical with, or substantially indistinguishable from, a registered mark.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court has interpreted a trademark counterfeit claim to operate as a trademark infringement with the addition of a defendant's intention to use the plaintiff's trademark, knowing it was a counterfeit. See\n   <em>\n    Haggar Clothing Company\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202868443\">\n    2009 WL 2868443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Regardless, even if the court were to adopt the definition urged by KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools, the court would nonetheless conclude that Springboards had satisfied the definition. Springboards asserts that because it provides educational services and \"programs for educators to use in schools,\" the parties' services are equivalent. Second Amended Complaint \u00b6 14; Springboards's Response to KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools' Motion at 20. Springboards has shown that its trademarks apply to not only to the goods but also to the services it provides. Second Amended Complaint \u00b6 22. Because both Springboards and the KIPP defendants provide educational services that promote strengthening students' reading abilities in connection with the registered marks, at this stage, Springboards has satisfied the criteria of demonstrating the \"same goods or services\" using the marks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Although not addressed by the KIPP defendants, Springboards has also properly asserted that the defendants \"acted intentionally, knowing the mark ... used was counterfeit.\" See\n   <em>\n    Grand Time Corporation v. Watch Factory Corporation\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:08-CV-1770-K,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202412960\">\n    2011 WL 2412960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (N.D. Tex. June 10, 2011) (Kinkeade, J.) (dismissing plaintiff's summary judgment for trademark counterfeiting because the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the defendant acted intentionally). Springboards asserts that the KIPP defendants were aware of Springboards's services and programs before using similar marks. Second Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 59, 63, 75. Accordingly, the court denies the motions to dismiss Springboards's trademark counterfeit claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The Motion to Dismiss Springboards's State Claims (Counts 5-8)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Springboards asserts four state law claims against the defendants: (1) Texas\n   Anti-Dilution Statute-Texas Business &amp; Commercial Code \u00a7 16.103, (2) common law trademark infringement, (3) common law unfair competition, and (4) conspiracy. Second Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 112-148. For the reasons stated below, the motions to dismiss the trademark claims (counts 5-7) are denied, and the motions to dismiss the conspiracy claim (count 8) are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   a. State Law Trademark Claims (Counts 5-7)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Asserting a claim under the Texas Anti-Dilution Statute implicates the same standards as the Lanham Act under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1125.

Further, the Fifth Circuit has previously held that \"[an] unfair competition action under Texas common law presents essentially 'no difference in issues than those under federal trademark infringement actions.' \"\n   <em>\n    Amazing Spaces, Inc. v.

For the reasons stated above, Springboards has sufficiently pleaded its Texas Anti-Dilution Statute claim, common law trademark infringement claim, and unfair competition claim. Hence, the court denies the motions to dismiss these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   b. Conspiracy Claim (Count 8)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The KIPP defendants assert that Springboards's conspiracy claim should be dismissed on four grounds: (1) Springboards has failed to demonstrate an underlying tort, (2) Springboards has failed to allege an underlying harm, (3) Springboards has failed to plead sufficient grounds to prove a \"meeting of the minds,\" and (4) Springboards has failed to provide any factual allegations supporting an overt act. KIPP Foundation's Brief at 2-8; KIPP, Inc. and KIPP Texas Schools' Brief at 16. Because the court concluded above that Springboards has pleaded facts sufficient to prove unfair competition, a common law tort, the KIPP defendants' first argument is rejected. Further, because the court concluded above that sufficient factual allegations support the presence of an injury, the second ground is rejected as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To sufficiently plead the existence of a \"meeting of the minds,\" the plaintiff must allege \"a preconceived plan or a time and place at which [the defendants] had a meeting of the minds regarding the object of the conspiracy.\"\n   <em>\n    I Love Omni, LLC v.

And, further, merely referencing the existence of a pre-existing personal relationship does not suffice to plead conspiracy.
