Crum &amp; Forster is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New Jersey. ECF No. 2 at 1; 19-4 at 1. DVO is a Wisconsin corporation with its principal place of business in Chilton, Wisconsin. ECF No. 1 \u00b6 3. The amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. Presently before the court is Crum &amp; Forster's motion for summary judgment. For the reasons set forth below, the motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Underlying Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   DVO is engaged in the business of designing and building anaerobic digesters, which use microorganisms to break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen to create biogas. ECF No. 19-1 \u00b6 2, Ex. A. In August 2013, WTE-S &amp; S AG Enterprises, LLC filed a complaint against DVO in the Circuit Court for Door County, Wisconsin.\n   <em>\n    WTE-S &amp; S AG Enters., LLC v. GHD, Inc. n/k/a DVO, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13CV166. In this underlying action, WTE alleged that it entered into a Standard Form of Agreement created by the Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee for the construction of an anaerobic digester in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, which was to generate electricity from cow manure. The electricity generated by the converter would then be sold to the electric power utility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pl.'s Proposed Findings of Fact (PPFOF), ECF No. 18 at \u00b6 2. WTE asserted a single cause of action in its lawsuit against DVO: breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. It claimed DVO failed to fulfill its design duties, responsibilities and obligations under the contract because it did not properly design substantial portions of the structural, mechanical and operational systems of the anaerobic digester, which caused substantial damages to WTE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 2, 2013, Crum &amp; Forster provided a defense to DVO under a reservation of rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. On December 21, 2015, Crum &amp; Forster advised DVO that it would no longer provide a defense to DVO, effective December 31, 2015. Def.'s Proposed Finding of Fact (DPFOF), ECF No. 22, at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. WTE later filed for bankruptcy and the case was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois. ECF No. 18 \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. On August 18, 2017, following an eight-day trial, the Bankruptcy Court found in favor of WTE and ordered DVO to pay over $65,000 in damages. The Court later added attorneys fees and costs in the amount of $198,000. ECF No. 22, \u00b6\u00b6 5-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Insurance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Crum &amp; Forster issued primary and excess insurance policies to DVO for the following policy periods: June 1, 2011 to April 1, 2012; April 1, 2012 to April 1, 2013; and April 1, 2013 to April 1, 2014. PPFOF, ECF No. 18, at \u00b6 13. The primary policies contained various coverages, including commercial general liability (CGL) coverage, contractors pollution liability coverage, E &amp; O coverage, third party pollution coverage, and onsite cleanup pollution liability coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Policy Exh. C., D. and E, ECF Nos. 19-3, 19-4, 19-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the E &amp; O liability coverage part of the Policy, Crum &amp; Forster agreed to pay, in excess of the deductible amount, \"those sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as 'damages' or 'cleanup costs' because of a 'wrongful act' to which this insurance applies.\" ECF No. 19-3 at 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The term \"wrongful act\" was defined as: \"an act, error or omission in the rendering or failure to render 'professional services' by any insured.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. \"Professional services\" were defined as \"those functions performed for others by you or by others on your behalf that are related to your practice as a consultant, engineer, architect, surveyor, laboratory or construction manager.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. The Policy also provided that Crum &amp; Forster had the \"right and duty to defend the insured against any 'suit' seeking 'damages' to which this insurance applies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Policy also contained numerous exclusions of coverage. The exclusion at issue in this case is the breach of contract exclusion that was added by an endorsement. As amended by the endorsement, the contractual liability exclusion reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   This Policy does not apply to 'damages', 'defense expenses', 'cleanup costs', or any loss, cost or expense, or any 'claim' or 'suit':\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Based upon or arising out of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   a. breach of contract, whether express or oral, nor any \"claim\" for breach of an implied in law or an implied in fact contracts, regardless of whether \"bodily injury\", \"property damage\", \"personal and advertising injury\" or a \"wrongful act\" is alleged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Crum &amp; Forster filed this complaint on December 7, 2016, seeking a declaration that it did not have a duty to defend DVO in WTE's lawsuit against it or indemnify DVO for any damages awarded therein. In its motion for summary judgment, Crum &amp; Forster argues that any coverage provided under the Policy is eliminated by the breach of contract exclusion. DVO argues that the breach of contract provision effectively eliminates all possible coverage under the E &amp; O policy and thereby renders the E &amp; O coverage illusory. Because illusory coverage is contrary to Wisconsin public policy, DVO argues the court should reform the contract and remove the breach of contract exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Designing and constructing the anaerobic digester are functions that fall within the definition of \"professional services\" because DVO is an environmental engineering firm.

Every failure to perform a professional contract with care, skill, reasonable expedience and faithfulness is a professional error or omission. It thus follows, DVO argues, that there are no acts, errors or omissions that could occur while rendering professional services designing and building an anaerobic digester that would not \"arise out of\" a breach of DVO's contract with WTE. For this reason, DVO concludes that it could never be covered for its errors and omissions and the E &amp; O coverage it purchased is therefore illusory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Crum &amp; Forster argues that DVO reads the policy agreement too narrowly and the exclusion too broadly. It notes that the E &amp; O policy also includes coverage for \"clean up\" costs that may arise out of DVO's professional services and would not be excluded under the breach of contract exclusion. Additionally, Crum &amp; Forster argues that the policy must be read as a whole, including the other coverages, such as CGL, third party pollution liability and contractors pollution liability.

DVO's argument is predicated upon the Wisconsin Supreme Court's explanation that \"[a]ccompanying every contract is a common-law duty to perform with care, skill, reasonable expedience, and faithfulness the thing agreed to be done, and a negligent failure to observe any of these condition is a tort, as well as a breach of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Colton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8678320\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis/259/142/\">\n    259 Wis. at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20N.W.2d%20901\">\n    47 N.W.2d 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Third parties who sustained personal injuries or property damage as a result of DVO's errors or omissions in its design and construction of an anaerobic digester for WTE would therefore have claims against DVO that would not be based upon or arise out of DVO's contract with WTE. Such claims would be based upon and arise out DVO's negligent errors or omissions. The manifest intent of the breach of contract exclusion is to avoid making Crum &amp; Forster a guarantor of DVO's contractual obligations.

At issue in that case was coverage under a contractor's E &amp; O policy for a claim arising out of the insured's failure to perform a contract. The insured contractor was hired to install metal studs and drywall in a condominium project and was sued by the owner for loss of use and cost of repair due to its defective performance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1-4. The court construed the \"contract\" exclusion of the policy,\n   which excluded coverage \"for damages arising out of any ... [d]elay or failure by [the insured] or anyone acting on [the insured's] behalf to perform a contract or agreement in accordance with its terms,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34, so as to apply. In reaching this result, the court rejected the insured's argument that such a construction was absurd \"because it would render the E &amp; O policy meaningless, in that every time an insured enters into a contract, it would lose coverage for any negligent acts, errors or omissions in work performed under the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. The court noted that although the owner's allegations in that case fit the contract exclusion, coverage was not defeated in all other scenarios.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As an example of a scenario in which the contract exclusion would not apply, the court noted that \"because contractors owe common law duties of care to those with whom they contract, as to all other persons, the 'contract' exclusion would not operate to preclude E &amp; O policy coverage arising from a tort claim that involves conduct that is not a delay or failure to perform under a contract term.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Even if one accepts DVO's argument that the phrase \"arising out of,\" as construed by Wisconsin courts, is so broad that even injuries and harm to third parties who sue in tort would be covered by the exclusion, this does not mean the exclusion would be eliminated entirely. As noted above, where a policy's purported coverage is illusory, the policy may be reformed to meet an insured's reasonable expectations of coverage.\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   , 369 Wis. 2d at \u00b6 56,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775981\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/369/547/\">\n    881 N.W.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But reforming a policy doesn't mean eliminating an exclusion in its entirety.

As the Wisconsin Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]f a clause in Marks' policy renders the policy illusory, we consider whether to reform that clause. We do not consider whether to reform other clauses, simply because they too eliminate coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Likewise in this case, even if DVO is correct that the breach of contract exclusion renders the E &amp; O coverage illusory because it applies not only to claims based upon a breach of contract, but also claims by third parties arising out of a breach of contract, it does not follow that the entire exclusion would be eliminated. Instead, the clause would be reformed to meet the insured's reasonable expectations of coverage. In this case, a reasonable insured would believe, based on the plain language of the exclusion, that liability for breach of contract would be excluded, but not liability to third parties who were not parties to the contract. Reforming the policy to so read, however, would not help DVO since DVO's entire liability in the underlying lawsuit was for breach of its contract with WTE and not to any third parties. In other words, even if reformation were granted, DVO would still be without coverage. It thus follows that Crum &amp; Forster had no duty to defend or indemnify DVO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, the E &amp; O policy is not illusory and any coverage provide by the E &amp; O coverage of the policy is excluded by the breach of contract exclusion. Alternatively, even if it is illusory, reformation would not provide coverage. It thus follows that Crum &amp; Forster has no duty to defend DVO in the WTE lawsuit or indemnify DVO for its liability arising out of that suit. Crum &amp; Forster's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 16) is therefore\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .
