The plaintiff has the better arguments.</p><p id=\"p-43\">The defendants fail to acknowledge that the agency action at issue-the FSA's loan guarantee for the OMH CAFO-is ongoing. The facts in the complaint indicate that the FSA approved the loan guarantee <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"50\" href=\"#p50\" id=\"p50\">*50</a>on July 23, 2015, for the maximum 90 percent of the loan, or $1,095,300. Compl. \u00b6 42. This guarantee continues today, and if the FSA were to revoke its guarantee, 90 percent of the loan would be left without a guarantor, potentially exposing the lender to substantial risk and jeopardizing the funding for the OMH CAFO. <em>See</em> Pl.'s Opp'n at 12-13. In addition, the statutes and regulations regarding FSA loan guarantees contemplate the agency's ongoing obligations and responsibilities in connection with a guarantee. For example, the Secretary of Agriculture must \"require [ ] an annual review of the credit history and business operation of the borrower,\" as well as \"an annual review of the continued eligibility of the borrower for the loan,\" <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983</extracted-citation>(2)(A)-(B), and must also \"require such provision for supervision of the borrower's operations as the Secretary shall deem necessary to achieve the objectives of the loan and protect the interests of the United States,\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">id.</extracted-citation></em> \u00a7 1983(4). Under the FSA's Guaranteed Farm Loan Program regulations, lenders must \"notify the Agency of any scheduled inspections during construction and after the guarantee has been issued.\" <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20762.130\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 762.130</extracted-citation>(d)(2). The FSA is also required to approve releases from liability upon an individual's withdrawal from the farming operation or upon liquidation, <em><extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20762.130\">id.</extracted-citation></em> \u00a7 762.146(b)-(c), and must be notified of any interest rate changes, <em><extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20762.130\">id.</extracted-citation></em> \u00a7 762.146(d)(5). Moreover, under the FSA regulations in effect at the time of the loan guarantee at issue, the FSA was responsible for \"post-approval inspection and monitoring of approved projects\" to \"ensure that those measures which were identified in the preapproval stage and required to be undertaken in order to reduce adverse environmental impacts are effectively implemented.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20762.130\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> \u00a7 1940.330(a) (2015). Thus, the FSA remains involved in the OMH CAFO through its ongoing guarantee of 90 percent of the loan and the responsibilities associated with that guarantee.</p><p id=\"p-44\">This continued involvement indicates that the plaintiff can be afforded effectual relief through a court order. For example, in response to a court order requiring the FSA to undertake additional environmental assessments, the FSA could revoke its guarantee or add conditions to its continuing guarantee of the loan, which could include requiring additional environmental restrictions or mitigating measures. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201940.318\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1940.318</extracted-citation>(g) (2015) (requiring that mitigation measures be included \"in the offer of financial assistance as special conditions\"). Indeed, the D.C. Circuit has relied on precisely this reasoning in concluding that a NEPA challenge to the construction of an oil pipeline was not moot. <em>See</em> <em>Sierra Club</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173839,4345799\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/31/\">803 F.3d at 43</extracted-citation>. In that case, the intervenor-defendant pipeline company argued that the appeal was moot \"because the agencies have already granted the various authorizations at issue and construction of the pipeline is now complete,\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173839,4345799\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/31/\">id.</extracted-citation></em> , but the court rejected that argument \"because an order wholly or partly enjoining operation of the pipeline, pending further analyses of the pipeline's environmental impact, would provide some degree of 'effectual relief,' \" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173839,4345799\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/31/\">id.</extracted-citation></em> Notably, the agencies' continuing involvement in the pipeline at issue in <em>Sierra Club</em> is similar to the FSA's continuing involvement in the OMH CAFO: construction of the pipeline required easements, approvals, and permits from the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, some of which required NEPA analyses. <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173839,4345799\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/31/\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173839,4345799\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/31/\"> at 35-36</extracted-citation>. Although the pipeline had been completed by the time of the appeal, the D.C. Circuit noted that the agencies could still \"call for additional mitigation and monitoring, or could decide not to renew their respective authorizations,\" indicating that the appeal was not <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"51\" href=\"#p51\" id=\"p51\">*51</a>moot despite the completion of the project. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173839,4345799\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/31/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173839,4345799\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/31/\"> at 43</extracted-citation>. Although the defendants cite <em>Sierra Club</em> <em>, see</em> Defs.' Mem. at 6-7; Defs.' Reply at 6-8, they fail to grapple with these salient aspects of the decision that undermine their mootness argument.</p><p id=\"p-45\">Similarly, the plaintiff correctly points to <em>Buffalo River Watershed Alliance v. Department of Agriculture</em> , No. 13-cv-450, <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206837005\">2014 WL 6837005</extracted-citation> (E.D. Ark. Dec. 2, 2014), a case with similar facts to the pending lawsuit, that relied on the same reasoning to find that the plaintiffs had established a redressable injury. In <em>Buffalo River</em> , the plaintiffs alleged that the FSA and the Small Business Administration had conducted an inadequate environmental review in guaranteeing loans for a pig CAFO. <em>Id.</em> at *1. The court concluded that the agencies could \"still take the hard look at [the CAFO's] environmental consequences that they should have in the beginning,\" <em>id.</em> at *3, and noted that \"if that hard look requires the Agencies to put conditions on their guaranties, then it's likely that [the CAFO] will comply with those conditions,\" <em>id.</em> Similar relief could be awarded in this case.</p><p id=\"p-46\">The defendants cite several cases in support of their argument that completion of the CAFO renders the plaintiff's claims moot, but these cases are distinguishable. In <em>Lechliter v. University of Delaware</em> , No. 12-cv-16, <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2012827782\">2015 WL 12827782</extracted-citation> (D. Del. Jan. 16, 2015), the court found that the plaintiffs' challenge to the construction and operation of wind turbines was moot because \"the wind turbine is already fully constructed and operational,\" \"the majority of the [Department of Energy's] funding (more than 95 percent) has been spent,\" and \"the [Department's] involvement in the project is finished.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2012827782\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> at *4 n.7.

By virtue of the FSA's continuing guarantee of the OMH CAFO's loan, the FSA continues to exert some control over the CAFO and maintain some involvement in the CAFO's ongoing operations. If, for example, a court order directed the FSA to withdraw its loan guarantee pending further environmental assessments or to conduct a supplemental environmental assessment and impose additional conditions on its guarantee, the plaintiff's alleged injury would, in some measure, be redressed. Indeed, the defendants concede that \"this Court has the power to remand the EA/FONSI for reconsideration or further explanation and to vacate the loan guarantee,\" Defs.' Mem. at 10, but they argue that \"neither of those actions would prevent the continuing operation of the poultry farm,\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">id.</extracted-citation></em> The plaintiff has established, however, that \"an order enjoining payments on the loan guarantee until NEPA compliance was achieved would redress Plaintiff's procedural rights because the CAFO would be unlikely to risk losing the federal guarantee [by] ignoring its NEPA obligations.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 24. Given that the FSA guarantees 90 percent of the OMH CAFO loan, the temporary withdrawal or revocation of that guarantee would put a substantial portion of the OMH CAFO's funding at risk. If, as a result of further environmental assessments, <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"56\" href=\"#p56\" id=\"p56\">*56</a>the FSA were to impose additional mitigation measures or conditions on its guarantee, the OMH CAFO would likely comply with those conditions, given that the CAFO would be \"unable to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere ... at reasonable rates and terms.\" <extracted-citation index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20762.120\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 762.120</extracted-citation>(h)(1).

Reply at 1, the gravamen of the plaintiff's complaint is that the FSA must comport with the NEPA.

Here, unlike in <em>Center for Biological Diversity</em> , the FSA remains involved in the project at issue, and given the FSA's continuing guarantee of 90 percent of the loan supporting the OMH CAFO's ongoing operations, the plaintiff has established that \"it is likely, not merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\" <em>Ctr. for Biological Diversity</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711476\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/541/1091/\">541 F.Supp.2d at 1095</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-67\">The defendant also attempts to distinguish <em>Buffalo River</em> , a case with substantially similar facts to the pending case, arguing that <em>Buffalo River</em> \"is not supported by reasoning or law, is contrary to the law of this Circuit and has no binding authority here.\" Defs.'

To recap, in <em>Buffalo River</em> , the plaintiffs claimed that the FSA and the Small Business Administration violated the NEPA by guaranteeing loans for a pig CAFO without conducting adequate EAs. <em>Buffalo River</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206837005\">2014 WL 6837005</extracted-citation>, at *1.

Reply at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is precisely the standard used in <em>Buffalo River</em> , however-the court found it \"likely that more environmental review\" would change the ways in which the CAFO operated. <em>Buffalo River</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206837005\">2014 WL 6837005</extracted-citation>, at *4. <em>Buffalo River</em> is therefore persuasive in this case, and for similar reasons, the plaintiff here has shown that \"[m]ore study of [the OMH CAFO's] environmental consequences, and any resulting conditions on reinstated guarantees, will likely redress [the plaintiff's] injuries.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206837005\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> Accordingly, the plaintiff has shown injury in fact, causation, and redressability, and has therefore established that at least one of its members would have standing in his or her own right.</p><p id=\"p-69\">The remaining requirements for organizational standing are easily satisfied in this case.
