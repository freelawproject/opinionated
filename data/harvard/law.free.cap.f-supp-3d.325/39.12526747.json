To recap, in\n       <em>\n        Buffalo River\n       </em>\n       , the plaintiffs claimed that the FSA and the Small Business Administration violated the NEPA by guaranteeing loans for a pig CAFO without conducting adequate EAs.\n       <em>\n        Buffalo River\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206837005\">\n        2014 WL 6837005\n       </extracted-citation>\n       , at *1.

The defendants contend that\n       <em>\n        Buffalo River\n       </em>\n       \"is inconsistent with controlling D.C.

Reply at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is precisely the standard used in\n       <em>\n        Buffalo River\n       </em>\n       , however-the court found it \"likely that more environmental review\" would change the ways in which the CAFO operated.\n       <em>\n        Buffalo River\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206837005\">\n        2014 WL 6837005\n       </extracted-citation>\n       , at *4.\n       <em>\n        Buffalo River\n       </em>\n       is therefore persuasive in this case, and for similar reasons, the plaintiff here has shown that \"[m]ore study of [the OMH CAFO's] environmental consequences, and any resulting conditions on reinstated guarantees, will likely redress [the plaintiff's] injuries.\"\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206837005\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       Accordingly, the plaintiff has shown injury in fact, causation, and redressability, and has therefore established that at least one of its members would have standing in his or her own right.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-69\">\n       The remaining requirements for organizational standing are easily satisfied in this case.

Finally, neither the claims asserted nor the injunctive relief requested would require the participation of the individual members.
