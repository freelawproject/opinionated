Plaintiffs Isaias Rosales, individually and doing business as Pollos Asados El Regio (\"Rosales\"), and nine companies Rosales owns (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"), filed a response in opposition [Doc. # 20], to which Defendants replied [Doc. # 21]. The Motion is ripe for disposition. Having carefully considered the parties' briefing, all matters of record, and the applicable legal authorities, the Court\n   <strong>\n    denies in part and grants in part\n   </strong>\n

Plaintiff Isaias Rosales founded a restaurant chain known as \"Pollos Asados El Regio\" in the Houston area in 1998 or 1999,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   at some point registering the name \"Pollos Asados El Regio\" with Harris County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rosales also hired and paid an artist to design a logo that the restaurants, which specialize in Monterrey-style mesquite grilled chicken and similar fare, adopted and continue to use today.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The logo (\"Logo\") is a cartoon chicken in a yellow cowboy hat and red apron, against a blue background, with one wing pointing out and the other wing down at its side.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rosales, through the Plaintiff companies, currently operates a number of restaurants across Texas, including in Alvin,\n   Conroe, Houston, Katy, New Caney, Rosenberg, and Spring.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Plaintiffs, their grilled chicken restaurant businesses allegedly have established a reputation throughout the greater Houston area that is linked to the businesses' name,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Pollos Asados El Regio, and Logo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rosales alleges that he helped Defendant Bazaldua, his ex-brother-in-law, \"get started in the business\" by sharing his business practices with Bazaldua and providing Bazaldua a license to use Plaintiffs' \"recipes, logo, processes, and business model.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The license seems to have included using the name \"Pollos Asados El Regio\" or a variation on it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Plaintiffs, the license extended only to the one restaurant that Bazaldua had opened at the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs allege that Bazaldua agreed to compensate Rosales for use of Rosales' intellectual property, and paid Rosales approximately $4,000 over the course of one or two months for Bazaldua's use of the Logo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The payments, however, ceased.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, Bazaldua today operates multiple grilled chicken restaurants in the Dallas-Fort Worth and Austin areas, and, in the course of active business expansion, has opened a restaurant in Houston.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs claim these restaurants are named \"El Pollo Regio,\" a name allegedly identical or extremely similar to \"Pollos Asados El Regio,\" and that Bazaldua, exceeding the scope of the limited license granted him, has used Plaintiffs' businesses' name, Logo, recipes, and business model in operating the El Pollo Regio restaurants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Rosales further alleges that Defendant El Pollos Regio IP, LLC registered federal trademarks for a logo of a cartoon chicken and the business name \"Pollo Regio\" (\"Registered Marks\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff asserts that the Registered Marks are essentially the same as the marks Rosales developed and Plantiffs use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Rosales, in 2016, Bazaldua and his agents contacted Plaintiffs and claimed that Plaintiffs were infringing on Defendants' federal trademark rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rosales claims that Bazaldua initially offered to pay Rosales to change the Logo \"and/or\" name of Rosales' businesses, but subsequently retained counsel and formally threatened suit\n   against Plaintiffs for trademark infringement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n
