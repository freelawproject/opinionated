The Wahdans contend that the IRS lacked the authority to impose any penalty in excess of $100,000.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to the Complaint, the Wahdans failed to file or filed inaccurate Forms TD F 90.22-1, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) for 2008, 2009, and 2010. As a consequence, the IRS assessed numerous penalties for multiple FBAR violations, many of which were flat amounts of $100,000. But for three violations, the IRS assessed penalties of $1,108,645.41 for 2008, $599,234.54 for 2009, and $599,234.54 for 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Defendants move for judgment on the pleadings (\n   <strong>\n    # 33\n   </strong>\n   ) contending that the penalties for years 2008, 2009 and 2010 must be capped at $100,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Colo. Jan. 23, 2013). In the Complaint, the IRS asserts only two claims-one against each Defendant for penalties pursuant to 31 U.S.C.\u00a7 5321(a)(5) for willful failure to file accurate forms for numerous off-shore bank accounts (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts) for 2008, 2009 and 2010. In contrast, the issue presented in the subject motion only concerns penalties imposed on certain accounts, but as to both Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Because the issue raised in the extant motion is much narrower, and not configured to match the claims asserted, the Court inquired of counsel how a ruling might be fashioned. Based on their representations at a hearing conducted on July 17, 2018, the Court understands that the parties have submitted all evidence that would bear on this issue in conjunction with this motion. The Court therefore converts the motion to one brought pursuant to Rule 56(a), and finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact. Accordingly, the issue raised can be determined as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The focus of the dispute is upon the interplay between statutory and regulatory law. The applicable statute with regard to offshore accounts is\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205321\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5). It authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to impose civil penalties for violations of FBAR requirements, and for willful violations sets the maximum penalty at the greater of $100,000 or 50 percent of the balance in the relevant account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Several regulations implement the statute. They are all found in Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations governing Money and Finance for the Department of Treasury. The first is\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.820\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), which provides that \"[f]or any willful violation [of the FBAR implementing regulations] involving a failure to report the existence of an account or any\n   identifying information required to be provided with respect to such account,\" the Secretary \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   assess\" a civil penalty of $ 25,000 or up to the balance in the account but no greater than $100,000. The second regulation is\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.810\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) in which the Secretary delegates his/her authority to \"assess and collect civil penalties under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205321\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.820\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \" to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by means of a memorandum of Agreement between FinCen and the IRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under this scheme, the\n   <em>\n    statute\n   </em>\n   (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205321\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(C) ) permits the Secretary to impose a penalty of up to 50 percent of the account balance, but under 31 C.F.R.\u00a7 1010.820(g) the Secretary has limited the penalty to be enforced to $100,000. The parties agree that the disjunction between the statute and the regulation occurred in 2004 when the statutory penalty cap was increased,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   but no corresponding change was made in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.820\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Believing the statutory amendment superseded \u00a7 1010.820, the IRS enforced FBAR violations under the limits set forth in the current \u00a7 5321(a)(5)(C) against the Wahdans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Defendants argue that the assessments were improper because the IRS only had that authority limited by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.820\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). The IRS argues that it was obligated to impose the penalties in the statute, that the reference to \"may\" in the statute does not reflect any discretion to impose penalties smaller than the full amount authorized by Congress, and that the 2004 amendment to the statute supersedes any inconsistency in by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.820\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court finds the Defendants' arguments more persuasive. Beginning with the text of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205321\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court notes that both the pre-2004 version and the current version specifically grant the Secretary discretion to assess penalties. Both versions state that the Secretary \"may assess\" the described penalties. The statutory language is clear, and there is nothing in the legislative history offered by the IRS that suggests that Congress intended to limit the discretion of the Secretary to determine what penalties should be imposed. Congress' intent and directive ends with the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For a statute to supersede a regulation, it has to be clearly inconsistent with the regulation. The IRS argues that the different penalty caps in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205321\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.820\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) demonstrates an inconsistency such that the statute trumps the regulation.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Larionoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2235\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/864/#p873\">\n    431 U.S. 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 873,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2235\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/864/#p873\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2235\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/864/#p873\">\n    53 L.Ed.2d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977). The Court is unpersuaded for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   First, the statute and the regulation are not inconsistent on their face. The statute sets a higher cap than does the regulation; instead, the penalty cap in the regulation is, in essence, a subset of the penalties that could be imposed under the statute. The statute does not mandate imposition of the maximum penalty, but instead gives the Secretary discretion to impose penalties below the statutory cap. This means that compliance with the lower cap set in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.820\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) also complies with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205321\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, there is a simple and straightforward interpretation that gives coherent meaning to both the statute and the regulation-in the exercise of statutory discretion, the Secretary limited the penalties that the IRS could impose to $100,000 (plus the amount adjusted for inflation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Third, although the penalty caps in the statute and regulation differ, one cannot assume that the Secretary simply overlooked\n   the difference between them. The difference has existed since 2004-essentially 14 years. During that time, the Secretary made regular adjustments to another regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.821\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that adjusted penalties to account for inflation. Among the penalties affected by this regulation is that created by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205321\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(C), for which the inflationary increases have been made at least five times in the last eight years\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   , but at no time was the listed penalty cap raised above $100,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civil Monetary Penalty Adjustment and Table,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2042%2C503\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. 42,503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 42,504 -05 (June 30, 2016). The periodic revisions of the inflationary calculation required focus on the penalty cap, but it was never changed to comport with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205321\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(C). This suggests that the Secretary was aware of the penalties available under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205321\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(C) and elected to continue to limit the IRS' authority to impose penalties to $100,000 as specified in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.820\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, the IRS' reliance upon legislative history is misplaced. The IRS argues that congressional intent as evident from the legislative history for the 2004 amendment to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205321\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(C) shows that Congress intended the statute to supersede\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.820\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court pauses to note that, ordinarily, it does not resort to legislative history unless the text of a statute is ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    Mohamad v.

The Senate Report discusses threats arising from offshore accounts in the context of adding civil penalties for\n   <em>\n    nonwillful\n   </em>\n   violations but there is no discussion about willful violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 108-192 at 108 (2003). Willful violations are mentioned only in the Conference Report, which states only that the increase in penalties is based on a Senate amendment and that the committee accepted the amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 108-755 at 615 (2004) (Conf. Rep.). Although Congress\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   favored higher penalties for FBAR noncompliance, there is nothing here that suggests that Congress believed that the maximum penalties for willful violations should be mandatorily imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The IRS also argues the Secretary has never intended\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.820\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to limit the IRS in its ability to impose the maximum penalties authorized. The IRS points to the preamble to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.820\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   when its predecessor provision (\u00a7 103.57) was issued in 1987. It reads: \"Treasury has been given the authority and responsibility to enforce the Bank Secrecy Act, and intends to do so to the fullest extent possible. There will be no 'safe harbor' of allowable violations.\" Amendments to Implementing Regulations Under the Bank Secrecy Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Fed.%20Reg.%2011%2C436\">\n    52 Fed. Reg. 11,436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11,440 (Apr. 8, 1987). The IRS contends that this language suggests that the Secretary anticipated that the regulations would keep pace with statutory provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The IRS reads more into this provision than does the Court. It is true that this preamble evidences an intent to prosecute\n   all violations, but it does not expressly address the scope of penalties to be imposed, nor can it be fairly understood as directing how regulations would be updated. For example, if the Secretary intended that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201010.820\">\n    31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010.820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   would automatically incorporate changes in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205321\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the regulation could have referred to the statute, but in the past 31 years, it has not done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the absence of such clear direction, the Court is left with the question of what is meant by enforcement to the \"fullest extent possible\". This phrase could have a variety of meanings-prosecuting every violator and imposing maximum sanctions are just two. But the next statement in the preamble indicates the most likely meaning has to do with scope of prosecution-that there be no \"safe harbors\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court's reasoning is congruous with the Western District of Texas' determination on the same issue in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Colliot\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-CA-1281-SS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202271381\">\n    2018 WL 2271381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (May 16, 2018). Although the IRS believes that it is empowered by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205321\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to act, it is not. It is empowered by the Secretary who has discretion to determine what penalties are imposed. \u00a7 1010.820 remains in effect until amended or repealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Ass'n\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587337\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1199/#p1206\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1206,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587337\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1199/#p1206\">\n    191 L.Ed.2d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (\"[A]gencies [must] use the same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used to issue the rule in the first instance.\"). As a result, the IRS lacks authority to impose a penalty in excess of $100,000 as prescribed by 31 C.F.R.\u00a7 1010.820.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
