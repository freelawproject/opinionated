Defendant J Message Group Corp. (\"JMGC\"), also called Companions of Wisdom (\"CoW\") is a closed, invitation-only, nonprofit organization, incorporated under the laws of the State of Vermont, with its principal place of business in Vermont. (Doc. 15 at \u00b6 10.) Defendant Kenneth Alexander and Defendant Deborah Alexander (husband and wife) are officers and directors of JMGC, and they are citizens of the State of Washington. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12.) Defendants conduct fee-based seminars and conferences and develop written materials to promote their reincarnation-based doctrines, worldview, and advocacy agenda to its members and to those interested in engaging in its programs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 20.) Plaintiff, a citizen of the State of Virginia, met and became acquainted with the Alexanders and with JMGC in 2008, and she began paying to attend JMGC's conferences. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.) The actions giving rise to this lawsuit occurred during a JMGC conference held in Santa Fe, New Mexico. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 34-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants promote the belief that people have past lives that influence their current life and, as noted earlier, Defendants develop written materials to promote their reincarnation-based doctrines, worldview, and advocacy agenda to the organization's members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14) As part of the CoW program, Defendants hold seminars and issue publications to the members of JMGC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 30.) JMGC is authoritarian in nature and does not permit dissent or questions regarding its doctrines or leadership. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Alexander is the \"spiritual leader\" of JMGC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.) Mr. Alexander compels the members of JMGC to adopt the organization's reincarnation doctrines and hierarchical structure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14.) Mr. Alexander claims to channel communications from higher beings or master guides, which communications include instructions and beliefs that are binding on the members of JMGC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   JMGC lures people who are looking for spiritual direction and altruistic involvement by initially promoting self-improvement and by engaging its members in discussions and providing publications relating to broader contemporary topics such as history, economics, and spiritual development. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.) When prospective members wish to advance their association with JMGC and share details of their personal lives with Defendants, Defendants collectively engage in a process designed to control, isolate, shame, emotionally harm, and take advantage of the prospective members, which process is contrary to JMGC's \"self-improvement banner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.) Members who dissent or question the leadership's directives become the targets of \"shaming conduct\"-meaning that Defendants \"collectively disseminate false information coupled with outrageous accusations, in CoW communications, designed solely to cause dissenting members substantial emotional and psychological trauma.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.) Dissenting members are subjected to this \"shaming conduct\" until they recant their dissent or quit the organization. (Id. at \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As Plaintiff's involvement in JMGC increased, Plaintiff had questions about JMGC/CoW's operations and beliefs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21) Defendants did not like Plaintiff's inquiring nature and resistance to questionable directions, and they collectively engaged in a campaign to discredit her, and to cause problems in her personal life and to her professional reputation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23.) On one occasion, Plaintiff-who is a government contractor with a high-level security clearance, having attended a CoW conference abroad asked Mrs. Alexander for the name and sponsor of the conference so that she could provide that information on a United States Government\n   security clearance application as required by her employer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.) Mrs. Alexander demanded that Plaintiff refrain from disclosing the fact that she had travelled overseas to attend the CoW conference, and insisted that Plaintiff lie to the federal government about the purpose of her travel under threat of \"severe consequences\" if she did not comply with this directive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Plaintiff refused to comply with Mrs. Alexander's directive to lie to the federal government on the ground that any act of dishonesty or misconduct could compromise her professional credentials and her job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27) This notwithstanding, Mrs. Alexander continued to urge Plaintiff to lie, and Plaintiff continued to refuse to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In retaliation for Plaintiff's refusal to lie on her security clearance application, Defendants published \"Communication 17\" (dated February 12-13, 2016) to its membership, stating that: \"she [Plaintiff] has a split who is a porn star and is seen doing sex acts with her husband. That is all she does ... the Hubbard Soul has been part of several sex cults, including the Manson cult.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28 (italics omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In a further act of retaliation, Mr. Alexander began interfering with Plaintiff's personal relationship by urging her then fianc\u00e9e (now husband) Ken Kyzer to break off his relationship with Plaintiff because she was a destructive influence. (Doc. 15 at \u00b6 29.) Defendant Kenneth Alexander told Ken Kyzer that if he were going to be a committed partner associated with CoW, he would have to end his relationship with Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because Mr. Kyzer refused to end his relationship with Plaintiff, Defendants terminated Plaintiff's membership in JMGC/CoW, thereby prohibiting Plaintiff from reading Mr. Alexander's channeled communications, and also prohibiting her from attending Defendant's conferences or events. (Doc. 15 at \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Thereafter, (from February 25, 2016 through February 28, 2016) Defendants held a JMGC/CoW conference in Santa Fe, New Mexico. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.) During this conference, Defendants presented the following statements about Plaintiff to the membership of JMGC:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   a. Recently, we had to discontinue the access for one aspect of that soul [Carol Hubbard]. And why is that?\n   <strong>\n    Because ... they were very predatory in this group.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   b.\n   <strong>\n    Sandra Otterson, another famous porn star, they do have a split in your group,\n   </strong>\n   believe it or not, but they also have one that just left:\n   <strong>\n    Carol Hubbard.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   c.\n   <strong>\n    The sexual predators\n   </strong>\n   you might think are fairly easy to spot because they make you uncomfortable to be around, but they're still there.\n   <strong>\n    And your friend Carol Hubbard was a sexual predator, but she was also a financial predator because she was poor.\n   </strong>\n   And you have many who come in contact with this group thinking that this is where they will make their riches.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   d. We don't judge you over the fact that you have sexual desires or that you want to have wealth.\n   <strong>\n    But if you're using other people to get it in a way that is inappropriate,\n   </strong>\n   you need to stop and think about how far you're going to get before we see what you're doing.\n   <strong>\n    That is why Carol Hubbard and Ken Kyzer are no longer in your group.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   e. So this guy who is, uh, previously a reader (Rob Murphy), just reactivated, how long ago what that Deborah?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Deborah [Alexander]: Three days ago.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Three days ago.\n   <strong>\n    So we got right of the other one, Carol Hubbard, and now we have this guy. Okay? So,\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    they really want to be involved in this work, but I don't take them seriously any longer ... But you've got to understand just how messed up human psychology is, to see how you can get such a diversity of expression in the human form.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   f. Why are we always so hard on the pornographers? Is it because they're predatory? In most cases, who makes all the money? It's the pornographer, it's not the porn star.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Well, these two, Nina Hartley and Sandra Otterson are a little smarter because they took control of their own destiny and they are the ones making the money ... But they're still predatory on people who cannot express their sexuality in a normal functional manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   g. What's happened recently with the Scribe's split, Ken Kyzer, is an example of how the 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   ray not only got subverted, but got completely kicked out. And what was it due to? I am going to be very blunt about it.\n   <strong>\n    It was about sex and money.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   In this group we have worked extremely hard to remove these as factors in the group's functioning.\n   <strong>\n    We have tried to keep predatory people out of the group, either who are predatory sexually or monetarily. The sexual predators you might think are fairly easy to spot because they make you uncomfortable to be around, but they're still there.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    And your friend Carol Hubbard was a sexual predator, but she was also a financial predator because she was poor.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   And you have many who come in contact with this group thinking that this is where they will make their riches ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   h.\n   <strong>\n    Sexual predation is very common\n   </strong>\n   . It's a very common part of the 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   ray Psychoanthropology because 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   rays tend to be very insensitive to others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    They seek ways of gaining control over others and whether it's sex, money or power, they'll use one or more of these things to gain, uh, the upper hand.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    We have told the higher self of Carol Hubbard that if they want to stay in the group, if they want to have a functioning member of the group, there can be no sexual or financial predation going on.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The Scribe's higher self needs to come forward and explain what it is they did to cause the Carol Hubbard/Ken Kyzer problem from occurring in the first place because they were largely responsible for that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    This group cannot exist with financial or sexual predators.\n   </strong>\n   You cannot come into this group thinking, \"Well, I need to get myself laid,\" or \"I need to make a buck.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   If you happen to meet somebody in the group and you're attracted to them and you form a relationship, that's perfectly fine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   But if your sole purpose of being here is to have sex, you're in the wrong place. The same is true if you're here to try to make money off of people in the group. This is not the place to do it ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    But what you have seen with Carol Hubbard and Ken Kyzer is a perfect example of what we are trying to prevent in this group.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 35.) (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The statements, which were made live at the Santa Fe conference before an audience of more than 100 attendees in retaliation against Plaintiff and Mr. Kyzer, were, thereafter, edited, transcribed, and published\n   online on the JMGC/CoW website which is available to JMGC's worldwide membership. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 33, 34, 37.) Because Defendants had ousted Plaintiff from JMGC, she was precluded from reading the transcribed texts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.) The statements have caused Plaintiff extreme embarrassment and emotional distress, and have caused third-parties, friends and associates to avoid being associated with her out of fear of being associated with the statements. (Doc. 15 at \u00b6\u00b6 40, 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants' treatment of Plaintiff is consistent with their history and pattern of targeting members, particularly females, who dissent or question their directives, with shaming conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19, 42-44.) Defendants have previously maligned dissenting females by publishing statements labeling a well-respected former member of the United States Congress who was not a CoW member, but founded an organization that CoW's members are expected to volunteer for and financially support, \"as a madam at a bordello and a slave holder; and stating that another such person was a black whore, who aided and[ ] otherwise[ ] contributed to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Based on the foregoing allegations, Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on four theories of liability: (1) Defamation and Defamation Per Se, (2) False Light Invasion of Privacy, (3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and (4) Civil Conspiracy. (Doc. 15 at 11-17.) Plaintiff also seeks to enjoin Defendants from permitting continued access to its membership to the allegedly defamatory statements about her, to enjoin Defendants from publishing any further defamatory comments about her, and an order compelling Defendants to redact Plaintiff's and Mr. Kyzer's names from JMGC/CoW communications, transcripts, and publications. (Doc. 15 at 17.) Defendants move to dismiss these claims on the ground that the at-issue beliefs and communications are \"religious\" and, as such, Plaintiff's claims, which arise from a purely religious controversy, are barred by the \"church autonomy doctrine\"-an affirmative defense grounded in the First Amendment to the Constitution. (Doc. 19 at 11-17.) Defendants argue, in the alternative, that each of Plaintiff's claims should be dismissed on the merits for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-29.) For the reasons discussed herein, the Court concludes that Plaintiff's claims are barred by the First Amendment. Because Plaintiff's claims are dismissed on First Amendment grounds, the Court does not consider Defendants' alternative arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     The Standards Governing a Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) authorizes a court to dismiss a complaint for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" In deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must determine whether the plaintiff's complaint \"contain[s] sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Plaintiff claims that this is purely a secular dispute that can be resolved through the application of neutral principles of law without \"doctrinal or organizational entanglement.\" (Doc. 32 at 3.) The Court does not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     General Principles Relevant to Plaintiff's Particular Theories of Recovery Support Dismissal of Plaintiff's Claims on First Amendment Grounds\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As an initial observation, there is no bright line legal proposition that governs the question whether tort claims brought by current or former members of religious organizations that defame or ostracize them are barred by the First Amendment. And a review of the case law reveals that decisions are driven by the nuances underlying the particular claims. For example, in the defamation context, the Supreme Court of Iowa rejected a First Amendment defense to a claim of defamation arising out of a letter disseminated to members of the general public by a church minister describing the plaintiff as the \"spirit of Satan.\"\n   <em>\n    Kliebenstein v. Iowa Conference of United Methodist Church\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9114434\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/663/404/#p405\">\n    663 N.W.2d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 405-07 (Iowa 2003). The court reasoned that although the phrase \"spirit of Satan,\" clearly conveys sectarian meaning, it also carries a secular meaning and could, therefore effect the secular public's impression of the plaintiff's character.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9114434\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/663/404/#p405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Conversely, the Iowa Court of Appeals held that a defamation claim based on church officials having stated that the plaintiff \"lied,\" that he was \"in league with Satan\" and that he had been \"sleeping around\" was barred by the First Amendment since these comments arose out of an underlying dispute between the plaintiff and his church and, unlike the\n   <em>\n    Kliebenstein\n   </em>\n   case, the comments were presented only to church members.\n   <em>\n    Howard v. Covenant Apostolic Church, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"775104\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/124/24/\">\n    124 Ohio App.3d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=705%20N.E.2d%20385\">\n    705 N.E.2d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 388-89 (1997). The coexistence of\n   <em>\n    Kliebenstein\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   as governing law within the same judicial jurisdiction illustrate the importance of context and of subtle distinctions in the context of the First Amendment defense to tort claims against \"religious\" institutions. With that in mind, the Court, having reviewed a number of cases from courts in several jurisdictions, has derived some general principles that usefully inform its analysis of Defendant's First Amendment defense in the context of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The first principle is that courts generally do not permit tort claims arising from internal processes by which religious organizations discipline their members or determine whether a person's character renders her suitable for continued membership or participation in the organization. This is so even where the conduct underlying the tort claim would be actionable in another context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For example, the Minnesota Court of Appeals held that a couples' claim for defamation against their former pastor who had read a letter to the entire congregation of his church setting out the reasons for terminating the couple's membership was barred by the First Amendment even as to statements that were ostensibly unrelated to church doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Schoenhals v.
