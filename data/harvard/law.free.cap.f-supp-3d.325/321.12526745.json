At the request of Defendants' counsel, the court questioned Juror 5 (then-Prospective Juror 28) about an answer he provided on his questionnaire that he previously sought the help of a supervisor or his union for a dispute in the workplace:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Defendants' counsel]: I just had a quick question for him, because he said he sought [help] from his [union] and his supervisor, I'm just curious as to what was the nature of that help and why.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Prospective Juror 28 was brought up to sidebar.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [...]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE COURT: I just wanted to ask you a follow-up, a couple of questions here.

Could you just tell us more about those?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   JUROR: I am on the executive board of my union. I act as a shop steward often.

The court and the parties were thus made aware that Prospective Juror 28 was not just a union member, but was in fact a union representative. It would not be unreasonable to expect that someone who is a union representative might have sympathies that were pro-worker and even anti-corporation.

The jury is asked to listen to the evidence presented objectively, weigh the credibility of witnesses and testimony, and assess the case based on what they hear and see in the courtroom. Jurors may and can have personal views on certain issues, but in evaluating the potential for juror bias and impartiality during voir dire, the relevant inquiry is whether a juror can set those views aside to assess the case based only on the evidence presented.

The fact that Plaintiff's testimony on this issue was in conflict with the testimony of two of Defendants' witnesses does not render Plaintiff's testimony incredible. It is the province of the jury to weigh the conflicting testimony to determine which side is credible. The jurors did so here, and found Plaintiff's testimony credible. Defendants further emphasize that Plaintiff did not previously claim that he used the word \"discrimination\" in his conversations with Mendonca or Troche.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Post-Trial Br. at 15-16. However, as Defendants note, Plaintiff did previously indicate that he \"spoke to Troche and Mendonca about Ramphal singling him out and badgering him[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Therefore, the jury could have reasonably determined that Troche and Mendonca were on notice of Plaintiff's discrimination claim. Further, to the extent that Defendants insinuate that Plaintiff's testimony at trial that he explicitly used the word \"discrimination\" when reporting Defendant Ramphal's behavior to Mendonca and Troche was not truthful, Defendants' counsel questioned Plaintiff on this point during cross-examination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 20 Trial Tr. at 754:25-755:24, 794:4-14. The jury heard the conflicting testimony of Plaintiff, Mendonca, and Troche, and given the verdict, seemingly credited Plaintiff's narrative that he used the word \"discrimination\" in those conversations. The court does not find any reason to disturb that credibility determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendants' challenges highlight the fact that this case turned on the credibility of Plaintiff, as compared to the credibility of his supervisor, Defendant Ramphal and Defendant ASR's managerial staff. That is, the jury was asked to determine who was credible-Plaintiff who alleged discrimination, loss of overtime and demotion as a result of complaining of the discrimination he experienced, and further subjection to a hostile work environment, or Defendants, who claimed that Plaintiff never reported the allegedly discriminatory acts and that if he had, the company would have responded, and that Plaintiff was disciplined and demoted because of his skill. Much of the evidence at trial, and as made clear by the types of challenges raised by Defendants in their motion for a new trial, went to the parties' credibility or circumstantial evidence purporting to reveal a party's motivation for a given act. It was not unreasonable, based on the witness testimony and evidence presented, for the jury to find Plaintiff credible and to issue the\n   verdict that it did. The court cannot say that the jury's verdict is seriously erroneous or against the weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants' arguments that Defendants had legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for their conduct and that ASR \"maintains clear anti-harassment reporting policies and procedures which Plaintiff admitted he failed to follow[,]\" Defs.'

The jury credited Plaintiff's testimony that Defendant Ramphal was discriminating against him on the basis of his race and/or national origin, and that Defendant ASR ignored Plaintiff's reports of that discriminatory behavior. To the extent that Defendants' argument is that the jury should have believed their version of the facts, the court will not disturb the jury's verdict as it does not go against the weight of the evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendants also allege that the testimony of Plaintiff's witness Gaffney was incredible and should be disregarded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Post-Trial Br. at 16-17. Specifically, Defendants argue that Gaffney's testimony that Plaintiff complained to him on various occasions regarding Defendant Ramphal's use of the phrase \"you people\" and that Gaffney understood that phrase to mean the \"n word\" is incredible because at trial Gaffney testified that if one of his workers came to him with a claim of discrimination, he would report it, but that \"he never once reported discrimination to anyone at ASR.\" Defs.' Post-Trial Br. at 17 (citing Apr. 20 Trial Tr. at 667:2-669:1).

Based on all the evidence presented, a reasonable jury could determine that the weight of the evidence tipped in Plaintiff's favor. It was not unreasonable for the jury to find that credible evidence was presented to support Plaintiff's theory of the case, and the court therefore does not find that the verdict was seriously erroneous or against the weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

For the reasons that follow, Defendants' arguments are not persuasive and the court will not order a new trial based on these grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendants challenge as prejudicial Gaffney's testimony that the company \"did nothing\" to respond to other allegations of discrimination, which were unrelated to Plaintiff's case, but likewise resulted in litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Post-Trial Br. at 21-22. Defendants' argument that Gaffney's testimony regarding other instances of employment discrimination at and filed against Defendant ASR is not persuasive. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, evidence will be excluded if its probative value is \"substantially outweighed by [the] danger\" of \"unfair prejudice[.]\" Fed. R. Evid. 403. Defendants' explanation for why Gaffney's testimony was prejudicial does not rise to the level of unfair prejudice that clearly outweighs the probative effect of the testimony. Here, Gaffney's testimony is probative because it relates to the procedures he saw used by the company over an extended period of time to deal with grievances. Gaffney testified based on his experience as both the shop steward at ASR from 2013 through 2016,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Apr. 20 Trial Tr. at 596:15-19, and as an ASR employee who held several elected positions with Plaintiff's union.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 595:17-24, 596:8-15.

Post-Trial Br. at 21. Schullere's testimony was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted. Instead, it was offered for Schuller's impression of how Plaintiff's behavior and demeanor changed during the relevant time. In fact, during cross-examination Defendants' counsel elicited from Schullere that his testimony and perception of Defendants was based on Plaintiff's allegations, that Schullere has never spoken or met with Defendant Ramphal, and that Schullere never witnessed any of the allegedly discriminatory behavior. Apr. 20 Trial Tr. at 708:13-709:12. Indeed, the jury heard the same statements from Plaintiff himself,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   to which Defendants did not object. The court does not find that allowing the jury to hear these comments from Schullere prejudiced Defendants.

The court addresses the issue of remittitur below, and for the reasons provided there, the jury's actual and punitive damages awards are not excessive as to warrant a new trial.

Defendants raise five grounds in support of this challenge, arguing that: 1) the evidence does not support a finding of race and/or national origin discrimination; 2) the evidence does not support a finding of hostile work environment under Title VII or NYSHRL; 3) the evidence does not support a finding of retaliation; 4) Plaintiff failed to identify any evidence to support an award of punitive damages; and 5) the evidence does not support the jury's award of actual damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants offered the same grounds when moving for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.

Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 348:21-351:6. The jury was free to accept Plaintiff's understanding of the phrase \"you people\" as a phrase having a racial connotation.

At trial, manager Mendonca and human resources manager Troche testified that they were aware of Plaintiff's complaints against Defendant Ramphal as early as 2011,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 58:22-60:7 (Mendonca's testimony), 179:16-182:2 (Troche's testimony), which is enough to impune \"general corporate knowledge\" of Plaintiff's protected activity to the company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gordon v.

It is reasonable to infer that the company received the EEOC Charge when it was sent by the EEOC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Plaintiff also suffered several employment actions that were materially adverse. The jury heard evidence that Plaintiff lost overtime opportunities, was disciplined arbitrarily, transferred to a different department, and accepted a lower salary as a result of Defendant ASR's inaction, and was presented with a last chance agreement that would have prevented Plaintiff from grieving any actions occurring while under Defendant Ramphal's supervision and any actions going forward. Further, and as a result of arbitrary discipline, Plaintiff was demoted to a job in the sanitation department. Plaintiff's demotion to the sanitation department is specifically tied to improper discipline. The jury heard testimony regarding the company's progressive discipline system,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 123:8-18, and that in 2013 Plaintiff reached the last step and, pursuant to the CBA, could have been terminated by his company. The company, instead, transferred Plaintiff to the sanitation department and issued a last chance agreement that would have prohibited Plaintiff from grieving the company's conduct with the union, but which Plaintiff ultimately did not sign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The jury heard Defendants' and Plaintiff's versions of events that led to Plaintiff's transfer to the sanitation department. Defendants' witnesses testified that Plaintiff was properly disciplined in January of 2013 for being a no call/no show,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 124:4-23 (manager Mendonca's testimony regarding the January 2013 incident), 205:18-208:9 (human resources manager Troche's testimony regarding the same incident), and in October of 2013 for failing to load a truck with the correct product,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 228:2-230:12 (human resources manager\n   Troche's testimony regarding the October 2013 incident), and that as a result, reached the last step of the progressive discipline system, warranting his termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 229:4-11. However, according to human resources manager Troche, the company decided not to terminate Plaintiff, given his long career with the company, and instead, as a courtesy, moved Plaintiff to sanitation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 229:15-23. The jury also heard Plaintiff testify that he was wrongly disciplined in January of 2013 because he was never informed that he had to come in for an earlier shift,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 421:22-427:1, that even if he was scheduled to work, company policy directed that he be called to\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   why he was missing from work, which was not done, see Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 427:2-14, that in his experience employees were called and were often not disciplined for the infraction, see Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 427:15-23, and that he spoke with manager Mendonca about the situation, but who conveyed to Plaintiff that company policy had changed and persons scheduled to work, but missing, would no longer be called and be issued an automatic three-day suspension, without specifics as to when the policy changed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 429:20-430:25. The jury also heard Gaffney's testimony regarding this incident, which supported Plaintiff's narrative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 20 Trial Tr. at 629:9-631:11. Plaintiff also testified about the October 2013 discipline, explaining that he was still being trained at that time and that his was not the only name that should have appeared on the loading list, but that \"no one would ever put their name on [the list][,]\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 471:2-16, and that he should have been allowed to look at the truck, but was never allowed to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 471:3-7, 478:3-5. Plaintiff also testified that at the time of the October 2013 discipline, the company's HR department had yet to respond to two of his grievances citing CBA Article 10, although he followed up with shop steward McBean regarding their status,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 479:17-480:3, and that he spoke to manager Mendonca once again about a meeting and she refused.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 471:17-472:19. As a result of the January and October 2013 discipline, Plaintiff was at the termination stage of the progressive discipline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 477:16-478:2, 480:12-25. Plaintiff testified that he was called into a meeting where he was offered a choice to either sign a last chance agreement or be terminated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 481:2-8, 486:24-489:15. He testified that he was told that the last chance agreement would have prevented him from grieving company conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 481:2-8. He further testified that the last chance agreement was withdrawn when a union representative present at the meeting objected to the last chance agreement's content, and that instead Plaintiff was moved to a position in the sanitation department.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 487:9-491:3. Plaintiff also testified that as a result of this meeting he felt like he could not grieve the October discipline,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 481:1-18, and that the sanitation position was at a lower salary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 494:8-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Plaintiff also testified that on February 4, 2014, the same day the EEOC sent the notice of charge of discrimination to the company, he informed, via letter, union representative Chris Dempsey that human resources had yet to respond to the two grievances Plaintiff filed citing CBA Article 10.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 499:23-450:10, 503:3-505:17. Plaintiff's grievances were rejected on February 7, 2014, without an explanation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 505:21-507:1. The factual record before the jury was sufficient to make a finding that\n   Plaintiff suffered materially adverse employment actions that were caused by his attempts to report the allegedly discriminatory behavior. Accordingly, Plaintiff sustained his burden to make out a prima facie case of retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Although Defendants propose legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for the complained of materially adverse employment actions, the factual record before the jury was sufficient to make a finding that retaliation was a but-for factor for the adverse action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the jury could have reasonably concluded that because Plaintiff complained of Defendant Ramphal's treatment, he was improperly disciplined until Plaintiff reached the termination stage of the progressive discipline process and handed the last chance agreement in an attempt to prevent further complaints. The jury, likewise, could have concluded that the discipline was issued so Plaintiff would be moved to the lesser-paying sanitation department position. Further, the jury could have also reasonably inferred that Plaintiff lost overtime opportunities as a result of his complaints, as his yearly income decreased while under Defendant Ramphal's supervision,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 372:3-375:9, and at least on one occasion, Plaintiff was denied holiday pay for his failure to work a shift that he testified he was not noticed to work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 336:22-338:2. Therefore, the factual record before the jury was sufficient to make a finding for Plaintiff on the retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Jury's Award of Punitive Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Defendants argue that the jury's punitive damages award was excessive and unsupported by record evidence, and therefore warrants judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Post-Trial Br. at 36-39. Plaintiff argues that the jury reasonably determined that punitive damages were warranted because Defendants ignored Plaintiff's complaints, tolerated Defendant Ramphal's treatment of Plaintiff despite being notified of its occurrence, refused to hold a meeting with Plaintiff regarding his complaints or process Plaintiff's grievances timely, and did not adequately train its managerial staff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. Br. at 34-38. For the reasons provided below, the court agrees with Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In a Title VII case, the jury can award punitive damages if it determines that the employer, with \"malice\" or \"reckless indifference,\" retaliated or discriminated against an employee's federally protected rights. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a(b)(1) (2012) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tepperwien v.

A plaintiff can demonstrate malice or reckless indifference by presenting evidence that the employer retaliated or discriminated against him with the \"conscious knowledge it was violating the law,\" or of \"egregious\" or \"outrageous\" conduct from which a jury can infer malice or reckless indifference.\n   <em>\n    Farias v.

Reviewing the factual record in its totality, the jury could have reasonably determined that Defendant ASR acted with malice or reckless disregard. The jury could also have reasonably determined that Defendant ASR did not make a good faith effort to comply with its existing anti-discrimination policy. Specifically, the jury heard that although employees alleging discrimination are not required to follow the regular company protocol of first discussing the issue with their supervisors,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 167:6-169:4, Plaintiff's grievances citing CBA Article 10 were not processed for failure to follow standard protocol,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 171:2-172:5, that he was told that before he could file a grievance he needed to discuss his allegations of discrimination with his manager, Mendonca,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 181:13-23, but that Mendonca denied Plaintiff's requests for a meeting,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 61:2-63:14, and instead responded that he should just \"work it out\" with Defendant Ramphal, the very supervisor against whom Plaintiff was complaining.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 360:19-20. The jury also heard testimony that the company did not respond to Plaintiff's grievances citing CBA Article 10 for approximately a year,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 173:11-175:23, and that although manager Mendonca conveyed an intent to discuss Plaintiff's allegations privately with Defendant Ramphal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 63:16-64:23, Defendant Ramphal testified that she did not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 20 Trial Tr. at 833:2-5.

The first document, identified as JX-31, indicates that effective June 27, 2011, Plaintiff's hourly wage went down from $25.34 to $22.73.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 342:4-343:3 (discussing exhibit JX-31, which reproduces an employee status notice and identifies a change in Plaintiff's position and hourly rate, and which was admitted into evidence); Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 219:22-221:10. In 2011, Plaintiff was still employed in the processing department. The second document, identified as JX-18, indicates that effective April 15, 2013,\n   Plaintiff's hourly wage, as a result of Plaintiff's change in position from centrifugal operator to warehouseman, went down from $23.64 to $22.67.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 225:11-227:10 (discussing exhibit JX-18, which reproduces an employee status notice and identifies a change in Plaintiff's position and hourly rate, and which was admitted into evidence).

For the reasons provided below, the court grants Defendants' request for remittitur of the compensatory damages, and denies Defendants' request for remittitur of the actual and punitive damages. On August 15, 2018, the court ruled on Plaintiff's post-trial motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. &amp; Order [on Pl.'s Post-Trial Mots.], Aug. 15, 2018, ECF No. 207 (\"Mem. &amp; Order on Pl.'s Post-Trial Mots.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Allocate Damages &amp; Injunctive Relief at 2-5, May 30, 2018, ECF No. 195. In its memorandum and order, the court granted Plaintiff's post-trial motion to conform the jury's verdict, and ordered the following-allocate $1 of the compensatory damages award to the Title VII claim and allocate the remaining $249,999 of the compensatory damages award to the NYSHRL claim, and allocate the entire punitive damages award to the Title VII claim and reduce the punitive damages award from $2,000,000 to $299,999, in light of Title VII's statutory cap.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. &amp; Order on Pl.'s Post-Trial Mots. at 4. In light of these allocations, the court reviews Defendants' request for remittitur of the compensatory damages under state law, and its request for remittitur of punitive damages under federal law. Further, for the reasons provided below, the court adjusts Plaintiff's damages as follows: $115,000 in compensatory damages under the NYSHRL, $1 in compensatory damages under Title VII, and $299,999 in punitive damages under Title VII. The court does not disturb the jury's actual damages award, and therefore, Plaintiff is awarded $519,000 in total damages. Plaintiff may elect to either accept these amounts or to proceed to a new trial on damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

At trial, the evidence showed a company-wide failure to take seriously Plaintiff's complaints of discrimination, and that Plaintiff was subjected to a demotion and loss of overtime opportunities because he complained. There is evidence on the record supporting a finding that the employer acted maliciously in demoting Plaintiff and issuing improper discipline, while ignoring Plaintiff's complaints regarding Defendant Ramphal's behavior that led to Plaintiff's transfer to a lower-paying position. Plaintiff testified to being improperly disciplined, and as a result, reaching the final step of the progressive discipline system. Subsequently, the company attempted to get Plaintiff to sign a last chance agreement which would have prevented Plaintiff from grieving not only the treatment he endured under the supervision of Defendant Ramphal, but also anything going forward.

Instead, manager Mendonca testified that she told Plaintiff that she would address the issues he brought to her attention with Defendant Ramphal herself and that she did so following every conversation with Plaintiff on this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 63:16-64:23. However, during trial, Defendant Ramphal testified that no one at the company made him aware of Plaintiff's complaints against him until October of 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 20 Trial Tr. at 826:2-828:13.

Human resources manager Troche confirmed that she spoke with manager Mendonca about a meeting, that she knew Plaintiff attempted to set up a meeting with Mendonca and was denied, and that \"any time [Plaintiff] came to [her], [she] would say, you need to speak to Liz [Mendonca] about it.\" Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 181:19-20, 185:9-18. However, Troche also testified that she \"wouldn't condone\" managers refusing a meeting with their employees, upon request, Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 185:6-8, and that although she knew that Plaintiff had already spoken with Mendonca, Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 181:8-182:2, her practice was to \"always refer the employees back to their supervisors or manager to work out the issues.\" Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 181:22-23.

Plaintiff presented evidence that,\n   Defendant ASR never conducted an investigation into Plaintiff's claims, nor followed the procedures outlined in the company's code of conduct. For example, at trial, human resources manager Troche testified that the company's code of conduct allows an employee alleging discrimination to bypass the standard procedure of first reporting a given issue to their supervisor, and can instead report the discrimination directly to human resources.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 167:6-169:4.

The jury also heard testimony that Plaintiff reported Defendant Ramphal's behavior to manager Mendonca and human resources manager Troche and requested a meeting to discuss this behavior, but was denied on several occasions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Apr. 18 Trial Tr. at 61:2-63:14, 171:2-175:17, 180:14-182:12; Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 359:10-372:2. From the actions of Defendant ASR's staff, the jury could appropriately find malice and deceit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The jury also heard about repeated acts of retaliation. Plaintiff testified that he lost overtime after complaining about Defendant Ramphal's conduct, was forced to transfer into a lower-paying position to escape Defendant Ramphal's conduct because his oral complaints and written grievances were rejected or dismissed, and was ultimately demoted to a lower-paying position in sanitation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Apr. 19 Trial Tr. at 372:3-17, 374:7-375:9, 336:8-342:3, 403:24-409:14, 477:16-478:2, 480:12-481:18, 487:1-491:3, 494:8-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The ratio of the punitive damages to the compensatory damages does not violate due process. The jury's award of $2 million in punitive damages and $354,000 in compensatory and actual damages represents a ratio of approximately 5.7 to 1. The court remitted Plaintiff's compensatory damages award to $115,000, and conformed the jury's punitive damages to the statutory cap, i.e., $300,000, less one dollar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. &amp; Order on Pl.'s Post-Trial Mots. at 4. There is little disparity between an award of $299,999 in punitive damages and an award of $219,000 in compensatory and actual damages. Therefore, the punitive damages are \"reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030875\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/408/#p416\">\n    538 U.S. at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030875\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/408/#p416\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Finally, the punitive damages award is reasonable in comparison to awards in comparable cases.

Punitive damages are meant to punish the committed misconduct and serve as deterrence against recommitting the same bad\n   acts in the future.

The two questionnaires were created using questions submitted by the parties. The parties' counsel reviewed the two questionnaires prior to voir dire, raised objections, and after several rounds of discussions agreed on the final versions of the questionnaires that were presented to the prospective juror pool.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Voir Dire Tr. at 6:6-19:25.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    Defendants argue that Prospective Juror 28 made a material omission that, if disclosed, would have resulted in the juror being struck for cause, and that case law supports the ordering of a new trial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Reply Mem.

However, in the present case, there is no evidence that Prospective Juror 28 deliberately omitted information when answering the questionnaire or conversing with the court at sidebar. Further, the cases Defendants rely upon did not order a new trial because of juror misconduct or bias. For example, in\n    <em>\n     Colombo\n    </em>\n    , an empaneled juror falsely answered a question during voir dire regarding whether she knew or was related to anyone who was an attorney and the court remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the juror's brother-in-law was in fact an attorney.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

There are also serious policy concerns regarding the appropriateness of counsel delving into jurors' social media accounts, after the conclusion of trial, to potentially uncover juror statements made out of court and unrelated to the proceedings, and use any discovered statements as evidence of purported juror bias or inability to be fair. Such a practice may decrease willingness to serve on juries or dampen private citizens' ability to engage in civil discourse.

Specifically, the jury could have believed that grievances citing CBA Article 10 were reporting discriminatory behavior by ASR staff, and defined discrimination in a broader sense than a legally cognizable claim of discrimination. Gaffney's belief that CBA Article 10 included all kinds of discrimination, including race and/or national origin discrimination, is evident from his testimony. For example, in response to Defendants' counsel's contention that certain grievances citing CBA Article 10 were unrelated to legally cognizable discrimination claims, Gaffney clearly stated that CBA Article 10 covers all kinds of discrimination and that at least one of the grievances counsel asked about was specifically reporting race and/or national origin discrimination.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Apr. 20 Trial Tr. at 691:11-692:5.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    Defendants also argue that Plaintiff's counsel's questioning of Troche regarding CBA Article 10 confused the jury and improperly elicited testimony regarding the Mayo-Coleman litigation, which the court, in its ruling on the motion in limine, explicitly barred.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.'
