If they could not, civil litigation would not serve its purpose of offering a \"just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 1. Accordingly, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require courts to hold pretrial conferences at which the parties, under the court's supervision, will \"formulat[e] and simplify[ ] the issues.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(c)(2)(A). When the parties make representations at a conference about which issues remain outstanding, they may fairly be held to those oral representations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Genereux v.

P. 41(a)(1)(A)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   These considerations compel the conclusion that, where sophisticated parties to a FOIA case have agreed to narrow the issues in a written status report, they generally may be held to their agreement under traditional waiver principles. Given the volume of FOIA litigation in this District, and the fact that FOIA plaintiffs located anywhere in the country may file here,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B), written status reports often play the same role in FOIA cases as pretrial conferences do in other civil litigation.

Similarly, where a plaintiff agrees in a joint status report not to challenge the adequacy of the government's search, she effectively narrows her request to cover only the documents the government has already located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Here, ACLJ waived the adequacy issue by voluntarily agreeing, in the 9/27/17 Status Report, to narrow the scope of the case. As ACLJ (a sophisticated litigant) no doubt understands, FOIA cases often turn on two issues: the adequacy of the government's search, and the propriety of the government's withholding of responsive material. The 9/27/17 Status Report-which ACLJ's counsel signed electronically and uploaded to the Court's electronic filing system on behalf of both parties-could not have been clearer that, by agreement of the parties, only the second issue remained in dispute. The purpose of the status report was \"to propose an agreed-upon briefing schedule to address\n   <em>\n    the remaining unresolved issues\n   </em>\n   .\" 9/27/17 Status Report at 1 (emphasis added). It explained that the parties had conferred \"in an attempt to address and, if possible, resolve\n   <em>\n    any remaining issues\n   </em>\n   with regards to Plaintiff's FOIA request,\" namely certain \"objectionable withholdings\" ACLJ had identified.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4 (emphasis added). The report further explained that, after reaching an impasse, the parties had \"determined that motions practice [would] be necessary\n   <em>\n    to resolve Plaintiff's remaining objections to Defendant's withholdings\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7 (emphasis added). On the basis of the status report, the Court adopted the parties' proposed briefing schedule by minute order dated October 12, 2017. The report and subsequent order thus left the parties and the Court in agreement on the status of the case: the parties had resolved any dispute over the adequacy of the search and would litigate the only remaining issues (concerning the validity of DOJ's withholdings) in the forthcoming summary judgment motions. In short, by agreeing to limit the Court's involvement to deciding the parties' dispute about DOJ's withholdings, ACLJ knowingly and voluntarily waived all other issues it might reasonably have anticipated, including any challenge to the adequacy of DOJ's search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Even where a waiver is knowing and voluntary, courts will sometimes decline to enforce the waiver where it would be unjust to do so. For example, when a criminal defendant has waived his right to appeal, courts will not enforce the waiver if there is a \"colorable claim\" of \"ineffective assistance of counsel,\" or if a procedural sentencing error \"results in a miscarriage of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Until that time, it claims, it had \"no reason to believe\" that DOJ's search was inadequate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. The Court finds this an unpersuasive basis to let ACLJ escape from its agreement. Adequacy of the government's search is a potential issue in every FOIA case. ACLJ had every opportunity to discuss DOJ's search methodology with DOJ during the meet-and-confer process. And after meeting and conferring, ACLJ represented that it was not challenging DOJ's search. Moreover, there is no suggestion here that DOJ procured ACLJ's agreement by misinforming ACLJ about the scope of its search. In this context, the fact that DOJ failed to produce one particular responsive document is immaterial. Indeed, it is well established that such failures do not render the government's search unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iturralde v.

Thus, there is nothing unjust about holding ACLJ to its prior agreement and finding that it has waived its challenge to the adequacy of DOJ's search, nor is there good cause for allowing ACLJ to reintroduce the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Third, ACLJ asserts that DOJ's redactions under Exemption 5 (apparently including redactions in the 11 specified documents and other documents that neither party has submitted to the Court) generally fail to comply with FOIA's segregability requirement because DOJ has withheld \"factual\" material not protected by the deliberative-process privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 5 n.1; Southerland Decl. \u00b6 3; Pl.'s Reply at 6-8.

While the D.C.

The Court agrees and thinks this conclusion is inescapable: if agency deliberations about public statements were FOIA-able, then agencies would be hamstrung in their dealings with the press, defeating the very transparency FOIA aims to foster. Nonetheless, as another judge in this District has concluded, agencies must provide context about the particular press-related deliberations at issue and cannot rely solely on conclusory labels (such as \"draft press release\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heffernan v.

For example, DOJ has redacted portions of email communications among officials from different DOJ offices-the Office of the Attorney General, Office of Legislative Affairs, and Office of Press Affairs-discussing how to respond to particular media inquiries identified in the unredacted text.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Ex.

In another email chain, officials from the Office of the Attorney General discuss providing \"guidance\" to the FBI about a similar press inquiry; the content of this guidance is redacted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17 (document 0.7.9269.5280).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   DOJ's declarant confirms that the redactions cover portions of emails that \"evaluate and analyze press coverage and make recommendations and/or consider possible options in responding to press and other inquiries.\" Brinkmann Decl. \u00b6 14.

ACLJ argues that the deliberative-process privilege, which is qualified, is overcome here by the public's need for the information. Pl.'s Br. at 10-11. This argument fails as a matter of law.

An employee from the Office of the Attorney General reported that Attorney General Lynch \"stuck to the talking points\" at the June 28 press conference.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40 (document 0.7.9269.5166). On June 29, the Director of DOJ's Office of Press Affairs forwarded the talking points to an official in the Office of Legislative Affairs, noting that \"OLA is going to get questions about this and I think the talking points we drafted will be useful for your purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. The Director also subsequently forwarded the talking points to other employees alongside the transcripts of press appearances by Attorney General Lynch on June 28 and June 29.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-13 (documents 0.7.9269.6298 and 0.7.9269.6923). The talking points are fully redacted in each of these iterations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   ACLJ asserts that many versions of the talking points, in particular the \"final\" versions and versions that were shared after the Attorney General's remarks, were not predecisional. Pl.'s Br. at 7-8; Pl.'s Reply at 4-6. This argument fails to appreciate the nature of talking points generally and the particular context surrounding the June 28 talking points. Talking points are typically documents \"prepared by [government] employees for the consideration of [government] decision-makers.\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9179841\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/337/146/#p174\">\n    337 F.Supp.2d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174 (D.D.C. 2004). There may be some circumstances where \"talking points\" are intended by agency decisionmakers to be followed literally such that they, in and of themselves, represent the agency's decision about what to say. But the \"final\" version of talking points prepared by more junior staffers for a more senior official is rarely the final decision about what the senior official will say.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU v. DHS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149636\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/738/93/#p111\">\n    738 F.Supp.2d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 111-12 (D.D.C. 2010) (concluding that \"final\" talking points fell within deliberative-process privilege). Rather, a senior official-especially one as high-ranking as the Attorney General-may elect to use all, some, or none of the talking points prepared for her. Perhaps to the chagrin of their junior staffers, senior officials have a tendency to improvise. And even when senior officials do follow their talking points, they often do not recite the points word-for-word. The particular factual context surrounding the June 28 talking points, which were written for Attorney General Lynch but concerned events she had personally witnessed, strongly suggests that the talking points were no more than advice from subordinates. The final decision was what Attorney General Lynch actually said to the media, which is, of course, already a matter of public record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Nor does the subsequent use of the talking points modify this analysis. The point of the deliberative-process privilege is to protect internal agency deliberations; it would make no sense for the privilege to turn on whether the internal advice was ultimately followed. As the D.C. Circuit has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [T]he writer [of a draft] does not know at the time of writing whether the draft will evolve into a final document. But the\n   writer needs to know at the time of writing that the privilege will apply and that the draft will remain confidential, in order for the writer to feel free to provide candid analysis. A privilege contingent on later events-such as whether the draft ultimately evolved into a final agency position-would be an uncertain privilege, and as the Supreme Court has said, an uncertain privilege is \"little better than no privilege at all.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Sec.

That is, the deliberative-process privilege should be judged based on the purpose of the document when it was created, not in hindsight. The privilege over a predecisional document is \"waived\" only when the agency publishes the document or expressly adopts the document's reasoning as its own.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elec. Frontier Found. v. DOJ\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324329,4085580\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/739/1/\">\n    739 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10-12 (D.C. Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Applied here, these principles mean that the talking points remain protected even though Attorney General Lynch followed them and even though they were repurposed for other press inquiries. A government employee drafting talking points to advise a senior official needs to know that her advice will remain privileged regardless of whether the official ultimately sticks to the script or decides to extemporize. It is accordingly of no moment that Attorney General Lynch ultimately \"stuck to the talking points\"-the point is that she might not have. And given that talking points are typically used on the fly, it would rarely be the case that an official formally \"adopts\" talking points simply by relying on them; certainly, no facts suggest that to be true here. Moreover, sticking to talking points often does not entail a verbatim recitation, leaving open the possibility that \"a simple comparison\" of the talking points with the official's public remarks would reveal the agency's deliberations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mapother v.

Cir. 1993). Finally, the mere fact that the June 28 talking points were forwarded in later emails does not deprive them of protection. \"Post-decisional documents properly fall under the deliberative[-]process privilege when they recount or reflect pre-decisional deliberations.\"\n   <em>\n    Am. Immigration Council v.

In particular, the Court has no basis to assess whom the talking points were drafted for, how they were used, or what their subject matter was (apart from the fact that they somehow related to the airplane meeting). Thus, DOJ has not provided \"the minimum facts needed for the invocation of the deliberative process privilege.\"\n   <em>\n    Heffernan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525941\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/94/#p125\">\n    317 F.Supp.3d at 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The second document, bearing control number 0.7.9269.6094, is an email chain dated June 30, 2016.

It is possible that they are-for example, the employees may have been discussing how to respond to similar requests in the future. Nonetheless, the information provided to the Court is insufficient to make that determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will grant summary judgment to DOJ on this issue, except that it will order DOJ to file a supplemental declaration and renewed motion for summary judgment regarding documents 0.7.9269.5105 and 0.7.9269.6094.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Segregability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   ACLJ has also challenged DOJ's compliance with FOIA's segregability requirement. Segregability is adjudicated using a burden-shifting framework. Agencies must provide a \"detailed justification\" for the non-segregability of the withheld information, although not \"so much detail that the exempt material would be effectively disclosed.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Exec. Office for U.S. Att'ys\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11429257,3700614\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/310/771/\">\n    310 F.3d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 776 (D.C.

Agencies typically meet their initial burden by providing a\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index and \"a declaration attesting that the agency released all segregable material.\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

Pl.'s Br. at 5 n.1; Pl.'s Reply at 7 n.6.

The declarations also explain that, in the talking points and press statements, factual content was generally intertwined with the advice being given and thus could not be segregated. Brinkman Decl. \u00b6 18; Second Brinkman Decl. \u00b6 32. The Court concludes that this showing is sufficient to trigger the presumption in favor of compliance with FOIA's segregability requirement.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Juarez v.

DOJ has asserted that this is the case here. It explains that attempting to carve out the \"factual\" material from the talking points and other documents at issue would disclose its internal deliberations regarding how to respond to media inquiries. Brinkman Decl. \u00b6 18; Second Brinkman Decl. \u00b6 32. The Court finds this at least plausible, and perhaps even compelling. Communications with media often consist of nothing more than a judicious selection and presentation of facts. Thus, releasing \"factual\" material from talking points would almost inevitably reveal the agency's deliberations on how to present those facts.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elec.
