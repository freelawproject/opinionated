ROBRENO, District Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In this action, a labor union, the union's pension trust fund, and the trustee for the fund have brought claims against a commercial cleaning company under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, alleging that the company failed to make contributions to the pension fund, as required by the collective bargaining agreement between the company and the union. Plaintiffs seek either the unpaid installment amounts or a single-sum liability amount. After Defendant failed to appear, plead, or defend against Plaintiffs' complaint, the clerk entered default. Plaintiffs now move for entry of judgment by default. The Court held a hearing, at which Defendant did not appear. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' motion, enter judgment, and close the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Plaintiffs provided notice, as required under ERISA, and Defendant failed to cure the default within 60 days and continued to fail to pay withdrawal liability. Given that the allegations are accepted as true at this stage and that they establish Defendant's liability, there does not appear to be a litigable defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   With respect to culpable conduct, the final factor, it does not appear that Defendant has committed any bad faith conduct aside from simply failing to respond to the action. The Third Circuit has explained that \"culpable conduct\" is conduct that is \"taken willfully or in bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Gross v. Stereo Component Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844703\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/700/120/#p123\">\n    700 F.2d 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 123-24 (3d Cir. 1983). Plaintiffs have not provided any record evidence that Defendant's actions were in bad faith, but Defendant's failure to respond to the complaint and failure to attend the hearing were both \"willful,\" in the sense that Defendant accepted service of the complaint and the order setting the hearing and therefore was aware of the complaint and the hearing. To this date, Defendant still has not responded to Plaintiffs' Complaint, entered an appearance, or participated in this action in any way, despite having accepted service through the registered agent for service of process on the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On balance, the\n   <em>\n    Chamberlain\n   </em>\n   factors support the entry of default judgment in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Having determined that Plaintiffs are entitled to the entry of default judgment, the Court must calculate the proper amount of damages and attorneys' costs and fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In support of their motion, Plaintiffs have submitted an affidavit by their attorney explaining the calculation of Defendant's withdrawal liability as $152,836.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Certification of Amount Due in Support of Application for Default Judgment, ECF No. 5-3. The Court accepts this amount as adequately supported by Plaintiffs' counsel's certification, and unchallenged by Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Pursuant to Section 1132(g) of ERISA, Plaintiffs are entitled to (1) the full amount of the unpaid contributions; (2) interest on the unpaid contributions; (3) the greater of interest on the unpaid contributions or liquidated damages provided for under the plan in an amount not in excess of 20 percent; (4) reasonable attorney's fees and costs of the action, and (5) such other legal or equitable relief as the Court deems appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2). Section 1132(g) also provides that interest on unpaid contributions shall be determined by using the rate specified by the plan, or, if none, the rate prescribed by the IRS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here, the unpaid contribution is equal to the amount of withdrawal liability, which is $152,836.00. The Plan provides that interest accrues at the rate charged by the IRS under Section 6621(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is 4 percent, plus one\n   additional percentage point, which results in an interest rate of 5 percent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Default J. Ex. A at 1 \u00b6 2, ECF No. 5-2. Under Section 1399 of ERISA, interest is calculated from the date that the first payment was not made, which in this case was October 23, 2017. The amount of interest due is therefore $5,590.03. Regarding liquidated damages, the Plan provides that if a delinquent contribution is not paid, the Trustees will assess liquidated damages in an amount equal to 15 percent of the delinquent contribution. Here, that amount is $22,925.40 (15 percent of $152,836). As the liquidated damages amount is greater than the interest due, pursuant to Section 1132(g)(2)(C), liquidated damages are awarded in addition to interest. Thus, the total amount of damages is $181,351.43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, under Section 1132(g), Plaintiffs are entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2)(D). Plaintiffs assert that their attorneys' fees and costs total $6,678.00 (consisting of $6,018.00 in attorneys' fees and $660.00 in costs). Plaintiffs based their calculation on a rate of $200.00 per hour for attorneys and $110.00 per hour for paralegals, which the Court finds reasonable in light of the prevailing market rates in the community.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rode v. Dellarciprete\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529587\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/892/1177/#p1183\">\n    892 F.2d 1177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1183 (3d Cir. 1990). The Court also finds that the number of hours billed is reasonable in light of the work required in this case. Therefore, under the lodestar approach, see\n   <em>\n    Hahnemann Univ. Hosp. v. All Shore, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048845\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/300/#p310\">\n    514 F.3d 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 310 (3d Cir. 2008), the attorneys' fees are reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' motion for entry of judgment by default, enter judgment for Plaintiffs and against Defendant in the amount of $188,029.43, together with post-judgment interest to run thereon at the rate of 4 percent from the date hereof until paid, and close the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   An appropriate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW\n   </strong>\n   , this\n   <strong>\n    7th\n   </strong>\n   day of\n   <strong>\n    September, 2018,\n   </strong>\n   for the reasons set forth in the accompanying memorandum, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   1.

To the extent the\n    <em>\n     Chamberlain\n    </em>\n    factors are \"counterintuitive\" where a defendant has not appeared in the action, they are still the law in the Third Circuit, and the Court is bound to apply them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
