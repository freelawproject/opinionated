COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Robert Belt thinks the District of Columbia Public School System (\"DCPS\") has sold his granddaughter J.B. short. In\n   Belt's view, DCPS has not done enough to ensure that J.B.-who was diagnosed first with a learning disability and later an intellectual disability-makes appropriate academic progress at her public elementary school. Belt and J.B. (collectively, \"plaintiffs\") sought remedies through the proper administrative channels, but an administrative hearing officer denied their requests. Believing the hearing officer got it wrong, plaintiffs filed this federal lawsuit in June 2017. They claim that DCPS violated J.B.'s right to a \"free appropriate public education\" (\"FAPE\") under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, they allege that DCPS failed to develop an adequate Individualized Education Program (\"IEP\") for J.B. and failed to comply with the terms of the IEPs it did produce. To right these alleged wrongs, plaintiffs want DCPS to subsidize J.B.'s placement in a non-public school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs moved for judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment; the District responded with its own motion for summary judgment. The Court referred the motions to Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey, who recommended that the Court deny Belt's motions and grant the District's. Plaintiffs then filed objections to the recommendation, and the District responded to those objections. After a fresh review of the magistrate judge's work and plaintiffs' objections, the Court adopts the magistrate judge's recommendation and will grant summary judgment in the District's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The complaint alleged that DCPS had denied J.B. a FAPE by failing to (1) include a special education teacher in J.B.'s IEP planning meetings; (2) develop an IEP in October 2016 and January 2017 that was reasonably calculated to provide educational benefits; (3) identify an appropriate location of services; and (4) implement J.B.'s IEPs effectively given that she had made minimal or no academic progress from October 2014 to January 2017.

For relief, plaintiffs sought funding to subsidize J.B.'s placement\n   at a non-public school and enrollment in an extended-school-year program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   An administrative due process hearing took place in March 2017, at which plaintiffs presented four witnesses and the District another two. AR Exs. 3-6; R &amp; R at 3. Shortly thereafter, the hearing officer determined that DCPS had fulfilled its obligation to provide J.B. with a FAPE and denied plaintiffs' requested relief. AR Exh. 1 at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This lawsuit challenges that administrative determination. The plaintiffs moved for judgment on the pleadings and for summary judgment. The District opposed both motions and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The Court referred these motions to Magistrate Judge Harvey, who issued his R &amp; R on May 5, 2018, recommending summary judgment in the District's favor. Plaintiffs timely filed their objections to the R &amp; R, the District has responded, and the matter is now ripe for the Court's resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Objections\") at 2. The Court takes them in the order plaintiffs present them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The R &amp; R Gives Inadequate Attention to J.B.'s Present Levels of Performance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs first object that the R &amp; R paid too little attention to the IEPs' present-levels-of-performance sections, which are supposed to-but according to the plaintiffs, did not-document J.B.'s current achievement in various academic categories. Pls.' Objections at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument fails for two reasons. First, it is incorrect on the facts: as the magistrate judge documented, the IEPs do estimate J.B.'s current achievement and document her progress. To take just one example-one highlighted in the R &amp; R-the January 2017 IEP noted that J.B. was \"able to write and copy simple words and sentences with good letter to baseline alignment\" and remarked that she \"has improved since the previous years.\" AR Exh. 2 at 170; see R &amp; R at 37 (discussing January 2017 IEP). Second, even assuming the IEPs were deficient in documenting J.B.'s present performance, plaintiffs must show that this procedural shortcoming led to some substantive denial in the form of a lower-quality education.\n   <em>\n    Lesesne ex rel. B.F. v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3455596,5860231\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/447/828/\">\n    447 F.3d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 834 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (collecting cases that stand for this proposition). Plaintiffs come up short in this regard. While they contend generally that an IEP cannot be tailored appropriately to the needs of the individual student without adequately documenting the student's current achievement levels, Pls.' Objections at 18, they do not show that any purported inattention to J.B.'s present performance led to J.B.'s halting academic progress. The Court therefore overrules plaintiffs' first objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The R &amp; R Misapplies the Spoliation or \"Missing-Evidence\" Rule\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs next complain that the R &amp; R mistakenly rejected their \"missing-evidence\n   rule\" argument.

Plaintiffs assert that DCPS had control over additional evidence regarding J.B.'s academic progress (or lack thereof) but chose not to introduce it into the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3455596,5860231\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/447/828/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That obfuscation, plaintiffs contend, should compel the Court to draw an adverse inference against the District. But for the same reasons the R &amp; R rejected this argument-most importantly, that the District was under no obligation to provide the alleged missing evidence during the administrative hearing-the Court overrules plaintiffs' second objection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 39-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The R &amp; R Overlooks Defendant's Intentional and Deceptive Practices\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the District answered their complaint with bad-faith evasions. Pls.' Objections at 20. As with plaintiffs' spoliation argument, the Court cannot improve on the R &amp; R's analysis of this claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 25. In short, even assuming that the District's answer were improperly evasive-a proposition for which the Court finds little evidence-the plaintiffs cannot show that any harm came of it.\n   <em>\n    G.G. ex rel.

This time they take aim at the District's written notice of proposed changes to J.B.'s January 2017 IEP. Pls.' Objections at 21-22. Plaintiffs argue that the written notice failed to accurately depict and respond to Mr. Belt's concerns about J.B.'s education.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328004\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/924/273/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here again, even assuming that the District mischaracterized Mr. Belt's concerns in the notice, plaintiffs still must show that somehow led to a substantive denial of a FAPE.

They argue that Mr. Belt was denied the opportunity to adequately participate in the decision-making process regarding J.B.'s education, and that this led to J.B. being denied a FAPE. Pls.' Objections at 22-23. Plaintiffs' best evidence is Mr. Belt's absence from the October 2016 IEP meeting. Yet here, too, the R &amp; R correctly rejected plaintiffs' argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 27-28.

But the Court acknowledges the intuition behind plaintiffs' argument: if DCPS truly were crafting effective IEPs for J.B., and if it were indeed providing J.B. with a FAPE, one would expect the 2017 IEP to look meaningfully different from the 2014 iteration. With time comes progress, one hopes, and that progress should manifest itself in evolving IEPs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Even so, the R &amp; R thoughtfully accounted for the slight changes over J.B.'s four IEPs.

AR Exh. 2 at 80. In addition, the R &amp; R emphasized that there is no freestanding rule that IEPs evolve in any particular manner; rather, each individual IEP should be judged by whether it is \"reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress in light of the child's particular circumstances.\" R &amp; R at 42 (citing\n   <em>\n    Endrew F. v.

Plaintiffs appear to believe that fact alone establishes that J.B. was denied a FAPE, especially in light of\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Objections at 26. The R &amp; R concluded otherwise, R &amp; R at 40-43, and the Court agrees. In short, limited academic progress does not\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   signal a violation of the IDEA any more so than does the existence of substantially similar IEPs year over year. Magistrate Judge Harvey amply addressed plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   argument; the Court offers only this brief postscript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It is important to clarify what the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   did and did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   do. In\n   <em>\n    Endrew\n   </em>\n   , the Court rejected the Tenth Circuit's rule that \"a child's IEP is adequate so long as it is calculated to confer an 'educational benefit [that is] merely ... more than\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   .' \"\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610008\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/988/#p999\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (citation omitted). Because that was an improper interpretation of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Rowley\n   </em>\n   , the Court vacated the Tenth Circuit's decision and remanded the case for consideration of its facts under the correct legal standard: \"To meet its substantive obligation under the IDEA, a school must offer an IEP reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child's circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610008\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/988/#p999\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Now what\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   did not do. It did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   hold that any time a child makes limited, or even zero, progress, that a school system has necessarily failed to provide a FAPE and violated the IDEA.\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   may have held that a school system cannot satisfy its statutory obligation\n   <em>\n    merely\n   </em>\n   by pointing to something beyond\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   progress; but it did not say that the presence of only\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   progress (or even less than that) equates to an IDEA violation. So while\n   <em>\n    Endrew F.\n   </em>\n   clarified the appropriate legal standard for a challenge like this one, it certainly does not stand for the proposition that any time a child makes negligible (or uneven) academic progress, the school system has violated the IDEA. Indeed, on remand, the Tenth Circuit could reach the same result-rejecting the student's IDEA challenge-that it did the first time around, so long as it does so under the correct legal rubric.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here, though, both the hearing officer and the R &amp; R applied the correct test.

The District has already addressed those arguments and will not repeat those responses here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that DCPS had low expectations of J.B. because of her disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Pl's Obj. at 27-29. Plaintiff's argument is meritless because its premise is untrue. While DCPS recognized that J.B.'s Full Scale IQ of 59 was clear evidence of her limited cognitive abilities, there is record evidence that DCPS believed that J.B. could excel in some areas if she was given the opportunity. Ms. Freeman testified she'd like for J.B. to be exposed to the general education curriculum in history and science because she believed J.B. was capable of doing more in those areas with fewer special education modifications to the curriculum. AR at 484. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, were seeking a more restrictive special education environment for J.B. where she would only be exposed to disabled peers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The R&amp;R provides a thorough analysis of\n   <em>\n    Endrew F\n   </em>\n   . and Plaintiff's argument concerning low expectations. R&amp;R at 40-43. The R&amp;R concluded that the IEP was appropriate because it considered J.B.'s unique circumstances. Plaintiff's Objection should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   For the reasons previously stated, Plaintiff's Objections should be rejected by the Court, and Judge Harvey's April 25, 2016 Report and Recommendation should be adopted by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Dated: June 5, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    The details of these IEPs, the meetings surrounding them, and documentation of J.B.'s academic progress are discussed more fully in the R &amp; R.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    R &amp; R at 3-14.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    The D.C. Circuit has cautioned that, because the reviewing court can hear evidence not considered in the administrative proceeding, less deference ought to be accorded to IDEA determinations than is typical in other administrative contexts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Reid\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3440240,9173870\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/516/\">\n     401 F.3d at 521\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
