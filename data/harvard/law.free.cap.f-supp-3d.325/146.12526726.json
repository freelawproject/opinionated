First, Congress may limit Eleventh Amendment immunity by statute if it \"unequivocally expresse[s] its intent to abrogate that immunity\" and acts within its constitutional authority.\n      <em>\n       Kimel v.

So the question that the Motion to Dismiss presents is whether Ms. Slack has shown an\n     abrogation or waiver of WMATA's sovereign immunity from suit under the False Claims Act, or FCA, and under the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act, or DCWPA.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      <strong>\n       A.

As noted above, Congress can only abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity if it \"unequivocally expresse[s] its intent to abrogate that immunity\" and acts within its constitutional authority.\n      <em>\n       Kimel\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476145\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/62/#p73\">\n       528 U.S. at 73\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476145\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/62/#p73\">\n       120 S.Ct. 631\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .

Opp. to Mot. Dismiss 16-24. To support this view, she points out that Virginia and Maryland law mirrors District of Columbia law in three ways. First, each jurisdiction prohibits employers from retaliating against whistleblowers. Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3011(A)-(C) ; Md. State Personnel &amp; Pensions Code \u00a7 5-305 ;\n      <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-223.02\">\n       D.C. Code \u00a7 2-223.02\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . Second, each jurisdiction provides whistleblowers who have suffered retaliation a cause of action that allows them to go to court and sue for reinstatement, back pay, and attorney's fees. Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3011(D) ; Md. State Personnel &amp; Pensions Code \u00a7\u00a7 5-310(e), 5-311 ;\n      <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202-223.03\">\n       D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2-223.03\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (a). Third, Ms. Slack argues, and WMATA does not dispute, that each jurisdiction recognizes WMATA as one of its instrumentalities and applies its whistleblower protection statutes to its instrumentalities. Opp. to Mot. Dismiss 19-22. Ms. Slack concludes that Virginia and Maryland have waived their immunity against whistleblower retaliation claims and, with it, WMATA's immunity against suit under the DCWPA.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202-223.03\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202-223.03\">\n       at 23\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-37\">\n      But this line of argument fails for at least two reasons.\n      <em>\n       First\n      </em>\n      , the DCWPA does not apply to WMATA by its own terms. The DCWPA states that it \"shall apply to employees of the WMATA when the Commonwealth of Virginia and the State of Maryland enact similar provisions for WMATA whistleblowers.\"\n      <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202-223.07\">\n       D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2-223.07\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . Ms. Slack argues that Virginia triggered this provision by enacting its Fraud and Abuse Whistle Blower Protection Act in 2009. Opp. to Mot. Dismiss 24. But Ms. Slack has not shown that Maryland has made any relevant change to its whistleblower protection law since the DCWPA's enactment. Nor has she shown that either Virginia or Maryland has a whistleblower statute \"similar\" to the DCWPA in its provision \"for WMATA whistleblowers.\" Unlike the DCWPA, which explicitly addresses WMATA's liability for whistleblower retaliation consistent with the requirement that a statutory waiver must be clear and unequivocal, Virginia and Maryland law is silent on WMATA's liability. For both these reasons, Ms. Slack has failed to carry her burden of showing that the DCWPA applies to WMATA.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-38\">\n      <em>\n       Second\n      </em>\n      , consent to suit under one whistleblower protection law is not consent to suit under all whistleblower protection laws. Perhaps District law could apply to WMATA if Virginia and Maryland had enacted identical statutes clearly consenting to suit.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Feeney\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634142\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/299/#p305\">\n       495 U.S. at 306-07\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634142\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/299/#p305\">\n       110 S.Ct. 1868\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . But where each jurisdiction has enacted a different statute, the fact that the statutes address the same subject matter only increases the likelihood that applying one jurisdiction's laws to WMATA could upset the other jurisdictions' policy judgments.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Hellmuth\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872232\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/414/408/\">\n       414 F.Supp. at 409-10\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (holding that the Maryland Public Information Act did not apply to WMATA although Virginia and the District\n     of Columbia had enacted comparable freedom of information laws).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-39\">\n      A few examples will highlight the substantive differences between each jurisdiction's law. First, each jurisdiction places different conditions on whistleblower protection. Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3011(A)-(C) (protecting employees who make a disclosure in good faith); Md. State Personnel &amp; Pensions Code \u00a7 5-306 (excluding employees who make disclosures prohibited by law-presumably Maryland and federal law-except if made to the Maryland Attorney General under another Maryland statute);\n      <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202-223.01\">\n       D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2-223.01\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (10) (protecting any employee who is \"perceived to have made a protected disclosure\"). Second, each jurisdiction places different conditions on access to court. Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3011(D) (permitting a whistleblower to sue without exhausting administrative remedies); Md. State Personnel &amp; Pensions Code \u00a7 5-310(e) (requiring a whistleblower to exhaust administrative remedies before suing);\n      <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202-223.05\">\n       D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2-223.05\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (requiring a whistleblower who sues in court to give up an administrative remedy). Third, each jurisdiction provides different consequences for whistleblower retaliation. Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3011(D) (requiring civil penalty between $500 and $2,500); Md. State Personnel &amp; Pensions Code \u00a7\u00a7 5-309(e), 5-311 (authorizing specific forms of relief for the plaintiff and \"any other appropriate relief\" but not expressly contemplating any civil fine);\n      <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202-223.04\">\n       D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2-223.04\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (b) (providing for civil fine not to exceed $1,000). Given these differences, Virginia and Maryland's consent to suit under their own whistleblower laws falls far short of an express or unavoidably implied consent to suit under the DCWPA.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Feeney\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634142\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/299/#p305\">\n       495 U.S. at 305\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634142\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/299/#p305\">\n       110 S.Ct. 1868\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n      <footnotemark>\n       5\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-40\">\n      <strong>\n       D. The WMATA Compact Does Not Waive Sovereign Immunity from DCWPA Lawsuits\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-41\">\n      Ms. Slack argues that Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia have made a clear declaration of consent to suit by contractually waiving WMATA's immunity from whistleblower retaliation claims. Opp. to Mot. Dismiss 16-19. But this argument depends on the idea that their course of conduct has modified the WMATA Compact.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 17. And the course of conduct to which Ms. Slack points is \"passing similar legislation.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 16;\n      <em>\n       see also\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      at 18. The only textual hook that Ms. Slack provides for her contract argument that could distinguish it from her statutory waiver argument is a provision in the Compact allowing amendment by legislative action \"concurred in by all the others.\"\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       id\n      </em>\n      at 17-18. But she has not shown how Virginia and Maryland concurred in the amendment to the WMATA Compact proposed by the DCWPA. So Ms. Slack's contract argument merges with the statutory waiver argument and fails for the same reasons.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-43\">\n      Other judges of this District have already held that the DCWPA does not apply to WMATA, including at least one decision rendered after Virginia allegedly triggered the DCWPA's application by passing its whistleblower protection statute.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-46\">\n      For the reasons stated above, WMATA's Motion to Dismiss Counts I and III of the Complaint will be granted.
