U.S. Const. amend. XI (\"The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\"); <em>see also</em> <em>Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of.

As Ms. Slack appears to concede, when Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia created WMATA, they conferred their sovereign immunity upon it. <em>Morris v. WMATA</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3605531,1536211\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/781/218/\">781 F.2d 218</extracted-citation>, 219-220 (D.C. Cir. 1986).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-14\">But there are two primary exceptions to WMATA's Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>Barbour v. WMATA</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3429131,9239964\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1161/\">374 F.3d 1161</extracted-citation>, 1163 (D.C. Cir. 2004). First, Congress may limit Eleventh Amendment immunity by statute if it \"unequivocally expresse[s] its intent to abrogate that immunity\" and acts within its constitutional authority. <em>Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476145\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/62/#p73\">528 U.S. 62</extracted-citation>, 73, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476145\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/62/#p73\">120 S.Ct. 631</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476145\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/62/#p73\">145 L.Ed.2d 522</extracted-citation> (2000). Second, a state may voluntarily waive its immunity by making a \"clear declaration\" that it intends to submit itself to a federal court's jurisdiction. <em>Coll. Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ.

So the question that the Motion to Dismiss presents is whether Ms. Slack has shown an <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"152\" href=\"#p152\" id=\"p152\">*152</a>abrogation or waiver of WMATA's sovereign immunity from suit under the False Claims Act, or FCA, and under the District of Columbia Whistleblower Protection Act, or DCWPA.</p><p id=\"p-15\"><strong>A. The FCA Does Not Abrogate Eleventh Amendment Immunity</strong></p><p id=\"p-16\">Count III of Ms. Slack's Complaint alleges whistleblower retaliation in violation of the FCA and can proceed only if Ms. Slack shows that the FCA applies to WMATA. As noted above, Congress can only abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity if it \"unequivocally expresse[s] its intent to abrogate that immunity\" and acts within its constitutional authority. <em>Kimel</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476145\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/62/#p73\">528 U.S. at 73</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476145\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/62/#p73\">120 S.Ct. 631</extracted-citation>. Because \"abrogation of sovereign immunity upsets the fundamental constitutional balance between the Federal Government and the States,\" courts apply a \"stringent\" test to claims of abrogation, requiring that Congress make its intention \"unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.\" <em>Dellmuth v. Muth</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212005\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/223/#p227\">491 U.S. 223</extracted-citation>, 227-28, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212005\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/223/#p227\">109 S.Ct. 2397</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212005\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/223/#p227\">105 L.Ed.2d 181</extracted-citation> (1989). A statute could satisfy this test by providing that the states \"shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States from suit in Federal court for a violation.\" <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212005\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/223/#p227\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212005\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/223/#p227\"> at 229-30</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212005\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/223/#p227\">109 S.Ct. 2397</extracted-citation>. But even a statute that anticipates suits against states and provides for suit in federal courts fails to satisfy this test if it \"makes no reference whatsoever to either the Eleventh Amendment or the States' sovereign immunity.\" <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212005\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/223/#p227\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212005\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/223/#p227\"> at 231-32</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212005\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/223/#p227\">109 S.Ct. 2397</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-17\">The FCA's whistleblower retaliation provision provides:</p><p id=\"p-18\">Any employee, contractor, or agent shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make that employee, contractor, or agent whole, if that employee, contractor, or agent is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment because of lawful acts done by the employee, contractor, agent or associated others in furtherance of an action under this section or other efforts to stop [one] or more violations of this subchapter.</p><p id=\"p-19\"><extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730</extracted-citation>(h). Ms. Slack argues that this provision abrogates Eleventh Amendment immunity by authorizing lawsuits against employers that retaliate against whistleblowers without excluding employers that are state governmental entities. Opp. to Mot. Dismiss 6-12.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But WMATA challenges this view on two grounds.</p><p id=\"p-20\"><em>First</em> , WMATA argues that the FCA authorizes a lawsuit only against a legal person, which excludes any state agency. Memo. ISO Mot. Dismiss 6-8; Reply ISO Mot. Dismiss 8. According to WMATA, the Supreme Court has already decided this question by holding that state agencies are not persons liable to suit under the FCA's <em>qui tam</em> provision. <em>See</em> <em>Vt. Agency of Nat. Res. v. United States ex rel. Stevens</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/#p787\">529 U.S. 765</extracted-citation>, 787, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/#p787\">120 S.Ct. 1858</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/#p787\">146 L.Ed.2d 836</extracted-citation> (2000). But the FCA has other provisions authorizing other types of lawsuits. Indeed, <em>Stevens</em> noted that another provision of the FCA that enables the Attorney General to issue civil investigative demands explicitly includes states within its ambit. <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/#p787\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/#p787\"> at 783-84</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/#p787\">120 S.Ct. 1858</extracted-citation>.

WMATA's interpretation of the FCA lacks textual support and is at least in tension with the only interpretation of the whistleblower provision by a federal court of appeals that the parties have cited. <em>See</em> <em>Wilkins v. St. Louis Hous. Auth.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9385391\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/314/927/#p931\">314 F.3d 927</extracted-citation>, 931-32 (8th Cir. 2002) (holding that FCA's whistleblower provision applied to public employer).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-21\"><em>Second</em> , WMATA argues that, even if the FCA could apply to the states, it does not unequivocally express an intent to abrogate sovereign immunity.

Notably, Ms. Slack bears the burden of establishing the Court's jurisdiction but cites no precedent to show that Congress can use its spending power to demand that a state waive its Eleventh Amendment rights without the type of clear congressional statement required by <em>Barbour</em> . She has not shown that Congress, by a silent, implicit delegation of authority, can open the door for expansions of federal power that it otherwise could not have accomplished without satisfying a stringent clear-statement rule. <em>Cf.</em> <em>FDA v.

The second reason is that WMATA's recognition of federal law and its applicability could easily exclude FCA liability since federal law itself would not apply the FCA to WMATA. <em>See</em> <em>Barbour</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3429131,9239964\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/1161/\">374 F.3d at 1163</extracted-citation> (requiring clear declaration of consent to suit). The third reason is that nothing in WMATA's contract with the FTA unequivocally grants third parties like Ms. Slack a right to sue WMATA. <em>See</em> <em>Sossamon</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225560,12458764\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/277/\">563 U.S. at 284</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225560,12458764\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/277/\">131 S.Ct. 1651</extracted-citation> (construing waivers narrowly).</p><p id=\"p-28\"><em>Second</em> , Ms. Slack points to language in the FTA Master Agreement requiring recipients of federal funds to \"comply <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"155\" href=\"#p155\" id=\"p155\">*155</a>with applicable Federal civil rights laws,\" including \"applicable Federal nondiscrimination laws,\" and warning recipients that remedies for civil rights violations could be enforced as provided by federal law. Opp. to Mot. Dismiss 14-15. These contractual provisions are too broad to constitute a clear consent to suit under the FCA, particularly since none of WMATA's enumerated civil rights obligations relate to discrimination based on whistleblower activity. <em>See</em> <em>Sossamon</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225560,12458764\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/277/\">563 U.S. at 292</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225560,12458764\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/277/\">131 S.Ct. 1651</extracted-citation> (construing general words in light of specifically enumerated examples). And the contract's reference to applicable laws and the remedies they authorize does not make the FCA applicable to entities like WMATA that enjoy sovereign immunity. Finally, as noted above, WMATA's contract with the FTA does not clearly convey rights to third parties. So neither the civil rights provisions of the FTA Master Agreement nor the civil fraud provisions establishes waiver.</p><p id=\"p-29\"><em>Third</em> , Ms. Slack asserts that the FTA expects WMATA to comply with a 45-page list of federal laws including the FCA. Pl.'s Sur-Reply 2. But Ms. Slack supports this claim only by attaching a 45-page list of laws. Nothing in the record shows why the FTA would expect WMATA to comply with these laws, suggests that WMATA has consented to suit under these laws, or shows that WMATA's consent extends to third parties like Ms. Slack. This alleged contractual agreement, like the alleged waivers under the FTA Master Agreement, does not satisfy Ms. Slack's burden of establishing this Court's jurisdiction over her FCA claim.</p><p id=\"p-30\">Ms. Slack also argues that she has a right to discovery into other agreements between WMATA and the federal government that might include contractual waivers of immunity. Opp. to Mot. Dismiss 12, 15. But Ms. Slack has not alleged facts showing a good-faith belief that discovery will enable her to establish this Court's jurisdiction. Her mere speculation that discovery might reveal a contract that clearly creates a third-party right to sue WMATA under the FCA does not provide grounds for discovery. <em>See</em> <em>FC Inv. Grp. v. IFX Markets, Ltd.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3626524,3570599\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/529/1087/\">529 F.3d 1087</extracted-citation>, 1094 (D.C.

Opp. to Mot. Dismiss 16-24. To support this view, she points out that Virginia and Maryland law mirrors District of Columbia law in three ways. First, each jurisdiction prohibits employers from retaliating against whistleblowers. Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3011(A)-(C) ; Md. State Personnel &amp; Pensions Code \u00a7 5-305 ; <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-223.02\">D.C. Code \u00a7 2-223.02</extracted-citation>. Second, each jurisdiction provides whistleblowers who have suffered retaliation a cause of action that allows them to go to court and sue for reinstatement, back pay, and attorney's fees. Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3011(D) ; Md. State Personnel &amp; Pensions Code \u00a7\u00a7 5-310(e), 5-311 ; <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202-223.03\">D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2-223.03</extracted-citation>(a). Third, Ms. Slack argues, and WMATA does not dispute, that each jurisdiction recognizes WMATA as one of its instrumentalities and applies its whistleblower protection statutes to its instrumentalities. Opp. to Mot. Dismiss 19-22. Ms. Slack concludes that Virginia and Maryland have waived their immunity against whistleblower retaliation claims and, with it, WMATA's immunity against suit under the DCWPA. <em><extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202-223.03\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202-223.03\"> at 23</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-37\">But this line of argument fails for at least two reasons. <em>First</em> , the DCWPA does not apply to WMATA by its own terms. The DCWPA states that it \"shall apply to employees of the WMATA when the Commonwealth of Virginia and the State of Maryland enact similar provisions for WMATA whistleblowers.\" <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202-223.07\">D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2-223.07</extracted-citation>. Ms. Slack argues that Virginia triggered this provision by enacting its Fraud and Abuse Whistle Blower Protection Act in 2009. Opp. to Mot. Dismiss 24. But Ms. Slack has not shown that Maryland has made any relevant change to its whistleblower protection law since the DCWPA's enactment. Nor has she shown that either Virginia or Maryland has a whistleblower statute \"similar\" to the DCWPA in its provision \"for WMATA whistleblowers.\" Unlike the DCWPA, which explicitly addresses WMATA's liability for whistleblower retaliation consistent with the requirement that a statutory waiver must be clear and unequivocal, Virginia and Maryland law is silent on WMATA's liability. For both these reasons, Ms. Slack has failed to carry her burden of showing that the DCWPA applies to WMATA.</p><p id=\"p-38\"><em>Second</em> , consent to suit under one whistleblower protection law is not consent to suit under all whistleblower protection laws. Perhaps District law could apply to WMATA if Virginia and Maryland had enacted identical statutes clearly consenting to suit. <em>See</em> <em>Feeney</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634142\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/299/#p305\">495 U.S. at 306-07</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634142\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/299/#p305\">110 S.Ct. 1868</extracted-citation>. But where each jurisdiction has enacted a different statute, the fact that the statutes address the same subject matter only increases the likelihood that applying one jurisdiction's laws to WMATA could upset the other jurisdictions' policy judgments. <em>See</em> <em>Hellmuth</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3872232\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/414/408/\">414 F.Supp. at 409-10</extracted-citation> (holding that the Maryland Public Information Act did not apply to WMATA although Virginia and the District <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"157\" href=\"#p157\" id=\"p157\">*157</a>of Columbia had enacted comparable freedom of information laws).</p><p id=\"p-39\">A few examples will highlight the substantive differences between each jurisdiction's law. First, each jurisdiction places different conditions on whistleblower protection. Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3011(A)-(C) (protecting employees who make a disclosure in good faith); Md. State Personnel &amp; Pensions Code \u00a7 5-306 (excluding employees who make disclosures prohibited by law-presumably Maryland and federal law-except if made to the Maryland Attorney General under another Maryland statute); <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202-223.01\">D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2-223.01</extracted-citation>(10) (protecting any employee who is \"perceived to have made a protected disclosure\"). Second, each jurisdiction places different conditions on access to court. Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3011(D) (permitting a whistleblower to sue without exhausting administrative remedies); Md. State Personnel &amp; Pensions Code \u00a7 5-310(e) (requiring a whistleblower to exhaust administrative remedies before suing); <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202-223.05\">D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2-223.05</extracted-citation> (requiring a whistleblower who sues in court to give up an administrative remedy). Third, each jurisdiction provides different consequences for whistleblower retaliation. Va. Code \u00a7 2.2-3011(D) (requiring civil penalty between $500 and $2,500); Md. State Personnel &amp; Pensions Code \u00a7\u00a7 5-309(e), 5-311 (authorizing specific forms of relief for the plaintiff and \"any other appropriate relief\" but not expressly contemplating any civil fine); <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202-223.04\">D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2-223.04</extracted-citation>(b) (providing for civil fine not to exceed $1,000). Given these differences, Virginia and Maryland's consent to suit under their own whistleblower laws falls far short of an express or unavoidably implied consent to suit under the DCWPA. <em>See</em> <em>Feeney</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634142\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/299/#p305\">495 U.S. at 305</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634142\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/299/#p305\">110 S.Ct. 1868</extracted-citation>.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-41\">Ms. Slack argues that Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia have made a clear declaration of consent to suit by contractually waiving WMATA's immunity from whistleblower retaliation claims. Opp. to Mot. Dismiss 16-19. But this argument depends on the idea that their course of conduct has modified the WMATA Compact. <em>Id.</em> at 17. And the course of conduct to which Ms. Slack points is \"passing similar legislation.\" <em>Id.</em> at 16; <em>see also</em> <em>id.</em> at 18. The only textual hook that Ms. Slack provides for her contract argument that could distinguish it from her statutory waiver argument is a provision in the Compact allowing amendment by legislative action \"concurred in by all the others.\" <em>See</em> <em>id</em> at 17-18. But she has not shown how Virginia and Maryland concurred in the amendment to the WMATA Compact proposed by the DCWPA. So Ms. Slack's contract argument merges with the statutory waiver argument and fails for the same reasons.</p><p id=\"p-43\">Other judges of this District have already held that the DCWPA does not apply to WMATA, including at least one decision rendered after Virginia allegedly triggered the DCWPA's application by passing its whistleblower protection statute.</p><p id=\"p-44\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"158\" href=\"#p158\" id=\"p158\">*158</a><em>See</em> <em>Ndzerre v.
