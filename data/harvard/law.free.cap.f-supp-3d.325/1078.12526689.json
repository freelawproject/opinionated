(Mot. to Dismiss (\"Mot.\"), ECF No. 16-1.) For the reasons below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This action arises from Plaintiff International Aero Products LLC's (\"Plaintiff\" or \"IAP\") allegations that Defendant Advanced Aero Paint Technology, Inc.'s (\"Defendant\" or \"AAPT\") infringed on Plaintiff's trademarks. (Compl. \u00b6 1, ECF No. 1.) Specifically, the dispute concerns the right to use \"AERO\" and \"AERO and Design\" as trademarks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n 1, ECF No. 21.) In or around November 2016, while Plaintiff was advertising and promoting its products at the Specialty Equipment Market Association (\"SEMA\") in Las Vegas, Nevada, Defendant claimed that one of its customers was confused when he or she saw Plaintiff's products and exhibit and believed Plaintiff was related to Defendant. (Compl. Ex. 6, at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 11, 2018, Plaintiff IAP, a California limited liability company, commenced a lawsuit against Defendant AAPT. (Compl., ECF No. 1.) Plaintiff brought two causes of action: (1) infringement of a federally registered trademark under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (2) infringement of trademark under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 28, 2018, Defendant AAPT initiated a lawsuit in the Southern District of Ohio against IAP; International Aero Holdings, LLC; International Aero Engineering, LLC; International Aero Services, LLC; Jonathan M.

(FAC, ECF No. 11.) The FAC is essentially identical to the Complaint with one exception: instead of identifying Plaintiff IAP as a California limited liability company, Plaintiff amended the Complaint to assert that Plaintiff is actually a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in California. (FAC \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 8, 2018, in the Ohio Action, Plaintiff IAP (and the related entities and individual) filed a Motion to Dismiss and Transfer to transfer the case back to the Central District.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Dismiss, Stay, or Transfer,\n   <em>\n    Aero Advanced Paint Technology, Inc. v.

Purposeful Direction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff does not dispute that Defendant would not be subject to general jurisdiction in California; therefore, only specific jurisdiction is at issue here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n 7; Reply 3, ECF No. 22.) To determine specific jurisdiction in a suit involving trademark infringement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   a court looks to whether a defendant \"purposefully directs\" its activities toward the forum.\n   <em>\n    Schwarzenegger v. Fred Martin Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9237389\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/797/#p802\">\n    374 F.3d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 802 (9th Cir. 2004). Defendant contends that the mere presence and creation of its website is not considered purposeful availment to the forum. (Mot. 10; Reply 4.) Defendant's contention misses the point. The issue is not just over Defendant's website, but whether Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to show that Defendant's activities, including the website, were purposefully directed toward the forum; specifically Defendant's alleged trademark infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Ninth Circuit has held that the relevant inquiry for purposeful direction is whether the defendant allegedly has (1) committed an intentional act, (2) expressly aimed at the forum state, (3) causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum state.\n   <em>\n    Schwarzenegger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9237389\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/797/#p802\">\n    374 F.3d at 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff's allegations meet this test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   a. Intentional Act\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under the first prong, Defendant must commit an intentional act. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant infringed on its trademark through the use of \"Aero\" and \"Aero and Design\" in connection with the\n   marketing and sale of paint on automobiles without its permission. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 27-29.) Plaintiff further alleged that Defendant's infringement was \"knowing, willful, and deliberate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) These allegations satisfy the \"intentional act\" prong.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Levi Strauss &amp; Co. v. Toyo Enter. Co., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3802207\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/665/1084/#p1093\">\n    665 F.Supp.2d 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1093 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (finding \"intentional act\" requirement satisfied by allegations of trademark infringement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   b. Expressly Aimed\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under the second prong, Plaintiff must demonstrate that Defendant expressly aimed its actions at the forum state. In this case, Plaintiff's allegations are substantially based on Defendant's website. The Ninth Circuit addressed this issue in\n   <em>\n    Mavrix Photo Inc. v. Brand Techs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734860\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/647/1218/\">\n    647 F.3d 1218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2011). The court found that the \"maintenance of a passive website alone cannot satisfy the express aiming prong,\" but it has also found that \"operating even a passive website in conjunction with 'something more' ... is sufficient.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734860\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/647/1218/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734860\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/647/1218/\">\n    at 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Thus, courts will look to the interactivity of the website, the geographic scope of the defendant's commercial ambitions, and whether the defendant targeted a plaintiff known to be a forum resident to determine whether a defendant has done \"something more.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734860\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/647/1218/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Ninth Circuit has also found that specific jurisdiction exists when \"a plaintiff files suit in its home state against an out-of-state defendant and alleges that defendant intentionally infringed its intellectual property rights knowing the plaintiff was located in the forum state.\"\n   <em>\n    Adobe Sys. Inc. v.

Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant, through the use of its interactive website, Defendant advertised, displayed, and offered for sale products that were similar to Plaintiff's products to consumers in this district. (FAC \u00b6 5.) Defendant's website also includes several news articles and promotional advertisements targeted at the Central District. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC Ex. 3.) Further, Plaintiff has made a prima facie showing that Defendant was aware of Plaintiff's principal place of business as Defendant's cease and desist letter is addressed to Plaintiff's President/CEO in Bellflower, California. (FAC Ex. 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff has made a prima facie showing that Defendant's conduct was expressly aimed at the forum state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   c. Foreseeable Harm\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Under the third prong, Plaintiff must demonstrate that Defendant's conduct caused harm that it knew was likely to be suffered in the forum.\n   <em>\n    Adidas Am., Inc. v.

(FAC \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15.) Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant's use of the trademark is \"likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception among the public.\" (FAC \u00b6 27.) Accordingly, Plaintiff alleges that it suffered harm in this district, and the but-for cause of this harm is Defendant's alleged infringement. This is sufficient to show that Plaintiff's claims arise out of Defendant's forum-related activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CollegeSource, Inc. v.

Reasonableness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As Plaintiff has made a prima facie case that specific jurisdiction over Defendant is proper, the burden shifts to Defendant to show why the exercise of jurisdiction would not be reasonable and fair.\n   <em>\n    Schwarzenegger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9237389\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/797/#p802\">\n    374 F.3d at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's allegations rely on false and unsupported representations, and that in any event, this Court should transfer the action to the \"first filed Ohio Action.\" (Reply 9.) As the Court addresses below, Defendant's presumption that the Ohio Action is the first filed action is wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that it has specific personal jurisdiction as to Defendant APPT. The Court further denies Plaintiff's request for jurisdictional discovery as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(Mot. 6.) However, Defendant's Motion to Transfer is severely\n   lacking. Defendant's only argument that the action should be transferred can be found in the introduction section that argues that the Ohio Action should be preferred because it is the first filed action and includes claims under Ohio law. (Mot. 6.) Accordingly, the Court will only address whether the Motion to Transfer is proper based on the first-to-file rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Cal. 2013). The first factor that must be satisfied is the chronology of the two actions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 625. There is no dispute regarding the chronology. Plaintiff's Complaint was filed on April 11, 2018 (ECF No. 1); Defendant's Complaint in the Ohio Action was filed on April 28, 2018; and Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint in this Action was filed on May 3, 2018 (ECF No. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   It is abundantly clear that Plaintiff's action in this district was filed first. Defendant's only argument is that Plaintiff's amendment, changing Plaintiff from a California limited liability company to a Delaware limited liability company did not relate back to the original filing, and thus, the Ohio Action is the first filed action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This Court is guided by our sister court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Barnes &amp; Noble, Inc. v.

Tex. 1993) (\"The cases need not be identical to be duplicative.\"). While the Ohio Action raises some unique state law claims, the factual allegations giving rise to those claims and the central theories of liability are identical to those in this action.
