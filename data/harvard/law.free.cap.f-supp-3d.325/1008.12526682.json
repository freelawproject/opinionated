Silver, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff and Defendants wish to depose non-party James L. Styers but Styers believes he is entitled to refuse to answer all possible questions based on his Fifth Amendment privilege. Plaintiff and Defendants disagree, arguing the history and current status of Styers' challenges to his convictions and sentences establish he is no longer entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege. There is no authority definitively resolving the issue, specifically regarding Styers and his present status, but the better reading of existing law is that Styers is not now entitled to invoke the privilege regarding the crimes underlying his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Styers' ability to invoke the Fifth Amendment appears to depend on the current status of his post-conviction challenges. Therefore, the Court has looked to the history of his post-conviction challenges in some detail.

The district court held the relief ordered by the Ninth Circuit \"gave the State the opportunity to cure the constitutional defect\" but did not specify precisely how it must do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203062799\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Arizona Supreme Court's \"new independent review of Petitioner's capital sentence ... remedied the constitutional infirmity\" the Ninth Circuit had identified.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. Therefore, Styers was not entitled to any additional relief. Styers appealed the district court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Shortly after the district court's decision denying Styers' request for an unconditional writ, he filed a separate petition in federal court. CV-12-2332-PHX-JAT. That petition raised eight grounds for relief.\n   <em>\n    Styers v.

April 25, 2013). Some of those grounds addressed issues that were raised or could have been raised in Styers' earlier petition. But some of the grounds addressed aspects of the Arizona Supreme Court's reweighing. When reviewing that second petition, the district court concluded it could not consider any of the grounds Styers had raised in his earlier petition nor could the court consider any of the grounds Styers could have raised earlier. The district court concluded, however, that it could entertain arguments based on the \"new independent sentencing review.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The district court decided to stay all those claims based on the pending appeal involving the earlier petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 30, 2015, the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion regarding Styer's earlier petition. In that opinion, the Ninth Circuit addressed whether, after the writ had been granted, the Arizona Supreme Court\n   was entitled to conduct a new independent sentencing review or if the case should have been sent for an entirely new sentencing.\n   <em>\n    Styers v. Ryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082544\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/292/#p294\">\n    811 F.3d 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 294 (9th Cir. 2015). The Ninth Circuit concluded the Arizona Supreme Court's decision that it could correct the error merely through a new independent sentencing review was not \"contrary to, [nor did it] involve[ ] an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determine by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082544\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/292/#p294\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082544\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/292/#p294\">\n    at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the Arizona Supreme Court's new independent sentencing review complied with all constitutional requirements. Therefore, Styers was not entitled to relief. Styers filed an unsuccessful petition for writ of certiorari.\n   <em>\n    Styers v. Ryan\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603649,12603650,12603651,12603652,12603653,12603654\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1332/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603650,12603651,12603637,12603638,12603641,12603642,12603644,12603645\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/197/525/\">\n    197 L.Ed.2d 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the petition for writ of certiorari was denied in 2017, the district court hearing Styers' second federal petition issued its ruling. That court concluded the only grounds for relief that were still pending involved the propriety of the Arizona Supreme Court's independent sentencing review. Because the Ninth Circuit had addressed those grounds in its 2015 decision, the district court found the grounds \"moot.\"\n   <em>\n    Styers v. Ryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203641454\">\n    2017 WL 3641454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D. Ariz. Aug. 24, 2017). The district court then denied Styers' request to reconsider its refusal to address the other grounds, including grounds involving Styers' convictions. The district court denied that request. Finally, the district court denied Styers' request for a certificate of appealability. CV-12-2332-PHX-JAT, Doc. 36. Styers subsequently requested a certificate of appealability from the Ninth Circuit. That request remains pending. Ninth Circuit Case No. 17-17356, Doc. 4 (filed January 17, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Based on this extensive history, Styers' convictions and death sentence have followed slightly differently post-conviction paths. Regarding his convictions, they have been affirmed during the following proceedings: 1) a direct appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court; 2) an unsuccessful petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court; 3) state post-conviction proceedings; 4) federal district court; 5) Ninth Circuit review; 6) an unsuccessful petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. Based on this history, it seems clear that there is no path remaining for Styers to challenge his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As for Styers' death sentence, he obtained relief from the Ninth Circuit in 2008 and the Arizona Supreme Court, after engaging in a new independent sentencing review, concluded the death sentence was appropriate. After that decision, Styers has unsuccessfully sought to challenge his sentence through the following: 1) an unsuccessful petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court regarding the Arizona Supreme Court's decision; 2) an unsuccessful motion in district court; 3) a published Ninth Circuit opinion concluding the resentencing complied with previous federal orders and did not violate Styers' constitutional rights; 4) an unsuccessful petition for writ of certiorari regarding that Ninth Circuit decision; and 5) a district court order denying relief because the sentencing claims had already been considered and rejected by the Ninth Circuit. As with his convictions, it seems clear that there is no path remaining for Styers to challenge his death sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Despite these decades-long attempts to overturn his convictions and sentences, Styers believes he still has not \"exhausted all avenues for state post-conviction relief.\" Styers plans \"to file a post-conviction petition\" under one of the exceptions allowing for successive petitions. (Doc. 269 at 7). In addition, Styers describes his Ninth Circuit\n   litigation as continuing and believes he may \"be awarded a new trial or sentencing proceeding.\" (Doc. 269 at 7). While Styers and his counsel may have plans to file additional attempts at relief, and they may believe there is a possible chance at winning relief from the Ninth Circuit, given the actual course of Styers' challenges and in particular the finality of the court decisions, there is no meaningful chance of that occurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Styers' Deposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During the present litigation, both Plaintiff and Defendants have sought to depose Styers. Hoping to avoid prolonged proceedings, the Court originally directed the parties to submit written questions to Styers and his counsel for their consideration. (Doc. 206). Plaintiff and Defendants did so but Styers, through his counsel, stated he planned to invoke the Fifth Amendment to every question except for his date of birth and the date of his marriage. (Doc. 253-1 at 1). Thus, Styers claimed he was entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment regarding, for example, the \"names and ages of [his] children\" and whether he has ever been arrested. (Doc. 253-1 at 1-2). After Styers made clear he would not answer any questions, the parties submitted briefing on whether Styers was entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment as he proposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Styers' position is that he need not answer\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   questions regarding his life and activities. The Fifth Amendment obviously does not reach so far.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist.

His direct appeal and state post-conviction relief efforts were unsuccessful and he sought federal habeas relief. One of the claims on federal habeas involved the alleged ineffectiveness of the petitioner's counsel at sentencing which if he prevailed would entitle him to a new sentencing. During the federal habeas proceedings the district court entered a protective order, authorized a substantial amount of discovery, and conducted a six-day evidentiary hearing. The petitioner testified at that hearing but invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege in response \"to all questions related to the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3629515\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/808/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3629515\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/808/\">\n    at 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

During the later state proceedings there was a disagreement about the scope of the federal protective order and whether the state could use evidence developed in the federal proceedings at the petitioner's resentencing.

In conducting that analysis, however, the Ninth Circuit made a number of observations regarding a federal habeas petitioner's Fifth Amendment privilege. According to the Ninth Circuit, any \"waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege\" during federal habeas proceedings \"is narrow and courts must limit the use of any privileged testimony to litigation of the habeas claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3629515\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/808/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3629515\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/808/\">\n    at 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit also stated that \"in some circumstances petitioners ... are permitted to refuse to answer questions by asserting their Fifth Amendment privilege\" but, when petitioners do so, a court \"is permitted to draw a negative inference against the petitioner[s].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3629515\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/808/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3629515\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/808/\">\n    at 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These statements assume federal habeas petitioners\n   retain at least a limited version of the Fifth Amendment privilege throughout their federal proceedings despite state convictions obviously being \"final\" as that term is usually understood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   While\n   <em>\n    Lambright\n   </em>\n   assumed the petitioner was entitled to invoke the privilege during federal habeas proceedings, it did not offer an explanation of that position. Moreover, the whole discussion of the privilege in\n   <em>\n    Lambright\n   </em>\n   is difficult to understand because it does not identify the particular information allegedly withheld based on the privilege. That is, the opinion claimed the petitioner had refused to answer questions based on the privilege, meaning it is unclear what privileged information was even at issue, potentially rendering the entire discussion dicta. But regardless of its precise reasoning,\n   <em>\n    Lambright\n   </em>\n   provides a substantial basis to conclude the Fifth Amendment privilege does not evaporate entirely once a state conviction has become \"final\" under the normal test for finality in the conviction context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   provides the Fifth Amendment no longer applies once a conviction is \"final\" while\n   <em>\n    Lambright\n   </em>\n   provides the Fifth Amendment continues to apply even in federal habeas proceedings for state prisoners.

Under this \"substantial and real\" approach, an individual may still be able to invoke the privilege after his conviction is \"final\" under the normal test for finality provided there is a \"substantial and real\" chance that any testimony might be used against him in future proceedings. For example, an individual convicted in state court likely would be entitled to invoke the privilege when he is pursuing his first federal petition for post-conviction relief. Until that round of federal habeas is completed, there will usually remain substantial hazards of incrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This \"substantial and real\" approach to finality allows for the holdings in\n   <em>\n    Reina\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lambright\n   </em>\n   to be consistent. The inmate in\n   <em>\n    Reina\n   </em>\n   had pursued and lost a direct appeal and there was no indication he was pursuing any form of post-conviction relief. In those circumstances, there\n   were no \"substantial and real ... hazards of incrimination.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166408\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/39/#p53\">\n    390 U.S. at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166408\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/39/#p53\">\n    88 S.Ct. 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, he could not invoke the privilege. By contrast, the inmate in\n   <em>\n    Lambright\n   </em>\n   had plausible-in fact, ultimately successful-post-conviction claims for relief. Thus, there remained substantial hazards of incrimination and he retained the ability to invoke the privilege. Applying the \"substantial and real\" approach to Styers requires the Court reject his position that he is entitled to invoke the privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Styers has been litigating his convictions and sentences for years. He has been through direct appeals, state post-conviction proceedings, and multiple rounds of federal habeas.

Ryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082544\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/292/#p294\">\n    811 F.3d 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2015). And again, the United States Supreme Court refused to review that decision. Therefore, Styers has been through a complete round of federal habeas regarding his convictions and sentences. And while Styers claims he still has plausible grounds for relief, especially sentencing-phase claims, the district judge handling his latest federal habeas petition held all the grounds Styers had asserted were \"meritless,\" \"moot,\" or subject to the \"second or successive\" bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Looking at the entirety of Styers' state and federal proceedings, there is no meaningful chance he will obtain relief. Accordingly, there is no \"substantial and real\" likelihood Styers will suffer any adverse consequences if he is required to testify at a deposition. In other words, Styers' convictions and sentences are \"final\" because \"no adverse consequences can be visited upon [Styers] by reason of further testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133167\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/314/\">\n    526 U.S. at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133167\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/314/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Styers is not entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege in connection with the crimes for which he was convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In addition to questions regarding the crimes for which he was convicted, Styers has claimed he is entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment in response to questions involving all other aspects of his life. Styers offers no meaningful explanation why he is entitled to do so. At present, there is no plausible basis for Styers to claim, for example, that identifying how many children he has will be incriminating. Furthermore, Styers claims he is entitled to invoke the privilege in response to questions that might implicate him in crimes allegedly committed during his service in Vietnam or in a conspiracy to murder Mark (Arizona) Milke. (Doc. 269 at 13). Absent substantially more information from Styers regarding the nature of his fears, the possibility of a war crimes prosecution for events occurring in Vietnam decades ago qualifies as \"imaginary and unsubstantial.\"\n   <em>\n    Ohio v. Reiner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300531\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/17/#p21\">\n    532 U.S. 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300531\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/17/#p21\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300531\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/17/#p21\">\n    149 L.Ed.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). Similarly, there is no indication of any \"substantial and real\" likelihood that Styers might implicate himself regarding an alleged conspiracy to commit murder. Therefore, Styers cannot invoke the privilege in response to other questions about his life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Styers' deposition will be allowed to proceed.

Styers believes that point will not be reached in his case until he is executed. In other words, Styers believes a death-sentenced individual retains his Fifth Amendment privilege until his execution, regardless of the status of any challenges to his conviction and sentence. Under this approach, every death-sentenced individual under any and all circumstances, could never be forced to testify. Styers cites no authority recognizing such an absolute rule and such a rule would seriously impair the \"truth-seeking function of the court\" for no meaningful purpose.\n    <em>\n     Denham v.

Moreover,\n    <em>\n     Reina\n    </em>\n    strongly indicates the privilege may no longer exist even when portions of a sentence remain to be served. Styers' proposed absolute rule, therefore, is not convincing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
