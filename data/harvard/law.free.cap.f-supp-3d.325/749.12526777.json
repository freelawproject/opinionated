Having reviewed the documents, the governing law, the arguments of counsel, and the file as a whole, the Court now enters the following opinion and order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The question in this case is whether federal law preempts a state law-Texas Local Government Code \u00a7 250.007(c) -that allows landlords to decline to rent to tenants who seek to pay their rent using federal housing vouchers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    The Federal Housing Choice Voucher Program\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Congress created the Housing Choice Voucher Program to \"aid[ ] low-income families in obtaining a decent place to live\" and to \"promot[e] economically mixed housing.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(a).

The Court first considers whether it has jurisdiction to hear the City's claims.

Given\n   Congress's apparent rejection of mandatory landlord participation, it makes little sense to suggest, as the City does, that voluntary landlord participation somehow stands as an obstacle to the purposes and objectives of Congress. Resp. [# 24] at 8-9. More to the point, however, there is nothing in the Senate Committee Report demonstrating a clear and manifest congressional purpose to preempt state laws preserving the voluntary character of the federal voucher program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In sum, the City has failed to provide any basis for concluding Congress possessed a clear and manifest purpose to preempt state laws, such as \u00a7 250.007, which preserve the voluntary character of the federal housing voucher program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the City has failed to carry its burden of persuasion, the Court GRANTS the State's motion to dismiss with respect to the City's federal conflict preemption claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Specifically, the State argues (1) the City has not identified a specific policy creating a barrier to fair housing and (2) the City has not pleaded a causal link between a policy and the disparate impact.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591002\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2507/#p2525\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Though the Court has concerns about the viability of the City's disparate impact claim, neither of the State's purported arguments are persuasive. First, the City has identified a policy-voluntary landlord participation in the federal voucher program-which allegedly creates a barrier to fair housing. Am. Compl. [# 16] at 7-8. Second, the City has also pleaded a causal connection between this policy of voluntary landlord participation and disparate impact. According to the City, the policy of voluntary landlord participation restricts the housing choices available to participants in the federal voucher program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Further, the City contends the large majority of individuals in the City who participate in the federal voucher program are African-American or Hispanic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Together, these allegations suggest a policy\n   allowing discrimination against voucher holders would disproportionately impact minorities. Absent any further argument from the State as to why the City's \u00a7 3615 preemption claim should be dismissed, the Court DENIES the State's motion to dismiss with respect to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Resp. [# 24] at 10. This confuses the issue. The question of whether Congress intended to preempt state and local antidiscrimination requirements is separate from the question of whether a state can validly enact a law preserving the voluntary character of the federal voucher program and invalidating contrary municipal regulations. Only the latter question is at issue here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Nor has the City given any indication Congress intended to allow the City to mandate landlord acceptance of federal vouchers where the State has made a contrary choice.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nixon v.
