(Dkt. No. 29.) Plaintiff filed an opposition on July 13, 2018. (Dkt. No. 32.) Defendant filed a reply on July 27, 2018. (Dkt. No. 38.) Based on the reasoning below, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 16, 2018, Plaintiff San Diego County Credit Union (\"SDCCU\") filed a complaint against Defendant Citizens Equity First Credit Union (\"CEFCU\") for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of trademarks and related claims. (Dkt. No. 1, Compl.) SDCCU and CEFCU are both large credit unions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) SDCCU's customers are primarily located in Southern California while CEFCU's customers are primarily located in Peoria, Illinois and northern California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   CEFCU is a credit union organized and existing under Illinois law and has its principal place of business in Peoria, Illinois. (Dkt. No. 29-4, Schneider Decl. \u00b6 2.) CEFCU's chief officers and senior vice presidents are based in Illinois. (Dkt. No. 37, Flexor Decl. \u00b6 2.) In 2008 or 2009, CEFCU bought California-based Valley Credit Union which had three branches. (Dkt. No. 29-3, Dabney Decl., Ex. 16, Flexor Depo. at 29:9-11; Dkt. No. 37, Flexor Decl. \u00b6 6.) It re-branded the three Valley Credit Union branches under CEFCU and added two additional California branches in 2016 and 2017. (Dkt. No. 29-3, Dabney Decl., Ex. 16, Flexor Depo. at 33:13-17; Dkt. No. 32-13, Salen Decl., Ex. 11; Dkt. No. 32-14, Salen Decl., Ex. 12.) On January 14, 2013, CEFCU registered an agent for service of process in California. (Dkt. No. 32-7, Salen Decl., Ex. 5.) As of March 31, 2018, CEFCU has 812 employees in Illinois and 77 in California. (Dkt. No. 37, Flexor Decl. \u00b6 3.) It maintains twenty-two branch locations in Illinois and has five branches in northern California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6.) It has members in all fifty states. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) As of March 31, 2018, CEFCU's California members\n   account for about 7.18% of CEFCU's total deposits and 7.46% of CEFCU's total loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) About 9.31% of CEFCU members have California addresses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   SDCCU owns over 40 federally registered trademarks in connection with its credit union services, including U.S. Trademark\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%204%2C560%2C596\">\n    Registration No. 4,560,596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for \"IT'S NOT BIG BANK BANKING.

CEFCU owns U.S. Trademark\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%203%2C952%2C993\">\n    Registration No. 3,952,993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for \"CEFCU. NOT A BANK. BETTER\" (the \"CEFCU Mark\") issued on May 3, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Several third-party credit unions use the following trademarks, \"NOT A BANK-BETTER!\", \"BETTER THAN A BANK\", AND \"IT'S NOT A BANK\" (\"Third Party marks\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After a CEFCU employee saw a billboard in San Diego, CA of the SDCCU Mark used to market credit union services, CEFCU filed a petition for cancellation of the SDCCU Mark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's (\"USPTO\") Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (\"TTAB\") claiming the SDCCU Mark is likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive consumers when viewing CEFCU's Mark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The petition for cancellation of the '596 Trademark Registration No. was filed on May 17, 2017 and entitled\n   <em>\n    Citizens Equity First Credit Union v. San Diego County Credit Union\n   </em>\n   , Cancellation No. 92066165. (Dkt. No. 29-3, Dabney Decl., Ex. 1.) On July 3, 2017, SDCCU filed an Answer and Counterclaim in the cancellation proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Ex. 3.) On August 7, 2017, CEFCU filed an Answer to the Counterclaim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 4.) On August 28, 2017, SDCCU filed an Amended Counterclaim to which CEFCU timely answered on September 11, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exs. 5. 6.) A scheduling order was issued and discovery has taken place. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 7.) On March 23, 2018, CEFCU filed a motion for leave to amend its petition to add an additional ground for cancellation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 17.) Then on May 16, 2018, SDCCU filed this action and moved the PTO for a stay of the cancellation proceedings which the PTO granted on June 8, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Exs. 1, 23, 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In this action, the complaint alleges that the CEFCU Mark is, in fact, more similar to each of the Third Party Marks than it is to the SDCCU Mark. (Dkt. No. 1, Compl. \u00b6 7.) Therefore, if CEFCU believes that the scope of protection for its mark is broad enough to encompass the SDCCU, CEFCU materially misrepresented to the USPTO that the CEFCU Mark was not confusingly similar to any of the Third-Party Marks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On the other hand, if CEFCU believes that its mark was not confusingly similar to any of the Third-Party marks, the CEFCU Mark cannot be broad enough to encompass the SDCCU Mark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In either case, CEFCU's cancellation action and threat of lawsuit are objectively baseless and brought with the subjective intent to harm SDCCU. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) SDCCU also has a reasonable apprehension that CEFCU will file a lawsuit against SDCCU alleging trademark infringement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The complaint alleges eight causes of action seeking declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of trademarks, false or fraudulent trademark registration under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201120\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , unfair competition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , unfair competition under California Business &amp; Professions Code section 17200\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and unfair competition under common law.

CEFCU registered an agent for service of process in California. California and Illinois are the only residents that qualify to be members and shareholders of\n   CEFCU. CEFCU markets aggressively to California residents through television, radio and newspaper advertisements. It also acquired the naming rights to San Jose State University's football stadium, now named CEFCU Stadium, for a period of 15 years for $8.7 million. CEFCU also conducted focus group research in California to grow awareness of its brand. CEFCU's website allows California residents to open accounts, access accounts and perform other banking operations. In its 2017 annual report, CEFCU boasted that its California market saw record growth in their book-of-business of over $52 million and consumer/mortgage and business loan volume of more than $108 million.

Plaintiff has not conducted an assessment of CEFCU's contact in their entirety but focuses solely on its activities in California. Plaintiff asserts that California is the only state, besides Illinois, in which residents qualify to be members and shareholders. However, the record demonstrates that other qualifications allow a person to become a member of CEFCU. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 32-10, Salen Decl., Ex. 8.) Furthermore, CEFCU has members in all fifty states. (Dkt. No. 37, Flexor Decl. \u00b6 7.)

Plaintiff further argues that CEFCU's assertion of trademark rights is based on SDCCU's use of its trademark in California which is the only state where both market their credit union services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In the instant complaint, SDCCU challenges assertions made by CEFCU in its cancellation proceeding before the TTAB which was filed in Virginia. However, the facts and impetus underlying the cancellation proceeding, and consequently this proceeding, arise out of CEFCU's contacts in California. These include acquiring California-based Valley Credit Union and rebranding them as CEFCU, increasing its presence by adding two additional branches, and aggressively marketing its services using its trademark in California. The petition\n   for cancellation asserts that SDCCU's mark will likely cause confusion, mistake or deceive under the trademark laws. SDCCU's mark is in use only in southern California and its use in California will likely cause confusion or mistake. Because of CEFCU's expansion into the California market, one of CEFCU's employees saw the SDCCU Mark in southern California which prompted the filing of the cancellation petition. CEFCU's contacts in California form the basis of SDCCU's reasonable concern that CEFCU would file suit for infringing its federally registered and common law trademark. The declaratory relief claims arise from CEFCU's expansion of its credit union into California.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Picot v.

The plaintiff was incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in California and the defendant was a Delaware corporation that was founded in California and was later acquired by a Texas-based company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The court held, citing\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   , that any contact by the defendant with the plaintiff due to the cancellation proceeding such as retaining California counsel for the TTAB action, conducting discovery and attending two in-person settlement meetings in California did not support the expressly aimed factor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.

The court held that the intentional acts of contracting with a third party that gave the defendant the right to market its products throughout the entire world, including the United States, its authorization to create a mobile application and its filing of trademark applications and petitions to cancel the plaintiff's trademarks were not expressly aimed at California or the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The court explained that the contracts or mobile application did not authorize a sale to the United States and no sale was made or could have been made to the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The actions amount to \"untargeted negligence\" and did not meet the \"express aiming\" requirement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the court noted that the defendant's filing of trademark applications and petitions to cancel the plaintiff's trademarks are not sufficient to justify haling a foreign into federal court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Contrary to\n   <em>\n    Allergan\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Delphix Corp.\n   </em>\n   where the defendants did not expressly aim their conduct at California, in this case, CEFCU's intentional acts underlying the cancellation petition were directed at California are more significant and substantial. The Court concludes that SDCCU's declaratory judgment complaint, seeking a declaration that CEFCU's trademarks are invalid and not infringed, based on the petition for cancellation directly relate to CEFCU's contacts in California. Accordingly the \"expressly aiming\" factor is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

The fact that a CEFCU employee saw the SDCCU mark on a billboard is not relevant to specific jurisdiction because none of SDCCU's purported claims arise from the person seeing a billboard and CEFCU's discovery of the SDCCU Mark in California does not involve any interaction between CEFCU and SCDCCU. SDCCU rebuts CEFCU's argument by asserting that if CEFCU had not actively spent the last seven years growing its California based credit union business and its brand in California, discovered the SDCCU Mark on a billboard in San Diego, served a Cancellation Petition and proposed amendment on SDCCU in this district based on such discovery and alleged a likelihood of confusion based on the use of the respective marks in California, SDCCU would not have developed a reasonable fear of being sued in this state or be required to defend itself in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiff that SDCCU's claims arise out of CEFCU's contacts with California. The impetus of CEFCU's cancellation petition was a result of its expansion of its credit union services from Illinois to northern California. Because of its increasing presence in California, including when a CEFCU employee saw SDCCU's billboard in San Diego, such presence prompted CEFCU to pursue the cancellation petition in Virginia, But for CEFCU's expansion into the northern California credit union market and subsequent filing of a cancellation petition, the declaratory action would not have been filed. Thus, SDCCU's claims \"arises out of or relates to [CEFCU's] forum-related activities.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schwarzenegger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9237389\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/797/#p802\">\n    374 F.3d at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

California has a strong interest in protecting its citizens from trademark infringement and consumer confusion between two entities operating in California. SDCCU has an interest in obtaining full relief in this Court because relief in the TTAB cancellation proceedings is limited. Fourth, California is the most efficient forum for judicial resolution as this case will resolve all issues while the TTAB is limited to deciding matters relating to registration. Lastly, California has a strong interest in furthering substantive social policies as CECFU seeks to protect its California operations and consumers from SDCCU's alleged infringement and SDCCU filed this case to protect itself and its California consumers.
