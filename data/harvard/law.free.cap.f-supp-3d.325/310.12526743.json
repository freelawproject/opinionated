(\"Foot Locker\") from August 19, 2016 to August 17, 2017. Plaintiff City of Warren Police and Fire Retirement System (\"City of Warren\") has brought claims pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"the Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 against Foot Locker, Richard A. Johnson (\"Johnson\"), Foot Locker's President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Lauren B. Peters (\"Peters\"), Foot Locker's Chief Financial Officer. (Dkt. No. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6-8). Foot Locker is an athletic shoe and apparel retailer and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"FL.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court is New England Carpenters Guaranteed Annuity and Pension Funds' (the \"Funds\") unopposed motion for appointment as Lead Plaintiff. Four other motions for appointment as Lead Plaintiff and corresponding motions for appointment as Lead Class Counsel were filed. Three were withdrawn. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 30 (withdrawing Dkt. No. 20, Brian Rosenberg's (\"Rosenberg\") motion); Dkt. No. 31 (withdrawing Dkt. No. 14, Osman Kazan's (\"Kazan\") motion); Dkt. No. 33 (withdrawing Dkt. No. 17, Boilermaker-Blacksmith National Pension Trust's (\"Boilermaker\") motion) ). Integral Capital Management SARL's (\"Integral Capital\") motion, (Dkt. No. 23), was not\n   withdrawn, but the movant indicated that it did not oppose the Funds' motion, (Dkt. No. 32). City of Warren did not file a motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the Funds' motion for appointment as Lead Plaintiff, and Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd LLP (\"Robbins Geller\") as Lead Counsel for the putative Class are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   City of Warren filed its Complaint on March 9, 2018. The Complaint alleges that on August 19, 2016, November 18, 2016, and February 24, 2017, Foot Locker issued press releases announcing its second, third, and fourth quarter 2016 financial results. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14, 16). On those same days, Foot Locker conducted conference calls with analysts and investors to discuss the company's earnings and operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15, 17). Defendants are alleged to have made positive statements about Foot Locker's business metrics and financial prospects that were materially false and misleading in those press releases and during the conference calls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-17). Defendants are also alleged to have failed to disclose adverse facts-namely, that Foot Locker's vendors were transitioning to online retailers and increased competition with online retailers affected pricing and lowered demand such that statements about Foot Locker's business were materially false and misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 19, 2017, Foot Locker issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2017 financial results. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19). Foot Locker reported that revenue growth had declined and were essentially flat; same store sales increased only one-half of one percent, and profits fell to $1.36 per share, below the $1.38 per share Foot Locker led investors to expect and below the $1.39 per share reported during the same period in 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). During the conference call held with investors and analysts that morning, Defendants further disclosed that this trend was not limited to the second half of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 but would continue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants stated that if sales did not improve, the company would be forced to cut costs and inventory in order to make its 2017 financial guidance of a mid-single digit earnings per share increase. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In response, the price of Foot Locker common stock declined from its open of $70.45 per share on May 19, 2017 to a close of $58.72 per share. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 18, 2017, Foot Locker issued a press release announcing its second quarter 2017 financial results. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21). Foot Locker reported that its revenues had declined 4.4%, from $1.78 billion in 2016 to $1.7 billion in 2017 during the same quarter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Foot Locker reported that its profits fell during the period to $0.39 per share, below the $0.90 per share the company had led investors to expect, and the $0.94 per share reported in the same quarter in 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The company also stated that it would close approximately 130 stores, more than the 100 stores it had previously announced it would close. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). During the conference call, Foot Locker said it expected weaker sales for the remainder of 2017, with same store sales likely to be down between 3% and 4%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The price of Foot Locker common stock declined from a close of $47.70 per share on August 17, 2017 to a close of $34.38 per share on August 18, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Complaint contains two causes of action alleging: (1) a violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-37); and (2) a violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Five motions, each of which asked the Court to appoint the movant(s) as Lead Plaintiff, and designate Lead Class Counsel, were filed on May 8, 2018. Three of those motions have been withdrawn and Integral Capital has filed a notice of non-opposition, leaving the Funds' motion unopposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\"PSLRA\") requires that a plaintiff who files a complaint publish, in a widely circulated business oriented publication or wire service, a notice advising members of the purported class of \"the pendency of the action, the claims asserted therein, and the purported class period\"; and permits \"not later than 60 days after the date on which the notice is published, any member of the purported class may move the court to serve as lead plaintiff[.]\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 9, 2018, Robbins Geller, counsel for City of Warren and the Funds, caused a notice about the pendency of the action to be published in\n   <em>\n    Business Wire\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of David A. Rosenfeld in Support of the New England Carpenters Funds' Motion for Appointment as Lead Plaintiff and Approval of Selection of Lead Counsel (\"Rosenfeld Decl.\"), Ex.

None of the moving parties challenged the adequacy of the notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The 60-day period in which any member of the proposed class may apply for lead plaintiff status elapsed on May 8, 2018; the Funds' motion, which was filed on May 8, 2018, was timely. Integral Capital's motion-the only other motion not withdrawn-was filed on May 8, 2018 and was also timely. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(A)(i)(II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Lead Plaintiff\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The PSLRA requires the Court to appoint as \"lead plaintiff\" the member of the class that the Court determines to be \"most adequate plaintiff,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   . the member the court determines to be \"most capable of adequately representing the interests of class members.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(i). The Court must \"adopt a presumption that the most adequate plaintiff\" \"is the person or group of persons\" that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (1) \"has either filed the complaint or made a [timely] motion\" to be appointed as lead plaintiff(s);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (2) \"in the determination of the court, has the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (3) \"otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I). This presumption may be rebutted \"only\" by proof that the presumptively adequate plaintiff either \"will not fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class\" or \"is subject to unique defenses that render such plaintiff incapable of adequately representing the class.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Even when a motion to appoint lead plaintiff is unopposed, the Court must still consider the factors under the PSLRA to ensure that the movant is the most adequate plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Springer v.

During the class period, they are alleged to have suffered $2,034,806.60 in losses, having purchased 102,327 shares total, 36,188 net shares, and expending a net amount of $3,238,868.26 on Foot Locker common stock during the class period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Rosenfeld Decl., Ex. C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The financial interest of Integral Capital, the only other party not to withdraw its application, does not compare to that of the Funds. Integral Capital suffered, in contrast to the Funds, $227,902.91 in losses, based on a purchase of 7,229 shares, 7,229 net shares (Integral Capital has since sold all of its shares outside of the class period), and expending a net amount of $470,475.51. (Dkt. No. 25, Declaration of Kim E. Miller in Support of the Motion of Integral Capital Management SARL for Appointment as Lead Plaintiff and Approval of Selection of Lead Counsel (\"Miller Decl.\"), Ex. B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Had the other parties pressed their motions to be Lead Counsel, the Funds' financial interest would still be greater. Kazan suffered $15,796.32 in losses, based upon a purchase of 1,022 shares total, 822 net shares, and expending a net amount of $43,146.22. (Dkt. No. 15, Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion of Osman Kazan to Appoint Lead Plaintiff and Approve Lead Plaintiff's Selection of Counsel (\"Kazan Mem.\"), Ex. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Boilermaker suffered $776,860.54 in losses, based on a purchase of 55,707 shares, 45,337 net shares, and expending a net amount of $1,576,061.03. (Dkt. No. 19, Declaration of S. Douglas Bunch in Support of Motion of Boilermaker-Blacksmith National Pension Trust for Appointment as Lead Plaintiff and Appointment of Lead Counsel (\"Bunch Decl.\"), Ex. C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Rosenberg suffered $16,037 in losses, based on a purchase of 550 shares, 550 net shares (although he sold 200 shares after the class period), and expending a net amount of $34,863. (Dkt. No. 22, Declaration of Jeremy Lieberman in Support of Motion of Brian Rosenberg for Appointment\n   as Lead Plaintiff and Approval of Counsel (\"Rosenfeld Decl.\"), Ex. C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On each measure-losses suffered; total shares purchased; net shares purchased; and net funds expended-the Funds' expenditures or losses is greater than that of Integral Capital as well as the parties who initially moved, but have now since withdrawn their applications to serve as Lead Plaintiff. The Court therefore concludes that the Funds have the largest financial interest in relief sought by the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Rule 23\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The next step in identifying which plaintiff is entitled to the presumption is to \"ensure that the person (or persons) with the largest financial interest 'otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23.' \"\n   <em>\n    Maliarov v.
