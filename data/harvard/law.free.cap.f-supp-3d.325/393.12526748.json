PAUL OETKEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Jacob T. Eberhart brought this lawsuit against Amazon.com, Inc. for injuries he suffered from a coffeemaker purchased on Amazon's website. Amazon\n   moves for summary judgment. For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of an accident that Eberhart suffered in August 2015. According to the Complaint, Eberhart was washing his French press coffeemaker when the glass pot shattered. (Dkt. No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.) The shards of glass lacerated Eberhart's thumb, and he was taken to the hospital for emergency medical treatment. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-22.) Eberhart alleges that he suffered nerve damage and, as a result, potentially permanent limitations on the use of his thumb. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At this stage of the litigation, however, the question is not whether or how Eberhart was injured. Rather, the issue is whether Amazon-the website from which Eberhart bought the coffeemaker\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -is legally responsible for injuries caused by the product's alleged defect. It is undisputed that Amazon neither manufactured nor designed the coffeemaker. (Dkt. No. 65 (\"CSOF\") \u00b6 11.) Eberhart argues that Amazon sold the coffeemaker and, even if it did not, it is legally liable for defective products sold by third parties through its website. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 66 at 5-13.) Amazon states that it did not sell the coffeemaker to Eberhart; it merely provides an online marketplace and, in some instances, logistics services to shippers. Amazon argues that it cannot be held liable for the torts of third-party sellers, and it moves for summary judgment on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Eberhart asserts five causes of action against Amazon: strict products liability, negligence, vicarious liability for the manufacturer's negligence, breach of express warranty, and misrepresentation. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-103.) These counts are not additive; rather, each states an alternative theory of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As both parties direct their briefing to New York law, the Court applies New York law to Eberhart's claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts Not Subject to Genuine Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Amazon operates an online marketplace at www.amazon.com. (CSOF \u00b6 1; Dkt No. 47-2 (\"Poad Aff.\") \u00b6 5.) Amazon sells some of its own products on its marketplace, but a significant portion of the products on amazon.com are sold by third-party sellers. (CSOF \u00b6 1; Poad Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7.) Amazon requires all third-party sellers to agree to Amazon's \"Amazon Services Business Solutions Agreement\" (\"BSA\"), which explains that Amazon offers \"a suite of optional services for sellers.\" (Dkt. No. 47-6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   CSOF \u00b6\u00b6 3-4; Poad Aff. \u00b6 9.) Under the terms of the BSA, third-party sellers are responsible for deciding what to sell, sourcing their products, providing product descriptions, setting the prices for their products, and packaging their products (or ensuring their products are properly packaged). (CSOF \u00b6 5; Poad Aff. \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   If a seller chooses to pay to participate in Amazon's \"Fulfillment by Amazon\" (\"FBA\") program, Amazon will store the seller's inventory in an Amazon fulfillment center and, upon receipt of an order, will place the product in a shipping container and deliver it to a shipper. (CSOF \u00b6 8; Poad Aff. \u00b6 16.) FBA participants retain title to their products and pay for storage space. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The coffeemaker that caused Eberhart's injury was purchased on amazon.com, where it was described as a \"CoffeeGet 6 cup 27 oz. French Press Coffee Maker with thick heat resistant glass.\" (Compl. \u00b6 11; Poad Aff. \u00b6 4.) Amazon offers evidence that the coffeemaker was offered for sale by a company operating under the name \"CoffeeGet.\" (CSOF \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9; Poad Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4; Dkt. No. 47-5.) While Eberhart formally denies that CoffeeGet sold him the coffeemaker (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CSOF \u00b6 7), he offers no evidence beyond unsubstantiated speculation. Amazon has also offered evidence, in the form of an affidavit and deposition testimony from Amazon General Manager Chris Poad, that CoffeeGet participated in Amazon's FBA program and, consequently, Amazon never took title to the coffeemaker. (CSOF \u00b6\u00b6 8, 11; Poad Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13, 16; Dkt. No. 47-3 at 21:7-17, 106:2-18.) Amazon did not write or develop the product detail page for the coffeemaker. (CSOF \u00b6 11; Poad Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13; Dkt. No. 47-3 at 69:5-22.) As to all of these facts, Eberhart offers no evidence on which a reasonable jury could base a contrary finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Strict Products Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The instant case poses a question that has not been directly answered by the New York Court of Appeals: Is an \"online\n   marketplace\" such as Amazon subject to strict products liability? As this Court is sitting in diversity, its task is not to answer the question for itself in the first instance, but rather to predict how the New York Court of Appeals would decide the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Travelers Ins. Co. v. 633 Third Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523412\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/114/#p119\">\n    14 F.3d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 119 (2d Cir. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court begins with decisional law of the New York Court of Appeals. In New York, \"[i]t is well settled that a manufacturer of defective products ... may be held strictly liable for injuries caused by its products, regardless of privity, foreseeability or due care.\"\n   <em>\n    Finerty v. Abex Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777339\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/236/#p241\">\n    27 N.Y.3d 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 241,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777339\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/236/#p241\">\n    32 N.Y.S.3d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6777339\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/27/236/#p241\">\n    51 N.E.3d 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). And in\n   <em>\n    Sukljian v. Charles Ross &amp; Son Co.\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals extended strict liability to \"certain sellers, such as retailers and distributors,\" for \"products ... sold in the normal course of business.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"75963\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/69/89/#p95\">\n    69 N.Y.2d 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=511%20N.Y.S.2d%20821\">\n    511 N.Y.S.2d 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=503%20N.E.2d%201358\">\n    503 N.E.2d 1358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986).

A survey of New York cases reveals that in the vast majority of opinions, \"whenever the term 'distributor' was used, or a distribution contract was discussed, the terms were used in the context of an entity selling the product in question, the product having been purchased by the distributor either from the manufacturer or a distributor higher in the selling chain between the manufacturer and the ultimate consumer.\"\n   <em>\n    McCormack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201643590\">\n    2011 WL 1643590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (collecting cases). For example, in\n   <em>\n    Spallholtz v. Hampton C.F.
