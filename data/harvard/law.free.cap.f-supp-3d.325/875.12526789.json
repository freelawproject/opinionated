Defendant moves to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) or, in the alternative, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (R. 13, Mot.) For the reasons set forth below, the motion is granted, and this action is dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff is a resident of Illinois and a \"consumer\" within the meaning of the FDCPA. (R. 1, Compl. \u00b6 6.) Defendant collects consumer debts owed to other entities and individuals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) Plaintiff incurred a debt for back-due rent and fees, which due to her financial circumstances, she could not pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) After the debt went into default, the creditor retained Defendant to collect on the debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Defendant then filed a lawsuit against Plaintiff in the Circuit Court of McLean County, Illinois, entitled\n   <em>\n    Young America Realty, Inc. v. Chatman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20S.C.%201267\">\n    14 SC 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"state court action\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant was ultimately awarded a default judgment against Plaintiff in the state court action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) On or about August 19, 2016, \"Defendant obtained a warrant against Plaintiff for failure to make an appearance in court or to set up payment arrangements[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Plaintiff claims that the warrant was \"invalid\" because, prior to its issuance, she was \"not provided the opportunity to appear in court to show cause for why she should not be held in contempt\" as required by Illinois law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17 (citing 735 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/12-107.5 ).) On or about August 22, 2016, Defendant sent a letter to Plaintiff referencing the debt and stating in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Jasmine-it has been requested that a warrant issue for your arrest due to your failure to appear in court on August 19, 2016. Please contact this office regarding payment of the above balance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21; R. 1-1, Letter at 2.) After receiving this letter, Plaintiff obtained an attorney, who contacted Defendant to advise that the warrant was \"improper.\" (R. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) Defendant then had the warrant withdrawn on the basis that Plaintiff had \"made arrangement for payment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24; R. 1-2, Mot. to Recall Warrant at 4.) Plaintiff claims she nevertheless \"experienced negative emotions\" as a result of Defendant's actions, \"including fear of answering the door, embarrassment when speaking with family or friends, feelings of hopelessness, pessimism, guilt, worthlessness, [and] helplessness [.]\" (R. 1, Compl. \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Based on these events, Plaintiff filed this action in August 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20S.C.%201267\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) She asserts one count that has two parts: First, she claims that Defendant used \"unfair and unconscionable means\" to collect a debt in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f when\n   he obtained \"an invalid warrant to arrest a consumer for the purposes of collecting a debt.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) Second, she claims that Defendant \"used false, deceptive, or misleading representations\" in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e\"when Defendant represented an invalid warrant as valid for the purposes of collecting on an alleged debt.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss under either Rule 12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(6). (R. 13, Mot.) Defendant first argues that Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue her claim because she obtained a discharge of her debts in bankruptcy in September 2017 and failed to schedule any claim against Defendant in her bankruptcy schedules. (R. 14, Mem. at 3-5.) Defendant further argues that, even if Plaintiff has standing, her claims are barred by the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine because she is essentially \"asking a lower federal Court to declare that the state court issued an order in violation of Illinois law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Alternatively, Defendant moves for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), arguing that Plaintiff cannot state a claim under the FDCPA based on the state court's issuance of a warrant, or based on Defendant notifying her of the state court's order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-13.) Plaintiff objects to dismissal, arguing that she properly disclosed the claim in the bankruptcy case and that her claims are independent of the state court proceeding such that they are not barred by\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   (R. 18, Resp. at 4-12.) She further argues that she has adequately stated claims for relief under the FDCPA based on the invalidity of the warrant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-16.) The matter is now ripe for adjudication. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 25, Reply.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A Rule 12(b)(1) motion tests whether the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction.
