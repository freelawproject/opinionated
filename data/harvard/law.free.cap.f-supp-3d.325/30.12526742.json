The Court's opinion addressed two arguments that RAKIA made in support of its motion to dismiss: (1) that this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to entertain Azima's suit because RAKIA is entitled to sovereign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\"FSIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and (2) that Azima's suit should be dismissed under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   in favor of litigating this case in London, England, because Azima\n   and RAKIA had previously entered into a settlement agreement that contained a forum-selection clause designating London as the forum for any disputes over the contents of that settlement agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, this Court rejected both arguments, concluding that it has subject-matter jurisdiction under the commercial activity exception to the FSIA, and that RAKIA's\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   argument was meritless, because RAKIA had not carried its heavy burden of establishing that London was, in fact, an adequate alternative forum to hear this case, nor had RAKIA demonstrated that the balance of public and private interests (including the settlement agreement upon which RAKIA relied) weighed in favor of having this case heard in London,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    at 173-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   RAKIA has since filed an interlocutory appeal regarding this Court's FSIA determination, as it is clearly authorized to do under the collateral order doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Agudas Chasidei Chabad of U.S. v.

Cir. 2008). Apparently, RAKIA also wishes to appeal this Court's Order denying RAKIA's motion to dismiss for\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , and to this end, before this Court at present is a motion that Rakia has filed to ask this Court to certify its\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   ruling for interlocutory appeal in accordance with section 1292(b) of Title 28 of the United States Code. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. of Law in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Certification of March 30, 2018 Order (\"Def.'s Mem.\"), ECF No. 45 -1, at 5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In its Section 1292(b) motion, RAKIA has asked this Court to certify its prior\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   order for interlocutory appeal with respect to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   three controlling issues of law: (i) whether the Courts of England, where a parallel proceeding is already underway between the parties in the High Court of Justice (the \"High Court\"), is an adequate forum for Plaintiff's claims; (ii) whether the law of England offers an adequate legal remedy to Plaintiff; and (iii) whether a mandatory forum selection clause directs the parties to litigate this dispute in the High Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (Def.'s Mem. at 5.) RAKIA contends that certification of this Court's ruling regarding these three pivotal\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   issues is appropriate \"because [certification] meets each of the elements of [ section] 1292(b), and is the most efficient path forward given the already-pending appeal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) Thus, RAKIA maintains that this Court's ruling with respect to these issues and its ultimate conclusion about\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   raises \"controlling question[s] of law\" that permit a \"substantial ground for difference of opinion[,]\" and that the resolution of that question may \"materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van Cauwenberghe v.

Azima opposes RAKIA's certification request, arguing primarily that the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   issue presents no substantial ground for difference of opinion-as the standard for interlocutory review requires-and that, therefore, certifying the case for interlocutory appeal is improper at this point in time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n to Def. RAKIA's Mot. for Certification (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\"), ECF No. 46, at 6-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Having considered the parties' arguments and the law surrounding section 1292(b) certification motions, this Court has concluded that RAKIA's section 1292(b) motion for certification must be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . In this Court's view, there is no substantial ground for difference of opinion regarding the controlling issues of law that RAKIA has identified with respect to\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   or this Court's ultimate conclusion that the complaint should not be dismissed on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds, which means that the legal standard for certifying the March 30, 2018 Order for interlocutory appeal has not been met. However, even in the absence of a certification from this Court, RAKIA still has the option of petitioning the court of appeals to exercise its \"pendent jurisdiction\" over the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   issue in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part II,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 8-9 (noting that RAKIA may make such a petition).)

First, it concluded that RAKIA had not carried its \"heavy burden\" of establishing that the United Kingdom constituted an adequate and alternative forum, because: (1) RAKIA was entitled to sovereign immunity in English courts and\n   had been \"careful to avoid making any representation that it would necessarily consent to the High Court's jurisdiction with respect to the claims that Azima makes in the instant case[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Azima\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524740\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/305/149/#p154\">\n    305 F.Supp.3d at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and (2) RAKIA had not \"demonstrated that the United Kingdom offers an adequate remedy for the injuries Azima ... complained of in this case[,]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524740\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/305/149/#p154\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524740\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/305/149/#p154\">\n    at 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, this Court concluded that, even if RAKIA had shown that England constituted an adequate alternative forum, it had failed to establish \"that the balance of public and private factors has a strong tilt towards a particular forum[,]\" in large part because this Court read a forum-selection clause in an unrelated settlement agreement executed by the parties to be unequivocally inapplicable to the instant case,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524740\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/305/149/#p154\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524740\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/305/149/#p154\">\n    at 175-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); therefore, there was no reason to disturb Azima's choice of forum,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524740\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/305/149/#p154\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524740\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/305/149/#p154\">\n    at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And RAKIA's certification motion does not establish that there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion with respect to any of these aspects of this Court's\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Beginning with this Court's conclusion that RAKIA failed to demonstrate that English courts provide an adequate forum because RAKIA enjoys the prospect of sovereign immunity in the United Kingdom and has not yet waived its sovereign immunity with regard to Azima's pending claims, RAKIA has pointed to no case within this district or outside of it that would suggest that RAKIA would not in fact enjoy sovereign immunity within the English court system. Indeed, it acknowledges at every turn that RAKIA would presumptively enjoy sovereign immunity in that forum. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 13; Reply Mem. in Further Supp. of Mot. for Certification of March 30, 2018 Order (\"Def.'s Reply\"), ECF No. 47, at 9.) RAKIA's tack is instead to contend that a substantial ground for a difference of opinion exists as to whether this Court \"should have ... granted the motion to dismiss on the express condition that [defendant] consent to the jurisdiction of the [foreign] court[ ].\" (Def.'s Mem. at 13 (first and second alterations in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 9-10.) But here, again, RAKIA's section 1292(b) motion comes up short: while RAKIA has shown that other courts within this district and outside of this circuit\n   <em>\n    are willing\n   </em>\n   to dismiss a case on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds conditionally, it has not pointed to a single case suggesting that a district court\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   conditionally dismiss a case, and, in fact, cases within this circuit clearly suggest that a district court need not do so.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    El-Fadl v.

Thus, far from demonstrating that there is a substantial difference of opinion regarding whether or not this Court can refuse to dismiss a case conditionally on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds, past precedent clearly indicates that a district court's decision to grant a conditional\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   dismissal-or not-is entirely discretionary, and therefore, the Court's determination that RAKIA's sovereign immunity in the English High Court prevented (and, for the current moment, still\n   prevents) England from serving as an alternative forum is not the stuff of which 'a substantial different of opinion' argument in support of section 1292(b) interlocutory review is made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Similarly, this Court has found no substantial ground for a difference of opinion regarding whether this \"Court held RAKIA to an unreasonably high burden to demonstrate the availability of an adequate legal remedy for alleged computer hacking under English law[,]\" when it required more proof than Defendant's submission of portions of the U.K. Data Protection Act of 1998 and an opinion from the English High Court,\n   <em>\n    Gulati v. MGN Ltd\n   </em>\n   [2015] EWHC 1482. (Def.'s Mem. at 13-14.) There is certainly no dearth of precedent within the D.C. Circuit as to what sort of evidence a defendant must produce to establish the existence of an adequate remedy in a suggested alternative forum.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    El-Fadl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"693,3691621\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/75/668/\">\n    75 F.3d at 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To show the existence of an adequate alternative forum, the defendant 'must provide enough information to enable the District Court' to evaluate the alternative forum ...

And based on this Court's review, no case within the D.C. Circuit has ever held that a citation to an inapposite foreign law and a foreign case that merely establishes that a tort action is potentially available will satisfy the Defendant's heavy burden to establish the adequacy of a forum.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MBI Grp., Inc. v.

RAKIA has failed to point to a single case that interprets a similar clause in the context of a similar contract and comes to a different conclusion about whether the parties intended for a dispute of this nature to be litigated in a particular forum. And as noted, such disagreement among jurists is crucial to establishing a substantial difference of opinion for the purpose of section 1292(b) ; RAKIA's own rejection of this Court's interpretation of the instant contract (\n    <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n     see\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Mem. at 16-17) is insufficient to certify this issue for interlocutory appeal,\n    <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n     Singh\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8927600\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/383/99/#p104\">\n     383 F.Supp.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    104 ;\n    <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n     Judicial Watch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11373370\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/233/16/#p20\">\n     233 F.Supp.2d at 20\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In short, because RAKIA's certification motion provides no evidence of a circuit split, conflicting decisions among the judges in this district amidst a dearth of case law from the D.C. Circuit, or anything other than an attempt to revisit the previous, unsuccessful arguments that RAKIA has made with respect to the issues that RAKIA has identified regarding this Court's\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   ruling, there exists no substantial ground for a difference of opinion, and this Court cannot certify RAKIA's motion under section 1292(b) of Title 28 of the United States Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Notably, although this Court cannot grant RAKIA's motion to certify the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   issue for interlocutory review under section 1292(b), the Court does acknowledge that it would be most efficient for the court of appeals to address both the foreign sovereign immunity issue and\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   question in one blow. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 18.) As RAKIA has explained, \"RAKIA is already pursuing an interlocutory appeal\" with respect to this Court's FSIA ruling (Def.'s Reply at 5), and if section 1292(b)'s standards did not constrain this Court, it would readily agree to RAKIA's request for certification of the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   issue as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Thus, this Court urges RAKIA to request that the D.C. Circuit exercise its \"pendent appellate jurisdiction\" over the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   issue in this case. (Def.'s Mem. at 8-9.) To be sure, the D.C. Circuit \"exercises pendent appellate jurisdiction sparingly[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Gilda Marx, Inc. v.
