Hersh, Sr., a prisoner incarcerated at the Chester County Prison proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , brings this civil action against Michael P. Rellahan (a reporter), the Daily Local News, and Erin O'Brien (an Assistant District Attorney), based on allegations that they defamed him. Hersh also filed a Motion for Leave to Proceed\n   <em>\n    In Forma Pauperis\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 1). For the following reasons, the Court will grant Hersh leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and dismiss his Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A review of public dockets reflects that Hersh is awaiting trial on several burglary and related charges in the Chester County Court of Common Pleas.\n   <em>\n    See Commonwealth v. Hersh\n   </em>\n   , Docket Nos. CP-15-CR-0000060-2017; CP-15-CR-0000072-2017 &amp; CP-15-CR-0002071-2017 (Chester Cty. Ct. of Common Pleas). His wife Anita Lynn Hersh was also charged with burglary and related offenses, and pled guilty on September 6, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Hersh\n   </em>\n   , CP-15-CR-0002614-2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Complaint stems from an article written by Rellahan that appeared in the Daily Local News on July 27, 2018. The article, which is attached to the Complaint, reports that Anita Hersh had been charged with child abuse and noted her attorney's contention that her bail had been set exceedingly high, at $100,000. According to the article, when the attorney questioned the $100,000 figure, \"the prosecutor in the case told the judge that Hersh had been on bail at the time of her arrest on the child abuse charges for a string of home burglaries she and her husband allegedly committed in the southern and western Chester County areas in 2016.\" (Compl. ECF No. 2 at 11-12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The article quotes Erin O'Brien \"of the DA's Child Abuse Unit\" as defending the high bail because \"[Anita] Hersh had committed the alleged abuse while she was on bail for three burglary cases that involved her husband, Christopher Hersh, and another man, Jose Goynes [who appears to be identified as Hersh's brother].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) The article adds that Anita Hersh pleaded guilty to the burglary charges and is cooperating with the prosecution. It appears from the article and Complaint that Hersh and his wife are also facing burglary charges in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the Complaint, Hersh alleges that the article defames him by referencing him in connection with the allegations against his wife. He also believes that the article will prejudice him in his criminal cases. Hersh seeks $500,000 for defamation of character, release of an article \"amend[ing] the slander/defamation of character of [his] name,\" and \"seeking relief for jeopardizing [his] trial for the case(s) [he] is currently facing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court grants Hersh leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   because it appears that he is incapable of paying the fees to commence this civil action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Hersh is\n   proceeding\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   , the Complaint is subject to screening under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii).

July 25, 2018) (no stigma-plus claim where \"Curley's only alleged harm is his speculation that his chances for reelection may be harmed\"). But even if Hersh could establish a sufficient interest here to trigger due process protection, it is not clear why the protections afforded to him as a criminal defendant would be insufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Otto v.

Indeed, Hersh will presumably ask prospective jurors whether they have read any information in the newspaper about his criminal conduct to determine whether they are already familiar with his case or harbor any bias towards him in an effort to weed out jurors who might be prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To the extent Hersh is raising defamation claims under state law, he has not established a basis for this Court's diversity jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). That provision grants a district court jurisdiction over \"all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between ... citizens of different States.\" The complaint fails to establish that the parties in this case are citizens of different states for purposes of \u00a7 1332.
