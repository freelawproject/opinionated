Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Blue Earth, Inc. was a clean-energy startup formed in 2010 (\"Blue Earth\" or the \"Company\"). (Compl. \u00b6 2.) Blue Earth provided comprehensive energy efficiency and alternative/renewable energy solutions for small and medium-sized commercial and industrial facilities. (Ex. 2 at 4.) Defendant Johnny Thomas (\"Thomas\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   joined Blue Earth as its Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") on September 1, 2010 and served in that position until September 1, 2015, when he resigned to serve as CEO of a Blue Earth subsidiary. (Compl. \u00b6 6.) Thomas also served as president of Blue Earth from September 1, 2010, until May 16, 2013. He was appointed to Blue Earth's Board of Directors in February 2011, a position in which he served until September 1, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant John C. Francis (\"Francis\") joined Blue Earth as its Executive Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations on September 1, 2010, and served in that position until September 1, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.) Plaintiff Jackson Investment Group, LLC (\"Jackson\") is a private investment firm that invested in Blue Earth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the first quarter of 2013, Blue Earth had a net loss of over $1.8 million. (Ex. A at 3.) In its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2013, Blue Earth explained that it had \"not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern\" and that its survival depended on \"obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 n.2.) Blue Earth warned that \"[i]f the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In July 2013, Blue Earth acquired IPS Engineering Inc. (\"IPS\") and Global Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (\"GREG\"). This was Blue Earth's first foray into the combined heat and power (\"CHP\") business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) In announcing the acquisition, Blue Earth stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   IPS is an EPCM company (engineering, procurement, construction and management) and GREG is an affiliated renewable energy company, which companies specialize in the combined heat and power (\"CHP\") alternative energy space. The Acquisitions will enable the Company to become a significant independent power producer (\"IPP\"). The Company plans to build seven power plants and sell the thermal and electric power generated to one large customer and to local utilities through long-term power purchase agreements. The Company is funding permitting and remaining development tasks for the initial projects from a portion of the proceeds of a recent private placement, while finalizing project financing terms for the estimated total construction costs of the seven plants of over $120 million. Management anticipates that the projects will be financed primarily through project debt, which will allow the Company to maintain ownership of the projects without significant share issuances. Blue Earth is continuing to perform engineering tasks on additional power plants for the same customer, in anticipation of adding several more construction projects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Ex. 3 at 2.) Blue Earth also hired two founders of IPS, Robert Potts (\"Potts\") and Brett Woodard (\"Woodard\"). (Ex. 4 at 2.) Blue Earth named Potts as its COO and Woodard as its CFO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Woodard was responsible for overseeing \"financial analysis of acquisition, merger, and divestiture activities.\" (Ex. 5 at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the acquisition, Blue Earth added Michael Allman (\"Allman\") and James Kelly (\"Kelly\") to its Board of Directors and its audit committee. Allman was appointed chair of the audit committee and served as its \"financial expert.\" He\n   had experience as a CEO and CFO of various renewable energy companies and was certified both as a management accountant and internal auditor. Kelly had \"knowledge and experience in accounting, management and the energy industry\" and \"exclusive responsibility for multiple external audits and management reviews of energy company operations.\" (Ex. 6 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its quarterly and annual financial statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), Blue Earth disclosed its newly acquired CHP business. In its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2013 (first filing covering the period after the acquisition of the CHP business), which was filed on November 15, 2013, Blue Earth explained that \"the cost of the assets acquired [were] capitalized and allocated to the several projects to be constructed\" as \"Construction in progress.\" (Ex. 7 at 11.) Blue Earth explained in its annual report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2013, which was filed on March 3, 2014, that the assets accounted for as \"Construction in progress\" were \"[d]esigns for co-generation projects.\" (Ex. 2 at F-21.) The Form 10-K stated that the IPS purchase consisted of 15.5 million shares at $2.84 per share for a total of $44,035,500, resulting \"in a construction in progress asset of $44,029,229.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at F-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 2, 2014, the SEC sent a letter to Blue Earth asking for details about Blue Earth's decision to account for the projects as \"Construction in progress\" in Form 10-K. (Ex. 11 at 3.) More specifically, the SEC asked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   We note that you disclose your construction in progress represents designs for cogeneration projects. To help us understand whether the assets represent physical assets in construction or an intangible asset related to contract rights, please tell us in sufficient detail about the nature of the underlying assets. Also tell us the estimated costs to complete the seven co-generation projects, the expected source of funds for the projects, the current status of each project, and the estimated timing of beginning and ending each project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, on April 11, 2014, Thomas explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The underlying assets for the purchase of IPS/GREG are the designs and plans created by IPS/GREG to use natural gas to generate steam to power electrical generators in meat processing plants. The steam is secondarily used to butcher and process the meat. There were no contract rights existing beyond the right to build the plants at the time of the purchase of IPS/GREG. The Company is negotiating the purchase take off agreements with the local utilities for the excess electricity which they are required by law (PURPA) to accept at their avoided cost rate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The first project is on schedule to be turned on line in August 2014 with 4 more in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the remaining 2 in the first quarter of 2015. All of the projects have begun preconstruction work including siting and permitting as of this date. Equipment has been ordered and is being built for the first 5 projects. During ... the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company raised approximately $12 million (including $1,600,000 payable through promissory notes) in equity capital through the exercise of approximately four million registered Class A warrants at $3 per share. The primary use of the capital raise[d] will be to provide the equity component of project financing for the seven initial combined heat and power projects. The Company has non-binding\n   term sheets from an international bank and mezzanine debt providers that would result in approximately 8% equity and 92% project finance debt for the larger CHP power plants. The Company is negotiating with alternative financing services for various combinations of equity and debt project financing. To date, the Company is using cash on hand to advance the projects on schedule while deciding which of the various alternative sources of funding to use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Ex. 12 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 23, 2014, the SEC sent another letter requesting the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Given the significance of these assets, please amend to disclose the nature of the assets similar to your response [dated April 11, 2014]. Further, with a view towards disclosure, please summarize the significant terms of the agreements you acquired. Based on your response, it appears that you acquired contracts to construct seven gas-to-steam generator facilities at certain meat processing plants in the U.S. and Canada. Also, revise your discussion of liquidity and capital resources in MD&amp;A to provide disclosure similar to your response with respect to the estimated costs to complete the seven co-generation projects, the expected source of funds for the projects, the current status of each project, and the estimated timing of beginning and ending each project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Ex. 13 at 3.) In response, on May 12, 2014, Blue Earth amended its Form 10-K to include the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Our business model is to construct and own, on a customer's site under a long term lease, CHP or cogeneration systems, selling the thermal power to the customer and the electricity to the customer and the utility grid under long term power purchase agreements (PPAs). We have targeted large companies within the food-processing sector. To date, the Company has signed a letter of intent with a large U.S. and international protein provider to design, build and operate seven (7) CHP plants. We have invested significant revenues into the feasibility and permitting of these projects, have designed and ordered equipment for these projects and are negotiating and finalizing the various operating contracts. The PPA agreements with our customers will be on a take or pay basis at a guaranteed discount rate from what they currently pay to their local utility providers. To date, Blue Earth CHP has received limited revenue from engineering work done for a large food processor. Revenues from the sale of electricity generated, which is the foundation of this business unit, are expected to commence in the third quarter of 2014, when the first power plant is scheduled to be completed. The Company raised adequate equity to build this first power plant through its $12 million warrant exercise in November of 2013. In December 2013, the Company ordered generators, costing approximately $6.1 million for two power plants for which the total cost is expected to be approximately $17 million. The Company is making the equipment installment payments and construction costs from cash on hand, while selecting among several project debt financing options. The Company will install, own and operate the systems at two food-processing facilities selling thermal and electric power to the customer and the local utility under 20 year power purchase agreements, none of which have been signed. The units are modular, so construction is primarily assembly that is expected to be completed with power revenues commencing in or about August of 2014. In March 2014, the Company ordered generators costing approximately $17.6 million for three power plants, for which\n   the total cost is expected to be approximately $67 million. These facilities are expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2014. Although these are the Company's first CHP power plants, Blue Earth team members have extensive experience building many larger, more complex CHP power plants with prior employers. The Company also employs large engineering companies for selected engineering and procurement activities as budgeted and planned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Ex. 14 at 6.) Blue Earth did not change the characterization of the CHP assets as \"Construction in progress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at F-3.) In addition, as in the previous reports, the amended Form 10-K explained that the $44 million represented the value of \"designs for co-generation projects\" and \"the costs accumulated on 7 gas to steam/electricity co-generation projects in the United States and Canada.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at F-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In a prospectus filed on May 14, 2014, Blue Earth reiterated the status of the CHP plants at that time, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   To date, the Company has signed a letter of intent with a large U.S. and international protein provider to design, build and operate seven (7) CHP plants .... We have continued to negotiate these operating contracts while all of the foregoing work has been carried out and expect to enter into the initial contracts in the near term ..... The Company will install, own and operate the systems at two food-processing facilities selling thermal and electric power to the customer and the local utility under 20 year power purchase agreements, none of which have been signed. The units are modular, so construction is primarily assembly that is expected to be completed with power revenues commencing in or about August of 2014 .... In the event that the Company is unable to reach a definitive agreement with the intended customer or the customer is otherwise unable to commence commercial operations, the CHP equipment purchased is generic to virtually all CHP projects; the design work is usable for other potential customers and only a small amount of expenditures is site specific and would be written off ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The purpose of the Company's acquisition of IPS Engineering Inc. (IPS) and Global Renewable Energy Group Inc.(GREG) was to acquire the plans and development of the above described CHP projects. As a result of this acquisition, the percentage of the Company's total assets represented by construction in progress assets of $44,029,229 at December 31, 2013, was approximately 51%. The Company recognized revenues of $11,444 and a net loss of $319,931 for the year ended December 31, 2013 from IPS and GREG.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Ex. 15 at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2014, which was filed on May 16, 2014, Blue Earth changed its characterization of the CHP assets from \"Construction in progress\" to \"Property &amp; equipment.\" (Ex. 8 at 3.) In its Form 10-Q's balance sheet, the bulk ($32,769,573 of $34,761,615) of the \"Property &amp; equipment\" line item was allocated to \"Cogeneration plants (under construction).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) The balance sheet listed that Blue Earth had a total of $88,192,692 in assets, that $33,745,418 of those assets-or 38% of all assets-were \"Property and equipment, net,\" and that another $12,581,570 of the assets-or 14% of all assets-were \"Construction in progress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It also explained that \"[d]epreciation of the cogeneration plants will commence when the plants are placed in service during the latter part of 2014 and early 2015.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The report further explained: \"Although the Company has a limited operating history and limited revenues in comparison\n   to the size of the projects it has undertaken, as a result of the Company's acquisitions, it is fully staffed with experienced personnel who have previously built many larger complex power plants. Our first CHP plant is expected to be completed in August 2014 with power revenues commencing thereafter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In June 2014, an investment-management consultant approached Jackson about investing in Blue Earth. (Compl. \u00b6 16.) The consultant assembled presentation materials on Blue Earth's business plans and finances, which included information from Blue Earth's consolidated balance sheet in Blue Earth's Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Based on the Form 10-Q's balance sheet, the presentation stated that Blue Earth had a total of $88,192,692 in assets, that $33,745,418 of those assets-or 38% of all assets-were \"Property and equipment, net,\" and that another $12,581,570 of the assets-or 14% of all assets-were \"Construction in progress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Based on the presentation, Jackson believed that Blue Earth had over $33 million in tangible revenue generating assets and over $12.5 million more actually under construction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.) On June 20, 2014, Jackson bought $2.5 million in Blue Earth stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ending June 30, 2014, which was filed on August 14, 2014, Blue Earth characterized all of the CHP assets as \"Property &amp; equipment.\" (Ex. 9 at 3.) In its Form 10-Q's balance sheet, the bulk ($46,658,436 of $48,694,732) of the \"Property &amp; equipment\" line item was allocated to \"Cogeneration plants (under construction).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) The balance sheet reflected that Blue Earth had a total of $88,615,910 in assets and that $47,653,535 of those assets-or 53% of all assets-were \"Property and equipment, net.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It also explained that \"[d]epreciation of the cogeneration plants will commence when the plants are placed in service during the latter part of 2014 and early 2015.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The report further explained: \"Although the Company has a limited operating history and limited revenues in comparison to the size of the projects it has undertaken, as a result of the Company's acquisitions, it is fully staffed with experienced personnel who have previously built many larger complex power plants. Our first CHP plant is expected to be completed in September 2014 with power revenues commencing thereafter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On August 28, 2014, Blue Earth announced the first executed CHP agreement to \"design, build, finance, own and operate a $29 million ... co-generation power facility\" in Alberta, Canada. (Ex. 16, Attach. 99.1 at 1.) Starting in early September 2014, Jackson directly exchanged emails with Thomas and Francis. (Compl. \u00b6 23.) Neither Thomas nor Francis disclosed that the \"Property &amp; equipment\" asset on the balance sheet solely consisted of the non-binding term sheets to discuss the possibility of building seven cogeneration plants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Nor did they explain how they and Blue Earth had calculated the valuation. Jackson continued to believe, incorrectly, that Blue Earth had tens of millions of dollars in tangible, revenue-generating property and equipment and had even more on the way. Jackson therefore invested another $4,017,095 through November 14, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.) On November 14, 2014, Blue Earth filed Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.) On the balance sheet, at least $44,035,000 of the $52,248,308 labeled as \"Property and equipment\" represented the CHP assets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Days later, Thomas and Francis met with Jackson's senior representatives to solicit an additional investment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.) During the meeting, defendants stated that Blue Earth had real, tangible assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because Jackson continued to believe that Blue Earth had tens of millions of dollars of tangible, revenue-generating \"Property &amp; equipment,\" on November 25, 2014, Jackson made another $10 million equity investment in Blue Earth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.) Jackson did so through a Common Stock Purchase agreement with Blue Earth that Thomas signed and that certified the accuracy of Blue Earth's SEC filings. That agreement also stated that Jackson was \"relying on the representations, acknowledgments and agreements made by\" Thomas in the agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39.) On December 3, 2014, Blue Earth announced work on the second CHP project, a $5.3 million CHP plant in Sumter, South Carolina, which it expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2015 (the \"Sumter Plant\"). (Ex. 17, Attach. 99.1 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On or about February 18, 2015, a key potential investor in Blue Earth suddenly changed the terms by which that investor would make the investment. (Compl. \u00b6 131.) The new terms were \"very unacceptable,\" according to a memorandum Thomas sent to Jackson, copying Francis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thomas wrote that the sudden breakdown of that potential investment placed Blue Earth in a \"vulnerable\" and \"precarious\" position and that Blue Earth \"urgent[ly]\" needed money to pay key vendors to continue construction on a cogeneration plant. Thomas added that the \"timelines required to meet the urgent needs\" \"clearly limit[ed Blue Earth's] options\" in finding an alternative investment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thomas also said that finding \"an investor or investment group that can/will step into the place of the\" prior potential investor was \"[c]learly ... in the best interest of\" Blue Earth and that a cogeneration plant Blue Earth was building would serve as collateral for Jackson's \"investment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 40, 41.) Thomas and Francis called, emailed and met with senior Jackson personnel to solicit an investment and to press the case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40.) Thomas and Francis emailed to Jackson Blue Earth's budgets for 2015-2017, which included a balance sheet that stated that Blue Earth had over $56 million in \"Net Fixed Assets\" out of over $98 million total assets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.) In addition, Thomas and Francis told Jackson that they had lined up another source of \"take-out financing\" that would quickly repay any new Jackson investment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49.) On March 3, 2015, Blue Earth filed its annual report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2014, which explained that \"[d]uring 2014 the Company commenced construction of the [CHP] projects accordingly the costs were reclassified to Property &amp; equipment.\" (Ex. 10 at F-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On March 10, 2015, Jackson and Blue Earth signed a Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement, which Thomas signed on behalf of Blue Earth (the \"March Note\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50; Ex. 23.) Under the agreement, Jackson paid Blue Earth $10 million for a 12% senior secured convertible note from Blue Earth, principal and interest of which were convertible to Blue Earth common stock at $1.00 per share; a warrant to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Blue Earth common stock at $1.00 per share; and the option to purchase up to 10,000,000 shares of Blue Earth common stock at $1.00 per share. (The conversion price and warrant and option exercise prices were later changed to $1.02 per share.) (Compl. \u00b6 50.) Additionally, under the agreement, Blue Earth issued 200,000 shares of Blue Earth stock to Jackson as a \"closing commitment fee.\" The note had a maturity of six months due to Thomas's and Francis's representation that take-out financing was lined up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The agreement incorporated by reference Blue Earth's SEC filings and contained representations that the filings were prepared in compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\n   (\"GAAP\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.) In a press release, Thomas described the deal as an \"investment\" to fund plant construction and to provide working capital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53.) Under the terms of the March Note, the loan was secured by substantially all of Blue Earth's assets. (Ex. 23 at 2.) In addition, Blue Earth was required to obtain Jackson's consent to any future equity fundraising. (Ex. 23, Attach. 10.1 \u00a7 8.15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On April 1, 2015, Blue Earth announced completion of the Sumter Plant. (Ex. 18, Attach. 99.1 at 1.) On September 1, 2015, Thomas and Francis resigned their positions at Blue Earth to run EnSite Power, Inc., Blue Earth's subsidiary that focused on battery backup technology. (Ex. 19 at 2). Robert Powell (\"Powell\") succeeded Thomas as CEO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Powell had worked at SunEdison, Inc., the world's largest renewable energy development company, had been CFO of both NRG Renew and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company, and was a partner at Arthur Andersen LLP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In September 2015, after defendants had resigned from Blue Earth, and Blue Earth failed to repay the March Note, Jackson and Blue Earth agreed to refinance the March Note through a 15% senior secured note for $10.6 million (the \"September Note\"). (Compl. \u00b6 70; Ex. 24, Attach. 10.2.) Powell signed the September Note on behalf of Blue Earth. (Ex. 24, Attach. 10.2 at 13.) In the agreement, Blue Earth represented that the earlier 10-K and 10-Q were accurate and GAAP compliant. (Compl. \u00b6 71.) Blue Earth used the proceeds to pay the March Note in full. (Ex. 24 at 2.) The terms of the March and September Notes provided that \"No oral or written representations have been made other than as stated in this Agreement or in a Transaction Document.\" (Ex. 23, Attach. 10.1 \u00a7 6.8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On October 13, 2015, defendants again emailed Jackson a copy of a proforma balance sheet that repeated that Blue Earth had millions of dollars in \"Property &amp; equipment.\" (Compl. \u00b6 75.) Later that month, Jackson invested $4,940,000 in return for a 9% senior secured note, relying on the \"Property &amp; equipment\" and \"take-out-financing\" representation. (the \"October Note\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 78, 80.) It was due in December 2015, with principal and interest totaling $5,154,508. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78.) The proceeds were to buy back shares of Blue Earth that the Company had sold to investors only a week before. (Ex. 25 at 2.) Powell signed the October Note. (Ex. 25, Attach. 10.1 at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In December 2015, when Blue Earth was unable to pay back the October Note, Jackson completed another note purchase that refinanced the October Note and included an additional $2 million investment from Jackson that would provide \"working capital\" (the \"December Note\"). Jackson received 704,842 shares of Blue Earth stock and a warrant to purchase additional shares. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 81, 83.) Powell signed the December Note on behalf of Blue Earth. (Ex. 26, Attach. 10.1 at 13.) The no-reliance provisions contained in the September Note also applied to the October and December Notes. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 79, 84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On March 1, 2016, after Blue Earth failed to make the scheduled payments, Jackson sent Blue Earth a notice of default. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88.) This prompted Blue Earth to announce that it would seek to restructure under the Federal bankruptcy laws. (Ex. 27 at 2.) Blue Earth filed for Chapter 11 reorganization a few weeks later. Powell's declaration submitted with the petition stated that the purpose of the filing was to initiate a \"debt-for-equity swap\" with Jackson. (Ex. 28 \u00b6 26.) The restructuring plan converted Jackson's debt into equity and made Jackson the sole shareholder of the reorganized company. Thus, once the restructuring plan was approved by the bankruptcy court, Jackson\n   owned all of Blue Earth's assets. (Ex. 29, Attach. A at 32.) Rick Jackson, the principal of Jackson, was named sole director of the new entity, Brightmark Energy (\"Brightmark\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Attach. A at 38.) Jackson kept Powell as CEO and retained Potts as a consultant to the new entity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Attach. E at 1; Ex. 20 at 4.) Additionally, Jackson pledged an initial equity and debt commitment of up to $250 million to Brightmark. (Ex. 1 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On November 28, 2016, Jackson filed this lawsuit claiming that each of the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act (\"Section 10(b)\"), Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder (\"Rule 10b-5\"), and various state laws. Plaintiff further claims that the individual defendants are \"controlling persons\" of Blue Earth as defined by Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act (\"Section 20(a)\"), and are therefore individually liable for Blue Earth's alleged violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. The core allegation is that Thomas and Francis incorrectly accounted for Blue Earth's CHP assets incorrectly as \"Property &amp; equipment\" in its financial statements between May 2014 and December 2015. Plaintiff also alleges that in February 2015, Thomas and Francis falsely represented that Blue Earth had \"lined up take-out financing\" for Jackson's loans. Plaintiff contends that because Blue Earth did not in fact have $44 million in tangible property and equipment, Blue Earth had few assets Jackson could foreclose upon to recover its investments in the bankruptcy. Jackson states that its equity investments were wiped out and that it recovered only a fraction of its debt investments, resulting in a $20 million deficiency.

Plaintiff alleges that Blue Earth made false and misleading statements by classifying CHP assets as \"Construction in progress\" and \"Property &amp; equipment\" in its 2014 and 2015 financial statements. Plaintiff alleges that defendants manipulated the accounting for the acquisition of the CHP assets to make it appear that Blue Earth had acquired sizeable real assets that could spur growth and that they treated the aspirational plans as a discrete asset on Blue Earth's Form 10-Q balance sheet by calling it \"Construction in progress\" implying that Blue Earth was building productive assets. (Ex. 7 at 3; Compl. \u00b6 18.) On that balance sheet, defendants valued the \"Construction in progress\" at $44 million (over 56% of Blue Earth's total assets) and internally valued each potential plant at $6.3 million. (Compl. \u00b6 18(a), (c).) The $44 million figure was the full value of the stock Blue Earth had issued in the IPS/GREG acquisition, which was disclosed in a note. (Ex. 7 at 11 n. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that defendants' accounting for Blue Earth's acquisition of IPS and GREG and the construction \"plans\" violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), Under GAAP, an acquirer records as \"goodwill\" the fair value of the consideration it pays for an acquiree, except that the acquirer may record a separate value for any separately \"identifiable assets\" acquired. FASB ASC 805-30-1, 805-20-25-1. An asset is separately \"identifiable\" only if (1) it is \"separable\" and thus \"capable of being sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged,\" or (2) it \"arises from a contractual or other legal rights.\" FASB ASC 805-10-20. Under those GAAP rules, plaintiff\n   argues that Blue Earth should have accounted for nearly the entire $44 million purchase price as mere \"goodwill,\" not as the plans' value, because the plans were not separately \"identifiable assets\" with their own value and were not contracts that were transferable or that created \"legal rights.\" In addition, without explanation, the report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2014, reclassified some of the term sheets as $33,745,418 in \"Property and equipment, net.\" (Ex. 8 at 3.) Under GAAP, \"[p]roperty, plant, and equipment typically consist of long-lived tangible assets used to create and distribute an entity's products and services and include ... Land and land improvements[;] Buildings[;] Machinery and equipments[; or] Furniture and fixtures.\" FASB ASC 360-10-05-3. Plaintiff contends that the assets should have been classified as \"intangible assets\" because they lacked a \"physical substance,\" and Blue Earth had virtually no tangible property and equipment and had not contracted to build any plants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In opposition, defendants assert that the complaint does not adequately plead that Blue Earth's accounting treatment for the CHP assets was incorrect. Defendants point out that GAAP's definition of \"property and equipment\" in FASB ASC 360-10-05-3 is not exclusive in that it only spells out \"typical\" situations. In addition, defendants assert that the benefits of an agreement in principle to construct revenue-generating power plants can be transferred and therefore are \"identifiable\" under GAAP. Furthermore, under the accounting guidance for the initial measurement of \"property and equipment,\" the cost of an asset includes the cost to bring it to \"the condition ... for its intended use\" and \"the activities necessary to bring it to that condition.\" FASB ASC 360-30-1. FASB ASC 360-10-20 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   The term activities is to be construed broadly. It encompasses physical construction of the asset. In addition, it includes all the steps required to prepare the asset for its intended use. For example, it includes administrative and technical activities during the preconstruction stage, such as the development of plans or the process of obtaining permits from governmental authorities....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   FASB ASC 360-10-20. Accordingly, as it began construction, acquired permits, and requisitioned materials, Blue Earth classified the assets as \"Property &amp; equipment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Moreover, \"[a]ccountants long have recognized that 'generally accepted accounting principles' are far from being a canonical set of rules that will ensure identical accounting treatment of identical transactions.

Ohio Mar. 26, 2002). Here, other than plaintiffs disagreement after the fact, there is no allegation that anyone disagreed with Blue Earth's accounting of the CHP assets at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As set forth in detail above, the SEC examined the disclosures and accounting related to the CHP assets and accepted Blue Earth's explanation that the assets were term sheets and plans to build plants. Blue Earth's response letter dated April 11, 2014, to the SEC stated: \"There were no contract rights existing beyond the right to build the plants at the time of the purchase of IPS/GREG.\" (Ex. 12 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Although plaintiff claims that Thomas misled the SEC by stating that \"[a]11 of the projects have begun preconstruction work including siting and permitting as of this date [and e]quipment has been ordered and is being built for the first 5 projects,\" the complaint does not allege that these facts were not true at that time. (Compl.\u00b6 109; Ex. 12 at 5.) Following the SEC correspondence, Blue Earth amended its 2013 10-K to supplement the information it had previously disclosed about the CHP assets and added that \"the Company has signed a letter of intent with a large U.S. and international protein provider to design, build and operate seven (7) CHP plants.\" (Ex. 14 at 6.) The SEC never suggested that the accounting was incorrect or that it should be changed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   There is no allegation that Blue Earth's audit committee ever concluded or suggested that the assets were misclassified. There is no allegation that Powell, who succeeded Thomas as CEO and who was a former CFO and partner at Arthur Andersen, ever questioned the accounting. Blue Earth continued to classify the CHP assets as \"Property &amp; equipment\" in its financial statements, which were signed by Powell as CEO and interim CFO. (Ex. 20 at 3, 28.) Blue Earth's Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2014, was restated twice with Powell as CEO of Blue Earth. Each time, Blue Earth's outside auditors reviewed and signed off on the financial statements, which were ultimately signed by Powell and the Board. But neither restatement had anything to do with accounting of the CHP projects. The amount of assets identified as \"Property &amp; equipment\" never changed. (Ex. 21 at F-1-F-3, 81; Ex. 22 at F-1-F-4, 81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In support of its argument that defendants were aware of their accounting error, plaintiff points to an \"internal accounting document Blue Earth produced in bankruptcy [that] labels the seven potential cogeneration plants as representing a total of $44,035,502 in intangible value.' \" (Compl. \u00b6 42(a).) The complaint does not allege who prepared this document. Nor does it allege when or even whether Thomas or Francis ever saw it. The complaint also does not allege that the document raised questions or concerns about whether the CHP accounting was incorrect. The document, which was created after December 31, 2015, did not exist at the time of the alleged false statements or when Thomas and Francis were employees of Blue Earth, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75(c).) As such, the document does not indicate that defendants were aware of their alleged accounting mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff also cites to a confidential witness, a senior Blue Earth executive (the \"CW\"), who purportedly claimed that \"the classification of the term sheets on Blue Earth's balance sheet was a topic of extensive discussion\" and that \"Thomas and Francis were both directly involved in the decision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 121.) Plaintiff fails to allege that anybody raised a concern during the \"extensive discussion[s]\" that the accounting for the CHP asserts was incorrect. There is nothing improper about the people within Blue Earth discussing the matter extensively to determine the proper accounting of the CHP assets.

The court would also have to assume that defendants held onto their Blue Earth stock, suffering substantial losses, even though they purportedly knew that Blue Earth was a sham. The court further would have to assume that defendants believed that plaintiff, a sophisticated investor, would ignore the company's public disclosures as to the status of the CHP plants, even though the assets made up more than half of the company's value.
