CORRIGAN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The issue of whether an insurance bad faith claim, joined by amendment to the underlying coverage action, may be removed more than a year after the original action began has divided my colleagues, and the Eleventh Circuit has not weighed in. I must now take a side. The case is before the Court on Plaintiff Jennifer Ann Hawkinson's Motion to Remand (Doc. 6), to which Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company filed a response (Doc. 7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 24, 2012, nineteen year old Hawkinson was a passenger in a car when it was hit by Brian Peters, an uninsured motorist driving under the influence. (Doc. 2 \u00b6\u00b6 5-6). As a result of the accident, Hawkinson suffered severe and permanent injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hawkinson claimed coverage under two State Farm automobile insurance policies: her own policy provided for $25,000 of uninsured motorist coverage benefits, and her parents' policy provided stackable uninsured motorist coverage limits of $250,000 per person and $500,000 per accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 6 at 2). After State Farm denied her claim for uninsured motorist coverage under her parents' policy, on November 19, 2013, Hawkinson filed a two count Complaint against Peters, a Florida citizen, and State Farm in the Fourth Judicial Circuit Court, in and for Duval County, Florida, alleging negligence against Peters (Count I) and an uninsured motorist coverage claim under her parents' policy against State Farm (Count II). On December 11, 2013, she served a Civil Remedy Notice, which notified State Farm that by denying her claim, it was not acting fairly and honestly toward its insured. (Doc. 6-1). Once State Farm failed to cure the notice in the sixty-day window, the prerequisite for Hawkinson's bad faith claim was established. (Doc. 6 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following a bench trial on February 4, 2016, the state court found Hawkinson was an insured under her parents' policy. (Doc. 6-2). Further, on April 22, 2016, the court granted Hawkinson's amended motion for leave to file an amended complaint, which included a claim for punitive damages against Peters and a claim of bad faith against State Farm under Florida Statute \u00a7 624.155.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The AC was filed in state court on April 25, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 2). State Farm unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the bad faith claim, which was abated pursuant to a court order dated August 8, 2016. (Doc. 6-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 3, 2016, Hawkinson and State Farm signed a Stipulation for Entry of Final Judgment and Temporary Stay of Execution, granting Hawkinson compensatory damages, final judgment on her uninsured\n   motorist claim against State Farm, and attorneys' fees and costs. (Doc. 6-5). The court entered Final Judgment on Hawkinson's uninsured motorist claim (Count II) November 18, 2016, thus resolving all matters related to Count II. (Doc. 6-6). State Farm appealed the Final Judgment to the First District Court of Appeal, and on March 8, 2018, that court affirmed coverage, granted Hawkinson attorneys' fees, and remanded that issue for resolution regarding the amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 6-7). Hawkinson filed a motion to lift abatement of the bad faith claim in state court on March 9, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 7-2 at 2). On April 5, 2018, State Farm removed the bad faith claim (Count III), invoking this Court's diversity jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Doc. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hawkinson filed a motion to remand on April 30, 2018, arguing that removal is untimely, State Farm waived any right to remove, and piecemeal removal is impermissible. (Doc. 6). State Farm opposes the motion (Doc. 7), which is ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Hawkinson argues that the action giving rise to the bad faith claim was initially filed in state court on November 19, 2013; State Farm was served on November 27, 2013. (Doc. 6 at 8). As a result, she contends that State Farm had until November 27, 2014-one year after the commencement of the case-to file its notice of removal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   State Farm contends that the \"separate and independent action for statutory bad faith\" commenced on the date it accrued (March 8, 2018), when the judgment in the underlying uninsured motorist action became final (Doc. 1; Doc. 7 at 13), as opposed to the date the original complaint (November 19, 2013) or AC alleging the bad faith claim (April 25, 2016) was filed. Using March 8, 2018 as the operative date for removal purposes, State Farm argues its notice of removal filed on April 5, 2018 was timely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 7 at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Despite State Farm's arguments to the contrary, the Court agrees with Hawkinson-this case was not timely removed and remand is therefore required. The case was not initially removable because the parties were not diverse. And, because the case was not initially removable, it was subject to the one-year removability restriction. State Farm removed the case within thirty days of the state appellate court affirming the trial court's ruling on the uninsured motorist claim. However, this case was not removed within one year of the commencement of the action. Strict construction of the removal statutes dictates that State Farm may not remove the case five years after its commencement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee v. Allstate Indem.

That may be, but Congress placed limits on federal courts' jurisdiction to hear cases arising under state law as a matter of comity. While the one-year time limit may seem \"arbitrary and unfair,\" such a limitation is \"an inevitable feature of a court system of limited jurisdiction that strictly construes the right to remove.\"\n   <em>\n    Russell Corp. v.

The crux of the procedural catch-22 rests with the Florida state courts, which apparently permits plaintiffs to amend the action for underinsured motorists benefits post-verdict instead of requiring the filing of a new action. That the post-verdict addition of a bad faith claim inserts a separate and distinct claim contrasted with the [uninsured motorist] claim is hardly debatable. However, unless and until Florida courts require the commencement of a new action or Congress acts to amend the removal statute, this\n   Court can only apply \u00a7 1446 as drafted-imposing a one-year limitation that begins with commencement of the action-to the vagaries of state procedural practice prior to removal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Barroso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831725\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/958/1344/#p1346\">\n    958 F.Supp.2d at 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After remand has been effectuated, the Clerk shall terminate all pending deadlines and motions, and close the file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE AND ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   in Jacksonville, Florida the 23rd day of July, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Brian Reynolds Peters is also named as a defendant in the Amended Complaint (\"AC\") (Doc. 2) filed in state court, but he is not a party to the removed bad faith action. (Doc. 1 at 2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The Background has been taken primarily from the allegations in the AC (Doc. 2) and the factual background of the motion to remand (Doc. 6).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Hawkinson was entitled to benefits under her parents' insurance as she was attending college on April 24, 2012. (Doc. 6 at 2 n.1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    It appears as though neither party included the April 22, 2016 Order on Plaintiff's Amended Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint Asserting Claim for Punitive Damages Against Brian Peters, though both parties rely on it. Nevertheless, the Court obtained the Order from the state court clerk.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The AC alleged negligence against Peters (Count I), an uninsured motorist claim against State Farm (Count II), a bad faith claim against State Farm (Count III), and a count for punitive damages against Peters (Count IV). (Doc. 2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Hawkinson states that the AC was deemed filed as of June 24, 2014 (Doc. 6 at 4), citing Exhibit C (Doc. 6-3) for support. The Court has reviewed Exhibit C and cannot find documentation stating the AC was deemed filed on that date.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    In addition, State Farm argues that Hawkinson is mistaken, and the AC was deemed filed on June 22, 2016, citing Hawkinson's Exhibit C and the state court order. (Doc. 7 at 3 n.1). However, the Court cannot find documentation confirming June 22, 2016 as a date filed for the AC either. The court's order directs Hawkinson to file her amended complaint \"upon entry of this order,\" and the file stamp shows the AC was filed on April 25, 2016, the date this Court shall use as the operative filing date for the AC.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The confusion outlined above is irrelevant to the Court's analysis here. Regardless of what date the AC is deemed filed, the case is due to be remanded.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    As of the date of the motion to remand, the issue of Hawkinson's appellate fees was unresolved. (Doc. 6 at 4).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The state court did not rule on Hawkinson's motion to lift abatement before removal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    In fact, State Farm had until November 19, 2014-one year after the action was commenced, not when State Farm was served-to remove the case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(1). This distinction, however, does not affect the Court's decision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    While it is not clear from the briefs that Hawkinson's motion to lift the abatement has been granted, it does not matter, because the latest date State Farm could have removed was November 19, 2014.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Because the Court finds that remand is appropriate based on Hawkinson's argument as to the untimeliness of removal, it need not address her arguments concerning waiver and piecemeal removal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
