Mr. Clark argues that Mr. Walker's recanting affidavit is admissible in this Section 2255 proceeding as a statement against interest under Rule 804(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Rule 804(b)(3) provides that a statement is not inadmissible under the rule against hearsay if the declarant is unavailable to\n   testify as a witness and is a statement that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (A) a reasonable person in the declarant's position would have made only if the person believed it to be true because, when made, it was so contrary to the declarant's proprietary or pecuniary interest or had so great a tendency to invalidate the declarant's claim against someone else or to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability; and (B) is supported by corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate its trustworthiness, if it is offered in a criminal case as one that tends to expose the declarant to criminal liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. EVID. 804(b)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

They also agree that the recanting affidavit constitutes a statement against Mr. Walker's penal interest because it could expose him to criminal liability for perjury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3766752,3755382\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/30/\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3766752,3755382\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/30/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   But the parties dispute whether Mr. Clark has shown that corroborating circumstances \"clearly indicate\" the trustworthiness of the affidavit for purposes of Rule 804(b)(3). Mr. Clark maintains that Ms. Johnson's testimony concerning the circumstances surrounding the creation of Mr. Walker's affidavit and the affidavit itself satisfy this test. In response, the United States relies on statements made by Mr. Walker to the two representatives of the U.S. Attorney's Office asserting that the affidavit contains false information and that Mr. Clark did in fact attack Mr. Walker on May 6, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The question under Rule 804(b)(3) is not whether Mr. Walker's affidavit is more credible than his trial testimony or more credible than what he told the two representatives of the U.S. Attorney's Office many years after trial. Nor is it whether the Court ultimately credits Ms. Johnson's testimony or the testimony of Mr. Hailey and Mr. Miller regarding the conversations they had with Mr. Walker. The corroboration that is required by Rule 804(b)(3)\"is not independent evidence supporting the truth of the matters asserted by the hearsay statements, but evidence that clearly indicates that the statements are worthy of belief, based upon the circumstances in which the statements were made.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Barone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"405359\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/114/1284/#p1300\">\n    114 F.3d 1284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1300 (1st Cir. 1997) (corroboration requirement not concerned with veracity of the in-court witness or credibility of witness who relayed out-of-court statement). Indeed, it is quite possible that all three witnesses are accurately and truthfully describing what Mr. Walker told them. After all, Mr. Walker has told many different versions of what transpired to\n   many different people-including the police and the jury. As the Advisory Committee stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   In assessing whether corroborating circumstances exist, some courts have focused on the credibility of the witness who relates the hearsay statement in court. But the credibility of the witness who relates the statement is not a proper factor for the court to consider in assessing corroborating circumstances. To base admission or exclusion of a hearsay statement on the witness's credibility would usurp the jury's role of determining the credibility of testifying witnesses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. EVID. 804(b) advisory committee's note. The question before the Court at this stage is whether the statement made by Mr. Walker to Ms. Johnson is supported by \"corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate its trustworthiness.\" FED. R. EVID. 804(b)(3). The Court concludes that this test is met here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   There is no dispute that Mr. Walker met with Ms. Johnson in 2014 regarding Mr. Clark's case and signed the affidavit that Ms. Johnson drafted in Mr. Walker's presence. There is also no dispute that the affidavit is notarized.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Haouari v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638442,6046941\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/350/\">\n    510 F.3d 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 354 (2d Cir. 2007) (rejecting unsworn letter from recanting co-conspirator); Memorandum Opinion,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Williams\n   </em>\n   , No. 91-0559 (D.D.C. Sept. 6, 1996), ECF No. 1615 at 22 (denying motion for new trial based in part on unsworn and undated letter from recanting witness). The circumstances under which Mr. Walker signed the affidavit are corroborated by the testimony of Ms. Johnson, a private investigator with over fourteen years of experience who obtained the affidavit from Mr. Walker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 20, 2016 Hr'g Tr. at 36. Ms. Johnson testified that she met with Mr. Walker in her office, elicited the facts from him in a conversational manner, and then wrote a detailed, ten-page affidavit for his consideration in his own words based on his account of the May 6, 2009 attack.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 39-40, 47. She testified that he provided the affidavit voluntarily and that he read, corrected, and initialed each page of the affidavit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . 39-47. Consistent with her standard practice, the affidavit was notarized that same day by a notary in her office building.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 39, 42. Ms. Johnson's testimony is supported by a review of the affidavit itself, which shows hand-written words corrected and stricken with Mr. Walker's initials next to each correction and his signature at the bottom of each page.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 2255 Mot. Attach 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The testimony of Mr. Hailey and Mr. Miller does not undermine the \"clear trustworthiness\" of the corroborating circumstances surrounding the creation of the recanting affidavit. Unlike the mine run of cases where courts have rejected recantations as untrustworthy, here Mr. Walker's affidavit was obtained by an experienced private investigator who testified under oath to the circumstances under which Mr. Walker signed the affidavit, which was then notarized. In contrast, Mr. Walker's statements to Mr. Hailey and Mr. Miller were not memorialized in a sworn affidavit. Furthermore, and importantly, Mr. Walker's statements to Mr. Miller and Mr. Hailey that he never conveyed any of the facts contained in the affidavit to Ms. Johnson, that she wrote it on her own in his presence, and that he did not read it before signing it are not credible. Where did Ms. Johnson get the facts to insert in a ten-page affidavit that she hand-wrote in Mr. Walker's presence if not from Mr. Walker? If she got them from someone else, why did she write the affidavit in Mr. Walker's presence? The detail and specificity of the facts in the affidavit suggest that they came from Mr. Walker during his meeting with an experienced private investigator,\n   not from the investigator herself. Whether what Mr. Walker told her was true or not is, of course, a separate question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court concludes that Mr. Walker's recanting affidavit meets the standard for trustworthiness under Rule 804(b)(3). Whether Mr. Walker's recanting affidavit is sufficiently persuasive to entitle Mr. Clark to Section 2255 relief is a separate question - one which the Court will consider at a hearing on the merits of Mr. Clark's Section 2255 motion. \"Matters such as the truth of what is asserted by [Mr. Walker's] hearsay statement[ ], the credibility of witnesses, and the weight to be accorded evidence\" are matters to be determined at the Section 2255 hearing.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    United States v. Barone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"405359\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/114/1284/#p1300\">\n    114 F.3d at 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the hearing, the Court will consider the testimony of Mr. Hailey and Mr. Miller if the United States chooses to call them as witnesses. Such hearsay testimony is sufficiently reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   IV.
