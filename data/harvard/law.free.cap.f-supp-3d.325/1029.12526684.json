Shortly thereafter she restored her GC-issued laptop computer as instructed by Cao.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This process allegedly removed all of Qiu's GC user files and wiped all the activity performed by Qiu on the computer during her employment at GC. Ayala Decl., Ex. A-2 \u00b6 33. On the same day, a user logged into Zhong's computer and attempted to restore the system to factory setting, but the restore failed to complete. GC Mot. at 16 \u00b6 68; Ayala Decl. \u00b6 5 &amp; Ex. A-2 \u00b6\u00b6 25, 37. Moye claimed that he saw Qiu enter Zhong's office that day. Moye Decl. \u00b6 14.

The Court disagrees. There are triable factual issues regarding whether Defendants knew or had reason to know that they had a duty to maintain secrecy of the li-foil idea as of July 26, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zhao 8/21/2017 Dep., 135:15-18, Ex. 60 at 1 (Zhao informing Zheng in an email dated July 26, 2015 that Zhong planned to file a patent on the new lithium doping technology, and Zheng's response); Zheng 9/29/2017 Dep., Ex. 13; Cao 6/20/2017 Dep., 106:3-108:3 (acknowledging that Zheng directed Cao to file the non-provisional\n   patent application), 111:6-9 (admitting that Zhong was \"the first person to suggest that you use multiple pieces of lithium foil on the negative electrodes\").

Plaintiffs' Breach of Contract Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   GC Defendants and Zheng argue that summary judgment is appropriate as to Plaintiffs' claim for breach of contract. Plaintiffs assert that GC breached the TLSA in at least two ways, including by: (1) using the Technology beyond the scope of the license; and (2) improperly sub-licensing the Technology to GC LLC. SAC \u00b6 24. Plaintiffs claim that GC LLC is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of GC LTD, and thus was not permitted to make use of ETI's Technology.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. to GC at 15. According to the GC Defendants and Zheng, it is beyond dispute that GC LTD owns GC LLC. Alternatively, even if GC LTD does not own GC LLC, GC Defendants and Zheng claim that Zhong waived her right to challenge GC LLC's use of the Technology because she initially authorized that use. GC Reply at 4. In response, Zhong claims that she only granted GC LLC permission because she relied on Zheng's statement that GC LLC was a subsidiary of GC LTD. Opp. to GC at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Genuine disputes of material fact preclude summary judgment. GC Defendants and Zheng rely for their ownership argument on a stock proxy agreement, through which Zheng and Harry Chen, owners of GC LLC, transferred certain interests in GC LLC to GC LTD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GC Mot. at 5 \u00b6 1; Zheng 9/29/17 Dep. at 99:17, 106:15; Dkt. No. 151-2 (\"Chen Decl.\"), Ex. 2 (\"Proxy Agreement\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to that agreement, executed November 26, 2014, GC LTD was to become a shareholder of GC LLC, while Zheng and Chen retained nominal ownership of that entity. Proxy Agreement \u00b6 3. Despite the existence of this agreement, Plaintiffs present evidence that creates a genuine dispute as to whether GC LLC was, in fact, a wholly-owned and operated subsidiary of GC LTD. For instance, GC Defendants' corporate counsel confirmed Zhong's understanding that GC LLC was \"a separate and different company\" from GC ITL. Dkt. No. 144-18 (Zhong explaining her understanding of GC LLC's status);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 144-3 (\"Moye 6/21/2017 Dep.\"), Ex. 39 (email from Moye to Zhong confirming Zhong's understanding of GC LLC's ownership status); Zhong Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. GC's corporate counsel also admitted in his deposition that GC LLC is \"not a wholly-owned subsidiary of GC Limited.\" Moye 6/21/2017 Dep. at 88:24-89:15, 40:8-9 (\"Q: Who owns General Capacitor, LLC? A. Jim Zheng proxy holds it on behalf of GC LTD.\"). Though by no means dispositive, Plaintiffs' evidence is sufficient at this stage to create a genuine dispute of fact that prohibits summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   GC Defendants' waiver argument likewise fails. A party waives a known right when it\n   <em>\n    intentionally\n   </em>\n   relinquishes that right after full knowledge of the facts.\n   <em>\n    Granite States, Ins. Co. v.

Determining whether Zhong had the requisite intent for waiver turns on Zhong's purported beliefs when she authorized GC LLC's use of the Technology. To the extent the GC Defendants present evidence to counter Zhong's claims, that evidence shows simply that a genuine factual dispute exists on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , GC Reply at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs' Claim for Inducement of Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   GC Defendants and Zheng also move for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' inducement of breach of contract claim. According to GC Defendants, Plaintiffs' inducement theory is legally untenable because, in short, it rests on \"an unsupportable argument that GC Ltd. induced a breach of its own contract.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GC Mot. at 19-20. Separately, Zheng relies on the \"manager's privilege\" to claim that he cannot be liable for inducing a breach of contract if the Court finds that such a breach occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zheng Mot. at 16-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To assert a claim for inducing a breach of contract, Plaintiffs must show: \"(1) a valid contract between plaintiff and a third party; (2) defendant's knowledge of this contract; (3) defendant's intentional acts designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual relationship; (4) actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship; and (5) resulting damage.\"\n   <em>\n    Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v.

Not only did GC Defendants fail to cite\n   <em>\n    ViChip\n   </em>\n   in their briefs, but that decision pre-dates\n   <em>\n    Nosal\n   </em>\n   by approximately six years (as Defendants acknowledged after the hearing).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 157 (\"Defendants' Notice of Correction Following Hearing\"). Because GC Defendants cannot succeed as a matter of law on their CFAA claim, the Court finds that summary judgment in Plaintiffs' favor is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For these reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motions for summary judgment. In addition, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment in Plaintiffs' favor on GC Defendants' CFAA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    For purposes of this order, Defendants GC LTD, GC ITL and GC LLC are collectively referred to as \"GC Defendants.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Defendants claim that GC LLC, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of GC LTD, was also a party to the TLSA.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , GC Mot. at 6.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Defendants object to Plaintiffs' translation of documents in paragraphs \"7, 17 a., b., c., and d., and 21 of the Zhong Declaration, and the purported English translations in Exhibits 1, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 referenced therein.\" Zheng Reply at 14. The Court has not relied on these translations for summary judgment purposes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Defendants object to Zhong's statement as improper because it \"makes a legal conclusion that the disclosure was made under the TLSA.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Zheng Reply at 14; Cao Reply 9-10. The Court relies on Zhong's statement only to the extent that it reflects her belief in the confidentiality of the disclosure to show that she took reasonable steps to maintain secrecy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Plaintiffs claim that Defendants belatedly produced the joint venture agreement between GC and China Aviation, which Defendants designated \"Confidential-Attorneys' Eyes Only.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    GC Opp. at 25. Plaintiffs accordingly request that the Court either deny Defendants' motions outright or provide Plaintiffs with additional time to \"contest the AEO designation, file a motion to seal, and to oppose the motions.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5631526\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/438/1087/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    At oral argument, the Court advised the parties to file a motion to seal if one was required pursuant to the parties' protective order. Neither party did so. The Court accordingly\n    <strong>\n     DENIES AS MOOT\n    </strong>\n    Plaintiffs' request. Similarly, Plaintiffs lodged several evidentiary objections in their opposition to Defendant Cao's motion for summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Cao Opp. 16-18. In reaching its disposition, the Court did not rely on those portions of the declarations and their supporting exhibits that Plaintiffs identified as improper or improperly disclosed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Defendants did not file an English translation of the agreement (which was originally in Chinese) along with their motion; instead, as acknowledged at oral argument, Defendants filed the English translation with a collective declaration in support of their reply briefs.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 151. The translated document is titled Stock Proxy Agreement Supplemental Agreement. In their February 14, 2018 filing, Dkt. No. 153, Plaintiffs objected to this exhibit on grounds that it was improperly authenticated (because the translator lacked personal knowledge), and violated the parties' protective order. Plaintiffs, however, fail to cite any support for their authentication objection. In addition, as set forth in footnote five, neither party filed a motion to seal the proxy agreement after being advised that they could do so. Even considering the agreement, however, disputes of fact regarding actual ownership preclude summary judgment in GC Defendants' and Zheng's favor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
