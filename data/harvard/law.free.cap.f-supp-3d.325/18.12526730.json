Mehta, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the court in an unusual posture. Strictly speaking, the court has before it the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment and a suggestion of mootness filed by Defendant Secretary\n   of Health and Human Services. But it is not the merits of Plaintiffs' claims that are at issue in these motions; rather, what the parties vigorously contest is the proper remedy to afford these Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs are five acute care hospitals who brought this action to seek review of a determination by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Provider Reimbursement Review Board that it lacked jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs' appeal. Plaintiffs' appeal to the Board challenged the amount of \"outlier\" payments Plaintiffs received in fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2012 on the ground that the federal Medicare regulations governing those payments violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and, as relevant here, requested that the Board grant \"expedited judicial review\" of Plaintiffs' APA challenge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board denied Plaintiffs' request for expedited judicial review, however, under what is known as the \"self-disallowance\" regulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is this decision by the Board that forms the basis for Plaintiffs' lawsuit, at least in its current form. Plaintiffs' challenge to the outlier regulations is not presently before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant does not seek to defend the Board's determination that it lacked jurisdiction to grant Plaintiffs' request for expedited judicial review. Instead, he asks the court-for a second time-to remand this matter to the Board so that it can confirm its jurisdiction and grant these Plaintiffs the expedited judicial review finding that the Board previously withheld. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, do not want a remand. They ask for greater relief. They want the court to\n   <em>\n    vacate\n   </em>\n   the self-disallowance regulation that the Board relied upon to deny them expedited judicial review. Such relief is warranted, they say, following this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart Hospital v. Burwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182319\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/131/\">\n    201 F.Supp.3d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2016), in which the court held that applying the self-disallowance regulation to dissatisfied providers, like these Plaintiffs, who assert a legal challenge to an agency regulation or policy that cannot be addressed by a fiscal intermediary is contrary to the Medicare statute. After the regulation is vacated, Plaintiffs maintain, the court could retain jurisdiction, freeing Plaintiffs to amend their Complaint to challenge the outlier regulation on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court previously rejected Defendant's request for a remand.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bayshore Cmty.

The landscape has changed, however, since the court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Three things have occurred. First, in his motion for summary judgment and remand, Defendant has offered a more fulsome explanation for why the Board did not apply\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   to Plaintiffs' appeal in the first instance. Defendant explains that the Board had no choice but to apply the self-disallowance regulation to Plaintiffs' appeal, notwithstanding the court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   , because \"the Board is constrained by the agency's existing regulations, which it lacks the power to overrule.\" Def.'s Cross-Mot. for Summ.

In denying Defendant's first motion for remand, the court did not appreciate this limitation on the Board's authority.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bayshore Cmty.

Authority, ECF No. 33, Ex. 1, ECF No. 33-1 [hereinafter CMS Ruling No. 1727-R]. The ruling \"states the policy of [CMS] concerning [its] decision to follow the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia's holding in [\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   ] for appeals of cost reporting periods that ended on or after December 31, 2008[,] and began before January 12, 2016[,] that were pending or filed on or after April 23, 2018.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In practical terms, the new CMS ruling means that the Board, generally speaking, now has jurisdiction to grant expedited judicial review to providers who, like Plaintiffs, did not follow the self-disallowance regulation by including a challenged item on a cost report \"due to a good faith belief that the [challenged] item was subject to a payment regulation or other policy\" as to which the fiscal intermediary had \"no authority or discretion to make payment in the manner ... sought.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Plaintiffs candidly acknowledge that CMS' acquiescence to\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   negates at least one form of relief that they originally sought: an injunction prohibiting the Board from applying the self-disallowance regulation to similarly situated providers in the future.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Resp. to Def.'s Suggestion of Mootness, ECF No. 37 [hereinafter Pls.'

Circuit recently decided\n   <em>\n    Billings Clinic v.

Cir. Aug. 10, 2018). In that case, multiple hospitals brought suit to challenge the agency's methodology for calculating a particular\n   component of their Medicare reimbursements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 302-03,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203910505\">\n    2018 WL 3910505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1. The Board granted expedited judicial review to some hospitals, but declined to exercise jurisdiction as to others, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to grant expedited review because those hospitals failed to comply with the self-disallowance regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 310-12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203910505\">\n    2018 WL 3910505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *8-9. With respect to the hospitals in the former category, the Circuit found that \"the district court properly exercised jurisdiction over [their] claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 312,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203910505\">\n    2018 WL 3910505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *9. With respect to the hospitals in the latter category, however, the Circuit observed that while the Secretary \"ha[d] since disavowed the Board's procedural objection to [their] claims in that case, that [left] unanswered whether the district court could proceed without first remanding for either a final decision or certification for expedited review from the Board.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203910505\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, the Circuit did not need to untangle this \"jurisdictional quandary,\" because some of the hospitals did have expedited-review certifications from the Board and because \"only non-individualized injunctive relief [was] sought.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203910505\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Billings Clinic\n   </em>\n   has obvious relevance to this case. Although the Circuit passed on resolving the jurisdictional inquiry, it clearly telegraphed that jurisdictional complications might arise should a substantive challenge to an agency policy or regulation arrive on appeal without proper Board certification.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203910505\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It would be careless for this court not to heed the Circuit's warning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In view of these events, and for the reasons that follow, the court reconsiders its denial of Defendant's initial motion for remand and finds that a remand to the Board, with instructions to follow\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   , as Defendant has agreed to do, is the appropriate remedy in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) provides that \"[a] court may revise its own interlocutory orders at 'any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties' rights and liabilities.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ofisi v.

As noted, when the court first denied Defendant's request for voluntary remand, the court did not recognize that the Board's decision not to apply\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   was appropriate. Accordingly, the concern that animated the court's initial decision-that \"Defendant is giving these Plaintiffs the run-around, rather than applying the law in a fair and just manner\"-is now alleviated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.

And, importantly, all indications are that if the Circuit were to resolve the \"jurisdictional quandary,\" it would conclude that the absence of a certification from the Board would mean that the district court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case. As Defendant points out,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 27, the Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Allina Health Services\n   </em>\n   observed that the pertinent Medicare statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   <em>\n    oo\n   </em>\n   (f)(1), \"\n   <em>\n    conditions\n   </em>\n   expedited judicial review in the district court on the existence of [the Board's] no-authority determination,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   on whether that determination is correct,\"\n   <em>\n    Allina Health Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276043\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/937/#p942\">\n    863 F.3d at 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (first emphasis added). The Circuit's use of the word \"condition\" leaves little doubt about the jurisdictional significance of securing expedited judicial review from the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To be certain, a remand will prejudice Plaintiffs, as even more time will pass before they receive judicial review of their underlying APA challenge to the validity of the outlier regulations. But that additional time is warranted. It will immunize Plaintiffs against jurisdictional challenges in this District Court-and before the Circuit-that would prove fatal to Plaintiffs' cause if successful. A remand for that purpose is time well spent. Moreover, the court, too, will benefit from returning this case to the Board. A remand will allow the case to \"come before the court in a posture that facilitates review on the merits,\" thereby obviating the need for \"judicial effort\" on jurisdictional issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ryan v.

They also fear that regulations prohibiting the reopening of Board determinations to apply new rulings will prevent the Board from issuing an expedited-review certification in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   CMS Ruling No. 1727-R at 9 (stating that the ruling \"is not an appropriate basis for the reopening ... of any decision by the [Board] or other reviewing entity\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1885\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)-(2) and, therefore, that \"reviewing entities may not reopen any ... decision with respect to the question of whether application of the self-disallowance jurisdictional requirement ... is foreclosed by any provision\" of the ruling).

Therefore, just as the Board did on remand in\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   , the Board here will be required to accept jurisdiction and grant expedited judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs also protest a remand because \"the Board will remain bound to apply the self-disallowance regulation and/or CMS Ruling as written,\" as \"it lacks any authority to do otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Resp. at 6. Plaintiffs describe this result as creating as a \"dilemma\" for the Board.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1885\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But a remand presents no dilemma as to\n   <em>\n    these\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs: the Board will grant their request for expedited judicial review. To the extent Plaintiffs' concern is for similarly situated providers, that worry is purely speculative and, in any event, is better resolved based on the factual circumstances of each individual case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, although Plaintiffs have pressed aggressively for vacatur as the proper remedy, such relief exceeds what is required to resolve the parties' dispute. For starters, as the court noted in\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   , under Circuit precedent, remand-not vacatur-is the preferred remedy where, as here, the agency has committed a legal error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182319\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/131/\">\n    201 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   143 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ne.

Cir. 2005) ) ). Moreover, the need for vacatur is diminished substantially\n   by Defendant's acquiescence to\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   and its issuance of CMS Ruling 1727. The self-disallowance regulation does not present the jurisdictional roadblock that it once did for those providers similarly situated to Plaintiffs. And, given Defendant's response to\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart\n   </em>\n   , vacatur at this point is only likely to create unnecessary administrative confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allina Health Servs. v.

Thus, vacatur is not an appropriate remedy in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court reconsiders its October 25, 2017, decision denying Defendant's original motion for voluntary remand, ECF No. 10,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. &amp; Order, ECF No. 21, and remands the case to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and with this court's August 19, 2016, Memorandum Opinion in\n   <em>\n    Banner Heart Hospital v.
