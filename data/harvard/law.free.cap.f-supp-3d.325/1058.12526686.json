BREYER, United States District Judge\n     The Court has sentenced Defendant Rose Perez to sixty months imprisonment following her conviction for possession with intent to distribute Methamphetamine in violation of\n     <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n      21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (a)(1) and \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). The first Presentence Report calculated Perez's Total Offense Level as 31, based, in part, on its determination that she qualified as a career offender under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2(b). At sentencing, Perez argued that the two prior convictions that the Presentence Report identified as the basis for this determination did not qualify as controlled substance offenses. The government did not disagree. This Court thus sentenced Perez on the understanding that Perez's Total Offense Level was properly calculated without the career offender enhancement, and was thus properly calculated as 28.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-9\">\n     Although the parties did not dispute at sentencing that Perez's prior convictions did not qualify as controlled substance offenses, this Court considers it prudent to state why it agrees that these prior convictions under California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11378 do not, in light of recent Ninth Circuit precedent, qualify as controlled substance offenses.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-10\">\n     <strong>\n      I. LEGAL STANDARD\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     The United States Sentencing Guidelines provide a sentencing enhancement for offenders who, while at least eighteen years old, commit a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and have \"at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). In determining whether a prior conviction qualifies as such a crime, courts employ what is known as the \"categorical approach.\"\n     <em>\n      United States v.

Under that approach, \"[i]f the statutory definition of the prior offense criminalizes conduct that would not constitute\" either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, then that prior conviction is not categorically a \"crime of violence\" or a \"controlled substance offense.\"\n     <em>\n      Leal-Vega\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3881825,3880566\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/1160/\">\n      680 F.3d at 1164\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-12\">\n     Courts then undertake what is, intuitively, called the \"modified categorical approach,\" in which courts \"determine whether the state law is divisible-i.e., whether the overly broad element sets out alternative means of committing a single crime or alternative elements of committing two or more distinct crimes.\"\n     <em>\n      Lorenzo v.

The Court held that under California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11378, the \"definition of methamphetamine is broader than the federal definition. Whereas the former includes geometric isomers of methamphetamine, the CSA does not. Accordingly, California law is facially overbroad under the first step in the categorical approach.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 935-36, at *5. The Court went on to conclude that \"California law demonstrates that optical and geometric isomers of methamphetamine are alternative means of committing a single controlled substance offense under California law,\" meaning that \"[t]he overly broad methamphetamine element, therefore, is not divisible.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 935-36, at *8. Because the modified categorical approach was therefore foreclosed, the Court held that California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11378 did \"not qualify as controlled substance offenses\" under\n     <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n      8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (a)(2)(B)(i).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-16\">\n     The inquiry, however, does not end with\n     <em>\n      Lorenzo\n     </em>\n     , because whether Perez has qualifying controlled substance offenses, such that she is properly deemed a \"career offender,\" turns not on\n     <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n      8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , which\n     <em>\n      Lorenzo\n     </em>\n     addressed, but rather U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2(b). The question then becomes whether\n     <em>\n      Lorenzo\n     </em>\n     's holding in the immigration context applies to the Sentencing Guidelines. And the answer, as\n     <em>\n      Leal-Vega\n     </em>\n     instructs, is yes.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-17\">\n     In\n     <em>\n      Leal-Vega\n     </em>\n     , the defendant argued that his prior conviction under California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11351, which criminalizes \"every person who possesses for sale or purchases for purposes of sale\" certain controlled substances, did not qualify as a predicate controlled substance offense under the Sentencing Guidelines.\n     <em>\n      Leal-Vega\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3881825,3880566\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/1160/\">\n      680 F.3d at 1163\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . He relied on a series of Ninth Circuit cases which held that provisions of the California Health and Safety Code were categorically overbroad, and thus did not qualify as controlled substance offenses under immigration law.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3881825,3880566\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/1160/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     at 1164-65 (citing\n     <em>\n      Ruiz-Vidal v.

The government urged the\n     <em>\n      Leal-Vega\n     </em>\n     Court to distinguish between the Guidelines and immigration law contexts and conclude that an offense that did not qualify as controlled substance offense for the purposes of immigration law could, nevertheless, qualify as a controlled substance offense under the Sentencing Guidelines.\n     <em>\n      Leal-Vega\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3881825,3880566\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/1160/\">\n      680 F.3d at 1166\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-18\">\n     Ninth Circuit rejected the government's argument. It explained that, just as in the immigration context, \"controlled substances offenses\" under the Sentencing Guidelines refers to substances set out in\n     the Controlled Substances Act.\n     <em>\n      Leal-Vega\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3881825,3880566\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/1160/\">\n      680 F.3d at\n     </extracted-citation>\n     1167 (citing\n     <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20801\">\n      21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801\n     </extracted-citation>\n     <em>\n      et. seq.\n     </em>\n     ).

Thus, because the Presentence Report identifies only Perez's two \u00a7 11378 convictions as the basis for its conclusion that she qualifies as a career offender, (Dkt. 24), and these two convictions do not qualify under the categorical approach as controlled substances offenses, this Court concludes that Perez does not qualify as a career offender.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-20\">\n     For the foregoing reasons,\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-21\">\n     <strong>\n      IT IS SO ORDERED.\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
