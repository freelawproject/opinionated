(\"Eastern\"). The court, having considered the motion, Eastern's response, the reply, the summary judgment evidence, the record, and applicable authorities, finds that the motion should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As recited in the court's memorandum opinion and order of April 20, 2018, plaintiff filed its complaint for declaratory relief against Eastern and ACE American Insurance Company (\"ACE\") on February 9, 2018. Doc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   39. Plaintiff alleges: ACE issued a commercial general liability insurance policy to Eastern and/or its parent company, U.S. Concrete, Inc. (\"U.S. Concrete\") for the policy period December 31, 2016, to December 31, 2017. Plaintiff issued a commercial umbrella insurance policy, No. TUU 2-53-45-62-18, (the \"policy\") for the same period under which U.S. Concrete and certain of its subsidiaries, including Eastern, are named insureds. Eastern contends that both the ACE policy and plaintiff's policy cover or potentially cover amounts it has paid or may pay in connection with a certain New Jersey pollution claim arising out of the discharge of rock\n   fines into the Spruce Run (as further described herein).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   With regard to Eastern, plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that (1) it has no duty to defend Eastern against the New Jersey pollution claim or to pay its defense costs; (2) it has no duty to indemnify Eastern against any liability arising from or relating to the New Jersey pollution claim; and (3) to the extent that plaintiff has any potential coverage obligations to Eastern in connection with the New Jersey pollution claim, its obligations are excess to coverage provided by the ACE policy. And, plaintiff seeks a judicial determination of the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to Eastern's claims for insurance coverage in connection with the New Jersey pollution claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Grounds of the Motion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff says that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the absolute pollution exclusion provision of its policy bars coverage for the New Jersey pollution claim. For the same reason, plaintiff does not, and will not, have any defense or payment obligations to Eastern. Further, Eastern cannot prevail on its counterclaims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Applicable Summary Judgment Principles\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the court shall grant summary judgment on a claim or defense if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The quarry manager failed to shut off the pumping before the rock fines began to be pumped into Spruce Run on July 29, 2017. As a result, substantial amounts of rock fines were pumped into Spruce Run. The pumping of rock fines into Spruce Run caused physical damage to the stream and stream bed by changing the flow and contours of the stream and filling in depressions in the stream bed. Up to two feet of rock fines were pumped into some portions of Spruce Run. As a result, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Bureaus of Coastal and Land Use Compliance and Enforcement and Water Compliance and Enforcement (\"New Jersey\") issued notices of violation dated July 31 and August 2, 2017.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546041\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/929/1054/#p1058\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PA 269.

As previously noted, the insurance policy was negotiated, brokered, and issued in Texas and this action solely concerns interpretation of that policy. Doc. 39 at 10-11. Eastern admits that its parent, U.S. Concrete, which is \"at home\" in Texas, purchased the policy. Doc. 55 at 17. The policy covers a group of risks that are scattered throughout the United States. For this reason, Texas courts would not give weight to the location of the insured risk in interpreting the pollution exclusion clause.\n   <em>\n    Reddy Ice Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9147733\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/145/337/\">\n    145 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   345 &amp; n.11.

That Eastern relies primarily on the third factor-relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue-is ironic, given its adamant denial that the release of the rock fines was pollution.
