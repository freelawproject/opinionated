Statement of Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   1. Neldon Johnson is and has been the manager, and a direct and indirect owner of, RaPower-3, LLC, International Automated Systems, Inc. and LTB1, LLC (among other entities). He is the sole decision-maker for each entity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   2. Johnson claims to have invented certain solar energy technology that involves solar thermal lenses placed in arrays on towers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   3. In or around 2006 through 2008, Johnson directed IAS to erect, at most, 19\n   towers on \"the R &amp; D Site\" near Delta, Utah, in Millard County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   4. Johnson also directed that IAS install solar lenses in those towers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   5. To make money from this purported solar energy technology, Johnson decided to sell a component of the purported technology: the solar lenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   6. Johnson recognized that his strength was not in sales, so he directed that IAS use independent sales representatives to sell lenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   7. Johnson drafted some promotional materials to describe the arrangement, \"IAUS Solar Unit Purchase Overview\" and IAS \"Solar Equipment Purchase.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   8. Johnson showed IAS salespeople these descriptive materials about the structure of the transaction, the purported technology, and the federal tax benefits that Johnson said a customer could lawfully claim when he bought a lens from IAS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   9. He told IAS's initial salespeople what he understood the tax laws to mean.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   10. R. Gregory Shepard has been an IAS shareholder since the mid-1990s.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   He became one of IAS's initial salespeople in or around September 2005, and began selling solar lenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   11. Shepard's information about Johnson's purported solar energy technology came from Johnson or members of Johnson's family, and Shepard's own observations on his site visits over the years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   12. Johnson told Shepard that a depreciation deduction and the solar energy tax credit are related to the sale of lenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   13. Johnson created, owns, and controls at least three entities that sell or have sold solar lenses: SOLCO I,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   XSun Energy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   and RaPower-3, LLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   SOLCO I and XSun Energy are not defendants in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   14. Johnson created RaPower-3 in 2010. He is it manager and the sole decision-maker for the company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   15. Once formed, RaPower-3, rather than IAS, sold solar lenses to individuals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   16. RaPower-3's only business activity is selling solar lenses through a multi-level marketing (otherwise known as \"network marketing\") approach to increase sales.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   17. Selling lenses through RaPower-3 gave Johnson \"much needed revenue\" to continue his operations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   18. Johnson directed RaPower-3 to create a site online (\n   <em>\n    https://rapower3.net\n   </em>\n   ) where a customer can access and sign a contract to buy lenses and sign other transaction documents that Johnson provides (described below).\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   19. Among other things, Shepard created the website www.rapower3.com\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   and moderates an online discussion board called \"IAUS &amp; RaPower[-]3 Forum.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   20. Shepard gets paid for his work with RaPower-3 through his company, Shepard Global.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   21. On the RaPower-3 website, Shepard describes the solar energy technology (including the solar lenses) and the transactions underpinning the solar energy scheme, promotes sales, and provides links to the website with the transaction documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shepard also uses the IAUS and RaPower-3 Forum and emails to communicate with RaPower-3 members and prospective members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   22. Shepard also organizes groups of people to visit the R &amp; D Site, the site where component parts of the purported solar technology system are manufactured (the \"Manufacturing Facility\"), and the site on a large field with a few semi-constructed component parts (the \"Construction Site\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   23. Shepard directs customers to use tax return preparers who are part of the solar energy scheme, like John Howell in Wichita Falls, Texas; Kenneth Alexander in Florida; and Richard Jameson in St. George, Utah.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   24. From 2009 through 2016, RaPower-3 had received at least $25,874,066 from its role in the solar energy scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   25. From 2008 through 2016, IAS has received at least $5,438,089 from its role in the solar energy scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   26. From 2011 through 2016, XSun Energy has received at least $1,126,888 from its role in the solar energy scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   27. From 2010 through 2016, SOLCO I has received at least $3,434,992 from its role in the solar energy scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   28. From 2005 through February 28, 2018, all lens-selling entities have received at least $32,796,196.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   29. Testimony at trial showed that the total sales price of lenses which appears to have been paid is at least $50,025,480.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   30. From 2008 through 2016, Shepard received $702,001 from his role in the solar energy scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   31. While selling the solar lenses, Defendants told customers they could buy \"lenses\" and claim tax benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   32. While they sold solar lenses and organized efforts to sell solar lenses, Defendants told their customers that if they bought a solar lens and signed the transaction documents Defendants provide, their customers were in the \"trade or business\" of \"leasing\" solar lenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   33. According to Defendants, because their customers are in the trade or business of leasing solar lenses, their customers are allowed to claim on their federal income tax returns a business tax deduction for depreciation on the solar lenses and a solar energy tax credit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   34. Defendants told customers that IAS, RaPower-3, or LTB \"placed in service\" or \"put into service\" their solar lenses in the year that the customers purchased the lenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   35. Starting in 2010, RaPower-3 sold lenses for a price of $3,500 per lens.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Johnson determined the price that RaPower-3 would charge for the lenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   36. Customers started purchasing lenses via the internet at rapower.net. On that site, a potential customer enters the number of lenses he wishes to purchase, and the website \"figures\" the amount the customer owes and the amount of the customer's down payment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   37. The site also provides all transaction documents for customers to sign electronically: an Equipment Purchase Agreement, an Operations &amp; Maintenance Agreement (\"O &amp; M\"), and, at times in the past, a bonus contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   38. Customers do not negotiate the price of a lens, or other terms of the transactions Defendants promote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   39. Over the years, Defendants told customers about Johnson's purported solar energy technology and the progress being made by Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants emphasized progress being made despite their knowledge that the system was not up and running.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   40. From the start, Defendants have told their customers that they can \"zero out\" their federal income tax liability by buying enough solar lenses and claiming both a depreciation deduction and solar energy tax credit for the lenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   41. Defendants knew that when they made statements to customers and prospective customers about the tax benefits and their purported solar lens leasing \"trade or business,\" that the only way a customer has ever \"made money\" from buying a lens is from the tax benefits; no customer has earned money from rental income or income from a bonus contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   42. LTB, which by contract was to operate and maintain the solar energy project and specifically the lenses, has never\n   done anything; it has never had a bank account, any employees, or any revenue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   43. Defendants told customers to expect income from the \"lease\" of their lenses, but Defendants know that no customer has been paid for the use of his or her lenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   44. Defendants' customers have been audited by the IRS for claiming the tax benefits Defendants promote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   45. Based on the advice and information provided by attorneys or accountants they spoke with about the solar energy scheme, Defendants knew or had reason to know that the purported tax benefits were not permissible under the Internal Revenue Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   46. Defendants also knew or had reason to know that the purported tax benefits from their solar energy scheme were not permissible under the Internal Revenue Code because others also disagreed with their assertions about tax benefits available from the solar lenses, including: customers' or prospective customers' tax preparers/CPAs, the Internal Revenue Service, the Oregon Department of Revenue, the Oregon Tax Court Magistrate Division, and the Department of Justice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   47. When a customer notifies Shepard that they are under audit, Shepard typically directs the customer to Enrolled Agents John Howell or Richard Jameson to represent the customer before the IRS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Howell and Jameson represent RaPower-3 customers using the same arguments that Defendants make.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   48. Shepard has also advocated for customers under audit before the IRS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   He has given customers the arguments to make before the IRS and documents to submit while under audit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   49. Johnson is paying the attorneys' fees for all customers whose tax benefits have been disallowed on appeal by the IRS and who have filed petitions in Tax Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   50. Defendants have caused serious harm to the United States Treasury as a result of their solar energy scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants' customers claimed at least $14,207,517 of improper tax refunds as a result of Defendants' scheme for tax years 2013 through 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   51. To date, Johnson, Shepard, IAS and RaPower-3 continue to organize sales of solar lenses, and participate (directly and indirectly) in the sale of solar lenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   52. They are not deterred from promoting the scheme, not by the IRS' disallowance of their audited customers' depreciation deductions and solar energy tax credits or by the complaint filed in this case or by the announced result in the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The injunctive relief requested by the United States - in the form of an asset freeze and appointment of a receiver - is necessary or appropriate to enforce the Internal Revenue Laws.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207402\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court has the authority to impose an asset freeze and appoint a receiver to take control of Defendants IAS and RaPower-3's assets and business operations..\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 7402(a) encompasses a broad range of powers necessary to compel compliance with the tax laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   Courts have exercised\n   this broad authority under \u00a7 7402(a) in a variety of contexts, including ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains against a tax return preparer engaged in fraudulent return preparation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   appointing receivers to assist in collection of federal tax liabilities or otherwise ensure compliance with the internal revenue laws,\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   and freezing a defendant's assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute alone provides sufficient authority to issue an injunctive order freezing Defendants' assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Examination of the typical factors in imposing equitable relief before final adjudication is not necessary but demonstrates the propriety - and necessity - of this action. In the Tenth Circuit, a party seeking a preliminary injunction must show 1) that there exists a substantial likelihood that the movant will prevail on the merits; 2) that the movant will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues; 3) that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and 4) that the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds that while\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207402\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) provides explicit authority for the relief requested, the United States, as the moving party, also meets its burden under the preliminary injunction standard for the relief requested.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The United States has succeeded on the merits.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For injunctive relief to be warranted under \u00a7 7408, the United States must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) Defendants organized an entity, plan, or arrangement; (2) Defendants made false or fraudulent statements concerning the tax benefits to be derived from the entity, plan or arrangement; (3) Defendants knew or had reason to know those statements were false or fraudulent; (4) the false or fraudulent statements pertained to a material matter; and (5) an injunction is necessary to prevent recurrence of this conduct. Alternatively, for injunctive relief to be warranted under \u00a7 7402, the United States must prove that an injunction is necessary\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   appropriate to enforce the internal revenue laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Court has found, the United States has proven that it is entitled to an injunction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207402\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and/or 7408. The\n   evidence adduced at trial shows that Defendants organized the solar energy scheme;\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   that Defendants made false or fraudulent statements about the tax benefits to be obtained from purchasing a solar lens;\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Defendants knew or had reason to know that their statements were false or fraudulent pertaining to a material matter,\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   namely the tax benefits of depreciation and solar energy tax credits. Further, Defendants have testified that they have no intention of ceasing their activity related to and sales of solar lenses. An injunction is necessary to prevent recurrence of Defendants' conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Disgorgement is also necessary or appropriate to enforce the internal revenue laws. Defendants profited from their scheme in the millions of dollars through money from the United States Treasury that was funneled through their customers. Defendants should not be permitted to retain their ill-gotten gains. The United States has shown that a reasonable approximation of their proceeds is at least $50,025,480. This Court has found that an injunction will issue and that disgorgement will be ordered. Thus, the United States has already succeeded on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The United States will suffer irreparable injury if an order granting the asset freeze and appointing a receiver is not issued.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The United States Treasury has already been greatly harmed by Defendants' scheme. Defendants continue to sell lenses to this day, and Defendants' customers continue to claim the tax benefits related to those lenses. If the injunctive relief requested is not granted, Defendants will have full unfettered access to the funds illicitly obtained to the detriment of the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants' entire scheme was geared to \"zero-out\" a customer's tax liability. Defendants requested customers make a down payment for their solar lenses of $1,050 per lens. The customers paid this with a $105 \"upfront fee\" and were asked to pay the remaining\n   amount\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   they received their tax refunds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants funded their entire scheme through funds that were \"redirected\" or diverted from the United States Treasury to their pockets though the money first went through the hands of their customers. The United States will not be able to recover all of the improper refunds paid to Defendants' customers. Defendants have been dissipating assets since they learned of the criminal investigation by the Internal Revenue Service no later than June of 2012\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   and throughout the course of this litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants have moved assets into foreign jurisdictions\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   and both Johnson\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Shepard\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   have taken steps to frustrate the collection of a potential disgorgement award. Without the relief requested, Defendants will continue in their attempt to frustrate the collection of any disgorgement this Court may award and thus irreparably injure the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The balance of harm to the United States in not issuing the injunctive relief outweighs the harm to be caused to Defendants by issuing the requested relief.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In evaluating this factor, courts look to whether the freeze itself will cause such disruption of defendants'\n   <em>\n    legitimate\n   </em>\n   business affairs that the assets would be destroyed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Defendants have no legitimate business. Defendants' solar energy scheme is an abusive tax scheme and not a legitimate business. Defendants do not operate the solar energy scheme - or any of the entities involved in the solar\n   energy scheme - in a businesslike manner. Defendants do not have any revenue or income aside from the sale of solar lenses. There is no harm to Defendants in prohibiting them from using ill-gotten gains to fund their technology experimentation and their personal expenses, including offshore arrangements that will be difficult to collect against. The United States however, and the taxpaying public, will continue to be harmed by the probable dissipation of Defendants' assets. The United States has a compelling interest in enforcing the tax laws and ensuring that persons promoting abusive tax schemes do not profit from their unlawful behavior.\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, the balance of harms weighs in favor of the United States and for relief to be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    D. An injunction will benefit, not disserve, the public interest.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The public interest is served by issuing the injunctive relief requested by the United States. The public has an interest in enforcement of the tax laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taxpayers have an interest in being protected from suffering the results of other taxpayers improper tax benefits. Defendants' activities do a disservice to the taxpaying public, undermining confidence in the fair administration of the internal revenue laws, and have cost the United States' Treasury over $14 million. Defendants should not be permitted to profit from their illicit activities. The public interest is also served in ensuring that Defendants do not dissipate assets that can be used to satisfy any disgorgement award this Court may order or otherwise compensate those harmed by Defendants' abusive tax scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    91\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

Defendants' solar energy tax scheme involves false or fraudulent statements and the possible dissipation of assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given Defendants' reluctance to cooperate in discovery regarding assets and ownership structure,\n   <footnotemark>\n    95\n   </footnotemark>\n   a receiver is necessary to enforce the internal revenue laws and determine and corral the assets Defendants have, regardless of their location.
