WOODLOCK, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Petitioner, Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc., (\"Ameriprise\"), has timely filed this action seeking to vacate an arbitration\n   award in favor of Respondent, Cheryle Anne Brady. For the reasons stated below, I grant the petition only in part, vacating so much of the award as purports to assess attorney fees against Ameriprise, but otherwise confirming the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. The Parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ameriprise is a national broker-dealer providing wealth management, securities trading, and investment banking services. It is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Brady has been a Registered Associate with FINRA or its predecessors at several broker-dealers since 1993. She worked for Ameriprise from January 2012 until her September 2016 termination as a result of unauthorized trades in June 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Unauthorized Trading Incident\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As Brady tells it, on June 20, 2016 her sales assistant, Brian Noyes, went rogue and engaged in several securities trades for clients without consulting those clients, as their account terms required. Brady contends she learned of the trades shortly after they were entered, questioned Noyes about the trades, and instructed him to \"fix this\". For its part, Ameriprise concluded after an internal investigation, and continues to maintain, that Brady directed Noyes to engage in the unauthorized trades.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In October 2017, at the close of FINRA's investigation, Brady signed a FINRA Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC) conceding that she lied to Ameriprise's Compliance Department (\"Compliance\") during its investigation of the trades. In response to a June 23, 2016 email inquiry from Compliance about the trades, Brady stated that she had talked to the clients on the day of each trade and told Noyes to make the trades. While she maintained this story on a second call with Compliance, she later told her assistant manager that in fact Noyes had entered the trades without her foreknowledge. Misrepresentations are understood to constitute a violation of FINRA Rule 2010, which provides that \"[a] member, in the conduct of its business, shall observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.\" In Brady's AWC, she conceded she violated FINRA Rule 2010 by making the misrepresentations to Compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about September 7, 2016, Ameriprise terminated Brady's employment and later filed a U5 termination form with FINRA stating the reason for Brady's termination was: \"The advisor was terminated on September 7, 2016 for policy violations including unauthorized trading and use of discretion in non-discretionary accounts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. The Arbitration\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Agreement to Arbitrate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the commencement of her employment with Ameriprise, Brady signed a Financial Advisor Agreement. In Part 12 of that agreement, she agreed, in relevant part, to \"arbitrate any dispute, claim, or controversy that [might] arise between [her] and the Company or a customer or any other person [\"Claims\"], unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties.\" That agreement also stated that Brady \"and [Ameriprise] shall each be responsible for their own costs of legal representation, if any except where such costs of legal representation may be awarded as a statutory remedy by the arbitrator.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Additionally, Brady took out loans from Ameriprise. The following clause is included in the notes for each loan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The undersigned Employee hereby ... agrees to pay all costs in collection, whether or not suit of action is filed hereon, in the event that payment is not made in accordance with the provisions of this Promissory Note. The costs of collection shall include but are not limited to reasonable attorney's fees for collection efforts which before commencing any legal proceeding, in arbitration, at trial, and on appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On or about October 26, 2016, Brady filed a statement of claim in FINRA Dispute Resolution (\"FINA DR\") for defamation, wrongful termination, breach of contract, tortious interference, and failure to supervise against Ameriprise and Noyes in connection with her termination. On or about November 17, 2016, Ameriprise filed a statement of claim in FINRA DR for breach of the promissory note agreement related to loans Brady had taken out from the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In late 2016, after filing their respective statements of claim, the Parties signed the FINRA Arbitration Submission Agreements for each claim. The Submission Agreement for Ameriprise's claim stated, in part: \"The party further agrees to abide by and perform any award(s) rendered pursuant to this Submission Agreement. The party further agrees that a judgment and any interest due thereon, may be entered upon such award(s) and, for these purposes, the party hereby voluntarily consents to submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction which may properly enter such judgment.\" The Submission Agreement for Brady's claim against Ameriprise and Noyes was the same, but addressed to \"parties,\" rather than \"party.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Selection of Arbitration Panel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Parties received Arbitrator Disclosure Reports from FINRA regarding possible arbitrators to fill the Arbitration Panel (\"Panel) of three that would preside over their dispute. FINRA sent three lists of ten potential arbitrators. The Parties could peremptorily strike up to four arbitrators from each list of ten FINRA offered, permanently removing those arbitrators from consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Just one disclosure report is relevant to the instant action: that of David Summer, who served on the Panel. Under \"Skills in Controversy,\" Summer listed \"Account Related - Breach of Contract, Account Related - Dividends, Executions Limit/Stop/Market Order, Employment - Breach of Contract, Employment - Discrim. Age, Employment - Employment Discrimination, Employment - Retaliation, Employment - Sexual Harassment.\" As to Arbitrator Background, Summer stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   From March 2004 to present I have represented clients in various courts and before the IRS in audits and other tax forums. From January 2001 to March 2004, I worked for PricewaterhouseCoopers in their International Tax Department. From September 1997 to January 2001, I worked as a litigator for two Boston law firms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Summer listed two law firms, Bologna &amp; Harris and Baker &amp; Associates, at which he was previously employed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Though the association was not listed on his disclosure form, Summer was also associated with Cutler &amp; Associates, a firm that advertises its plaintiff-side employment work. In addition, Summer has a litigation practice in employment law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Arbitration Award\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On or about December 26, 2016, Brady filed a Motion to Consolidate her claim, which had been assigned Case Number 16-03134, and Ameriprise's claim, which had been assigned Case Number 16-03368. In\n   March 2017, the Panel granted the Motion to Consolidate over Ameriprise's opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Panel issued an award in the consolidated matter bearing a January 23, 2018 date of service. It awarded compensatory damages to Brady in the sum of $675,000.93, costs of $80,000.00, and attorney fees of $123,712.00 from Ameriprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Panel also recommended that several entries on Brady's Form U5, which Ameriprise had been required to file with FINRA regarding Brady's termination, be changed. It recommended that the Reason for Termination be changed to \"Other\" and that the following explanation be added:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE. THERE IS NO CREDIBLE PROOF THAT MS. BRADY AUTHORIZED THE ALLEGED TRADES OR THAT SHE WAS INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGED PRACTICE FOR WHICH SHE WAS TERMINATED. MS. BRADY'S FIRING WAS PRETEXTUAL,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   AS THERE WAS NO HARM TO ANY CUSTOMERS AND NO CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS. THE TRADES WERE ALLOWED TO STAND AND BENEFITED AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. AND ITS CUSTOMERS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Panel further recommended changing the answers to questions 7B and 7F(1) on the form. Though not submitted in the record before me, Ameriprise represents that Question 7B on Form U5 asked whether Brady was \"under internal review for ... violating investment-related statutes, regulations, rules or industry standards of conduct\" at the time of her termination. Ameriprise also represents that Question 7F on Form U5 asked whether Brady was terminated after allegations were made that she violated \"investment-related statutes, regulations, rules or industry standards of conduct.\" The Panel recommended that the answers to these questions be changed from \"Yes\" to \"No\" based on the \"defamatory nature of the information.\" Such changes would not, however, be automatic; rather, Brady is obligated to submit the award to FINRA for its review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Brady's claim against Noyes was denied, as were the claims of Ameriprise against Brady.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    4.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Instant Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On February 21, 2018, Ameriprise filed the petition to vacate the arbitration award now before me.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

It claims that Summer did not disclose his affiliation with a law firm that does plaintiff-side labor work or his own employment practice, which it claims was active during the arbitration. Because it says it learned of Summer's employment work after the award, Ameriprise claims it was denied a fair opportunity to strike him on the basis of his \"clear bias and predisposition in favor of employees in wage and compensation disputes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For these purposes, \"[e]vident partiality is more than just the appearance of possible bias.

In order to determine if the arbitrators have exceeded their authority, courts \"look to the parties' contract to determine the powers the parties intended to bestow upon the arbitrator.\"\n   <em>\n    E. Seaboard Constr.

Since the award cites M.G.L. c. 251, \u00a7 10, it is clear that the Panel was aware of the law and believed it to be applicable. The issue then becomes whether the Panel exceeded its authority by manifestly disregarding the established statutory law of attorney fees as interpreted by the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   There are two sets of documents at issue here. One is Brady's Financial Advisor Agreement with Ameriprise. The other is the FINRA Arbitration Submission Agreements executed by the Parties. Brady does not challenge Ameriprise's view that the Financial Advisor Agreement does not provide for non-statutory attorney fees. That Agreement is clear in this regard: the Parties agreed that they are each \"responsible for their own costs of legal representation, if any except where such costs of legal representation may be awarded as a statutory remedy by the arbitrator.\" Nor does Brady argue that the FINRA Arbitration Submission Agreement itself provides for attorney fees. Rather, Brady argues for an alleged agreement consisting of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \"(1) Brady filed her statement of claim in FINRA arbitration No. 16-93134 against Ameriprise and Noyes on October 26, 2016 and Brady requested her attorneys' fees payable by Ameriprise; (2) Ameriprise then filed its statement of claim in FINRA arbitration against Brady\n   on November 17, 2016 and requested its attorneys' fees payable by Brady; (3) Both Parties signed two FINRA arbitration submission agreements at the same time agreeing to arbitrate all issues in those two respective arbitration claims.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   There is a line of cases that hold parties may expand an arbitrator's authority beyond that provided by their written agreement.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Notre Dame (USA) in Eng.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    TJAC Waterloo, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276144\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/287/#p294\">\n    861 F.3d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 294 (1st Cir. 2017) (stating that \"a party who does 'not reserve [an] issue' or contest the arbitrator's authority to decide it, but rather submits the issue to arbitration, 'cannot complain that the arbitrator [ ] reached it.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    JCI Commc'ns, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Int'l Bhd. of Elec.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , No. 02-17-00035-CV, --- S.W.3d ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20895602\">\n    2018 WL 895602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Tex. App. Feb. 15, 2018), a court found that the arbitrator did not exceed his power by awarding attorney fees where both sides submitted written requests for attorney fees, and signed a submission agreement, in which they each agreed to submit the matters contained in their pleadings to the arbitration panel. Additionally, each party in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   pursued the arbitral proceeding without contesting whether such facts could be awarded, including making additional submissions to prove up their respective fee requests.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20895602\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Kaplan v.

To be sure, both parties submitted statements of claim including attorney fees. But they did so in two related, but factually distinct, matters that were consolidated. Significantly, Ameriprise sought fees in relation to loans to Brady, whose notes included a clause that allowed attorney fees for Ameriprise. For the duration of the proceeding, Ameriprise disputed that an award for Brady's claim could include attorney fees; Ameriprise asserted in its prehearing brief that the Panel lacked the authority to award attorney fees in relation to the claims brought by Brady. Further, even if the award of attorney fees were made pursuant to the agreement related to Ameriprise's claim regarding the loans, the underlying agreement by terms only permitted Ameriprise to recover. I therefore find that no agreement existed as to attorney fees for Brady's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The lack of provision for attorney fees agreed to by the Parties does not end the inquiry. Brady argues that the Panel had statutory authority to award attorney fees pursuant to an exception to the general rule in M.G.L. c. 251, \u00a7 10. Brady points to the fact that one portion of her claim was made pursuant to M.G.L. c. 93A \u00a7 11, an unfair competition and consumer protection statute that allows attorney fees.\n   <em>\n    Drywall Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    ZVI Constr.

The award of attorney fees is required by \u00a7 11, and therefore overrides the effect of G.L. c. 251, \u00a7 10.\") Brady contends a section of the arbitration\n   award that references M.G.L. c. 93A \u00a7 11 is instructive. This argument fails. The arbitration award clearly states that \"Respondent Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. is liable for and shall pay to Claimant Cheryle Anne Brady the sum of $123,712.00 in attorney fees pursuant to Massachusetts G.L. Chapter 251, \u00a7 10,\" not under M.G.L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In any event, the Panel did not have authority to award attorney fees pursuant to M.G.L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has made clear that \u00a7 11 covers \"individuals acting in a business context in their dealings with other business persons...\" and \"does not provide a remedy for disputes arising out of an employer-employee relationship....\"\n   <em>\n    Psy-Ed Corp. v.

In her submissions, Brady appears to concede, as she must, that she had an employment relationship with Ameriprise, by stating she was \"employed\" by Ameriprise. The dispute presented to the Panel arose directly from the employer-employee relationship and the events that precipitated in June 2016, notwithstanding the fact Ameriprise published the U5 form after Brady was terminated. Given the parties' employee-employer relationship, M.G.L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11 is inapplicable and did not provide authority to award Brady attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In light of the above, I find that the award of attorney fees either exceeded the power of the Panel in violation of \u00a7 10(a)(4) and to that extent, if necessary, may be said to have been made in manifest disregard of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    4.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fraud in Violation of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n     9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Ameriprise argues that the award should be vacated because it was based on perjured testimony by Brady.

Ameriprise's claim meets none of those requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Ameriprise offers no evidence that Brady perjured herself beyond bare assertion. Further, Brady's statements that she did not direct the trades were made to Ameriprise before the arbitration (thus, putting Ameriprise on notice). In its prehearing brief, Ameriprise emphasized that it did not credit Brady's statements that she did not know of the trades when they occurred by observing that \"[w]hen Brady allegedly\n   'discovered' the unauthorized trades, she did not have the trades reversed and failed to report the trades to management.\" It is apparent the Panel resolved this factual dispute otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Ameriprise also asserts Brady perjured herself by testifying at the hearing that she had never been accused of unauthorized trading previously when there was evidence, stemming from Brady's conduct at a previous employer in 2005, to the contrary. Ameriprise has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence this historical matter was materially related the pertinent issue before the Panel: whether Brady was dismissed without cause for the events that transpired in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Given the lack of clear and convincing evidence for the contention that fraudulent activity procured the arbitral award, this is not a proper ground for vacatur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
