Hudson Surgical filed its first amended complaint two months later, in September (the \"FAC\"). [DE 17] Biomet answered the FAC that same month. [DE 19] On motion, the case was then transferred to this Court in November 2010 and then ordered stayed in December 2010, pending reexamination of the '541 patent before the United States Patent\n   and Trademark Office. During the stay, Hudson Surgical assigned ownership of the '541 patent to Puget Bioventures, LLC (\"Puget\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The stay was lifted in August 2017 following the reexamination, and the parties were ordered to exchange contentions and proceed with claims construction. On November 3, 2017, Biomet filed its Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. [DE 114] For the reasons stated herein, the Court will grant Biomet's motion in part and deny in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The '541 patent issued to Hudson Surgical on March 18, 2008. Only four months later, Hudson Surgical sent a letter to Biomet, informing Biomet of the '541 patent. The letter advised Biomet that Hudson Surgical believed the '541 patent covered several of Biomet's products. Subsequent alerts issued in 2010, when Puget sent Biomet charts demonstrating how Biomet's products were purportedly infringing on the '541 patent. Despite these warnings, Biomet took no steps to avoid infringement of the '541 patent. Specifically, Biomet designed, made, marketed, provided, distributed, and sold potentially infringing products to hospitals and surgeons, and in so doing, allegedly committed direct infringement of the '541 patent (specifically, patent claims 21-33 and 41-48). These products include Biomet's MIS TKA instruments and techniques. Furthermore, Biomet induced and contributed to infringement of the '541 patent by providing its infringing products to hospitals and surgeons, and by training surgeons to use said products (specifically, patent claims 1, 2, 5-13, 21-33, 41-48). Finally, Puget alleges that all of Biomet's purported direct and indirect infringement has been willful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) is subject to the same standard of review as a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    Gill v.

First, and most briefly, Biomet submits that many of the patent claims alleged in the FAC should be dismissed as unenforceable because they were cancelled during reexamination. Biomet also argues that claims 45 and 47 of the '541 patent are patent ineligible, and therefore Puget cannot\n   allege that Biomet infringed on those claims. Finally, Biomet maintains that the allegations of infringement are insufficiently pled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Cancelled Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The following claims of the '541 patent were cancelled during the reexamination: 1-30, 32, 34, 41-44, 46, 48, 53, and 54. [DE 118-5] Because of this, Biomet argues that Puget's infringement allegations regarding claims 1, 2, 5-13, 21-30, 32, 41-44, 46, and 48 should all be dismissed because those claims are unenforceable. The Court agrees. The Federal Circuit has made clear that \"when a claim is cancelled, the patentee loses any cause of action based on that claim, and any pending litigation in which the claims are asserted becomes moot.\"\n   <em>\n    Fresenius USA, Inc. v. Baxter Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755538\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/1330/#p1340\">\n    721 F.3d 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2013). So, Puget's infringement allegations based on any of the cancelled claims are moot and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SHFL Entm't, Inc. v. DigiDeal Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 729 Fed. App'x 931, 934 (Fed.

Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 645 Fed. App'x 1018, 1023 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (upholding the district court's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction because\n   <em>\n    Fresenius\n   </em>\n   rendered the suit moot as to the claims cancelled after reexamination) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CFTC v.

Puget does not oppose the dismissal of its allegations related to the '541 patent's cancelled claims in response to the instant motion. The Court will therefore dismiss these moot allegations for lack of jurisdiction, without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

As\n   <em>\n    dependent\n   </em>\n   claims, claims 45 and 47 include all of the limitations of the claims from which they depend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Markman v.

Claim 45 depends directly from independent claim 24, and claim 47 depends solely from claim 46, which itself depends solely from independent claim 24. Therefore, when the Court addresses claims 45 and 47, it addresses them in their \"entirety,\" which includes the language of claim 24 and (when applicable) claim 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The second\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   step requires the Court to \"examine the elements of the claim to determine whether it contains an inventive concept sufficient to transform the claimed abstract idea into a patent-eligible application.\"\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2355\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Step two is 'a search for an inventive concept-i.e., an element or combination of elements that is sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself.' \"\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures I LLC v.

The Court has independently verified that patent claims 45 and 47 are directed to the abstract idea of \"providing\" instrumentation and information on how to perform a medical procedure, and that they contain no inventive concept that transforms their nature into a patent-eligible application of that abstract idea. Because of this, the Court finds them ineligible under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

So, the Court lastly turns to whether Puget has sufficiently pled the remaining allegations in its FAC. As to its allegations of direct infringement, Puget concedes that those charges do not relate to patent claims 31 and 33. [DE 118 at 29] Thus, the scope of Puget's lawsuit at this point can be even further limited to the allegations that Biomet willfully induced and contributed to the infringement of claims 31 and 33 (indirect infringement). Biomet urges the Court to dismiss these allegations as well, for various reasons. First, Biomet argues that the amendments proposed during the reexamination of the '541 patent negate any\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   for indirect infringement. Second, Biomet maintains that Puget has not pled all the\n   necessary elements for induced and contributory infringement.

According to Biomet, proposing an amendment to avoid invalidity during reexamination \"voids the original claim and an accused indirect infringer cannot intend to induce or contribute to infringement of an invalid claim that no longer exists.\" [DE 115 at 28] Under this theory, the proposed amendments here wiped out their corresponding original patent claims, and so, Puget's 2008 and 2010 notices (which pertained to the original patent claims and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the amended claims) are irrelevant for the purpose of pleading the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   needed for indirect infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   But Biomet's position is squarely at odds with the established notion that amendments to claims during the reexamination process \"are not effective until the certificate issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Biomet Orthopedics, LLC v.

To hold otherwise, urges Biomet, \"would work an enormous injustice and undermine any public notice function in the patent examination process.\" [DE 122 at 18] However, those who read the very rules of patent examination procedure must know that a patent's original claims are not undone by\n   the proposal of amendments; the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure explicitly cautions that \"amendments are not legally effective until the reexamination certificate is issued and published.\" MPEP \u00a7 2234.
