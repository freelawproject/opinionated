KENNELLY, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The FTC alleges that Danny Pierce and Andrew Lloyd operated a deceptive marketing campaign on behalf of Michael Brown and Credit Bureau Center, LLC (CBC). The campaign directed consumers to CBC websites. The FTC alleges these websites misled consumers into enrolling in a monthly credit monitoring service that cost $29.94 per month. The FTC contends this conduct violated several consumer protection laws. Pierce and Lloyd agreed to entry of a preliminary injunction against them, and after an evidentiary hearing, the Court issued a preliminary injunction against CBC and Brown on February 21, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FTC v.

In these statements, the defendants have failed to provide \"a concise response\" to the FTC's statements of fact using \"specific references to the affidavits, parts of the record, and other supporting materials relied upon[.]\" LR 56.1(b)(3)(B).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malec v.

The FTC also offers facts that Brown received e-mails from particular parties involved in CBC's business that notified him of the Craigslist advertising scheme. Though the defendants' burden is to rebut these facts through contrary evidence that show the existence of a genuine factual dispute, the defendants have failed to do so. Instead they rely on an unsupported theory that it is the\n   <em>\n    customers\n   </em>\n   who were defrauding\n   <em>\n    CBC\n   </em>\n   by lying about the websites' deceptive character and other irrelevant or unfounded responses. This does not meet the requirements of Local Rule 56.1. Thus the Court deems as admitted Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Stmt. of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 57-61, 72-73, 80-82, 89, and 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. CBC and Brown\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Michael Brown is the owner, director, and sole employee of CBC. Independent contractors fulfilled many of CBC's marketing, sales, and customer service functions. CBC owned and operated several websites, including CreditUpdates.com, FreeCreditNation.com, and eFreeScore.com. For a monthly subscription fee, customers can access credit scores, credit reports, and a credit monitoring service. CBC does this through two lines of business: a \"white label/co-branding\" line, in which other businesses can offer CBC's services under their own name, and an affiliate marketing line, in which marketers direct customers to CBC sites. Affiliates who marketed CBC's services were compensated based on the volume of customers they referred. The practices of two affiliates are at issue in this suit: Danny Pierce and Andrew Lloyd.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Craigslist marketing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pierce became an affiliate for CBC in January 2014. As an affiliate marketer, Pierce received an identification number by which Brown could track the volume of his referrals and determine compensation. Several months after Pierce began working as an affiliate for CBC, he asked Brown to create specific websites to which he could direct the customers he referred. CBC created these websites on December 1, 2015. The websites, which are described in detail later in this decision, advertised that consumers could obtain a \"free credit score and report.\" In smaller type, the websites disclosed that signing up for these services would enroll the customer in a monthly credit monitoring service for $29.94 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pierce, working as an affiliate marketer for CBC, contracted out some marketing functions to Andrew Lloyd. Lloyd began posting to Craigslist ads of attractive rental properties. Interested customers were invited to e-mail the \"landlord\" for additional information. The response e-mails were routed to Lloyd, who responded as though he were the landlord (which he wasn't). In the reply, Lloyd would ask the customer to obtain a credit report through the CBC websites and would promise to set up a tour of the rental property once the customer had a credit report in hand. If interested, the customer would then sign up for CBC's services and then follow up with the \"landlord\"-but would never receive a reply. (One of these e-mails has been attached to this opinion as Appendix I; screenshots of one of the CBC websites has been attached as Appendix II.) As Pierce later testified, he knew that Lloyd was posting \"phony ads,\" as Lloyd was \"not renting these places out,\" was \"not a realtor\" and \"doesn't own the place.... He has no connection to this property.\" D.E. 206, Defs.' Ex. C at 73 (Pierce Dep.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The marketing effort proved extremely effective. Pierce was the most successful of CBC's affiliate marketers: his efforts resulted in 2,741,268 visitors to CBC's websites. (The next largest affiliate produced 369,869 visitors.) Pierce's traffic generated $6.8 million in revenue for CBC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   But the effort, unsurprisingly, also generated significant customer complaints. Customers complained that they were never connected with a landlord after obtaining a credit report and that they did not realize that they had been enrolled in CBC's credit monitoring service. A contractor who provided customer services for CBC logged numerous calls from dissatisfied customers. CBC also received customer e-mails complaining about the Craigslist marketing. In response, CBC's customer service often denied that CBC was involved in the marketing effort or that CBC paid affiliate marketers for referrals. Many customers also asked their credit\n   card company to reverse the CBC charges. Brown also received direct e-mails from many individuals about the Craigslist marketing program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural posture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Customers also directed their complaints to the FTC, which commenced an investigation into CBC. The FTC sued CBC, alleging that the Craigslist marketing program and the CBC websites violated several consumer protection laws. On January 11, 2017, Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman, acting as emergency judge, imposed a temporary restraining order on the defendants, restraining them from continuing the marketing program and freezing their assets. The FTC then moved for a preliminary injunction. As indicated earlier, Pierce and Lloyd agreed to the motion. CBC and Brown contested it, but the Court entered a preliminary injunction against them on February 21, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Both parties have moved for summary judgment. Summary judgment is appropriate if \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material issue of fact.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). There is a genuine issue of material fact if \"the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

The FTC contends that CBC violated the FTCA through (1) the Craigslist marketing scheme that Pierce and Lloyd carried out and (2) the credit report websites that CBC operated. (Because the websites are virtually identical, the Court refers to \"website\" in the singular for ease of reference.) The FTC has moved for summary judgment on its allegations under the FTCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Craigslist marketing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First, the FTC contends the Craigslist advertising campaign violated the FTCA. No reasonable jury could find that the Craigslist scheme did not involve unfair or deceptive practices, as it was rife with material misrepresentations that were likely to deceive a reasonable consumer.\n   <em>\n    Bay Area Bus. Council, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8927390\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/423/627/#p635\">\n    423 F.3d at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pierce and Lloyd's marketing\n   effort consisted of two parts, both of which were materially misrepresentative. First, they posted to Craigslist advertisements of attractive rental properties with an e-mail address for interested renters to contact. But the properties either did not exist or the marketers did not have authority to rent them. Second, when an interested renter asked about a property, Lloyd responded with a form e-mail that promised a tour of the property once the renter obtained a credit report. But customers found that, credit report in hand, there was no landlord that would provide a tour. There is, therefore, no genuine dispute that the Craigslist scheme was misrepresentative. Moreover, the misrepresentations were material, as the properties themselves and the requirement that a prospective renter first obtain a credit report before touring the property made it more likely that a reasonable consumer would choose to request a credit report from CBC.\n   <em>\n    Cyberspace.Com LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3336776\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/1196/#p1201\">\n    453 F.3d at 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The FTC has established that CBC is liable for the Craigslist campaign carried out on its behalf; no reasonable jury could find otherwise. \"Principals are liable for the misrepresentations of their agents under the FTC Act.\"\n   <em>\n    FTC v.

Am. Reply in Supp. of Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. at 1 n.1 (\"Defendants will not address the FTC's argument on ratification as to CBC's corporate liability.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   But even if the defendants had not conceded the point, the Court would find that CBC ratified Pierce and Lloyd's conduct. To establish that CBC ratified the affiliates' conduct, the FTC must demonstrate that CBC knew of the conduct but provided \"long-term acquiescence\" by accepting \"the benefits of an allegedly unauthorized transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    Sphere Drake Ins. Ltd. v. Am. Gen. Life Ins.

No reasonable jury could find that CBC did not know of the affiliates' fraudulent conduct. Consumers called to complain about the Craigslist advertisements and \"landlord\" e-mails that prompted them to enroll in CBC's service, sent e-mails to the same effect, and initiated chargebacks. CBC could easily trace these complaints to Pierce and Lloyd's practices. Not only could CBC track the traffic it received back to Pierce through an identification number, CBC could also determine that approximately 89 percent of its chargebacks were attributable to Pierce's traffic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Despite this, CBC continued to permit Pierce and Lloyd to market on its behalf. CBC could have terminated Pierce's affiliate arrangement whenever it liked, yet it never did so, despite mounting complaints. Thus CBC was aware of the Craigslist scheme but continued to accept the traffic (and revenues) generated by that conduct. As Pierce testified, he never stopped the Craigslist ads because he \"assumed that it was fine, because Mike Brown wanted the traffic. He continuously took the traffic, and I just went based on that[.]\" D.E. 206, Defs.' Ex. C at 74 (Pierce Dep.). The Court\n   concludes there is no issue for trial on the question of agency. The Craigslist campaign was materially misrepresentative, and CBC ratified Pierce and Lloyd's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The first page that consumers see, the landing page, features a banner that states: \"Get Your Free Credit Score and Report as of [the date on which the site was visited].\" There are three panels that describe the offer: the left panel shows a \"Sample Score\"; the central panel asks the consumer to add his or her information, which is submitted through a button that states \"Your Score-Now!\"; and right panel describes the benefits of CBC's service, which promises instant and secure access to one's credit score. If the website is visited via a desktop computer, the website also states \"Monthly membership of $29.94 automatically charged after trial[,]\" in light gray text against a white background. This text is not found on the mobile version of the website. The landing page does not describe what the membership entails. If a consumer scrolls down the page, the website displays in small text: \"Monitoring services may take up to 3 days to become active so this service within your membership may not be available during the whole 7-day trial period.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On the next page, the consumer is invited to enroll by completing several fields, including name, address, e-mail address, and phone number. The website contains two questions in a panel to the right of these fields: \"What is a good Credit Score?\" and \"Will I find errors on my credit report?\" Consumers are then directed to a page in which they may enter their payment information. The largest test on the page is the website logo. There is a large banner in black text below the logo; it reads, \"Your credit score is ready once we confirm your identity!\" Below that is a bright-green graphic consisting of a check mark and text stating \"Located Credit File.\" Above the fields into which consumers may enter payment information, the\n   website requests: \"Tell us which card you would like to use for your $1.00 refundable processing fee and membership[.]\" Below all of the payment information is a paragraph of small-sized text. The paragraph begins with a heading that reads \"Payment Information\" and then includes the following text:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   When you place your order here you will begin your membership in [the website].

The Court disagrees with the premise of CBC's argument, that an attempt to conform to conduct approved under a consent decree renders the conduct lawful. \"The entering of a consent decree ... is not a decision on the merits and therefore does not adjudicate the legality of any action by a party thereto.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Beatrice Foods Co. v.

Nev. May 6, 2015) (disclosures of a negative option were not clear or conspicuous, as the disclosures were \"either buried in fine print on the payment page of Defendants' websites or stated in separate Terms and Conditions documents\"). As discussed above, CBC embedded its disclosures into pages with larger, bolded text that promised \"free\" credit reports and scores. The disclosures were not prominent when compared to the rest of the page. Indeed, the disclosures appear \"designed to ensure minimal attention by the reader.\"\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9148966\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/389/719/#p730\">\n    389 F.3d at 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For this reason, the Court is unconvinced by CBC's repeated mention that the text was in twelve-point font: the analysis of the disclosure is necessarily contextual, meaning that the Court must consider the text, whatever size it is, in relation to the other elements on the page. The FTC is entitled to summary judgment; no reasonable jury could find that the disclosures were clear and conspicuous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   ROSCA also requires CBC to obtain a consumer's \"express informed consent\" before entering into a negative option. CBC contends that it can satisfy this standard, as a consumer is notified of the negative option at three points: on the landing page, the payment page, and in a welcome e-mail to those who enroll. The welcome e-mail is obviously unhelpful to CBC's case, as that e-mail\n   <em>\n    follows\n   </em>\n   the transaction, so it cannot affect whether the consumer rendered express informed consent before entering into the negative option.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   CBC's remaining contentions are also insufficient. The Court concludes that summary judgment is warranted where, as here, the website is virtually devoid of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   mention of the service aside from the statement that the customer is to be billed for it. Except for a handful of disclosures that the consumer will be enrolled in a service that costs $29.94 per month, the consumer would not know that CBC was offering a service. And there is no description of what the service constitutes or why it is beneficial. A website that fails to provide a consumer any information about a service cannot obtain a consumer's express\n   <em>\n    informed\n   </em>\n   consent to purchase that service. CBC suggests that credit monitoring was a \"bonus\" for consumers, but the Court overrules this rather odd argument. If credit monitoring was a \"bonus\" that CBC had not promised consumers, then consumers could not have expressly consented to be billed for a service they had not been told about.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, the FTC is entitled to summary judgment on its ROSCA claim because no reasonable jury could find that CBC \"clearly and conspicuously\" disclosed that the site involved a negative option transaction\n   or that consumers rendered their express informed consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Free Credit Report Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The FTC also brings a claim under the Free Credit Report Rule, which requires any advertisement for a free credit report to disclose that a consumer may obtain a free credit report annually as of right under federal law. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681j(g)(1) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201022.138\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1022.138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because it is undisputed that there was no notice of the as-of-right annual free credit report, the only question before the Court is whether CBC advertised a free credit report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Given that CBC website contained a banner advertising a \"free credit score and report,\" one could justifiably ask what there is to discuss. But the defendants present two arguments against the application of the Free Credit Report Rule. First, the defendants contend that the formatting of their advertisement of a \"free credit score and report\" places their site outside the reach of the Rule. They note that the text is split into two lines and that the text is colored differently: \"free credit score\" is in orange text, but \"and report\" is in black text. CBC contends there is a clear implication: the black lettering of \"report\" indicates that it, unlike the orange-lettered \"free credit score,\" is not free.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   But the defendants' proposed \"black-letter\" rule runs smack into the reality of actual black-letter law. Under \"generally accepted rules of syntax,\" an initial modifier applies to each noun or phrase in a conjunctive series.\n   <em>\n    Wash. Educ. Ass'n v. Nat'l Right to Work Legal Def.

Any reasonable consumer would read \"free\" as modifying both \"credit score\" and \"report,\" no matter the color of the text or its formatting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Next, CBC argues that the Free Credit Report Rule applies to advertisements of free credit reports alone; it does not apply to advertisements of CBC's services, which include a credit report, score,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   credit monitoring service. The defendants argue that the FTC, while promulgating the relevant rule, rejected the use of the term \"consumer report\" because it swept broadly enough to include credit scores.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Free Annual File Disclosures,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Fed.%20Reg.%209725\">\n    75 Fed.

Brown's personal liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The next issue is whether Brown is personally liable for the conduct for which CBC is liable. To establish Brown's personal liability, the FTC must prove three elements: (1) CBC's corporate liability (which the Court has just found); (2) Brown's knowledge of the practices; and (3) Brown's control over or direct participation in the practices at issue.\n   <em>\n    Amy Travel Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531540\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/564/#p573\">\n    875 F.2d at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FTC can satisfy the knowledge element by presenting \"evidence that the individuals had actual knowledge of material misrepresentations, reckless indifference to the truth or falsity of such misrepresentations, or an awareness of a high probability of fraud along with an intentional avoidance of the truth.\"\n   <em>\n    Bay Area Bus.

First is the creation of the CBC websites, which contain misrepresentations about the monthly subscription service. No reasonable jury could find that Brown did not know of these misrepresentations, as he wrote and edited the contents of the websites. Brown also controlled the practice in question: he owned, operated, and controlled the websites at issue, as he was the sole member, managing director, and owner of CBC. Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.'

Brown is personally liable for the violations associated with this conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Second is the Craigslist marketing scheme, in which Pierce and Lloyd posted false Craigslist advertisements of attractive rental properties and required interested customers to obtain credit reports through CBC websites. The Court concludes that there is no genuine issue for trial here; the evidence is such that no reasonable jury could not find that Brown was not, at the very least, recklessly indifferent towards or intentionally ignorant of the truth.\n   <em>\n    Bay Area Bus. Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8927390\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/423/627/#p635\">\n    423 F.3d at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Pierce and Lloyd sent e-mails purportedly from landlords to induce interested customers to request their credit reports through CBC; Brown admits he knew that Pierce and Lloyd did not have any relationship with actual landlords. But Brown claims that it does not follow that he knew that Lloyd's e-mails were false. Rather, Brown argues he believed that Lloyd was acting as an affiliate for others who wanted to rent out their properties, just as Pierce acted as an affiliate for CBC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   But this argument cannot account for the numerous signals Brown that received indicating that Pierce and Lloyd were not acting on behalf of actual landlords or advertising real properties. Brown received an e-mail on April 29, 2015 from a contractor who \"happened to notice this fake ad for apartment to get credit report\", Defs.'

As in\n   <em>\n    Bay Area Business Council\n   </em>\n   , in which the Seventh Circuit held the defendant personally liable in part because he personally controlled who would conduct telemarketing, the Court holds Brown personally liable because he controlled whether Pierce and Lloyd could continue their conduct.\n   <em>\n    Bay Area Bus.

In assessing whether there is a reasonable likelihood of future violations, the Court must consider (1) the gravity of the harm, (2) the extent of CBC and Brown's participation, (3) the nature of the infraction and the likelihood that they may become involved in similar conduct in the future; (4) any recognition of culpability; and (5) the sincerity of assurances against further violations.\n   <em>\n    Holschuh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1487248\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/694/130/#p144\">\n    694 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   144 ;\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"521663\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/591/1211/#p1220\">\n    591 F.2d at 1220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court finds a reasonable likelihood of future violations. First, the gravity of the harm was significant, as CBC and Brown's deceptive practices caused customers to lose millions of dollars on an unwanted service and to needlessly expose their sensitive personal and financial information, including their credit card and Social Security numbers. Moreover, both CBC and Brown were deeply involved in these practices. Third, CBC and Brown's ongoing participation in the credit information industry increases the likelihood that similar conduct could occur again, as these schemes are easy to facilitate. The Court notes that, after the onset of this litigation, it held Brown in contempt for violating the preliminary injunction, which barred him from, among other things, operating a website with a negative option feature without first obtaining express informed consent, processing payments from CBC customers, or transacting any business as CBC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 106. Though Brown argues that he was misadvised by attorneys when he engaged in this conduct, the Court only relies on this fact to show the ease with which parties can engage in this conduct, not to show Brown's scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, Brown's ongoing litigation of this claim in the face of significant contrary evidence-and the assertion that it is the\n   <em>\n    consumers\n   </em>\n   who engaged in misconduct through \"friendly fraud\"-undercuts any belated recognition of culpability or assurance that similar misconduct will not happen again. The Court concludes that a permanent injunction against CBC and Brown is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Brown argues that the FTC's proposed injunction should be narrowed in two ways. First, he contends that the injunction should not apply to all of CBC's websites, just those created to receive traffic referred from Pierce and Lloyd. Brown also contends that he should not be enjoined, as he was fooled by Pierce and Lloyd into believing the properties existed, just like CBC's dissatisfied customers. The Court declines to narrow the injunction in either respect. First, the injunction should extend to all sites, as the Court has found a reasonable likelihood of future violations, and any site could be used to facilitate a similar scheme. Second, as already discussed, no reasonable jury could find that Brown did not know of, and have control over, Pierce's practices. Just because it was Pierce and Lloyd who directly facilitated the Craigslist marketing does not mean that Brown should escape an injunction. Brown has not presented a viable reason that he should not be subject to a permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Equitable monetary relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In addition to the permanent injunction, the FTC seeks relief from CBC and Brown in the amount of consumer\n   losses. \"The district court's power to grant a permanent injunction also includes the power to grant other ancillary relief,\" which \"includes the power to order repayment of money for consumer redress as restitution or [rescission].\"\n   <em>\n    FTC v.

Section 13(b) only authorizes the Court to \"enjoin any such act or practice\" that violates the FTCA. CBC and Brown contend that this provision does not expressly encompass restitution and that the Supreme Court case law that authorized a broad interpretation of this language has been undercut. CBC and Brown concede that the Court \"has previously ruled on and generally denied\" this contention, but they contend that, had the Court fully considered the legislative history or the text of section 13(b), it would have found in favor of this argument.

But, CBC and Brown contend, restitution is unavailing, as the FTC must be able to trace the funds it identifies for restitution, and here the funds have been commingled. CBC and Brown urge the Court to consider several cases in which courts declined to order restitution because the funds requested were not traceable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montanile v.

CBC and Brown rely primarily on ERISA cases in which plaintiffs seek to reclaim benefits from a defunct employer. ERISA is distinguishable from the FTCA in a significant way: ERISA only authorizes equitable restitution, not legal restitution.

But, as the Court has already noted, it has rejected this reading of\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   ; the Court need not interrogate it in greater depth. The Court concludes that, even if the funds at issue were commingled with other CBC funds, the FTC is not barred from obtaining restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Third, Brown contends that the permanent injunction and the proposed restitution would violate his Eighth Amendment rights.

The FTC began its calculation with the amount of revenue obtained through traffic that Pierce directed to CBC: $6,832,435.81. The FTC subtracted the amount of refunds CBC paid to customers ($414,860.77), chargebacks that customers successfully obtained ($394,903.68), and the amount already paid by Pierce and Lloyd in settlement of their claims ($762,000), for a net of $5,260,671.36. CBC and Brown present several arguments against this amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   First, they contend that the revenues must be limited to the period beginning after CBC created websites to which Pierce could direct his traffic. The Court disagrees: the amount of liability is based on the duration of the campaign of misrepresentation conducted through the Craigslist marketing scheme, not the existence of certain websites. The date on which certain websites became active is irrelevant to the calculation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Next, CBC and Brown contend that the amount of restitution should be limited to the customers referred by Pierce. The description of how the FTC calculated losses refutes this argument; the losses are already based on revenue obtained through traffic that Pierce referred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Third, they contend that the FTC should deduct the revenue obtained from customers who contacted CBC's customer service but then chose not to cancel their credit membership. The FTC argues that a setoff would be inappropriate, as CBC lied to customers about its involvement in the Craigslist marketing scheme.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Stmt. of Facts \u00b6 60 (recording of a CBC customer service employee telling a customer, \"We don't ... do any Craigslist posts.... [W]e're not affiliated with any third party companies posting any rental ads or anything like that.\"). The Court concurs: CBC and Brown are not entitled to keep the revenue obtained from customers who were retained through additional misrepresentations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Fourth, CBC and Brown contend that the losses should be limited to the period during which Brown had actual notice of the purported scheme. They contend that Brown did know of the fraudulent marketing until he saw complaints from the Better Business Bureau on June 30, 2016. CBC and Brown's argument is unpersuasive. First, they do not point to any authorities supporting the premise that liability can only attach to particular losses of which the defendant was specifically aware; the Seventh Circuit only requires that a defendant be \"adequately alerted ... to the corporation's deceptive trade practices.\"\n   <em>\n    Bay Area Bus.

But no reasonable jury could conclude that Brown only learned of Pierce's campaign on June 30, 2016. As the record makes clear, Brown was e-mailed in April 2015-just months after the campaign began-by a contractor with concerns about the campaign. As already discussed, this e-mail was joined by numerous other signs of misconduct, all of which occurred well before June 30, 2016. The Court declines to reduce the loss figure on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   CBC and Brown also ask the Court to set off business expenses and the loss of CBC revenues. But restitution seeks to protect consumers from \"economic injuries\" by recovering the full amount of consumer loss.\n   <em>\n    Febre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"977941\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/128/530/#p534\">\n    128 F.3d at 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The defendants do not contest that these are the proper sites to analyze; therefore, the Court restricts its analysis to these sites. Because the sites are virtually identical, only the eFreeScore.com images are included in Appendix 2 to this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Indeed, the Court could not put it much better than the defendants do: \"The overall net impression created by the website is that the consumer is signing up for a free credit score and can cancel within seven (7) days [if] they don't want to continue the service.\" Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 20. Notably absent from this impression is any sense of\n    <em>\n     what\n    </em>\n    service CBC will render through a monthly subscription.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    ROSCA also includes a third element that is not at issue in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Defendants arguably raise an additional point in their reply brief asking the Court to dismiss any claims relating to CBC's \"pre-existing\" websites. Defs.' Am. Reply in Supp. of Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. at 8. This argument is underdeveloped and, to the extent it is a new point, defendants forfeited it by failing to raise it in the initial brief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
