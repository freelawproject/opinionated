The asserted patent claims that remain at issue are claims 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14 of the '183 Patent and claim 1 of the '348 Patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 367, Joint [Proposed] Final Pretrial Order at 13; oral order dated June 15, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Additional facts are set out in the court's memorandum order on the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction (D.I. 127) and need not be repeated here. Briefly, the technology at issue in this litigation involves instruments and procedures for endometrial ablation, a treatment wherein the lining of the uterus is destroyed in order to treat Menorrhagia, or abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding. In the late 1990s, NovaCept Corporation (\"NovaCept\") under the direction of Csaba Truckai (\"Truckai\") and his design team developed the NovaSure system (\"NovaSure\") in the late-1990s. Prior to an ablation procedure, NovaSure uses computerized monitoring to detect perforations in the uterus, by applying C02 gas to the uterus and measuring any flow of gas out of the uterus. NovaSure employs an application head with a triangular shape designed to conform to the shape of the uterus, which ablates the endometrial lining throughout the cavity in two minutes or less. NovaSure also provides a \"moisture transport\" function with a vacuum used to remove\n   steam and moisture from the cavity during energy delivery. Minerva has developed and brought to market a new technology for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding, the Minerva Endometrial Ablation System (\"EAS\" or \"accused product\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The '348 patent is directed to \"an apparatus and method of ablating and/or coagulating tissue, such as that of the uterus or other organ.\" It uses \"an electrode array,\" which \"includes a fluid permeable elastic member preferably formed of a metallized fabric having insulating regions and conductive regions thereon.\" To use the apparatus, \"the electrode array is positioned in contact with tissue to be ablated, ablation energy is delivered through the array to the tissue to cause the tissue to dehydrate, and moisture generated during dehydration is actively or passively drawn into the array and away from the tissue.\" (D.I. 281-7, Ex. 40, '348 patent, 2:34-45). The specification describes two exemplary embodiments. The first embodiment describes an ablation device comprised generally of three major components-RF applicator head, main body, and handle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:55-58) The applicator head includes an array of electrodes formed on the surface of an electrode carrying means. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:58-61). \"The second embodiment differs from the first embodiment primarily in its electrode pattern and in the mechanism used to deploy the electrode applicator head or array.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   11:53-54). Aspects of the two \"exemplary embodiments and their methods of operation may be combined without departing from the scope of the present invention.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:50-58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Claim 1 of the '348 Patent states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   A device for treating a uterus comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   an elongate member having a proximal portion and a distal portion, the elongate member comprising an outer sleeve and an inner sleeve slidably and coaxially disposed within the outer sleeve;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   an applicator head coupled to the distal portion, the applicator head defining an interior volume and having a contracted state and an expanded state, the contracted state being configured for transcervical insertion and the expanded state being configured to conform to the shape of the uterus, the applicator head including one or more electrodes for ablating endometrial lining tissue of the uterus;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   a handle coupled to the proximal portion of the elongate member, wherein the handle comprises a frame, a proximal grip and a distal grip pivotally attached to one another at a pivot point and operably coupled to the applicator head so that when the proximal grip and the distal grip are moved closer together, the applicator head transitions from the contracted state to the expanded state;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   a deflecting mechanism including flexures disposed within the applicator head, the flexures including first and second internal flexures and first and second external flexures, the first and second external flexures being coupled to the outer sleeve and the first and second internal flexures being coupled to the inner sleeve, wherein the deflecting mechanism is configured so that translating the inner sleeve relative to the frame causes the applicator head to transition from the contracted state to the expanded state; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   an indicator mechanism operably coupled to the inner sleeve, the indicator mechanism configured to indicate a dimension of the uterus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:9-42) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The '183 patent is directed to \"a system and method for detecting perforations in a body cavity.\" (D.I. 281-7, Ex. 39). The\n   system delivers a fluid (either liquid or gas) \"into a body cavity to slightly pressurize the cavity. A pressure sensing system monitors the pressure within the cavity for a predetermined test period. If cavity pressure is not substantially sustained during the test period, the physician is alerted.\" In the preferred form of the system, the perforation detection functionality is provided with an RF [radio frequency] ablation system. ( '183 patent, 1:49-62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   What is claimed in Claim 1 of the '183 Patent is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1. A method of ablating a uterus, comprising the steps of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   inserting an ablation device into a uterus;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   flowing an inflation medium into the uterus;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   monitoring for the presence of a perforation in the uterus using a pressure sensor; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   treating the interior of the uterus using the ablation device.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:10-14). Asserted Claim 7 recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The method of claim 1, further including the step of preventing performance of the treating step until after the monitoring step has been carried out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:30-33) Asserted Claim 9 recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A method of detecting a perforation in a uterus, comprising the steps of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   passing an inflation medium into the uterus;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   monitoring for the presence of a perforation in the uterus using a pressure sensor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   if no perforation is detected during the monitoring step, permitting ablation of the uterus using an ablation device; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   if a perforation is detected during the monitoring step, preventing ablation of the uterus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:39-48). Dependent claim 11 recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The method of claim 9, further including the step of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   if a perforation is detected during the monitoring step, activating a notification signal alerting t e user to the presence of a perforation in the uterus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:54-57). Dependent claim 13 limits claim 9 reciting, \"wherein the inflation medium is introduced using the ablation device.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:60-61). Claim 14 states: \"The method of claim 9, wherein the ablation device is an RF ablation device.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:63-65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The specification explains that \"a pressure sensing system\" is \"fluidly coupled to the medical device via [a] pressure detection/signal line\" and used to monitor the pressure within the body cavity. Fluid or gas is delivered to the body cavity and the pressure sensing system detects \"whether elevated pressure can be maintained above a predetermined threshold level over a predetermined period of time. If it cannot, the user is alerted that there may be a perforation in the organ.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:36-44) The pressure sensor \"monitors pressure in the pressure signal line ... and delivers the signal to the microprocessor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:23-25). The specification explains that during testing \"[w]hen the pressure at gauge 84 rises and remains above 50mmHg for 4 seconds\", the test is passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The court has construed the relevant claims of the Patents-in-Suit as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Pressure sensor\n   </em>\n   :\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   A device whose input detects, directly or indirectly, a force per unit area and outputs a corresponding electrical signal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Applicator head\n   </em>\n   :\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   A distal end portion of an ablation device that applies energy to the uterine tissue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Indicator mechanism\n   </em>\n   :\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   A mechanism configured to indicate a dimension.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    One or more electrodes\n   </em>\n   :\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   One or more electrical conductors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (D.I. 227, Memorandum Order at 2-5).

In February 2001, Csaba Truckai assigned his interest in U.S. Application No. 09/710,102, an application to which the '183 Patent claims priority, to NovaCept. Hologic is the owner by assignment of the '183 Patent. Hologic acquired the '183 Patent from Cytyc on January 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The '348 Patent was issued by the USPTO on August 4, 2015 and expires on November 19, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cytyc listed Csaba Truckai, Russel Mahlon Sampson, Stephanie Squarcia, Alfonso Lawrence Ramirez, and Estela Hilario as named inventors on the face of the '348 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In August 1998, Csaba Truckai assigned his interest in U.S. Application No. 09/103,072, an application to which the '348 Patent claims priority, to NovaCept. Hologic is the owner by assignment of the '348 Patent. Hologic acquired the '348 Patent from Cytyc on January 15, 2016. In May 2004, Cytyc Corporation (\"Cytyc\") acquired NovaCept for $325 million dollars. In 2007, Hologic acquired Cytyc Corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In 1993, Csaba Truckai co-founded NovaCept, Inc. (\"NovaCept\") Csaba Truckai and others at NovaCept developed the NovaSure system. NovaCept received FDA premarket approval for commercial distribution of the NovaSure system on September 28, 2001. NovaCept assigned to Cytyc its patent rights including continuation applications. Hologic markets and sells the NovaSure system throughout the United States and in interstate commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Csaba Truckai is a founder of Minerva. Minerva was founded in 2008. Csaba Truckai was involved in the development of the Minerva Endometrial Ablation System (\"EAS\"). Minerva received FDA premarket approval for commercial distribution of the Minerva EAS on July 27, 2015. Minerva began commercial distribution of the Minerva EAS in August 2015. Minerva markets and sells the Minerva EAS throughout the United States and in interstate commerce. Both the Minerva EAS and the NovaSure system are indicated for use on premenopausal women with menorrhagia (excessive bleeding) due to benign causes for whom childbearing is complete. The Array Opening Indicator of the Minerva EAS contains a Black Indicator Line that can move relative to rows of black dots depending on the degree of expansion of the Plasma Formation Array.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Hologic alleges that Minerva infringes its patent in the use of the Minerva EAS. It alleges that use of the Minerva EAS, consistent with its instructions for use, practices each and every step of the method claims of the '183 Patent. It asserts that Minerva directly infringes these claims and induces and contributes to the infringement by its customers. It further alleges that Minerva infringes the apparatus claims of the '348 Patent by making, selling and/or offering to sell the Minerva EAS in the United States. Also, Hologic contends that Minerva's infringement of the Patents-in-Suit has been and continues to be willful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Minerva denies that it infringes-directly or indirectly (under inducement or contributory infringement)-any of the asserted claims of the Patents-in-Suit and denies that infringement, if any, has been willful. In addition, Minerva asserts an invalidity defense to the asserted claims. With respect to the '183 patent, it argues that all the asserted claims of the Patents-in-Suit are invalid for lack of written description and lack of enablement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Minerva's Motion to Dismiss (D.I. 275)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   A threshold issue is Minerva's motion to dismiss. Minerva seeks dismissal of Hologic's claim for infringement of the '183 Patent under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(c). Minerva asserts that the '183 Patent claims \"should be dismissed as moot\" because \"no viable cause of action\" remains. Minerva's motion is based on a final written decision of the Patent and Trial Appeals Board (\"PTAB\") in an\n   <em>\n    inter partes\n   </em>\n   review under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20318\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) of the '183 patent. Minerva contends the PTAB's decision extinguishes any cause of action Hologic may have had with respect to its asserted '183 patent. Hologic has appealed the Patent Office's\n   decision on the '183 Patent to the Federal Circuit (D.I. 344, Hologic Brief at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In response, Hologic asserts Minerva is estopped from contending the patent is invalid by the doctrine of assignor estoppel. It argues that Minerva profited from its assignment and subsequent sale of the intellectual property and cannot disclaim the patent's validity. Assignor estoppel is also the subject of one of Hologic's motions for summary judgment and will be discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   B. Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   A party may move to dismiss for \"lack of subject-matter jurisdiction\" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).

Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   More preliminary issues are Hologic's motion to preclude consideration of certain evidence (D.I. 290), Minerva's motion to strike the expert testimony of Karl Leinsing and Christopher C. Barry (D.I. 279), and Minerva's motion to strike the supplemental expert report of Karl Leinsing (D.I. 317).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Hologic contends the court should exclude the lay opinion of David Clapper, Minerva's current CEO and former CEO of NovaCept, on the issue of market value for endometrial ablation devices. Further, Hologic argues the court should exclude invalidity and infringement opinions of Robert Tucker, M.D. because they are not based on the court's claim constructions and are based on exceedingly narrow characterizations of what he understands the invention to be. It argues Dr. Tucker's reliance on an impermissible claim construction renders his opinions irrelevant and unreliable and not helpful to the finder of fact. Hologic also challenges Minerva's damages expert Blake Inglish's apportionment calculations because they are based entirely on Dr. Tucker's allegedly flawed opinions. Hologic next challenges Burt Magen's conclusion that several prototype Minerva EAS's handpieces would not infringe the claims of the '348 patent. Hologic argues that Magen's opinions are not relevant to any fact at issue since Magen's opinions relate to three proposed handpiece designs, none of which are the accused product. Hologic also argues that Magen failed to apply the court's construction of an \"indicator mechanism.\" Last, Hologic states that the court should exclude Dr. Eugene Skalnyi from testifying regarding facts and opinions not disclosed to Hologic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In response, Minerva contends Clapper's testimony does not relate to any scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge that would fall under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and is properly admissible under Rule 701. Minerva also controverts Hologic's conclusion that Dr. Tucker did not properly apply the court's claim construction. Minerva also contends the testimony of Mr. Inglish is proper and should be considered, further arguing that Mr. Magen's testimony survives Hologic's challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Minerva moves to preclude Leinsing's opinions on validity and infringement. It contends Leinsing improperly relied on claim construction legal standards to render opinions on invalidity for lack of a written description under \u00a7 112. Minerva contends Hologic fails to apply the relevant authority that rejects a patentee's attempt to argue that the specification does not limit the claims (which is a claim construction argument) in the context of \u00a7 112.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rivera v. Int'l Trade Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276800\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/1315/#p1322\">\n    857 F.3d 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Hologic, on the other hand, contends that Leinsing properly considered the claims as construed by the court and analyzed the disclosure of the Patents-in-Suit to conclude that the asserted claims of the Patents-in-Suit are described and enabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Next, Minerva argues Leinsing's opinions relying on unreliable and misleading documents should be excluded, arguing that unverified Internet data, with no connection to Minerva or its EAS, is not something an expert would reasonably rely upon to prove infringement. Minerva is challenging Dr. Leinsing's testimony about Bernoulli's principle, which was found on a website. In response, Hologic contends that Leinsing's opinions are valid because they rely on documents that confirm the existence of Bernoulli's principle and Minerva's own technical documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Last, Minerva challenges Leinsing's opinions regarding copying. Hologic argues that Leinsing never offered an opinion that Minerva's EAS copied NovaSure and that Leinsing is entitled to rebut Minerva's expert's opinions on the subject.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   B.

Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The court is inclined to believe that Hologic's challenges go more to the weight than admissibility of the evidence. At any rate, the court need not rule on Hologic's motion at this juncture because the challenged evidence is not particularly relevant to the motions presently under consideration by the court. The court did not rely on the testimony of any of the challenged witnesses in making its determination on the pending motions. Some of the testimony relates solely to damages and will be addressed via a proper motion at trial or in limine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   For the most part, the court finds Minerva's challenges are similarly in the nature of objections or are the proper subjects of motions in limine. Minerva's arguments go more to the weight than to admissibility of the challenged evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The court disagrees with Minerva's characterization of Leinsing's testimony with respect to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   issues. Leinsing's testimony merely relates to the content of the specifications, not to teaching limitations that are not in the specifications. Similarly, Minerva's challenge to testimony on the Bernoulli principle is similarly unavailing. There is no serious dispute that the principle is a widely accepted principle of physics and fluid dynamics that is verified in other testimony and exhibits. The motions to preclude will be denied at this time without prejudice to reassertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   With respect to Minerva's motion to preclude opinions on copying and independent development, the court finds Minerva's position is misplaced. Minerva concedes that Leinsing never states that the Minerva EAS is a copy of the NovaSure system and Minerva's own technical expert expressed an opinion similar to that of Leinsing. (D.I. 292-2, Hologic Ex. 30, Rebuttal Declaration of Robert Tucker, M.D., \u00b6 54.) (\"Minerva's EAS is not identical to, substantially similar to, or a copy of the NovaSure, and in fact incorporates Minerva's own patentably-distinct technology.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Again, the issue is moot for purposes of the present motion because the court did not consider the challenged information in connection with its determination. Accordingly, Minerva's motion will be denied, without prejudice to reassertion at trial to the extent that Leinsing's testimony remains relevant to issues in the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Minerva also challenges Hologic's expert Christopher C. Barry's damages testimony. It contends he failed to apply the correct lost profits standards or the correct reasonable royalty standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The court is unable to evaluate the relevance of the challenged evidence in the context of a pretrial motion. Minerva's concerns may warrant a cautionary or limiting instruction, but the court cannot determine the ambit of such an instruction at this time. The court will admit the evidence at issue only on a showing that it is relevant to the issues in the case, is proper under the law, and only to the extent that the relevance of the evidence outweighs its potential to cause prejudice or confusion under Fed. R. Evid. 403. The court finds the motion can be adequately resolved at trial, either in a hearing immediately prior to commencement of the trial, as an objection with a sidebar, or with a review of the evidence outside the presence of the jury. Accordingly, the court finds that Minerva's motion to preclude expert opinions should be overruled at this time, without prejudice to its reassertion via timely objection to the admissibility of such evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Minerva's also moves to strike the supplemental expert declaration of Karl Leinsing. (D.I. 317.) Minerva contends the report is untimely and argues it has been prejudiced by having prepared and submitted its opening summary judgment and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   briefing in reliance on the timely Leinsing reports and deposition, only to be blindsided by new opinions based on new evidence raised for the first time in the Supplemental Leinsing Declaration. The court again finds the evidence is not particularly relevant and notes that Minerva had an opportunity to respond to any new information in its reply briefing. Further, the court notes that Minerva could have moved to reopen discovery in order to re-depose Leinsing, if necessary. The court is inclined to agree with Hologic that the allegedly new information merely elaborates on Leinsing's ultimate opinions. The court did not rely on the new information and finds the motion should be denied as moot without prejudice to reassertion to the extent the opinions remain relevant to issues in the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

It is undisputed that Truckai's job responsibilities as Minerva's President and CEO included bringing the accused product to market to directly compete with Hologic. Hologic contends the accused product incorporates the same patented technology that Truckai's company sold to Hologic. It is undisputed that Truckai, an inventor on each of the Patents-in-Suit, executed broad assignments of his inventions to NovaCept, which was then sold to Hologic's predecessor for $325 million dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Hologic contends that the balance of equities strongly favor a finding of privity and the application of assignor estoppel in light of Truckai's role as Minerva's founder, his efforts to invent, develop, test, and manufacture the accused device, and his broad executive leadership of Minerva. In essence, it argues that-more than 19 years after Mr. Truckai executed his initial patent assignment-Minerva and Truckai attempt to destroy the value of what Truckai sold to Hologic so that Minerva can directly compete with Hologic using the patented technology he already sold to Hologic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   2.

Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Considering the balance of equities and the relationship of Truckai to Minerva, the court first finds privity between Truckai and Minerva. It is clear that Truckai executed a broad assignment of his patent rights to NovaCept and later sold NovaCept to Hologic's predecessor for $325 million dollars. Minerva does not seriously dispute those facts. It argues instead that the doctrine is not applicable to bar a \u00a7 112 defense. It relies on a balance-of-equities argument, contending Hologic attempts to assert overly broad claims and therefore keep Minerva's competing product out of the market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The court finds Minerva's overly broad claims argument is effectively foreclosed by the court's adoption of Hologic's claim construction. Considering the balance of\n   equities and the relationship of Minerva and Truckai, the evidence demonstrates that Truckai is in privity with Minerva, therefore, assignor estoppel applies to Minerva's defenses to Hologic's patent infringement claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   B.

However, even if Minerva were not estopped from raising the defense, the court would find Minerva's motion for a summary judgment of invalidity lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Minerva's argument that the Patents-in-Suit had to provide written description and enablement of the accused devices plasma formation feature is unavailing. The claims at issue herein do not recite a plasma formation feature. Minerva's emphasis on the accused device and its plasma formation feature reflects its misguided notion that the improvements over the claimed material (the plasma formation feature) would have to have been disclosed. That an\n   accused product might include other, un-claimed features does not mean the accused product avoids infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Similarly, the court rejects Minerva's argument that undue experimentation would be required to practice the invention. Minerva failed to produce evidence that the experimentation required to create surgical instruments and methods for use in endometrial ablation such as those described in the claims of the Patents-in-Suit would be unduly laborious for one of ordinary skill in the art. The evidence shows that any such experimentation would involve repetition of commonly known or used techniques and application of techniques well known in the art. Minerva's expert's testimony on the subject does not controvert Hologic's testimony that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have known that a flow sensor could be used as a pressure sensor. Conclusory expert assertions do not give rise to a genuine issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The court already rejected Minerva's argument that exemplary embodiments define \"the invention\" and require a \"moisture transport system\" with a \"permeable external array\" during the claim construction phase. Minerva's other criticisms for the descriptions are also directed at exemplary embodiments and raise previously rejected arguments that would serve to improperly limit that claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The court finds Minerva's Section 112 arguments rest on a flawed definition of the claims that ignores the court's claim constructions. Minerva has not satisfied its burden of showing invalidity by clear and convincing evidence. No reasonable jury could find that Minerva has met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the claimed \"applicator head,\" \"indicator mechanism\" and \"one or more electrodes\" are not properly described or enabled in the asserted claims of the Patents-in-Suit. Minerva's arguments with respect to undue experimentation focus on the amount of experimentation necessary to make Minerva's EAS, which is not the relevant enablement analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Hologic, on the other hand has shown that the '183 and '348 Patent disclosures adequately describe the claims as construed by the court. The relevant enablement analysis is whether the specification teaches how to make and use a system that performs the step of monitoring for the presence of a perforation in the uterus using a device whose input detects, directly or indirectly, a force per unit area and outputs a corresponding electrical signal. The patent disclosure reasonably conveys to a person of ordinary skill in the art that the inventors had possession of \"[a] distal end portion of an ablation device that applies energy to the uterine tissue\" including \"[o]ne or more electrical conductors\" and \"[a]n applicator of an ablation device that delivers energy to the uterine tissue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The court finds no reasonable jury could find that Minerva can meet its clear and convincing evidence burden of showing that the claims of the Patents-in-Suit do not describe monitoring for the presence of a perforation in the uterus using a pressure sensor. Accordingly, the court finds Hologic's motion for a summary judgment of no invalidity should be granted and Minerva's corresponding motion should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   C. Minerva's Motion for Summary Judgment on the Doctrine of Equivalents and Prosecution History Estoppel. (D.I. 278, Brief at 44-47)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   1. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Minerva argues that prosecution history shows that the Patent Examiner rejected Hologic's pending claims as obvious under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and therefore invalid over\n   prior art in August 2015. In response to the rejection Hologic, among other things, struck \"a handle coupled to the proximal portion\" from pending claim 19 (later issued as Claim of the '348 patent ), and replaced it with more detail about the handle including: \"wherein the handle comprises a proximal grip and a distal grip pivotally attached to one another at a pivot point.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   D.I. 278 at 45. Minerva contends that Hologic elected to narrow the scope of what issued as independent claim 1 of the '348 Patent by adding the \"pivot point\" limitation in order to overcome the prior art rejection and secure the patent, and accordingly, prosecution history estoppel operates to foreclose Hologic from relying on the doctrine of equivalents to allege infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Hologic contends that Minerva seeks an improper advisory opinion in connection with this argument. It argues that the device with Minerva's new pivot handle is not an accused product because it has not been commercialized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   2.

Further, the court is not convinced that the added detail is more than tangential to patentability. Notably, the limitation relates more to the '989 Patent, which is no longer at issued, than to the '348 Patent. Moreover, the court agrees with Hologic's position that a ruling on the purported handle redesign would be an improper advisory opinion since the product is not being marketed and is not alleged to be infringing Hologic's patent. The court need not address whether Minerva's \"new\" handle design would infringe Hologic's '348 Patent because that design is not at issue. Minerva has not shown it is entitled to summary judgment on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   D.

Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Hologic moves for summary judgment in the issue of infringement, contending that Minerva has failed to raise a genuine issue of fact to counter the court's finding that evidence submitted in preliminary injunction proceedings supports a prima facie showing of infringement. It argues that there is no genuine dispute that the Minerva EAS embodies apparatus claim 1 of the '348 Patent. Claim 1 comprises a preamble and five limitations. Hologic argues that only the fifth limitation, \"an indicator mechanism configured to indicate a dimension of the uterus\" is at issue and contends that the Minerva \"PFA Width Indicator\" is such an indicator mechanism that measures a dimension of the uterus. Further, it argues that it is undisputed that Minerva's EAS infringes the asserted claims of the '183 Patent in that it detects perforations using a pressure sensor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Minerva contends that a summary judgment of no infringement is warranted because Hologic cannot show that Minerva's UIT meets the court's construction of \"pressure sensor\" for at least two reasons: (1) the flow sensor's \"input\" does not \"detect[ ], directly or indirectly, a force per unit area\"; and (2) its \"output\" is not \"a corresponding electrical signal,\" as the court's construction requires. It also contends the UIT does not perform the monitoring step using a pressure sensor as the claim requires. Minerva's arguments are\n   premised on its contention that Minerva's flow sensor detects a flow rate-not a pressure at its input.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   In its earlier order, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   \"Pressure sensor.\" The specification explains that \"a pressure sensing system\" is \"fluidly coupled to the medical device via [a] pressure detection/signal line\" and used to monitor the pressure within the body cavity. Fluid or gas is delivered to the body cavity and the pressure sensing system detects \"whether elevated pressure can be maintained above a predetermined threshold level over a predetermined period of time. If it cannot, the user is alerted that there may be a perforation in the organ.\" ( '183 patent, 2:36-44) The pressure sensor \"monitors pressure in the pressure signal line ... and delivers the signal to the microprocessor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:23-25) The specification explains that during testing \"[w]hen the pressure at gauge 84 rises and remains above 50 mmHg for 4 seconds, the test has passed.\"\n   <em>\n    (Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:44-46)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   (D.I. 127, Memorandum Order at 13-14. The court went on to find:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   Hologic has identified Minerva EAS' flow meter as meeting the \"pressure sensor\" limitation. Minerva argues that the flow meter does not measure pressure (differential or otherwise) to operate and its output is not a pressure measurement. (D.I. 86 at 8-11) Minerva EAS' operator manual describes a \"uterine integrity test\" aimed at detecting perforations. (D.I. 12, ex. 11 at 9, 33) Minerva's expert, Dr. Tucker, testified, \"[a]s the pressure goes down, the flow rate goes up. As the pressure goes up, the flow rate goes down.\" (D.I. 115, ex. 2 at 64:17-20) The design documents for Minerva EAS state that \"if the uterine cavity and the system is perforation free, gas used to insufflate the uterine cavity will stop flowing once the gas pressure in the uterine cavity matches the supply pressure.\" (D.I. 87, ex. 82 at 2337) The court concludes that the evidence supports a prima facia showing of infringement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14) (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   2.

Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The court finds that Minerva's non-infringement arguments were essentially mooted when the court rejected Minerva's erroneous claim constructions. Minerva's arguments for non-infringement all depend on claim construction that is contrary to the court's construction. Applying the court's construction, Hologic has shown that Minerva's accused product infringes the asserted claims of the patents. Minerva's non-infringement arguments go to differences in or additions to its device that are not claimed in the patents, but are improvements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The court's construction of the term \"pressure sensor\" in claim 9 of the '183 Patent as \"[a] device whose input detects, directly or indirectly, a force per unit area and outputs a corresponding electrical signal\" is determinative. Minerva contends the claim requires directly detecting a force per unit area. Nothing in the specification requires the pressure sensor to measure pressure directly or to convert to a unit of measure. The undisputed facts show that use of the Minerva EAS practices the step of monitoring for the presence of a perforation in the uterus using a device whose input detects, directly or indirectly, a force per unit area and outputs a corresponding electrical signal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Bernoulli's equation is a well-known principle of fluid dynamics that would have been known to persons of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention. Minerva's expert conceded that a person of ordinary skill in the art in 1998 would have known that it was \"just a fundamental law of fluid dynamics\" that there would have to be a pressure differential to generate flow. The equation describes the physical relationship between pressure and flow rate and, therefore, it shows that Minerva's use of a flow meter involves \"indirectly\" detecting pressure. Minerva's flow sensor, in conjunction with the orifice, is a pressure sensor because it indirectly detects pressure via flow rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Minerva does not dispute that use of the Minerva EAS practices all of the remaining limitations of the asserted claims. No reasonable jury could find that the remaining steps in the method for ablating a uterus claimed in the patent-inserting an ablation device, flowing an inflation medium, and treating the disorder-are not performed when using the Minerva EAS. Also, Minerva does not dispute that use of the Minerva EAS prevents performance of the treating step until after the monitoring step has been carried out, as claimed in Claim 7 of the '183 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Claim 9 of the '183 Patent comprises a preamble and four limitations, only one of which is in serious dispute-\"monitors for the presence of a perforation in the uterus using a pressure sensor.\" Minerva does not dispute that use of the Minerva EAS practices a method of detecting a perforation in a uterus or that use of the Minerva EAS practices the step of \"passing an inflation medium into the uterus\" or the steps of then permitting or preventing the ablation, depending on detection of a perforation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Minerva's argument with respect to monitoring with a pressure sensor is again precluded by the court's claim construction. Further, Minerva does not dispute that practicing the Minerva EAS includes activating a notification signal alerting the user to the presence of a perforation in the uterus included in claim 11 or introducing the inflation medium using the ablation device as recited in Claim 13 or using an RF ablation device as recited in Claim 14 of the '183 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Minerva's reliance on elements of its device-i.e., use of argon gas and plasma energy-to differentiate its device is unavailing. Those elements are not claimed by Hologic. Minerva's argument that Minerva EAS embodies Minerva's patent (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C343%2C078\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,343,078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) is relevant but is not dispositive of the issue of infringement.\n   <em>\n    National Presto Indus., Inc. v.

Cir. 1996) (stating \"[t]he grant of a separate patent on the accused device does not automatically avoid infringement, either literal or by equivalency. Improvements or modifications may indeed be separately patentable if the requirements of patentability are met, yet the device may or may not avoid infringement of the prior patent.\"). That an infringer may patent improvements to an invention does not negate the fact of infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   The evidence shows that Minerva has directly infringed the asserted claims of the '183 and '348 Patents by having its paid consultants perform infringing endometrial ablations in its promotional videos. Further, it produces operating manuals, instructions for use, instructional videos, training materials, and on-site training on how to use the Minerva EAS that infringes the Patents. Also, Minerva clearly induces and contributes to infringement by its customers. Minerva's customers infringe by using Minerva's included components for their intended purpose consistent with Minerva's instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Consistent with the court's claim construction, the court finds that undisputed evidence in the record establishes that Minerva has infringed the asserted claims of Hologic's patents. Accordingly, the court finds that Hologic's motion for summary judgment on the issue of infringement should be granted and Minerva's corresponding motion should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   E.

Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Minerva moves for summary judgment on Hologic's unfair competition claims. Minerva states that all four of Hologic's unfair competition claims hinge on the same theory-i.e., that Minerva's sales staff deceptively described Minerva's EAS as the \"new NovaSure,\" \"NovaSure 2.0\" and/or is from \"the makers of NovaSure.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   It asserts that Hologic's claims fail as a matter of law because Hologic has failed to produce or elicit any evidence supporting its allegations of deceptive statements, and cannot establish causation or harm. Minerva also argues that any allegedly disparaging comments were mere puffery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Hologic contends the motion should be denied because Minerva has not addressed its claim relating to disparagement. It further argues that it has shown a likelihood of confusion as a result of Minerva's alleged conduct. It argues, at the least, a jury should resolve the issue of whether there is a likelihood of confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Hologic has presented evidence that Minerva's employees obtained Hologic's confidential and proprietary data and information and circulated it to the sales team. There is also evidence that Minerva employees made allegedly disparaging remarks about Hologic to potential customers, hired former NovaSure sales representatives, used misleading sales tactics and allegedly advised customers to break Hologic contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   2.
