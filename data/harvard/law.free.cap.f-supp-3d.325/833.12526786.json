To assist the Court and parties in litigating (and hopefully settling) these cases and beginning to abate the crisis, the Court directed the Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\") and the Department of Justice ( \"DOJ\") (collectively, the \"United States\") to produce transactional data for all 50 States and several Territories from its Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (\"ARCOS\") database.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the data contains law enforcement-sensitive information and confidential commercial information of the reporting manufacturers, distributors and retailers, the DEA does not release ARCOS data publicly. The DEA has produced the ARCOS data to certain entities and individuals in this MDL at the direction of the Court for this litigation only, Doc ##: 233, 397, 400, and under the safeguards of a Protective Order, Doc #: 167 - an Order that was rigorously negotiated over a significant period of time by the parties in the MDL and the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the\n   United States agreed to the disclosure of ARCOS data to State Attorneys General (\"State AGs\") \"specifically conditioned upon\" the DEA and DOJ receiving a list of the State AGs who receive the data, a copy of the Protective Order Acknowledgment Form signed by each State AG who receives the data, notice of any distribution of the data by any State AG to any other authorized individuals, and notice of, and the opportunity to object to, any public records request submitted to any State AG for the data. Doc #: 542 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Certain recipients of the ARCOS data - Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Summit County, Ohio, and Cabell County, West Virginia (hereafter, \"the Counties\") - have received public records requests from the Washington Post and HD Media (together, \"the Media\") asking for copies of the ARCOS data furnished to the Counties in the course of discovery in this MDL. The Court has reviewed the briefs of the entities favoring disclosure of the ARCOS data to the Media. Doc #: 718 (Washington Post); Doc #: 719 (Track One Plaintiffs), Doc #: 725 (HD Media). The Court has also reviewed the briefs of entities objecting to disclosure of this data to the Media.

The Rule further provides that a protective order may, among other things, forbid requested discovery or disclosure, specify the terms for discovery or disclosure, forbid inquiry into certain matters or limit the scope of discovery or disclosure to certain matters, or require that trade secret or commercial information not be revealed or that it be revealed only in a specified way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 26(c)(1)(A)-(H).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Protective orders issued under Rule 26(c) serve the vital function of securing the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of civil disputes by encouraging full disclosure of all evidence that might conceivably be relevant,\" an objective which \"represents the cornerstone of our administration of civil justice.\"\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

Specifically, HD Media contends that detailed West Virginia ARCOS data for 2007-2012 \"is currently in the public domain and none of the harm claimed here occurred as a result of its disclosure in 2016.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   There are numerous legal and factual distinctions between the West Virginia cases and this MDL. First, as previously\n   noted, a protective order prevents a party from disseminating only that information obtained through use of the discovery process. \"Thus, the party may disseminate the identical information covered by the protective order\n   <em>\n    as long as the information is gained through means independent of the court's processes\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Seattle Times\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193483\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/20/#p32\">\n    467 U.S. at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193483\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/20/#p32\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Second, the decision of the West Virginia court on how to supervise its civil cases does not have any precedential effect on how the undersigned supervises discovery in this MDL. Third, in the West Virginia cases, the Charleston Gazette-Mail asked the court to unseal second amended complaints; here, the Media is asking the Counties to disclose the federal government's entire ARCOS dataset produced within the confines of a protective order in the course of discovery in this MDL. As shown above, the standard of review for challenging a protective order during discovery (a showing of good cause) is much more lenient than the standard of review for unsealing judicial documents (a presumption of public access). Finally, the reason cited by defendants in the West Virginia cases as a basis for denying the motion was confidential commercial injury. Here, the United States cites as a basis for nondisclosure, in addition to confidential commercial information, the need to protect law enforcement-sensitive information, which is a subject this Court takes very seriously.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In sum, a showing of \"good cause\" under Rule 26(c)(1) is sufficient to meet constitutional and common-law objections to a protective order that restricts the disclosure of certain discovery to unauthorized users, whether these materials are filed with the court in connection with discovery matters or remain solely in the possession of the parties and their counsel.\n   <em>\n    Flagg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272128\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/268/279/#p291\">\n    268 F.R.D. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   294 (citing\n   <em>\n    Chicago Tribune\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9487856\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/263/1304/#p1310\">\n    263 F.3d at 1310-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .).

It is a law-enforcement tool of the United States that it shares only with local law enforcement agencies to stem illicit drug-trafficking.

And while certain parties are preparing for trial, the Court is most heavily involved in global settlement negotiations which cannot be achieved absent the involvement of all proper parties. Allowing the ARCOS data to be disclosed to the Media pursuant to public records requests to the Counties would eviscerate the Court's Protective Order and contradict the bedrock principle that discovery is a private process, the sole purpose of which is to assist trial preparation and, in this case, global settlement discussions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The March 2019 trial in this MDL will be open to the public, and the evidence presented will become a matter of public record.
