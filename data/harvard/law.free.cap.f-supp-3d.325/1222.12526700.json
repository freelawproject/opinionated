Molzen, United States Magistrate Judge's Order to Show Cause, filed May 3, 2018 (Doc. 6)(\"Show Cause Order\"). In the Show Cause Order, Magistrate Judge Molzen ordered Castillo to show cause why the Court should not dismiss as untimely her Petition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for Writ of Habeas Corpus by a Person in State Custody, filed January 17, 2018 (Doc. 1)(\" \u00a7 2254 Petition\"). Castillo appears to seek equitable tolling of the one-year limitation period, contending that she \"has been researching continuously ... [the] legal issues pertaining to [her] case,\" but she has not been provided with access to \"case law pertaining to cases with issues in common\" or \"[a]dequate legal assistance.\" Response at 1. Additionally, Castillo alleges that she has been \"moved from one facility to another after being [on] lockdown for several months.\" Response at 1. For the reasons explained below, the Court will dismiss Castillo's \u00a7 2254 petition with prejudice, deny a certificate of appealability, and enter Final Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Castillo's \u00a7 2254 Petition reveals the following facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in The United States District Courts (requiring the Court to \"promptly examine\" and dismiss a \u00a7 2254 petition \"[i]f it plainly appears from the petition and any attached exhibits that the petitioner is not entitled to relief\"). On April 8, 2013, Castillo was convicted of trafficking controlled substances in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-31-20\">\n    N.M.

Castillo did not file an appeal from the judgment of conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   New Mexico Courts Case Lookup at 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 24, 2013, Castillo filed a state petition for writ of habeas corpus alleging that she received ineffective assistance of counsel and that the evidence was insufficient to support her convictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   New Mexico Courts Case Lookup at 23. Castillo's state petition for writ of habeas corpus was dismissed on October 8, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   New Mexico Courts Case Lookup at 23. More than four years later, on January 17, 2018, Castillo filed the present \u00a7 2254 petition, which also raises ineffective assistance of counsel and insufficiency of the evidence claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2254 Petition at 5, 7. Because Castillo filed the \u00a7 2254 Petition more than one year after her conviction had become final, Magistrate Judge Molzen ordered her to show cause why the Court should not dismiss her petition as untimely under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Show Cause Order at 1. Magistrate Judge Molzen notified Castillo that, although the one-year limitation period in \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) is subject to equitable tolling, such tolling is appropriate only in \"rare and exceptional circumstances,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Gibson v.

In response, Castillo appears to ask the Court to toll the one-year limitation period, because she has been denied access to relevant case law and adequate legal assistance, she has been on lockdown for months, and she has been transferred from one facility to another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   There is a one-year limitation period on the filing of a \u00a7 2254 petition, which begins to run, in relevant part, on \"the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of time for seeking such review.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A). Castillo did not file a direct appeal from the judgment of conviction and, therefore, her convictions became final thirty days after the entry of judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.M.R.A. 12-201(A)(1)(b) (providing that an appeal as of right must be filed \"within thirty (30) days after the judgment or order appealed from is filed in the district court clerk's office\"). Accordingly, absent statutory or equitable tolling, the one-year limitation period to file a timely \u00a7 2254 petition expired on May 8, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The one-year limitation period is subject to statutory tolling during the time in which \"a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2). Castillo's state petition for writ of habeas corpus was pending for seventy-six days, from July 24, 2013 until October 8, 2013, which tolled the expiration of the one-year limitation period to July 23, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Castillo filed her \u00a7 2254 Petition on January 17, 2018 and, thus, it is untimely unless the doctrine of equitable tolling applies. \"Generally, equitable tolling requires a litigant to establish two elements: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.\"\n   <em>\n    Yang v.

Ignorance of the law, and lack of access to unspecified legal materials or legal assistance, \"even for an incarcerated pro se petitioner, generally does not excuse prompt filing.\"\n   <em>\n    Marsh v.

Additionally, neither prison lockdowns nor transfers between different prison facilities constitute the type of rare and exceptional circumstance that warrant application of the doctrine of equitable tolling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dill v.

Accordingly, the Court concludes that Castillo is not entitled to equitable tolling of the one-year limitation period in \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), and the Court will dismiss her \u00a7 2254 petition with prejudice as time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In a habeas proceeding, \"[t]he district court must issue or deny a certificate of appealability when it enters a final order adverse to the applicant.\" Rule 11(a) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases In The United States District Courts.
