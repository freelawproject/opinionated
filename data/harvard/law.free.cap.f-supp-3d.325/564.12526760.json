Kegerise (\"Plaintiff\") initiated the above-captioned action on April 17, 2014, in connection with her previous employment as the superintendent of Susquehanna Township School District. (Doc. No. 1.) Plaintiff subsequently filed an amended complaint (Doc. No. 4), which Defendants moved to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on July 15, 2014 (Doc. No. 12). In a Memorandum and Order dated January 7, 2015, the Court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss (Doc. Nos. 34, 35), dismissing Plaintiff's claims for constructive termination, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress without leave to amend, and dismissing Plaintiff's FMLA retaliation claim with leave to amend (Doc. No. 35). Plaintiff then filed a second amended complaint on January 28, 2015. (Doc. No. 36.) By way of a joint stipulation filed on February 12, 2015 (Doc. No. 38), Plaintiff filed a third amended complaint on February 27, 2015 (Doc. No. 39), which sets forth nine (9) counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants filed a motion to dismiss certain counts in the third amended complaint on March 19, 2015 (Doc. No. 40), which the Court granted in part and denied in part (Doc. Nos. 43, 44). Accordingly, the following eight (8) claims remain before the Court: a due process claim against Defendants under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count II); a claim for breach of contract against the District (Count III); a claim for tortious interference with a contract against Karl, Rawls, and Sussman (Count IV); a claim for wrongful use of civil proceedings in violation of 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 8351,\n   <em>\n    etseq.\n   </em>\n   against Rawls and Sussman (Count VII); an FMLA retaliation claim against Defendants (Count VIII); a First Amendment retaliation claim against Defendants (Count IX); a retaliation claim under the Pennsylvania Constitution against Defendants (Count X); and a sex discrimination claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e,\n   <em>\n    etseq.\n   </em>\n   against Defendants (Count XII). Defendants move for summary judgment on each of the aforementioned counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 152.) The Court heard oral argument on the motion on June 8, 2018, and having been fully briefed (Doc. Nos. 163, 167, 168), the motion is ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiff's Employment with the District and Federal Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff's employment as the superintendent of the District began in January of 2010. (Doc. No. 153 \u00b6 1.) Plaintiff, whose employment was governed by an employment agreement/contract with the District, signed a second employment agreement (the \"employment agreement\") with respect to her role as superintendent on May 7, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) On April 17, 2014, Plaintiff filed the original complaint in this action against Defendants (Doc. No. 1). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) The complaint included,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , a claim for \"constructive termination.\" (Doc. No. 1.) Four days later, during a public meeting on April 21, 2014, the District's school board (the \"Board\") \"took a vote ... which [the Board] represented as a vote to accept [Plaintiff's] resignation.\" (Doc. No. 153 \u00b6 21.) Defendants Karl, Rawls, and Sussman were members of the Board at this time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The District \"memorialized the Board's April 21, 2014 vote by letter dated April 22, 2014\" that was signed by John Dietrich (\"Dietrich\"), who was then serving as the president of the Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) During this process, the Board did not provide Plaintiff \"with notice stating that she had been 'terminated.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Rather, the letter stated that the Board \"voted to accept [Plaintiff's] resignation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Before voting to accept what it deemed Plaintiff's resignation, Dietrich \"read a prepared statement on behalf of the Board\" that reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"history\" id=\"p-17\">\n   The Board hereby emphatically disputes any and all claims raised by [Plaintiff] at\n   United States Middle District Court at docket 1:14-cv-00747-WWC, which includes \"constructive discharge,\" however, it recommends that the Board accept the resignation of [Plaintiff] that is implicit with the term \"constructive discharge.\" Do I have a motion to approve her resignation, effective 4/17/2014 as stated?\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    The individual defendants are referred to collectively as \"Defendants\" herein.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    As noted in the third amended complaint, the Court dismissed Counts I, V, and VI in its January 7, 2015 Memorandum and Order granting in part and denying in part Defendants' motion to dismiss the first complaint. (Doc. No. 39 at 22, 29.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    The Court dismissed Count XI, which set forth a Title VII race discrimination claim, when it resolved the motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. (Doc. Nos. 43, 44.) Additionally, Defendants previously filed a motion for summary judgment (Doc. No. 110), which was rendered moot by their filing of the instant motion for summary judgment (Doc. No. 174).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    The following relevant facts of record are taken in part from Defendants' statement of material facts (Doc. No. 153), Plaintiff's \"responses\" to Defendant's statement of material facts (Doc. No. 157), Plaintiff's \"additional statement of facts\" (Doc. No. 157), which is part of Plaintiff's responses to Defendant's statement of facts, and Defendants' \"reply\" to Plaintiff's additional statement of facts (Doc. 169). All of these documents contain specific citations to the record in each numbered paragraph. At times, Defendants have responded to a statement made by Plaintiff with: \"denied as stated.\" In that event, the Court has cited the record underlying Plaintiff's statement. At other times, the parties have directly cited a portion of the record in their briefs and have not relied on one of their statements. In that event, the Court has also cited the record. Finally, in certain instances, the Court has cited the record to assist in resolving the summary judgment motion. Unless otherwise specified, the facts recited in this section are deemed undisputed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    Plaintiff's employment agreement with the District is governed by Pennsylvania's school code, which promulgates requirements for,\n    <em>\n     inter\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     alia\n    </em>\n    , the removal of superintendents.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    24 Pa.

Plaintiff's Sick Leave\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    Prior to the aforementioned events, while Plaintiff was superintendent, she notified the District's business manager \"that she was under a doctor's care and that she would be off of work\" around March of 2014.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    (Doc.

As superintendent, Plaintiff \"did not personally develop and disseminate FMLA administrative regulations, but instead delegated that responsibility to [the District's] business manager\" who, at that time, was Mike Frentz (\"Frentz\"). (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) Plaintiff was advised by Frentz that pursuant to the District's own procedure, employees were required \"to exhaust their sick leave prior to requesting FMLA leave.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 12.) Plaintiff maintains that she took sick leave due to symptoms, \"which included nose bleeds and cardiac issues\" resulting from \"job-related stress.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 179.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Interactions Between Plaintiff, the School Board, and Other Individuals Affiliated with the District During Plaintiff's Time as Superintendent\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    <strong>\n     i. Undisputed Facts\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    As testified to by Kathy DelGrande (\"DelGrande\"), a Board member and school parent, Plaintiff was \"subjected to inappropriate treatment by Board members\" while serving as superintendent. (Doc. No. 157 \u00b6 85.) Such treatment involved discussions by Board members on Facebook that, according to Plaintiff, included discussions of Plaintiff and her performance as superintendent in unfavorable terms. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 100.) DelGrande testified that there were often \"staged\" situations at public Board meetings (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 102), which Plaintiff claims were orchestrated so as to cause disruption and embarrass her. Moreover, Karl testified that \"the leaders of the [F]acebook group\" had discussed the idea of circulating a petition calling for Plaintiff's resignation. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 105.) In a similar vein, DelGrande testified that \"Rawls, Dietrich, and Sussman often walked into public meetings and knowingly told falsehoods to embarrass Plaintiff,\" such as statements indicating that teachers were leaving the District \"because of the District [a]dministration.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 118.) Additionally, Dr. Peter Sakol (\"Sakol\"), another Board member, testified that Plaintiff was \"screamed at\" by Board members. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 122.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    <strong>\n     ii. Disputed Facts\n    </strong>\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    Plaintiff also maintains that while she was superintendent, members of the Board attempted to embarrass her publicly on multiple occasions, and \"publicly criticized Plaintiff for her [c]ontract,\" while refraining from doing so as to male superintendents who succeeded Plaintiff in her employment with the District. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 86-88.) According to Plaintiff, such attempts to embarrass her included Rawls and Sussman's public announcement that they intended to file a complaint against the District and Plaintiff in federal court on October 31, 2013 (the \"Rawls and Sussman lawsuit\"), as well as Rawls and Sussman's \"provid[ing] a copy of said [c]omplaint to the newspaper in which they criticized Plaintiff's contract.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 89-90.) Plaintiff further claims that along with Karl and Sussman, Board members Dietrich and Clifton Edwards (\"Edwards\"), were \"part of a small anti-Plaintiff Facebook group,\" through which negative information about Plaintiff was published (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 100), and that while Plaintiff was superintendent, Board members \"met with the leader of the Facebook group, Bonnie Finnerty, and arranged for people to show up at Board meetings to harass and embarrass [Plaintiff].\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 103.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Further, Plaintiff states that she was told by the Board \"not to speak at Board meetings,\" and that when she did speak, she was \"cut off\" from doing so, while male superintendents did not receive such treatment when they spoke at Board meetings. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 112-13.) Also in the context of Board meetings, Plaintiff avers that the Board permitted \"nonresidents to criticize Plaintiff ... but did not allow it in the case of male superintendents,\" and also allowed \"commentators critical of Plaintiff to go beyond the [three]-minute time limit,\" in addition to \"refus[ing] to shut down inappropriate behaviors directed at Plaintiff.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 114-16.) According to Plaintiff, the \"Board regularly interfered with [her] ability to carry out her professional responsibilities\" as superintendent. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 121.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    <strong>\n     4. Plaintiff's Performance as Superintendent\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Plaintiff's tenure as superintendent was reportedly marked by various developments within the District. Specifically, while Plaintiff was the superintendent, the arrest record was reportedly lower than that during the tenure of a previous superintendent, David Volkman (\"Superintendent Volkman\" or \"Volkman\") (Doc. No. 122-6 at 42), and \"township arrests\" and \"disruptions\" allegedly decreased by eighty percent (Doc. No. 122-3 at 38). DelGrande testified that, consequently, \"[t]hings were much calmer in the school.\" (Doc. No. 122-6 at 42:25.) According to DelGrande, during her daughter's senior year, \"there was not one phone call that the school was in lockdown\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 43-44), and there were no reports of scheduling issues (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 43). DelGrande testified further that during this time, there were no incidents of misuse of District funds (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 46), and unnecessary positions were eliminated within the District (Doc. No. 157 \u00b6 74).\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    <strong>\n     5. Previous Superintendents\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Before Plaintiff became superintendent, Superintendent Volkman, a male, was employed\n    as the District superintendent. (Doc. No. 157 \u00b6 44.) During his tenure as superintendent, DelGrande's daughter was a tenth-grade student. During this period, it was reported that there were multiple instances during which the school was on lockdown. (Doc. No. 122-6 at 11.) In addition, fights between students allegedly occurred. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 11-13.) DelGrande and other parents reportedly met with Superintendent Volkman to discuss these occurrences at the high school (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 15), and Board members were also involved in these meetings (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 10-11).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Issues concerning student discipline were also reported during Superintendent Volkman's tenure with the District (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 12), and the parents' meetings continued as a result of dissatisfaction with his handling of these disciplinary issues (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    ). Initially, according to DelGrande's testimony, parents of students thought that Superintendent Volkman considered the issues \"overblown\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 15), but when parents began meeting with him and providing him with information about certain incidents, the police were contacted and police officers were even assigned to the school lunchroom (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 15-16). Further, as expressed by DelGrande, Superintendent Volkman was not disciplined as a result of these occurrences at the school. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 16.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    In addition, while superintendent, Volkman hired a business manager named Matthew Malinowski (\"Malinowski\"), who, as allegedly revealed through an audit, purchased personal items with District funds. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 21-22.) In an April 13, 2010 letter from Plaintiff to Malinowski, Plaintiff listed items that should not have been charged to the District. (Doc. No. 121-1 at 85.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    Additionally, it was reported that during his tenure, former employees-some of whom were then deceased-were not removed from health-care enrollment lists, which presumably resulted in the loss of \"an exorbitant amount\" of funds. (Doc. No. 122-6 at 22-24.) In addition, DelGrande stated that while Mr. Volkman was the superintendent, the school administration did not apply for reimbursement for capital improvements under Pennsylvania's PlanCon program, which resulted in the loss of approximately seven million dollars. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 24-25, 28-29.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    Further, DelGrande stated that the Board neither took corrective action against Superintendent Volkman on any of these issues (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 24-25, 28-29), nor disciplined Malinowski for failing to remove former employees from the health-care list (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 24).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    DelGrande also testified that under Superintendent Volkman's leadership, there were issues as to the adequacy of instruction of certain classes within the District. (Doc. No. 157 \u00b6 54.) Further, DelGrande stated that some classes consisted of thirty-two to thirty-three students, while other classes had five or six students, and \"[t]here were major scheduling issues at the high school.\" (Doc. No. 122-6 at 32-34.) She stated there were \"major issues as far as [advanced placement] classes,\" including what the District offered in comparison to what other schools offered (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 38), and that while the Board was aware\n    of the problems concerning class sizes, it reportedly did not discipline Superintendent Volkman as a result of such problems (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 34-35).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    While Volkman was superintendent, the District was sued and eventually settled a lawsuit alleging sexual abuse of a female student by a driver's education teacher. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 39-40.) According to DelGrande, the Board attempted to portray the incident as not having occurred (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 39), and in her opinion, Superintendent Volkman \"tried to cover it up\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 40). Additionally, during his tenure, non-residents were reportedly permitted to register as students and attend school within the District. (Doc. No. 157 \u00b6 62.) DelGrande testified that the Board did not discipline Superintendent Volkman for permitting this practice, although it was aware that he was doing so. (Doc. No. 122-6 at 39.) Further, he allegedly did not experience the same criticisms and behavior from Board members that Plaintiff claims she experienced. (Doc. No. 122-9 at 24.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    <strong>\n     6. Subsequent Superintendents\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Following the end of Plaintiff's tenure as superintendent on April 21, 2014, all of the interim superintendents-Jeffrey Miller (\"Miller\"), Richard Daubert (\"Daubert\"), and Todd Kline (\"Kline\")-were male. (Doc. No. 157 \u00b6 45.) Under the leadership of these superintendents, according to certain deposition testimony, the following events occurred. DelGrande testified that under Miller and Daubert, there was an increase in the number of incidents reported to the police at the high school, relative to those reported during Plaintiff's tenure. (Doc. No. 122-7 at 4.) Sakol testified that he did not think that student discipline improved under the superintendents after Plaintiff (Doc. No. 122-9 at 25), and district finances reportedly worsened (Doc. No. 122-7 at 4).\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    In response to a question about educational quality, DelGrande said, \"[w]ell, the students weren't getting what they had received before.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 6.) Further, according to DelGrande, scheduling issues and other administrative concerns reappeared. (Doc. No. 157 \u00b6\u00b6 81, 82.) In addition, Miller allegedly signed a $40,000 contract without the requisite approval from the Board, but was not disciplined by the Board for doing so. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 83.)

Applicability of Qualified Immunity to Individual Defendants\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Defendants argue that in this case, they decided \"simply to accept the verified allegations in [Plaintiff's] original [c]omplaint as the resignation of her position,\" and that, \"[w]hether this was a correct position, a mistake of law, a mistake of fact, or both, immunity should still attach to each of the members of the Board, including the individual Defendants.\" (Doc. No. 163 at 33.) According to Defendants, \"the Board reasonably believed, and still believes that its conduct complied with the law,\" and \"it cannot be said that [Plaintiff's] due process and the constitutional rights alleged in her [t]hird [a]mended [c]omplaint were 'clearly established.' \" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 34.) Conversely, Plaintiff asserts that qualified immunity is inapplicable because it \"is only a defense to actions seeking to hold defendants personally liable for their actions taken under the color of law\" that \"does not apply to official capacity actions, which require a showing that the\n    individual acted in accordance with a policy or custom of the governmental entity, and the policy was the 'driving force' behind the alleged constitutional or statutory violation.\" (Doc. No. 167 at 32.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The Court concludes that under the standard articulated above, qualified immunity does not apply to Karl, Rawls, and Sussman. As an initial matter, the Court notes that the caption of the third amended complaint indicates that Plaintiff is suing the aforementioned Defendants in both their individual and official capacities (Doc. No. 39), and, therefore, qualified immunity would apply to them to the extent that they are sued in their individual capacities. However, Plaintiff appears to disclaim any intent that she is suing Karl, Rawls, and Sussman in their individual capacities, but rather, asserts that she has set forth claims against them only in their official capacities. In light of the fact that Plaintiff has asserted claims against these Defendants in their official capacities, the Court finds that qualified immunity is inapposite, for official capacity suits are \"only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Monell v.

Plaintiff's Due Process Claim\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Defendants argue that as to this count, Plaintiff cannot establish a claim of a due process violation because she resigned\n    from her position as superintendent, asserting that when an employee leaves her employment based on her own free will, that employee \"is deemed to have relinquished [her] property interest in [her] continued employment for the government, and cannot contend that [she] was deprived [her] due process rights.\" (Doc. No. 163 at 4) (alterations in original). Stating that Plaintiff \"implicitly tendered her resignation when she filed her original [c]omplaint and alleged that she was constructively discharged\" and positing that an employee's resignation is a prerequisite to a claim for constructive discharge, Defendants argue primarily that Plaintiff could not have been constructively discharged-or, in other words, have involuntarily left her position-because her original complaint, wherein she alleged constructive discharge, contemplated her resignation. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4-8.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    On January 7, 2015, in ruling on Defendants' motion to dismiss the first complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Judge Caldwell explicitly rejected the concept that Plaintiff's filing of a complaint that includes an allegation of constructive discharge-of which actual resignation is an element-could constitute a resignation and thus preclude any due process claim. (Doc. No. 43 at 24.) In opposing Defendants' summary judgment motion, Plaintiff, therefore, maintains that \"this Court already considered and rejected Defendants' argument that Plaintiff resigned by filing a claim for constructive discharge,\" and \"[a]s their argument was a legal rather than a factual one, Defendants should not be allowed to re-litigate it except on appeal.\" (Doc. No. 167 at 4.) Additionally, Plaintiff maintains that in her original complaint, she did not allege that she resigned, nor did she \"submit a formal resignation in verbal or written form,\" and she also \"continued to make herself available to the Board even though she was on sick leave.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Plaintiff further supports her argument by stating that she could have submitted a formal, written letter of resignation, but chose not to do so, as she did not resign. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4-5.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Addressing the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's ruling on Plaintiff's mandamus action and its import as to the instant motion, Defendants urge the Court to look to the Supreme Court's reasoning that \"[i]n order to maintain a claim of constructive discharge, an employee first must demonstrate that he or she actually resigned.\" (Doc. No. 179 at 4.) Specifically, Defendants highlight that the supreme court relied on certain factors in concluding that Plaintiff resigned, including: (1) the timing of Plaintiff's federal complaint; (2) the fact that Plaintiff filed a verified complaint that included an allegation of constructive discharge and sought damages related to her salary and future salary; (3) the fact that Plaintiff was involved in drafting her employment agreement that contemplated \"constructive termination\"; (4) Plaintiff's mandamus testimony indicating she understood the meaning of the term \"constructive discharge\" and that it carried the same definition in both her state and federal actions; and (5) \"[t]he fact that [Plaintiff] had also conceded that resignation was a required element of constructive discharge.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 5-6.) Further, Defendants assert that in construing the Pennsylvania School Code, the Supreme Court ruled that Plaintiff \"was not entitled to any due process or a hearing prior to the School Board's decision to accept her resignation\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 6), which thus undermines Plaintiff's entire due process claim. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7) (stating that \"[t]he sole vehicle\" for Plaintiff's due process claim has been deemed inapplicable by the state supreme court).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    In her supplemental brief addressing the recent decision in her mandamus action\n    in the context of the motion that is before this Court, Plaintiff does not address directly the aforementioned arguments made by Defendants. Rather, Plaintiff argues that the Supreme Court's ruling was legally deficient and, thus, should be disregarded by this Court. First, Plaintiff asserts that the state court,\n    <em>\n     inter\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     alia\n    </em>\n    , made certain improper factual determinations unsupported by the record, thus \"overturn[ing] findings of fact made by the trial court,\" and disregarded \"evidence showing that Plaintiff did not intend to relinquish her position and Defendants knew it.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 3-17.) Second, Plaintiff argues that in discussing the relationship between the element of actual resignation and the broader concept of constructive discharge, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court interpreted federal law on constructive discharge in such a way that produces the anomalous result of penalizing Plaintiff for initiating a federal action in order to protect her employment. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 18-20.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The Court concludes that summary judgment in favor of Defendants is warranted as to Plaintiff's due process claim. As Defendants note, the basis for Plaintiff's due process claim as alleged in Count II of the third amended complaint is the Pennsylvania School Code, which the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has interpreted as not bestowing upon Plaintiff a right to notice and a hearing. While Plaintiff may disagree with the decision of the Commonwealth's highest court regarding her mandamus action, this Court is ultimately bound by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's interpretation of Pennsylvania state law, including its analysis of the School Code.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    As a result, because as a matter of law the District was not required to provide Plaintiff with notice and a hearing in conjunction with the end of her employment with the District, no reasonable factfinder could conclude that Plaintiff is entitled to relief on her due process claim. Accordingly, Defendants' motion for summary judgment will be granted as to Count II of the third amended complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    <strong>\n     C.

(Doc. No. 179 at 8.) According to Defendants, Plaintiff's breach of contract claim is ultimately \"founded on her mistaken contention that she was entitled to continue as an employee while maintaining her constructive discharge claim,\" and the ultimate disposition of her mandamus action further highlights the flawed nature of this belief.\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The Court concludes that summary judgment in favor of Defendants is warranted as to Plaintiff's claim for breach of contract. As explained above, a claim for breach of contract is fundamentally a matter of state law. In this instance, Plaintiff maintains that she did not resign, but rather, that she left her employment with the District involuntarily, a contention that would typically preclude the entry of summary judgment on the basis of the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    The state supreme court, however, specifically addressed the scenario that Plaintiff alleges constituted a breach of contract, concluding that \"[w]e cannot impose a duty upon the Board to provide notice and a hearing to a resigning superintendent absent any language in [the School Code] that directs us to do so.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kegerise v.

In examining the School Code-a product of Pennsylvania law-the court explicitly stated that, based on its conclusion that Plaintiff resigned, the District did not owe any type of duty to Plaintiff to provide her with notice and a hearing. Plaintiff,\n    therefore, cannot meet her burden in establishing sufficient facts to survive the motion for summary judgment on this claim, as she cannot establish the existence of the duty she alleges was breached.

Plaintiff's Tortious Interference Claim\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment as to Plaintiff's tortious interference claim because Plaintiff \"has failed to adduce any evidence of purposeful action ... specifically intended to harm [Plaintiff's] contractual relationship\" and Plaintiff has not proffered evidence of \"actual legal damage as a result of the alleged conduct.\" (Doc. No. 163 at 16.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    In opposition, Plaintiff asserts that neither of the aforementioned arguments has merit, citing her statement of material facts for the proposition that \"Rawls and Sussman reached out to a Pennlive reporter\" to announce their intention to file the subject lawsuit, \"waited twenty-five (25) days to file the [c]omplaint, which contained a number of meritless claims\"; amended the complaint by,\n    <em>\n     inter\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     alia\n    </em>\n    , removing the District as a Defendant; and subsequently withdrawing the claim after receiving a letter from the District's solicitor \"detailing the frivolous nature of the [c]omplaint and threatening sanctions.\" (Doc. No. 167 at 19.) Further, Plaintiff points to Rawls and Sussman's statement-made at the time they withdrew the complaint-that \"while we are confident the courts would have found in our favor, the reasons for filing this action have been corrected as a result of community and media interest in this case and recent events.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Plaintiff argues that such a statement amounts to an admission that the lawsuit was filed for an improper purpose. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) According to Plaintiff, therefore, \"a reasonable trier of fact could find that ... the actions and statements of Defendants were designed to and did, in\n    fact, convince members of the Board to violate Plaintiff's [c]ontract.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 20.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The Court concludes that Defendants have not met their burden in demonstrating that summary judgment is warranted as to Plaintiff's tortious interference claim. Although Plaintiff refers to the Rawls and Sussman lawsuit in support of this claim, and Defendants maintain that the initiation of this lawsuit cannot establish that Rawls and Sussman caused the entire Board to terminate Plaintiff's employment agreement with the District, the Court notes that Plaintiff has alleged several additional facts that could lead a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the aforementioned elements for a tortious interference claim have been met. For example, Plaintiff's additional statement of facts includes,\n    <em>\n     inter\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     alia\n    </em>\n    , the following factual assertions:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n    118.

No. 163 at 20.) Further, Defendants state that Plaintiff cannot show that she \"opposed any act or practice made unlawful by the FMLA or that she participated in any manner in an investigation,\n    proceeding or hearing under the FMLA,\" pointing to Plaintiff's responsibility for overseeing the administration of the District's FMLA policy and benefits. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 21.) In addition, Defendants note that Plaintiff had 249 days of sick leave and 30 vacation days available to her \"before she would have need to take FMLA leave.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    In opposition, Plaintiff indicates that the circumstances surrounding her request for FMLA paperwork and the end of her employment with the District demonstrate a causal connection between her invocation of FMLA protections and what she interprets as an adverse employment action. (Doc. No. 167 at 24.) Plaintiff also notes that \"at the time of her request for FMLA [leave] ... [she] had met the 1250 hour requirement and, arguably, the serious medical condition requirement[,] given her cardiac symptoms evidenced in the record, and that, but for the District's administrative policies, she would have been eligible for FMLA [leave].\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Defendants argue that the recent decision in Plaintiff's mandamus action impacts this Court's analysis of her FMLA claim because given that the state court \"found that [Plaintiff] separated from her employment in order to pursue her constructive discharge claims in this Court,\" she \"cannot also now claim that the cessation of her employment was causally related to her invocation of her rights to FMLA leave since she herself chose the time and place to separate from employment.\" (Doc. No. 179 at 10.) Defendants thus maintain that \"[i]f [Plaintiff's] due process claim cannot proceed and this Court has already dismissed her constructive discharge claim, then there is no adverse job action caused by the Defendants.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    While Plaintiff's supplemental brief does not appear to address the specific issue of how the subsequent mandamus ruling impacts her FMLA claim, Plaintiff describes the timeline of events related to the end of Plaintiff's employment as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n    After the incessant discriminatory abuse by Defendants over a long period finally led to stress induced nose bleeds and cardiac issues, Plaintiff took sick leave on the advice of her doctors and requested FMLA leave. When complaints about the treatment of her had no effect, Plaintiff filed suit to protect her job on April 17, 2014 and her doctor sent a letter to Defendants advising them that Plaintiff would be on sick leave for an indefinite period. Being prepared to argue that being forced to take sick leave was the functional equivalent of being forced to resign, Plaintiff included a claim for constructive discharge in her [c]omplaint. Despite receiving the doctor's letter from Plaintiff's doctor, the Defendants voted to \"accept Plaintiff's resignation\"-alleging that the pleading of constructive discharge constituted a resignation as a matter of law.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    (Doc. No. 184 at 2.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The Court concludes that no reasonable factfinder could find for Plaintiff in regard to her FMLA retaliation claim, as the applicable District policy required Plaintiff to exhaust her sick leave prior to invoking her FMLA leave. (Doc. No. 157 \u00b6 12.) Given that it is undisputed Plaintiff was required to exhaust approximately thirty-five weeks of paid leave prior to using FMLA leave, Plaintiff has not put forth sufficient evidence to establish a causal link between any adverse employment and the exercise of her FMLA rights.

Further, Plaintiff has produced sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Defendants were motivated by her filing of a complaint to effectively terminate her, especially in light of the Board's reference to Plaintiff's original complaint in the meeting minutes related to their vote to accept what they deemed her resignation. (Doc.

No. 122-2) (providing Plaintiff's deposition testimony in which she states that Rawls referred to her using such an expletive).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Further, Plaintiff has proffered evidence that her job performance as superintendent did not warrant being terminated, and that similarly-situated male employees did not experience the same working conditions of which she complains. Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that evidence demonstrates that male superintendents whose tenures preceded and succeeded hers were treated more favorably than she was, despite Plaintiff's job performance. DelGrande testified that a group of individuals would meet at Finnerty's home, attend Board meetings, and behave disruptively therein (Doc. No. 122-7 at 21-22), and that Sussman, Karl, Dietrich and Rawls encouraged this behavior (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 22). Further, the record suggests that male superintendents were not subjected to such behavior, and public criticism of male superintendents was prevented. (Doc. No. 157 \u00b6 117.) In her deposition, DelGrande also stated that Plaintiff was instructed not to speak at Board meetings (Doc. No. 122-7 at 34), yet male superintendents did not face such a restriction (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    ), and that the Board also demanded that Plaintiff form a disciplinary committee to involve community members in the District's disciplinary process (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 59), while declining to impose such a requirement on male superintendents (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    ). Such a discrepancy in Board-imposed requirements was also reported with respect to preapproval of checks. (Doc. Nos. 122-7 at 60, 157 \u00b6 120). Lastly, evidence of record also indicates that Sussman, through activities such as frequent emails to Plaintiff and attempting to impose a District-wide survey to evaluate Plaintiff, interacted with Plaintiff in such a way that was not experienced by male superintendents. (Doc. Nos. 122-7 at 14-15, 37-38, 55, 122-8 at 42-43.) Accordingly, the Court concludes that Defendants have not met their burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact exists with regard to Plaintiff's sex discrimination claim.\n    <em>\n     See,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Jackson v.

Pa. 2014) ) (\"Similarity between comparators is generally a question of fact for a jury, but 'summary judgment is appropriate where there is no evidence from which a jury could conclude the parties were similarly situated.' \"). In light of such evidence, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has met her burden in establishing a\n    <em>\n     prima\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     facie\n    </em>\n    case of sex discrimination.\n    <footnotemark>\n     22\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    In addition, the Court rejects Defendants' argument that Plaintiff has failed to produce evidence that would permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Defendants' legitimate, non-discriminatory reason was a pretext for discrimination on the basis of sex. As an initial matter, Plaintiff's evidence offered in support of her\n    <em>\n     prima\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     facie\n    </em>\n    case may also be used at the pretext stage of the\n    <em>\n     McDonnell Douglas\n    </em>\n    analysis.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Farrell v.

As noted above, a plaintiff can demonstrate pretext by showing that the employer had subjected her to unlawful discriminatory treatment, or that the employer treated other, similarly situated persons outside of the protected class more favorably. In this case, Plaintiff's evidence satisfying the fourth element of the\n    <em>\n     prima\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     facie\n    </em>\n    case also satisfies her burden of showing pretext.\n    <footnotemark>\n     23\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    For the reasons explained\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the Court will deny Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Count XII of the third amended complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    <strong>\n     J. Plaintiff's Constructive Discharge Claim\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    The Court notes that, prior to this action being reassigned to the undersigned, the Court dismissed Plaintiff's constructive discharge claim, reasoning that the allegedly discriminatory remarks made by Rawls were made by \"only one member of the nine-member Board,\" and, thus, did \"not create the reasonable inference that the entire Board intended to discriminate on the basis of gender or race\" so as to warrant a constructive discharge claim. (Doc. No. 34 at 18.) At oral argument, Plaintiff noted that the Court dismissed Plaintiff's constructive discharge claim before discovery was complete, and that there is now ample evidence of record to support a constructive discharge claim. Now having the benefit of complete discovery, the Court recognizes the importance of reexamining the law of the case as it applies to Plaintiff's constructive discharge claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    The doctrine of the law of the case generally prohibits a court from allowing \"the same factual and legal issues to be raised again\" once already decided.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dasrath v. Cont'l Airlines, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776457\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/467/431/#p442\">\n     467 F.Supp.2d 431\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 442 (D.N.J. 2006). There are, however, certain instances in which\n    the doctrine does not apply so as to prevent reconsideration of an issue already decided, such as circumstances in which: \"(1) new evidence is available; (2) a supervening new law has been announced; or (3) the earlier decision was clearly erroneous and would create manifest injustice.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re City of Phila.

As mentioned above, the Court finds that, having had the benefit of the discovery process, and in light of Plaintiff's contention that she did not leave her employment with the District voluntarily, reconsideration of the previous dismissal of Plaintiff's constructive discharge claim may be warranted. However, the Court will not revisit this issue\n    <em>\n     sua\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     sponte\n    </em>\n    , but will entertain a properly-filed motion for leave to file an amended complaint including claims for constructive discharge and a hostile work environment.\n    <footnotemark>\n     24\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.
