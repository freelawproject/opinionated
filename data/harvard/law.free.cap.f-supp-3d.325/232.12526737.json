No. 07-318 (PG), Docket No. 1562. At trial, the government introduced three cooperating witnesses: Harry Smith Delgado (\"Delgado\"), Xiomara Berrios-Rojas (\"Xiomara\"), and Andy Marcano (\"Marcano\"). Delgado testified that he was a part of the conspiracy, and that Sandra Flores served as both a runner and a seller of cocaine, crack, and marijuana.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

No. 07-318 (PG), Dockets No. 1583, 1602. Central to the defendants' trial strategy was an attempt to impeach Delgado, Xiomara, and Marcano by suggesting that they had colluded to fabricate their testimonies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flores-Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228574\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1/#p10\">\n    787 F.3d at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, the jury found Sandra Flores guilty as to Counts One, Three, Four, Five and Six of the indictment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim. No. 07-318 (PG), Docket No. 1652.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At some unspecified time before trial, Delgado sent the lead prosecutor a handwritten letter, which was not promptly disclosed to defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flores-Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228574\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1/#p10\">\n    787 F.3d at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, two handwritten notes that Delgado kept, which contained details of his conversations with two other co-conspirators were not timely disclosed. The belated production of these materials set off a series of post-trial evidentiary hearings and motions presented by Sandra Flores and her codefendants, Carlos Omar Bermudez-Torres (\"Omar\") and Cruz Roberto Ramos-Gonzalez (\"Ramos\"). Between 2010 and 2013, the district court wrote four separate opinions denying the appellants' various requests for a new trial, which were grounded on these belated productions. These four opinions provide a detailed account of each of the hearings conducted by, and motions submitted to, the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Unlike her codefendants, Omar and Ramos, Sandra Flores did not renew on appeal her argument regarding the evidence that was produced belatedly. The First Circuit Court of Appeals found that these materials warranted that Omar and Ramos be tried again. As a result, the First Circuit remanded Omar and Ramos' cases to the district court, and affirmed the convictions and sentences of Sandra and Sonia Flores-Rivera.\n   <em>\n    Flores-Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228574\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1/#p10\">\n    787 F.3d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In Grounds One and Three, Petitioner alleges that the prosecution violated her right to Due Process when it failed to turn over Delgado's letter and notes, and she\n   contends that her appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to renew this claim on appeal. In Ground Four, Sandra Flores argues that her sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced because the court erred in determining that her prior conviction for simple possession of marijuana under P.R. LAWS ANN. tit. 24, \u00a7 2404 is a \"felony drug offense\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A). Therefore, Petitioner contends that the prior conviction information presented by the government pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20851\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   was unwarranted, and she should not have been subjected to the mandatory minimum sentence imposed under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A). Lastly, Petitioner argues in Grounds Two and Five that she received ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel abandoned her during the post-trial proceedings and her trial and appellate counsels failed to successfully challenge the application of a two-point enhancement on Petitioner's sentencing guidelines calculation under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1).

The videos presented to the jury show that Sandra Flores operated a drug point and corroborates Delgado, Xiomara, and Marcano's testimonies that Petitioner was a seller and runner of illicit drugs. For example, during the jury trial on October 19, 2009, Delgado was shown and questioned about a video displaying Sandra Flores \"tallying up\" drugs and money with her brother, Alex Flores-Rivera, before changing shifts as drug sellers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Ms. Avila, AUSA: What other way, if any, could the seller tally up to turn over the shift to the other seller?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Delgado: He could tally up with the other person that was going to continue selling.

In the present case, the belatedly produced evidence did not prejudice Petitioner because there was sufficient corroborating evidence implicating her in the criminal venture.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim. No. 07-318, Docket No. 1602 at 29, 37-41, 53. Unlike her codefendants, Ramos and Omar, Delgado's testimony was not the sole means for determining Petitioner's guilt. In her case, the videos shown to the jury illustrating that Petitioner worked as a drug runner and seller contravenes the argument that there is a reasonable probability that the results of the trial could have been different had the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   documents been turned over in a timely manner. Thus, because Sandra Flores cannot prove that the belatedly produced evidence prejudiced her, she fails the prejudice prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   tests. Accordingly, her motion to vacate is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   on those grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Sentencing Enhancement Challenge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In Ground Four, Sandra Flores argues that her sentence violates the Eighth Amendment and her right to Due Process because the information filed pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20851\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   was done for an improper\n   purpose and resulted in a sentence that is excessive and disproportionate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1 at 13. Specifically, Petitioner contends that her prior conviction for simple possession of marijuana under P.R. LAWS ANN. tit. 24, \u00a7 2404 does not qualify as a \"felony drug offense\" pursuant to \u00a7 851. Petitioner asks the court to waive her procedural default of these claims because both her trial and appellate counsels were ineffective by failing to argue that her prior conviction was not a qualifying felony. Her arguments hold no water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   First, the record contradicts Petitioner's assertion that her trial counsel failed to challenge the \u00a7 851 enhancement. On February 20, 2011, Petitioner's trial counsel filed the appropriate objection to the \u00a7 851 enhanced penalty, which was subsequently denied by the court on March 21, 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim. No. 07-318, Dockets No. 2597, 2617. Moreover, Petitioner's trial counsel once again objected to the imposition of the enhanced penalty during her sentencing hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim. No. 07-318, Docket No. 2683, at 7. As such, Sandra Flores' claim that her trial counsel abandoned her in regards to this issue is inaccurate and belied by the record of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Second, Petitioner's appellate counsel was under no obligation to present the aforementioned objection, as the objection itself lacked merit. Sandra Flores relies on the First Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The definition is coherent, complete, and by all signs exclusive.\"). Moreover, the statute under which Sandra Flores' previous conviction rests reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   It shall be unlawful for any person, knowingly or intentionally, to possess any controlled substance, unless such substance was obtained directly, or pursuant to a valid prescription or order from a practitioner, while acting in the course of his professional practice, or except as authorized by this chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Any person who violates this subsection shall be guilty of a felony, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by imprisonment for a fixed term of\n   <strong>\n    three (3) years\n   </strong>\n   . Should there be aggravating circumstances, the fixed penalty established may be increased to a maximum of\n   <strong>\n    five (5) years\n   </strong>\n   ; if there should be extenuating circumstances, it may be reduced to a minimum of\n   <strong>\n    two (2) years\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   P.R. LAWS ANN. tit. 24, \u00a7 2404(a) (emphasis added). The conduct prohibited by \u00a7 2404 squarely fits the definition of a \"felony drug offense\" under \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 802(44). First, said statute prohibits conduct relating to narcotic drugs, including marihuana. Second, the least culpable version of the offense is punishable by a period of imprisonment of more than one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As a result, Sandra Flores' prior conviction for simple possession of marihuana under \u00a7 2404 constitutes a \"felony drug offense\" for the purpose of applying the increased minimum sentence imposed in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Any argument that her appellate counsel could have presented stating otherwise would have been meritless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Acha v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530624\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/910/28/#p32\">\n    910 F.2d 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32 (1st Cir. 1990) (holding that trial counsel is \"under no obligation to raise meritless claims. Failure to do so does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel\"). Ultimately, Petitioner's argument that her sentence violates the Eighth Amendment and Due Process, and that her appellate counsel was ineffective for not challenging it, necessarily fails because the \u00a7 851 information was filed correctly by the government, and the \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) sentencing enhancement was properly applied. Due to Petitioner's failure to excuse the procedural default of her claim, and due to her argument's lack of merit, her petition is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   on those grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Additional Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Lastly, Petitioner's remaining two grounds consist of additional allegations that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. Sandra Flores first claims in Ground Two that her trial counsel abandoned her during the post-trial proceedings.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1 at 10. Specifically, Petitioner contends that although her trial counsel filed a motion to join the post-trial proceedings, she failed to participate in them.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em case-ids=\"10530624\" https:=\"\" index=\"77\" xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.L&lt;extracted-citation url=\">\n    ibr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\"&gt;id\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530624\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/910/28/#p32\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   But, the record shows otherwise. Contrary to Petitioner's assertions, the record demonstrates that Petitioner's counsel was present and actively participated in the evidentiary hearing for the motion for new trial.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim. No. 07-318, Docket No. 2354;\n   <em case-ids=\"10530624\" https:=\"\" index=\"78\" xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.L&lt;extracted-citation url=\">\n    ibr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\"&gt;id\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530624\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/910/28/#p32\">\n    .,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Docket No. 2364 at 114-118. As a result, the ineffective assistance of counsel claim on this ground is thus\n   <strong xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In her fifth and final ground, Sandra Flores contends that her trial and appellate attorneys provided ineffective assistance because they failed to effectively challenge a two point enhancement imposed on her guideline calculation under\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1 at 5. Although Petitioner recognizes that her trial counsel indeed challenged the enhancement, she insists that said challenge failed solely because her counsel did not adequately research the issue. In support of her argument, Petitioner alleges that her similarly situated codefendants did not receive the enhancement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails on this ground because the district court correctly applied the enhancement. The statute in question, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), provides that a defendant's base offense level is increased by two levels \"if a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed\" in the furtherance of a federal crime. Petitioner's codefendant, Sonia Flores-Rivera, challenged this very enhancement on appeal. The First Circuit held that the \"firearm enhancement applies 'whenever a codefendant's possession of a firearm in furtherance of their joint criminal venture [is] reasonably foreseeable' by the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Flores-Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228574\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1/#p10\">\n    787 F.3d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bianco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10545517\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/922/910/#p912\">\n    922 F.2d 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 912 (1st Cir. 1991) ). The First Circuit further established that \" 'because firearms are considered common tools of the drug trade,' where firearms are used in furtherance of drug offenses, the two-level 'enhancement should be applied if [a] weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.' \"\n   <em>\n    Flores-Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228574\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1/#p10\">\n    787 F.3d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Thongsophaporn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2922386\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/51/#p58\">\n    503 F.3d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58 (1st Cir. 2007) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court held then that the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement was warranted because it was not \"clearly improbable\" from Sonia Flores-Rivera's perspective that firearms would be used during and in furtherance of the drug trafficking conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flores-Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228574\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1/#p10\">\n    787 F.3d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Following the same logic, it was reasonably foreseeable for Sandra Flores that weapons would be used in furtherance of the drug trafficking conspiracy. The trial testimony showed that Sandra Flores, like Sonia Flores-Rivera, was a runner of cocaine, crack, and marijuana, and that she would stash those kinds of drugs for the drug trafficking organization. Additionally, Petitioner had contact with several other co-conspirators, including Delgado, who had a propensity for carrying and using firearms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Because Sandra Flores was similarly situated to her sister, Sonia Flores-Rivera, the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement was warranted and her trial counsel was not ineffective for not prospering. Any additional research performed by her counsel would have only supported the court's determination. Therefore, Petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim on this ground fails the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test, as she fails to prove that her counsel's actions caused her prejudice. Furthermore, Petitioner's counsel had no reason to further develop or insist on an argument that was meritless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Acha\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530624\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/910/28/#p32\">\n    910 F.2d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the present argument is unfounded, and her motion to vacate is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   on those grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Petitioner's request for habeas relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Docket No. 1).
