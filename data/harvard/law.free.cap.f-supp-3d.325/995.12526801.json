SCHREIER, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff, Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe, filed this action against defendants Richard L. Sattgast, Andy Gerlach, and Dennis Daugaard seeking a judicial declaration that, under federal law, the State of South Dakota does not have the authority to impose the State's excise tax in connection to services performed by non-Indian contractors in the Tribe's on-reservation construction project. Docket 1. Plaintiff and defendants move for summary judgment. Docket 31; Docket 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The undisputed facts\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   are:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe is a federally recognized Indian tribe. Docket 32 at 2; Docket 75 at 10. The Flandreau Indian Reservation is wholly located in Moody County, South Dakota. Docket 32 at 2. The Tribe owns and operates the Royal River Casino on the reservation. Docket 32 at 2; Docket 75 at 11. The State and the Tribe entered into a Tribal-State gaming compact under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) that took effect on September 14, 2016. Docket 72-14. IGRA regulates Class III gaming activities at the Royal River Casino. Docket 32 at 2; Docket 75 at 11-12. The compact does not contain provisions specifically relating to construction standards, construction activities, or the taxation of construction activities at the casino. Docket 32 at 2; Docket 75 at 13. Casino revenue comprises approximately forty percent of the Tribe's income. Docket 75 at 12-13. Federal funding accounts for approximately fifty-two percent of the Tribe's income.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. The Tribe also utilizes proceeds from the casino to help fund off-reservation projects in the local community including donations to the local school and fire department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Tribe first opened the casino in 1990 and relocated it to the present building in 1997. Docket 75 at 11. Casino gaming amenities used or consumed at the casino by gaming patrons include: hotel rooms, alcoholic drinks consumed on the gaming floor and at the bar, concert tickets, and food eaten at the restaurant, on the gaming floor, and at the snack bar. Docket 77 at 35. The Tribe decided to invest in a $24 million renovation and expansion of the casino. Docket 32 at 2. The project includes doubling the number of\n   slot machines, adding a VIP lounge, renovating the casino cage area, relocating the bar, and renovating the snack bar, restaurant, and hotel. Docket 75 at 14-15. The Tribe retained Leo A. Daly as the architectural firm and Henry Carlson Company as the general contractor. Docket 32 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under SDCL \u00a7 10-46A-1, a contractor's gross receipts are subject to a two percent excise tax. SDCL \u00a7 10-46A-1. The excise tax is deposited into the general fund. The general fund is used for a number of services, but for purposes of this case, the State points out that the general fund is used for professional licensing such as attorneys, electricians, plumbers, and notaries, and for the supervision of parolees. Certain construction projects within Indian country are exempt under federal law. Docket 32 at 3. The South Dakota Department of Revenue requires contractors to complete an \"Indian Country Project Request for Exemption\" form to receive an exemption from the tax.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The Department of Revenue denied requests by the Tribe and its construction manager for an exemption for the casino construction project. Docket 75 at 15-16. As a result, Henry Carlson has paid contractor's excise tax under protest consistent with SDCL \u00a7 10-27-2. Docket 32 at 4; Docket 75 at 16. Henry Carlson's protest letters requested that the state issue refunds to the Tribe as the entity who paid the cost of taxes. Docket 75 at 16. The Tribe seeks to have a judicial declaration that the State does not \"have the authority to impose the State's contractor's excise tax\" and seeks a refund of the \"contractor's excise tax paid, or to be paid, under protest.\" Docket 1. Currently, the Tribe estimates that the contractor's excise tax on the project will be approximately $480,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Summary judgment is proper \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Congress iterated in IGRA that the intention of IGRA was to utilize the proceeds of tribal gaming to encourage \"tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202702\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).

Docket 77 \u00b6 9. The Tribal government's finance department, legal department, and the Tribal Executive Committee are all funded with federal and tribal funds. Docket 77 \u00b6 13. The casino was built in 1997 and the casino floor has not been renovated since that time. Docket 77 \u00b6 149. In 2011, a new and larger casino was built in nearby Larchwood, Iowa, which is the casino's first major nearby competitor. Docket 77 \u00b6 125. Thus, to stay competitive and maintain the building, the Tribe must renovate the casino. Updating the interior of the building and adding additional slot machines is a necessary expense in order to compete with bigger, newer casinos in the area and to attract patrons. If the Tribe failed to update the casino and let it fall into disrepair, patrons would go elsewhere for gaming, and the Tribe would risk a casino closure if the Chairman of the NIGC determined that the Tribe failed to maintain the appropriate standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202713\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20559.3\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 559.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 4 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20559.6\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 559.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Colville\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court found that Washington's tax on cigarettes sold to non-Indians on the reservation was permissible because the tribal cigarette sellers were only in business to offer an exemption to off-reservation customers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182119\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/134/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182119\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/134/\">\n    at 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182119\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/134/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court stated that tribal interests are \"strongest when the revenues are derived from value generated on the reservation by activities involving the Tribes and when the taxpayer is the recipient of tribal services.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182119\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/134/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182119\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/134/\">\n    at 156-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182119\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/134/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the Court stated that it did \"not believe that principles of federal Indian law ... authorize Indian tribes [ ] to market an exemption from state taxation to persons who would normally do their business elsewhere.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182119\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/134/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182119\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/134/\">\n    at 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182119\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/134/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Washington's interest in taxing non-members who would otherwise purchase cigarettes off-reservation was stronger than the tribe's general interest in creating a tax exemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Yee\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Colville\n   </em>\n   , the Tribe has not engaged in any tax manipulation and the Tribe is the entity ultimately responsible for paying the tax, thus it is involved in the transaction being taxed. In\n   <em>\n    Yee\n   </em>\n   , the tribe set up a system whereby two non-Indian parties would avoid paying California sales tax by delivering the goods to the reservation. The court found that the tax was not pre-empted because tax manipulation was the reason the on-reservation delivery system was set up and the Tribe was not a party to the transaction. And in\n   <em>\n    Colville\n   </em>\n   , the Indian cigarette retail sellers were marketing a tax exemption to non-Indian cigarette buyers who would otherwise have been subject to the state tax. Here, the Tribe has not engaged in any tax manipulation\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Tribe is a\n   party to the transaction being taxed. Also, this case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Cotton\n   </em>\n   because the State does not provide substantial services to the Tribe or Henry Carlson Company. At oral argument the State argued that services such as licensing for attorneys, notaries, electricians, and plumbers, and the supervision of parolees were services that benefit the Tribe and Henry Carlson Company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The court finds that argument unpersuasive. The attorneys, electricians, plumbers, and notaries involved in the renovation project maintain licenses in South Dakota for their own general purposes and did not become licensed specifically for this project. Further, the State supervises parolees as a service to all citizens in South Dakota and there is not any evidence in the record that there is a parolee currently working for Henry Carlson Company on the casino renovation project. All of the services identified by the State are services provided to the general population of the State of South Dakota and not specific to this project. There is no evidence that the State incurred additional costs specifically related to this project. In fact, the evidence indicates that the costs of inspection and supervision of the project are born by the Tribe. Thus, the court finds that the State's tax infringes on the Tribe's ability to govern itself because there is not a nexus between State services and the excise tax and the Tribe has not engaged in manipulation of tax policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In conclusion, the court finds that both barriers to the State's exercise of authority are present here. The excise tax is pre-empted by federal law by IGRA. Also, the State's interests in imposing the excise tax do not outweigh the tribal and federal interests in promoting self-sufficiency because there is not a nexus between any services the State provides to the Tribe or the contractor and the imposition of the excise tax. Either barrier, on its own, is sufficient to find that state authority inapplicable.\n   <em>\n    Bracker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787603\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/136/#p144\">\n    448 U.S. at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787603\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/136/#p144\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the court finds that the State's excise tax is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Because the court finds in favor of the Tribe under both prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Bracker\n   </em>\n   analysis, it does not reach the other theory raised by the Tribe-namely whether the Indian Trader Statutes pre-empt the State's ability to impose the contractor's excise tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Refund\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The State argues that this court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Tribe's claim for a refund of the tax paid in protest because the Eleventh Amendment only permits tribes to obtain prospective relief from state officials. Docket 32 at 6. The State acknowledges, however, that a suit for monetary damages against the State may proceed where the suit is \"brought by the United States on behalf of [the Tribe.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Given the State's assertion of sovereign immunity, \"the Tribe concedes that the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the relief sought in the Tribe's fourth claim.\" Docket 81 at 44. Thus, the Tribe's fourth claim for relief is dismissed, without prejudice, for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In conclusion, IGRA pre-empts the State's excise tax because IGRA comprehensively and pervasively regulates Indian gaming, and alternatively, because there would not be a renovation project without the casino and the casino needs the renovation project to operate. Also, the federal and tribal interest in promoting tribal self-sufficiency\n   through Indian gaming outweigh the State's interest in raising revenue for the general fund. And the Tribe's claim for a refund of the tax is dismissed due to lack of jurisdiction.
