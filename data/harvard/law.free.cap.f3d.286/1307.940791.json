Appellant was behind the wheel. As Johnson got into the cab, witnesses saw a dye pack explode, recorded the cab\u2019s license number, and called the police. The police identified appellant as the cab driver, and notified the FBI. Soon thereafter, FBI agents located appellant at his home, arrested him, and, in a search incident to the arrest, found $450 hidden in one of his shoes. He told the agents that Johnson had given him $500 of the robbery proceeds \u2014 the $450 hidden in his shoe plus $50 he had spent to rid his cab of the dye stains.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-21\">On April 3, 2001, following the return of a four-count superseding indictment, appellant pled guilty to Count Four which charged him with receiving bank robbery proceeds in the sum of \u201capproximately $500,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court accepted his plea after advising him that because the proceeds of the bank robbery exceeded the sum of $1000, specifically $3060, he was pleading guilty to a felony and, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b), faced a maximum prison sentence of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-22\">On June 22, appellant appeared before the court for sentencing. He objected to being sentenced as a felon on two grounds. First, he had pled guilty to a misdemean- or, not a felony, because Count Four alleged that he had \u201creceived\u201d less than $1000 of the robbery proceeds. (In other words, the fact that Johnson had \u201ctaken\u201d well over $1000 from the bank was imma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>terial.) Second, in derogation of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Count Four failed to allege, as an element of his offense, that he could be sentenced up to the maximum penalty provided by \u00a7 2113(b), ten years\u2019 imprisonment. The district court overruled the objection and sentenced appellant to a prison term of twelve months, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. Appellant now appeals his sentence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-4\">Section 2113(b) states, in relevant part: Whoever takes and carries away, with intent to steal ... any ... money ... exceeding $1,000 ... in the ... possession of any bank ... shall be fined ... or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-5\">Section 2113(c) states, in relevant part: Whoever receives ... any ... money ... which has been taken or stolen from a bank.... in violation of [\u00a7 ] 2113(b), knowing the same to [have been stolen] shall be subject to the punishment provided in [\u00a7 2113(b) ] for the taker.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1336-6\">In <em>Campbell v. United States, </em>420 F.2d 963 (5th Cir.1970), our predecessor circuit rejected the argument appellant presented to the district court and raises here: that his sentence should be driven by the amount of the robbery proceeds he actually received rather than the amount stolen from the bank.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court held that a person convicted under \u00a7 2113(c) for possession of money stolen from a bank faces the same penalty as the person who stole the money.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Other circuits have reached the same conclusion. For example, in interpreting \u00a7 2113(c), the Ninth Circuit stated that \u201cthe proscriptions of the statute are quite clear. Congress intended to punish knowing receivers of stolen bank property. The punishment meted out to the recipient is governed by the amount stolen by the taker.\u201d <em>United States v. Bolin, </em>423 F.2d 834, 835 (9th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>398 U.S. 954, 90 S.Ct. 1882, 26 L.Ed.2d 297 (1970).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Accord United States v. Wright, </em>540 F.2d 1247, 1247-48 (4th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1046, 97 S.Ct. 752, 50 L.Ed.2d 760 (1977). <em>But see United States v. Evans, </em>446 F.2d 998 (8th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 1021, 92 S.Ct. 695, 30 L.Ed.2d 670 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-10\">In light of our holding that appellant\u2019s plea subjected him to the same maximum statutory penalty \u2014 a prison sentence of ten years \u2014 as Johnson, the \u201ctaker,\u201d faced, Apprendi\u2019s holding is simply not implicated; that is, unlike the defendant in <em>Ap-prendi, </em>appellant neither received nor faced an enhanced penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1335-16\">.
