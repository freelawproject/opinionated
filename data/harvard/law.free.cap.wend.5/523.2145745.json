The plaintiffs sued Stanley in a justice\u2019s court for overflowing their lands by means of a dam of a cotton factory belonging to him. The defendant had a verdict before the justice. The plaintiffs appealed to the Orange C. P.; on the trial in which court the following facts appeared: The plaintiffs are the owners of a grist-mill on a stream in the town of Blooming-grove, and the defendant is the owner of a cotton factory situate below the grist-mill of the plaintiffs; the dam of the factory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>causes the water to flow back beyond the line of the premises belonging to the defendant, and the milling establishment of the plaintiffs, a few rods above the line, would be much more valuable if the factory dam were removed, by enabling them to increase the diameter of their wheel. Both parties claim under the same source of title. In February, 1813, one John Caldwell mortgaged the whole premises to W. Denning; in December, 1813, Caldwell, for (he consideration of f 1250, by warantee deed, conveyed the premises, now in possession of the defendant, to one Hatch, under whom the defendant holds; in May, 1815, Denning executed a quit claim to Caldwell of the premises conveyed to Hatch, including the ground whereon the factory dam stands, which was erected in October, 1813, of (he same height that it now is; was then and is now used to drive the factory, and flowed the water up to the wheel of the grist-mill, and beyond the mill in the bed of the stream. The main value of the defendant\u2019s premises consists in the water privilege, and the dam cannot bo lowered without destroying the same. The \"mortgage from Caldwell to Denning was foreclosed in chancery, and the premises mortgaged sold in 1823 for the consideration of <em>$9000 </em>to the plaintiffs, to whom the same were conveyed, <em>excepting </em>however by metes and bounds, the premises conveyed to Hatch and released to Caldwell. The court charged the jury that by intendment of law, Denning knew at the time of'his release to Caldwell, that the dam of the factory flowed the water back beyond the line of (he released premises, that the plaintiffs were estopped thereby, and that the defendant was entitled to a verdict; which was accordingly rendered.

What then would have been the effect of the convej'ance to Hatch as between him and Caldwell his grantor, if the. residue of the premises had been retained by him instead of having been mortgaged to Denning <em>1 </em>The evidence shews that the principal value of the defendant\u2019s premises consists in the waler privilege, and that it will be entirely destroyed if the dam is lowered. The dam, .as it now exists, was erected in October, 1813, prior to the conveyance to Hatch. It was admitted that it caused the water to flow back beyond the defendant\u2019s line upon the premises of the plaintiffs.; and it appears that, although the back water thus produced does not impede the operation of the plaintiffs\u2019 mill, yet the establishment would be much more valuable if the defendant\u2019s dam was removed, as they would .then be able to increase the diameter of their wheel. Upon this state of facts, it appears tome there can be no question that Hatch acquired an absolute right to maintain the dam at the height at which it was when he purchased from Caldwell, and that he or his grantees are not responsible to Caldwell or those who hold under him for any injury which the adjoining premises may receive from an overflow of water produced by the dam. Caldwell intended to sell and Hatch intended to purchase a valuable water privilege, for which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>large consideration was paid. The right to overflow the adj0jnjng premises of the grantor to the extent necessary to the profitable enjoyment of the privilege purchased, and in the manner in which it existed and had been used previous to the grant, passed to the grantee as necessarily appurtenant to the premises conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">There was no error, therefore, in the charge of the court below, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
