Canfield sued Millard in an action of <em>trover </em>for $40 in bank bills. The facts were these: Canfield was arrested by a constable on three warrants issued by a justice in civil suits commenced against him ; Millard became bail <em>to the constable </em>that Canfield would appear before the justice on a certain day, and stand trial in the three suits; and to indemnify Millard for thus becoming bail, Canfield put into his hands $40, to be returned to him if he complied with the engagement entered into by Millard. After two of the suits were tried, Canfield demanded the money of Millard, who refused to deliver it up, and a second de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>mand was made after the third suit was tried. After the triaj ^\u00a1{\u00a1arj went with a plaintiff in one of the suits to the store \u00b0f such plaintiff, and there took from his pocket a wallet containing the money received by him of Canfield, and laid the same on the counter; where it was levied upon by the constable who had served the warrants, by virtue of an execution. The evidence furnished strong presumption of connivance between the creditor and Millard, though the constable denied connivance. The court charged the jury that the contract between Canfield and Millard was void, and that Canfield had a right to the money at any time when demanded, even though such demand had been made prior to the time when Canfield had agreed to appear before the justice ; and even if Millard had a special interest in the monejr, such money could not be levied on by virtue of an execution against Canfield. The jury found for the plaintiff; on which verdict judgment was entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A1b\"><em>J Jl.

It is (lie officev\u2019s duly to take the defendant forthwith before the justice. He has no right to take security ; and such security, if taken, is void. The law looks with jealousy upon officers taking securities in their official character, when not warranted by law. <em>7 Johns. E. </em>426. 8 <em>id. </em>100. The undertaking of Millard to the constable being void, there was no consideration for the deposit of <em>$40. </em>Canfield was entitled to it at any moment, and the defendant Millard ought to have returned it to him when demanded <em>; </em>his refusal to do so was a conversion. Whether the money could be levied on is a question not necessary to be decided in this case. There is strong reason to believe there was connivance between the creditor and Millard, though the constable denies it; but whether <em>soar </em>not is immaterial: there was a conversion of the money, and the plaintiff below rightfully recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
