Eseic Cowen, one of the circuit judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AF5\">The defendant was in possession of about twenty-one acres of land, part of a lot designated as <em>lot F.- </em>6, which it was alleged <em>had never been granted by </em>the state to any person whatever. To shew that it had been granted, and that the title of the state was divested, the defendant produced <em>letters patent </em>of two tracts of land ; the first of a tract called Road Patent No. <em>2, </em>granted to John Thurman, bearing date the 8th May, 1795, in which the premises granted were described as beginning at the <em>eastermost corner oj township No. 24 </em>of Totten and Crossfield\u2019s purchase, and running thence along the same north 31 degrees and 15 minutes west 330 chains; thence north 40 degrees east 105 chains and 50 links; thence south 50 degrees east 153 chains to <em>Scaroon Lake, </em>then <em>across the same </em>south 6 degrees and 45 minutes east <em>240 </em>chains; thence south 58 degrees and 45 minutes west 50 chains to the place of beginning, containing 3500 acres: and the second of a tract called the <em>Hoffman township, </em>granted on the 15th May, 1795, described as beginning at a large clump of rocks on the west bank of the <em>Scaroon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>Lake, at the northeast corner of a tract of </em>3500 <em>acres of land granted to John Thurman, </em>running thence north 50 degees west 153 chains; thence south 40 degrees west 105 chains 50 links to the northeast bounds of township No. <em>24 </em>in Totten and Crossfield\u2019s purchase, &amp;c. The defendant proved, by a witness of the name of Charles Leggett, that about 30 years before the trial; a surveyor of the name of <em>Moxom </em>surveyed <em>Road Patent No. 2, </em>and according to his survey <em>lot F. </em>6 was included within the bounds of that patent, and there was no gore left between that tract and the Hoffman township; he did not know where Moxom commenced his survey. This witness further testified, that <em>according to a survey of </em>Road Patent No. <em>2, </em>made by George Webster in 1808, (by the direction of the surveyor general,) the <em>northeast comer </em>of that tract is 200 rods westerly of the clump of rocks which he supposed to be the commencement of the Hoffman township; the quantity of acres in the tract falls short nearly one half of that mentioned in the grant; the third line is too short by nearly one half; the fourth line crosses the first line above the place of beginning; and the south line is lost: and according to Webster\u2019s survey, <em>lot F. </em>6 is not included in the Road Patent. On his cross-examination, he stated that he himself is a surveyor and <em>knows the southeast corner </em>of township No. 24 in Totten and Cross-field\u2019s purchase. It is designated, as he testified, as a stake and stones, and is in a large swamp, running from that corner 330 chains, according to the course given in Road Patent No. 2, <em>lot F\u201e </em>6 is not reached nor included in the patent. Daniel Leggett, a witness for the plaintiff, testified that he also is a surveyor, and <em>knows </em>the southeast corner of No. 24 in Totten and Crossfield\u2019s purchase. It is in a swamp or marshy land. A few years ago he ran the first and second lines of Road Patent No. 2; he traced the east line of township No. 24, 330 chains, and did not reach <em>lot F. </em>6, and testified that the line as run by Webster was correct, making allowances for the inequalities of the ground; he fell short of Webster\u2019s corner about 7 chains; he also found Webster\u2019s second line correct. Another witness testified that many years ago <em>Road Patent No. 2, </em>was supposed to join the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Hoffman township. According to the location of Road Patent No. <em>2, </em>contended for by the defendant, the southwest corner of that patent would be nearly a mile north of the easternmost. corner of township No. <em>24 </em>of Totten and Crossfield\u2019s purchase, given as the place of beginning of the tract. A verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-7\"><em>Greene C. Bronson, </em>(attorney general,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtE\">Unless a grant covering the premises in question has been shewn, the verdict must stand. The defendant produced two grants, one called <em>Road Patent No. 2, </em>the other the Hoffman township. There can be no pretence that the premises are included in the latter grant; nor are they included in the former. The <em>place of beginning </em>of Road Patent No. <em>2, </em>though designated only as a stake and stones, was proved to be well known, and must govern in the location of the premises granted. 17 <em>Johns. </em>R. 146. In the two first courses there is nothing specified by which it could be controlled. The distance in the third course is controlled by the natural boundary of the lake, but there is no necessity of resorting to this boundary to fix the <em>location of the </em>premises granted, the place of beginning being definite and certain. The fact that the tract does not contain the quantity of acres specified in the grant can have no influence in the decision of the question in this case. 1 <em>Cowen, </em>616. 5 <em>id. </em>346, 373. 7 <em>id. </em>723.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-8\"><em>D. Russell, </em>for defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGL\">insisted that as the <em>northeast corner </em>of the Road patent tract was a fixed, permanent and notorious natural boundary, it should control in the location of the premises granted, in preference to the place of beginning, which is described as a stake and stones, than which nothing can be more uncertain ; that in addition to the greater certainty thus attained as to the premises intended to be granted, the whole quantity of land mentioned in the grant would pass, whereas according to the principle contended for on the other side, nearly one half of it is lost, the lines of the tract are shortened, and one whole course is rejected. That the intent of the land-office as to the premises meant to be granted in Road Patent No. <em>2, </em>is manifest by reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the grant of the Hoffman township which bears date but a few days posterior to the other grant, and which in its two first courses and distances precisely corresponds with it. That in the location of premises a fixed natural boundary will control courses and distances, and every other description resorted to, he cited 1 <em>Phil. Ev. </em>21; 9 <em>Cowen, </em>86.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\n<em>By the Court,</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"Agq\">Sutherland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtL\">The question in this case is as to the true location of Road Patent No. 2, in the county of Warren, granted to John Thurman on the 8th day of May, 1795. If the premises in question are not covered by that patent, the plaintiffs must have judgment, as there is no evidence in the case that they belong to, or are embraced in. any other. If the lot in question is in this patent to Thurman, it is embraced in the angle made by the two first courses specified in the grant, according to the testimony of all the witnesses, starting from what they understand to be the easternmost corner of township No. 24, in Totten and Cross-field\u2019s purchase, and running along the east line of that township the course and distance prescribed in the patent to Thurman, the premises in question will not be reached. The second course may also be run the prescribed distance without touching these premises or interfering with any other grant. The first difficulty in the location occurs in the third course. That line is described as running 153 chains <em>to Scaroon lake; </em>but according to Webster\u2019s survey, the lake is reached in about half the distance, and being a fixed and permanent object, must control the distance. The fourth course may be run, but it closes the patent, terminating at the place of beginning; and the south line of the patent being 50 chains, is lost. According to this survey, the patent falls short nearly one half. To avoid this result the defendant contends, that instead of commencing at the southwest comer of the patent, the true place of beginning is the northeast corner, which he identifies as being a <em>clump of rocks on the west bank of the Scaroon lake, </em>by the introduction of a patent for the Hoffman township, granted seven days after the patent to Thurman, which describes the Hoffman township as beginning at a large clump of rocks and at the northeast corner of a tract of 3500 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>acres granted to John Thurman. According to Webster\u2019s survey, the northeast corner of the patent is 200 rods <em>westerly </em>of the clump of rocks. Taking the clump of rocks as the place of beginning, a location of Thurman\u2019s patent may undoubtedly be made, which will embrace the premises in question. But the objections to it appear to me insuperable. It was assumed by the counsel for the defendant, that the place of beginning mentioned in Thurman\u2019s patent was uncertain ; and upon that assumption he contended that it must yield to the fixed and natural monument by which the northeast corner was designated. There might be force in the argument, if the assumption was well founded. But I understand all the witnesses, who testify upon this subject, to speak of the easternmost corner of township No. 24 of Tot-ten and Crossfield\u2019s purchase, which is the place of beginning of this patent, as certain and well known.</p>\n<p id=\"AGx\">The defendant\u2019s own witness, <em>Charles Leggett, </em>says that he is a surveyor, and knows the southeast corner of township No. 24 in Totten and Crossfield\u2019s purchase. <em>It is designated as a stake and stones; it is in a large swamp; </em>and to get the east line of this patent you must take ah offset, as you cannot run through the swamp. Starting <em>from that corner, </em>and running on the east boundary line of township No. 24, 330 chains, and you will not reach lot F. 6, the premises in question. <em>Daniel Leggett, </em>also a surveyor, a witness for the plaintiff, says <em>he knows the southeast corner of township </em>JVb. 24, in Totten and Crossfield\u2019s purchase. <em>It is in a swamp or marshy land; </em>and he corroborates the testimony of the preceding witness as to the manner of running the first course in this patent, and that it will not reach the premises. Both these witnesses speak positively, and without any qualification, as to their knowledge of this corner; they speak of it also as a place well known, and as designated by a stake and stones.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajo\">Here is no uncertainty as to the place of beginning. It is just as certain upon this evidence as though it were a natural monument; and where there is a known and well ascertained place of beginning, it must govern in the location of a grant or patent. It is immaterial how many natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>monuments there may be in the courses given, the place of beginning is a controlling point, and if rendered certain no matter in what manner, it cannot be abandoned, and another position assumed as the starting point. Jackson, <em>ex </em>dem, <em>Craigie, </em>v. Wilkinson, 17 <em>Johns. R. </em>146.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\">The principle is undoubtedly well settled, that in the location of a grant, that which is most certain and material in the description shall control that which is less so. Thus, a natural, permanent, or well known monument, as a river, a spring, a clearing, a marked tree, or any other well ascertained object, will control courses and distance and quantity, when they come in conflict. 1 <em>Cowen, </em>612. 5 <em>id. </em>346. 7 <em>id. </em>723. 6 Wheaton, 582. 7 <em>id. </em>10. But where, as in this case, the place of beginning can be ascertained, and the two first courses can be run according to the description, it is no reason for deranging the whole patent, that in one or more of the subsequent lines the courses and distances cannot be made to conform to the given monument. You must run according to the courses and distances as far as you can, and the courses and distances which are affected by the permanent object must yield to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">It is to be remarked, however, that the monument which the defendant contends is to control the location of this patent, is not given or recognized by the <em>patent </em>itself. It is the place at which the Hoffman township begins, and is incidentally mentioned in that grant as the northeast corner of Thurman\u2019s patent. A case may be presented, in which this recognition would bind the state; but it can have no effect upon this cause, unless it will authorise an abandonment of the well known place of beginning given in the patent itself, and the two courses which alone affect the lot in question ; and in the location and running of which, according to the terms of the patent, no difficulty exists. I know no legal principle upon which this can be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\"><em>Moxom\u2019s survey </em>is not proved so as to entitle it to any weight. Leggett, the witness who speaks of it, does not pretend that he is acquainted with the lines, or ever traced them; and he states in express terms, that he does not know where Moxom began. Ignorant of his place of be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ginning, and of his courses and distances, when he says, that by his surrey, there was no gore between Road Patent No. <em>2 </em>and Hoffman\u2019s township, he must intend to be understood as expressing merely a general and vague belief or impression, without any accurate knowledge upon the subject. A survey cannot be proved in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">It it is conceded, also, that according to the location for which the defendant contends, assuming the clump of rocks as the place of beginning, the west line of the patent, instead of running down to the southeast comer of township No. <em>24 </em>of Totton and Crossfield\u2019s purchase, will terminate nearly a mile north of that <em>point; </em>so that the effect of this location would be <em>to </em>shove the whole patent one mile north of the well known and established place of beginning pointed out by the patent itself. On the whole case, therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment according to the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
