Holmes claims that VIT violated the LHWCA by failing to pay his disability claims derived from an alleged work-related psychological injury. An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) heard Holmes\u2019 claim and concluded that his disability claims were not compensable under the LHWCA. Holmes then appealed that decision to the Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d), which affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision pursuant to Public Law 106-554. After the BRB denied his motion for reconsideration, Holmes filed this petition for review. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to decide the substantive merit of Holmes\u2019 claim and therefore dismiss his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-17\">VIT employed Holmes as a \u201cheader,\u201d the leader of a gang of three workers responsible for loading and unloading cargo. Bruce Sanders was Holmes\u2019 immediate supervisor. Holmes claims that Sanders started harassing him in 1996 by: (1) opposing Holmes\u2019 promotion to header; (2) refusing to grant Holmes\u2019 gang \u201cdesirable overtime assignments\u201d; and (3) falsely accusing Holmes\u2019 gang of damaging freight. Holmes reported Sanders\u2019 behavior to Greg Kubu, Sanders\u2019 immediate supervisor, but Kubu did not take any action.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Holmes claims that, on Friday, February 6, 1998, Sanders falsely accused him and his crew of not doing any work that day. Later the same day, Sanders accused Holmes of sleeping on the job. Despite Holmes\u2019 protestations that he was not sleeping on the job, Sanders reported him to Kubu. Kubu discussed the Holmes matter with Kevin Howard, the union business agent and president, who scheduled a meeting for the following Monday, February 9, 1998, to discuss Sanders\u2019 allegations with Holmes, Sanders, and company management. Holmes testified that he then became the \u201cbutt of jokes and harassment\u201d from his co-workers, who allegedly teased him about \u201csleeping on the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">On Monday morning, Holmes learned that his meeting with Howard and company management had been rescheduled for later that evening because Howard had work to do. At the end of the afternoon, Holmes learned that the evening meeting was also rescheduled. Holmes testified that after VIT cancelled the evening meeting, he began to suffer anxiety because he was concerned about why VIT was \u201cstalling and refusing to meet with him.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12). Holmes\u2019 physician, Dr. Sutton, examined Holmes that evening and diagnosed him with depression and anxiety disorder, ordered him to stay home from work, and referred him to a mental health specialist. Dr. Leonard Holmes, a psychologist, and Dr. Lewis Taylor, VIT\u2019s physician, both confirmed that Holmes was suffering from job-related stress and depression. Both Dr. Holmes and Dr. Taylor recommended that Holmes not work in his current job setting. Holmes remained out of work until September 28, 1998, at which time he returned to VIT and accepted an offer of a lower paying position at another job site.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">More than a year and a half later, on August 4, 1999, Holmes finally met with company management to discuss the February 6, 1998 incident. According to Holmes, this meeting did not resolve any of the issues surrounding Sanders\u2019 allegations. It was during this meeting that Holmes learned that he was being replaced as gang header. Shortly thereafter, he filed a claim under the LHWCA, alleging that he had incurred a work-related psychological injury, and that as a result, VIT was required to pay temporary total disability from February 9, 1998, to September 28, 1998, and permanent partial disability from September 29, 1998, to the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">In August 1999, Administrate Law Judge Richard Malamphy heard Holmes\u2019 claims. The ALJ issued a decision on February 3, 2000, denying Holmes\u2019 request for benefits. In his decision; the ALJ concluded that Holmes was not entitled to benefits because VIT\u2019s response to Sanders\u2019 \u201csleeping on the job accusation\u201d was a legitimate personnel action. The ALJ further determined that \u201cthe temporal relationship between Holmes\u2019 illness and the events of February 6 and 9,1998[,] indicate that it was the legitimate personnel action that resulted in Holmes\u2019 disability.\u201d Specifically, the ALJ noted that <em>\u201conly </em>after the events of February 9,1998, which have already been established as a legitimate personnel action, did Holmes seek any kind of psychological treatment.\u201d Thus, the ALJ concluded that Holmes was not entitled to benefits because his injury \u201cwas wholly a result of a legitimate personnel action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">On March 7, 2000, Holmes appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the BRB. Because the BRB failed to issue a decision by the one-year anniversary of Holmes\u2019 appeal to the BRB, the ALJ\u2019s decision was deemed affirmed by operation of law on March 7, 2001.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, on March 16, 2001, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>BRB issued a decision reversing and remanding the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">On April 4, 2001, the BRB issued an order withdrawing its March 16, 2001 decision. In the April 2001 order, the BRB noted that it had failed to issue an opinion within the one-year time limitation imposed by law, and thus, the ALJ\u2019s decision was deemed affirmed by operation of law on March 7, 2001. Holmes then filed a motion for reconsideration on April 9, 2001,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which the BRB denied on May 7, 2001. The BRB explained that \u201c[i]nasmuch as the administrative law judge\u2019s decision was affirmed by operation of law on March 7, 2001, the Board is without authority to review the [ALJ\u2019s] findings of fact and conclusions of law by way of a motion for reconsideration.\u201d On June 8, 2001, Holmes filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Before we can reach the merits of Holmes\u2019 claim, this Court must first determine whether it has jurisdiction to decide the issue presented. <em>See Betty B Coal Co. v. DOWCP, </em>194 F.3d 491, 495 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201c[W]e have a special obligation to satisfy ourselves, before deciding anything substantive, that we do have jurisdiction.\u201d). To this point, VIT argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction because Holmes did not timely file his petition with this Court. For the reasons that follow, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">20 C.F.R. section 802.406 governs the time period in which a petitioner may petition this Court for a review of a BRB decision. Under \u00a7 802.406, \u201c[a] decision rendered by the Board pursuant to this subpart shall become final 60 days after the issuance of such a decision____\u201d A motion for reconsideration timely filed, however, tolls the deadline for filing a petition for review. Thus,\u201d[i]f a timely request for reconsideration has been filed, the 60-day period for filing such petition for review will run from the issuance of the Board\u2019s decision on reconsideration.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.406. Motions for reconsideration must be filed with the BRB within 30 days from the filing of the BRB\u2019s initial decision. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.407 (\u201cAny party-in-interest may, within 30 days from the filing of a decision ... request reconsideration of such decision by those members who rendered the decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">In this case, the BRB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision by operation of law on March 7, 2001, the one-year anniversary of Holmes\u2019 appeal to the BRB. Public Law 106-554 requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-13\">[A]ny such decisions pending a review by the Benefits Review Board for more than 1 year shall be considered affirmed by the Benefits Review Board on the 1-year anniversary of the filing of the appeal, and shall be considered the <em>final </em>order of the Board for purposes of obtaining a review in the United States courts of appeal[ ] <em>sic. ...</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">LHWCA, Pub.L. No. 106-554, \u00a7 1(a)(1), \u2022114 Stat. 2763, 2763A-10 (2000) (emphasis added). Applying the plain language of Public Law 106-554 to the facts in this case requires this Court to conclude that the BRB\u2019s March 16, 2001 written opinion is void because the BRB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision by <em>final </em>order on March 7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>2001, the one-year anniversary of Holmes\u2019 appeal to the BRB.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, under \u00a7 802.406, March 7, 2001, is the date from which the statute of limitation should begin to run for any petition for review filed with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Holmes had 60 days from March 7, 2001, or until May 6, 2001, to petition this Court for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.406. However, Holmes did not file his petition for review with this Court until June 8, 2001. Thus, his petition for review was not timely, and this Court does not have jurisdiction to decide the substantive merit of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Holmes attempts to dissuade this Court from finding his petition untimely by arguing that his April 9, 2001 motion for reconsideration tolled the time for filing a petition for review with this Court. He contends that under \u00a7 802.406, the time in which to file an appeal with this Court should run from May 7, 2001, the date the BRB denied his motion for reconsideration. To bolster his argument, Holmes relies on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling in <em>Ramey v. Stevedoring Services of America, </em>134 F.3d 954 (9th Cir.1998). In that decision, the Ninth Circuit held that a petitioner may file a motion for reconsideration of BRB decisions rendered under Public Law 106-554. <em>Id. </em>at 959 (holding that \u201c[n]othing in Public Law 104-134 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ... purports to deprive parties of ... [filing] motions for reconsideration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">In Ramey, however, the petitioners had filed <em>timely </em>motions for reconsideration. Here, Holmes\u2019 motion for reconsideration was filed on April 9, 2001, more than 30 days after the BRB\u2019s March 7, 2001 final order. Holmes\u2019 motion for reconsideration, therefore, was untimely and did not toll the running of the statute of limitation for filing his petition for review with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">Because Holmes filed his petition for review more than 60 days after the BRB\u2019s March 7, 2001 decision, this Court lacks jurisdiction to decide the substantive merits of Holmes\u2019 petition. Accordingly, the petition is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-7\">. Public Law 106-554, \u00a7 l(a)(l)[Title 1] provides, in relevant part, \u2018\u2018[t]hat any such deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>sion pending review by the Benefits Review Board for more than 1-year shall be considered affirmed by the Benefits Review Board on the 1 year anniversary of the appeal, and shall be considered the final order of the Board for purposes of obtaining a review in the United States courts of appeals</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-15\">. It was unclear from the record whether Holmes filed his motion for reconsideration on April 6, 2001, or April 9, 2001. However, at oral argument Holmes\u2019 counsel confirmed that the motion for reconsideration was filed on April 9, 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\">. Holmes argues that, pursuant to \u00a7 802.407, the BRB's March 16, 2001 written decision on the merits of Holmes\u2019 appeal may be considered a \"de facto\u201d or \"sua sponte\u201d reconsideration of its affirmance of the ALJ\u2019s decision under Public Law 106-554. We find this argument unpersuasive. At the time the BRB issued its March 16, 2001 decision, it was unaware that it had affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision by operation of law on March 7, 2001. This is evident not only from the BRB\u2019s April 4, 2001 order, vacating its March 16 decision, but also from its May 7, 2001 order, which denied Holmes\u2019 motion for reconsideration, believing that it was \"without authority to review the administrative law judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law by way of a motion for reconsideration.\u201d Regardless of whether \u00a7 802.407 would permit the BRB to reconsider its own decision under these circumstances, it is clear from the facts of this case that the BRB\u2019s March 16, 2001 opinion was not a reconsideration of the March 7, 2001 final order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b529-16\">.
