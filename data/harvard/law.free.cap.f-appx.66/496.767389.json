We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-20\">Knipp\u2019s counsel filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In the <em>Anders </em>brief, Knipp\u2019s counsel briefed two issues, both of which counsel ultimately concluded were not meritorious: (1) whether the district court erred in accepting Knipp\u2019s guilty plea without specifically advising Knipp of its obligation to apply the sentencing guidelines and its discretion to depart therefrom; and (2) whether the factual basis for the guilty plea demonstrated a showing of continuity necessary to establish a business enterprise under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(a)(3). Knipp was informed of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief and failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-21\">We review violations of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 for plain error where, as in this case, the Defendant did not move in district court to withdraw her guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524-27 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 899, 123 U.S. 200, 154 L.Ed.2d 169 (2002). Under this standard, we exercise our discretion only to correct errors that are plain, material, or affecting substantial rights, and that seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 524 (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). We have reviewed the record and find no error in the district court\u2019s explanation of its obligation to sentence Knipp under the sentencing guidelines. Further, Knipp\u2019s responses during the Rule 11 colloquy constituted an admission that she performed an act that promoted or facilitated a drug conspiracy involving a continuing course of conduct, providing an adequate factual basis for her plea. <em>See United States v. Rawle, </em>845 F.2d 1244, 1248-49 (4th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Knipp\u2019s conviction and sentence. We require that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
