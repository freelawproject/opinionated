An appeal may not be taken to this court from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-25\">A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court on the merits absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). As to claims dismissed by a district court solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-26\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Jones has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>satisfied either standard.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal. We deny Jones\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel, for expansion of the record, for judicial notice, and for an evidentiary hearing. Finally, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b548-18\"> Jones attempts to raise an issue in his informal brief that was not before the district court and that we decline to address. <em>See Muth v. United. States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993) (noting that issues raised for the first time on appeal generally will not be considered).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
