We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Wimberley v. Rogers, </em>No. CA-02-890-5-BO (E.D.N.C. Sept. 11, 2002). Wimberley\u2019s motions to deny the Defendants\u2019 brief and for injunctive relief are denied. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
