THE UNITED STATES.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b691-11\">[Not reported in C. Cls. R., 225; U. S.

On the appeal the judgment was affirmed, and the Supreme Court decided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>\u201cAn assign within the meaning of \u00a7 2 of the act of June 16, 1880, 21 Stat. 287, c. 244, is one who becomes invested with the entryman\u2019s right in the land through the voluntary act of the latter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">\u201c While a mere quitclaim deed does not pass after acquired title, the equitable title of one who was also trustee to acquire the title for the grantee will pass by such a deed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">\u201c Equity usually looks upon that as done which ought to have been done. The act of June 16, 1880, proceeds upon equitable principles and should be administered accordingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">\u201cA remedial state, such as \u00a7 2 of the act of June 16, 1880, should be interpreted with appropriate regard to the spirit which prompted it; and that act is therefore construed so as to return money erroneously paid for an entry that cannot be confirmed to the party entitled to receive it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">\u201c One for whom an entryman initiates and obtains an allowance for an entry, and to whom the entryman gives a quitclaim deed is an assign within the meaning of \u00a7 2 of the act of June 16, 1880, and entitled to recover the purchase price if the entry cannot be confirmed, provided the arrangement was not forbidden by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">\u201c Under \u00a7 2 of the act of June 16, 1880, the assign of an entryman cannot recover the purchase price paid if there was any fraud practiced by it in connection with the entry; an entry fraudulently obtained is not one erroneously allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">\u201c Under \u00a7\u00a7 2347-2852 Rev. Stat., providing for coal-land entries, one cannot enter for another who has had the full benefit of the law; but, in the absence of evasion of restrictions as to quantity, there is no prohibition, expressed or implied, against an entry by a qualified person for the benefit of another person fully qualified to. make the entry in his, or, if a corporation, in its, own name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-10\">\u201cA corporation is an association of persons within the meaning of the coal-land entry provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 2347-2352, Rev. Stat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-11\">\u201c Where it does not appear that a corporation had previously entered its full amount of coal lands under \u00a7\u00a7 2347-2352, Rev. Stat., an entry made on its behalf by a qualified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>entryman is not illegal; and an affidavit that the latter was not making the entry for another, the falsity of which is disclosed on a contest, becomes harmless and does not affect the right of the entryman or his assign to recover the price paid under \u00a7 2 of the act of June 16,1880.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-4\">\u201c The rule that fraud is not presumed and that one basing his defense thereon should prove it, applies to the Government; and if the answer' contains no allegation of fraud, silence in the findings of the court below will be taken as showing that none was proved, and an affirmative finding that there was no fraud is not necessary to sustain the judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<author id=\"b693-5\">Mr. Justice Yan Devanter</author>\n<p id=\"AAG-\">delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court May 27, 1912.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
