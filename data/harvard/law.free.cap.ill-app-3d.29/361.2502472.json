The issues before us are: (1) Whether the trial court erred in failing to grant defendant\u2019s motions for a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict because defendant was not guilty of negligence as a matter of law; (2) whether the trial court erred in refusing to give defendant\u2019s instruction pertaining to alleged contributory negligence of the deceased child\u2019s mother; and (3) whether the trial court improperly failed to grant defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial when plaintiff\u2019s counsel made remarks in his closing argument allegedly implying to the jury that insurance was available to relieve whatever obligation might be placed on defendant.</p> <p id=\"b387-9\" pgmap=\"387\">The defendant contends that her motion for a directed verdict should have been granted or judgment notwithstanding the verdict entered because she was not guilty of negligence as a matter of law. Defendant\u2019s reasoning is that there was no evidence that she was violating the speed limit or any traffic law, she never saw the child prior to impact, nor was she even aware of the accident until her passenger told her, so, while a very unfortunate accident occurred, there was no act on her part from which a jury could find negligence so as to make her hable for the death of the child.</p> <p id=\"b387-10\" pgmap=\"387(133) 388(391)\">The accident occurred in the town of New Holland a little after 4 P.M., with visibility good and the pavement dry and clear. The defendant, accompanied by one Mrs. Tackman, was driving a car north on Route 10, which is a narrow road (18 feet wide) carrying moderate to heavy traffic through the town of New Holland. The speed limit is 30 MPH, and various witnesses place defendant\u2019s speed between 15 and 30 MPH. As the defendant\u2019s northbound vehicle approached the intersection of Pekin Street, the passenger (Mrs. Tackman) observed a small child running in a southerly direction on the sidewalk on the east side of the highway. The evidence does not establish whether or not this was the decedent. The defendant testified that at no time did she see a child. At a point approximatly 38 feet north of the intersection of Route 10 and Pekin Street, an impact occurred between the child and defendant\u2019s automobile. No one actually saw the impact, but several witnesses testified that they heard a \u201cthump\u201d and several testified that immediately prior to the impact, the child was standing alongside the road about 1 foot east of the pavement, apparently waiting to cross. A State trooper who happened to be driving several cars behind the defendant testified that after the impact, the child\u2019s body was approximately 5 feet from the edge of the highway. The investigating trooper testified that the defendant\u2019s car was covered with road film, and the only place this film was disturbed was a spot on the rear fender, approximately 27 inches in front of the right rear bumper and 25 inches above ground level. Mr. Hedrick, one of the witnesses who heard a thump which he said so.unded like a blowout, was driving a truck and was passing the defendant\u2019s car going in the opposite direction at the time he heard the noise. He glanced in his rear view mirror and saw defendant\u2019s car veer to the right immediately after hearing the thump. The witness Sue Aldag testified that she also heard a thump at the time of the impact, and that she also saw the car swerve but could not say whether this occurred before or after the impact. The defendant testified that she did not swerve her car prior to or at the time of impact, but pulled partially off the road immediately thereafter. There was no evidence that defendant\u2019s car left the paved surface of Route 10 prior to or at the time of the impact. In summary it may be said that inasmuch as no witness actually observed the impact between the child and defendant\u2019s car no one is certain how the accident occurred. Defendant argues that the child must have run into the rear fender of her automobile, while plaintiff contends defendant struck the child while swerving to avoid Hedrick\u2019s truck. The testimony was that the truck was 8 to 8% feet in width, and each lane of Route 10 was 9 feet in width. There is no evidence that any portion of the truck was over the center line of the highway.</p> <p id=\"b388-5\" pgmap=\"388\">Richard Sheley, the father of the decedent, testified that he was on his way home from Champaign when the accident occurred and that his wife was in charge of the child. He stated that there was frequent and constant traffic on Route 10 day in and day out. He testified that they frequently allowed their daughter to cross Route 10, but never by herself and unattended, but only after they escorted her to the edge of the pavement. Sheley also testified that the \u201cpractice\u201d was as follows, when the child returned from the opposite side of the road:</p> <blockquote id=\"b388-6\" pgmap=\"388(24) 389(25)\">\u201cWhen our daughter would start home she would stand on the other side of the road, the east side of the hardroad, and would yell for someone to help her across the hardroad. That was always her practice unless there was someone around to say \u2018Come on home, Hope\u2019.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b389-5\" pgmap=\"389\">Nancy Sheley testified that on the day in question the child asked to go across the street to play with a friend. She took Hope by the hand, walked her to the comer and thought that she accompanied her across the street. Mrs. Sheley then returned to their home and was engaged in preparing the evening meal when notified of the accident.</p> <p id=\"b389-6\" pgmap=\"389\"> We do not agree with defendant\u2019s contention that merely because she was not shown to have been violating any traffic laws, and did not see the child at any time, that there was no question of fact for the jury. The speed of defendant\u2019s automobile was placed between 15 MPH and 30 MPH by the various witnesses. Three witnesses said the child was standing 1 foot from the highway, defendant\u2019s passenger said that shortly earlier a child was running south on the sidewalk, and there was evidence that at some point tire defendant\u2019s car swerved towards the side of the road. Photographs in evidence show a clear view of the intersection and roadside and the defendant admits she knew that many young children resided in the area, and testified she kept \u201cextra special\u201d lookout for young children near the intersection; yet, the defendant never saw the decedent until after the impact. Whether an individual has been guilty of negligence is a question of fact, and evidence on that matter is addressed to the jury. In Kahn v. James Burton Co., 5 Ill.2d 614, 126 N.E.2d 836, the court stated that questions concerning one\u2019s care, another party\u2019s alleged negligence, the proximate cause of such injured party\u2019s injuries and damages are preeminently questions of fact for the jury to determine, and that a jury\u2019s finding should not be set aside unless against the manifest weight of the evidence. In this case, there was a real dispute as to whether the defendant was maintaining a proper lookout at the time of the accident and whether or not the defendant swerved and struck the child or tire child ran into the car. The trial court quite properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict in view of the evidentiary posture of this case. Pedrick v. Peoria &amp; Eastern R.R. Co., 37 Ill.2d 494, 229 N.E.2d 504.</p> <p id=\"b389-7\" pgmap=\"389\">The defendant offered an instruction predicated upon the proposition that the evidence demonstrated the mother\u2019s failure to properly supervise the child. The instruction, IPI \u2014 Civil No. 31.08, advised the jury that if they found that the mother negligently contributed to the cause of the death of the decedent, such would preclude the mother from participating in any award made.</p> <p id=\"b390-4\" pgmap=\"390\"> The trial court refused this instruction and upon appeal it was urged that such was error. The tendered instruction is predicated upon the provisions of section 2 of the Wrongful Death Act. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1971, ch. 70, \u00a7 2.) Contributory negligence of any person entitled to share in an award does not relate to liability, but simply precludes the contributorily negligent relative from sharing in the recovery, and the amount of damages shall not include compensation for such person.</p> <p id=\"b390-5\" pgmap=\"390\"> The negligence, if any, on the part of the mother cannot be imputed to the decedent. Duffy v. Cortesi, 2 Ill.2d 511, 119 N.E.2d 241; Rahn v. Beurskens, 66 Ill.App.2d 423, 213 N.E.2d 301.</p> <p id=\"b390-6\" pgmap=\"390\"> By its language the tendered and refused instruction applies to the amount of damages and the mother\u2019s right to participate in the award. There is no contention made upon this appeal that the damages awarded by the jury were in any way excessive. We see no reason why this offered instruction does not fall within the often stated rule that evidence or instructions going to the measure of damages where the amount awarded is not questioned as excessive must be viewed as harmless error. Aledo Terminal Ry. Co. v. Butler, 246 Ill. 406, 92 N.E. 909; Fugate v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 12 Ill.App.3d 656, 299 N.E.2d 108; Strasma v. Lemke, 111 IIl.App.2d 377, 250 N.E.2d 305; Slovinski v. Beasley, 316 Ill.App. 273, 45 N.E.2d 42.</p> <p id=\"b390-7\" pgmap=\"390\"> Furthermore, the defendant made no objection to the submission of plaintiff\u2019s instruction number 28 (IPI\u2014Civil No. 31.01, modified) which advised the jury to fix their award in an amount \u201cwhich will reasonably and fairly compensate the father, mother, brother and sister of the decedent for the pecuniary loss proved by the evidence to have resulted to them from the death of the decedent.\u201d Having accepted this instruction, it may be said that the defendant waived her right to object to the mother\u2019s sharing in the proceeds of the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b390-8\" pgmap=\"390\"> Upon this appeal, the defendant also complains that mistrial should have been declared when plaintiff\u2019s counsel made remarks in the closing arguments which purportedly referred to the presence of insurance. The trial court wrote a memorandum on this issue in his ruling on the post-trial motion indicating his belief that the statement made in closing argument was improper, but that it was given in response to defendant\u2019s argument improperly seeking sympathy for the defendant. The trial court thus found that the statements were provoked and further that any error was cured by the court\u2019s admonition to the jury with reference to the arguments of counsel. Upon our review of the record, we agree with the ruling and the reasons assigned for the ruling of the trial court.</p> <p id=\"b390-9\" pgmap=\"390(8) 391(43)\"> Defendant\u2019s brief mentioned several other issues concerning the propriety of evidentiary rulings. These issues were not briefed nor argued and are waived. (Supreme Court Rule 341(e)(7) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1973, ch. 110A, \u00a7 341(e) (7)).) The judgment of the circuit court of Logan County should be and the same is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b391-5\" pgmap=\"391\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b391-6\" pgmap=\"391\">SMITH, J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b391-7\" pgmap=\"391\">Mr. PRESIDING JUSTICE SIMKINS,</author> <p id=\"A8U\" pgmap=\"391\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b391-8\" pgmap=\"391\">The mother was in charge of the child on the day in question. This is not the case of a child wandering from an unfenced yard into or near a busy street. Rather the issue is the mother\u2019s established course of conduct and supervision, and the \u201cpractice\u201d involved in recrossing the street Or road. It is her alleged lack of supervision, her knowing acquiescence in the procedure which raises the question. The fact that she accompanied the child to the comer on the day in question and either directed her crossing or escorted her across the street and had done so on previous occasions demonstrates her awareness of the dangers involved. She was also aware that the child, 4 years of age, in endeavoring to recross the street, would stand beside the road waiting for assistance. That, indeed, was the practice.</p> <p id=\"b391-9\" pgmap=\"391\">Whether Nancy Sheley was exercising proper supervision and control over the child in light of all the attendant facts and circumstances, including the age and capacity of the minor and the nature of the danger to which the child was exposed, was a question of fact for the jury. Payne v. Kingsley, 59 Ill.App.2d 245, 207 N.E.2d 177; Strasma v. Lemke, 111 Ill.App.2d 377, 250 N.E.2d 305.</p> <p id=\"b391-10\" pgmap=\"391\">The defendant\u2019s post-trial motion explicitly raised the question of ex-cessiveness of damages in connection with the trial judge\u2019s refusal to give the instruction, and the failure to give the instruction is assigned as error here. Since the instruction goes only to the issue of damages it seems to me that the refusal to meet the question is predicated on a stringently applied technicality consisting of the failure of defendant to use one magic word. I would affirm on the issue of liability, reverse the finding on damages and remand for a new trial on that issue. It was error to refuse the instruction.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
