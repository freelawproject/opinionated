Samadi filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, challenging the constitutionality of his indefinite detention as a removable alien and contesting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>validity of his immigration proceedings. Samadi was released from detention; and, on respondents\u2019 motion, the \u00a7 2241 petition was dismissed as moot to the extent it challenged the constitutionality of the indefinite detention. Samadi filed a post-judgment motion, which was properly construed as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion. In denying this motion, the district court observed that Samadi\u2019s collateral arguments against respondents\u2019 dismissal motion were not cognizable under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">For this <em>pro se </em>appeal, we must first determine the jurisdictional scope of our review. <em>E.g., Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Samadi failed to file a timely notice of appeal from the underlying judgment denying his \u00a7 2241 petition. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review that order. <em>See Halicki v. Louisiana Casino Cruises, Inc., </em>151 F.3d 465, 468 (5th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>526 U.S. 1005, 119 S.Ct. 1143, 143 L.Ed.2d 210 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Samadi\u2019s notice of appeal was timely with respect to the denials of his Rule 60(b) motion; and his motion for an extension of time to file a second postjudgment motion. Rule 60(b) allows a court to relieve a party from a final judgment for reasons such as, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201c(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence ...; (3) fraud, ... misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party\u201d; (4) a void judgment; or (5) \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment\u201d. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., Edwards v. City of Houston, </em>78 F.3d 983, 995 (5th Cir.1996). Samadi has failed to contend or demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in denying his postjudgment motion. <em>See Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981). (Accordingly, Samadi\u2019s change of venue motion is DENIED.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b199-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
