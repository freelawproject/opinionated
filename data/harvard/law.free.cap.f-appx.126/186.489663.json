Olguin argues that he is entitled to credit on his federal sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana for time served while he was awaiting the imposition of his federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The respondent provided summary judgment evidence that Olguin received credit on his state sentence for the time he was being held by federal officers pending his federal sentencing, and Olguin has not refuted that evidence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Therefore, Olguin has not demonstrated that he is entitled to any additional credit for time served on his federal sentence. <em>See 18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The district court did not err in granting the respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment and in dismissing the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b219-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
