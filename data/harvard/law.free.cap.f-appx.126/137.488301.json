A certif\u00edcate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Marshall has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certif\u00edcate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\">. Because the petition was untimely, we do not address the other reasons for dismissal discussed in the district court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b170-24\">. Marshall consented to the jurisdiction of the magistrate judge to enter a final order in this case. <em>See </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 73.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
