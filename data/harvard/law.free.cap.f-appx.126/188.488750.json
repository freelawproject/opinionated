He contends that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He asserts further that he would be entitled to relief under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), if <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), were overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-25\">Hamilton-Reyes\u2019s argument concerning the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is, as he concedes, foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Since <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>not been overruled, Hamilton-Reyes is not entitled to relief under <em>Blakely. See Dabeit, </em>281 F.3d at 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
