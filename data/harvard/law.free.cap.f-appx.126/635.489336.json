The Petitioners claimed reopening was warranted because of ineffective assistance of counsel, newly discovered evidence and changed circumstances. In their petitions for review, the Petitioners limit review to the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-24\">We review the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2004); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Yanez-Popp v. INS, </em>998 F.2d 231, 234 (4th Cir.1993). A denial of a motion to reopen must be reviewed with extreme deference, since immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor motions to reopen. <em>M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc). We find the Board did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-25\">Accordingly, we deny the petitions for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-26\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
