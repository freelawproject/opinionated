He appeals the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and further asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. We find no error in the district court\u2019s application of the factors to be considered in deciding whether to grant a motion to withdraw. <em>See United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir. 1984). Armenia\u2019s assertion of innocence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>was equivocal at best, and he provided no good justification for his delay in seeking to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>See id. </em>We also find no error in the district court\u2019s determination that withdrawal of the plea would inconvenience the court and would waste judicial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The district court\u2019s findings that Armenta had close assistance of counsel and that his plea was made knowingly and voluntarily are supported by the record. The district court conducted a thorough Rule 11 colloquy, and Armenta affirmed that he understood the nature of the charges and denied any coercion. Armenta has failed to overcome the presumption of veracity that attaches to statements made under oath in open court. <em>See United States v. Cervantes, </em>132 F.3d 1106, 1110 (5th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the denial of Armenia's motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
