Johnson, former Mississippi prisoner # 42204 and current federal prisoner # 05292-043, has filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. The district court denied Johnson\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for relief from the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. The district court denied Johnson\u2019s motion to appeal IFP and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP, Johnson is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Johnson has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion by denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion. <em>See Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981). The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Johnson\u2019s request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Johnson is cautioned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Johnson is also cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined, that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
