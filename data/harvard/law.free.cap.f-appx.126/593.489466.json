Glaser and his family, appeal the dismissal of their claims for federal securities fraud, conspiracy, and common law fraud against Enzo Biochem, Inc. (\u201cEnzo\u201d) and individual defendants Barry Weiner, Elazar Rabbani, Shahram Rabbani, Dean Engelhardt, John DeLucca, and Heimon Gross. After denying the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, the district court dismissed the federal securities fraud claim based on the applicable statute of limitations and dismissed the remaining claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-20\">Enzo is a publicly traded biotechnology company engaged in research and development of treatments to combat the human immunodeficiency virus (\u201cHIV\u201d) and other diseases. During the period from 1994 to 2000, Glaser purchased more than one million shares of Enzo stock. According to the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint, Enzo, through press releases and statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>made by its officers, exaggerated the preliminary success of a new HTV treatment in 2000 and misled investors concerning the prospects for marketing that treatment. As a result, Glaser continued to purchase Enzo stock at a time when Enzo\u2019s officers and directors were selling their stock at inflated prices. After Enzo\u2019s stock price dropped precipitously in the spring of 2000, Glaser was left holding more than one million shares, many of which had been purchased on margin. Glaser and his wife were forced into bankruptcy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The plaintiffs specifically complain about statements made by Enzo officers during the January 12, 2000, annual shareholders\u2019 meeting. At that meeting, Enzo manager Dean Engelhardt announced that Enzo had developed a new treatment to combat HIV. According to Engelhardt, this new treatment was like a \u201croach motel,\u201d where \u201cthe virus goes in but does not come out.\u201d J.A. 267. Engelhardt stated that although the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) would not allow him to say that Enzo had cured AIDS, Enzo\u2019s new treatment \u201cworks\u201d and it kills the virus. J.A. 267. The amended complaint alleges that these statements were false because preliminary trials had not, in fact, yielded results that would satisfy the FDA\u2019s efficacy requirements for such a treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">During the same January 12 meeting, Enzo\u2019s president, Barry Weiner, reported that Enzo planned to open three more clinics by the end of the fiscal year to treat HIV and AIDS patients. J.A. 267. Each clinic would be able to treat 9,500 patients at a charge of $30,000 per patient. The amended complaint alleges that this representation was false because Enzo did not have permission from the FDA to open any new climes, nor had Enzo even sought such permission. Weiner also stated that Enzo had submitted its Phase I trial data to the FDA and that the company was awaiting approval to proceed to Phase II trials.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> J.A. 268. In fact, Enzo did not even have Phase I data in hand that it could submit to the FDA at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Weiner made further representations concerning the so-called HGTV-43 vector, a key component of a new gene therapy developed by Enzo. In a process called transduction, the HGTV-43 vector would deliver certain genes to human cells. With this new gene, these cells were engineered to enhance immune responses. Weiner stated at the January 12 meeting that Enzo scientists had been able to reduce the time period required for successful transduction from a period of up to three months to a period of only eighteen hours; that HGTV-43 was able to achieve levels of stable transduction to patients\u2019 non-growing blood stem cells greater than 30%; and that the HGTV-43 vector was ready for commercialization. J.A. 268-69. In a press release regarding Enzo\u2019s gene therapy and the HGTV-43 vector, Enzo also stated that it was exploring expansion of its clinical trials. J.A. 269. Weiner failed to mention, however, that Enzo had modified its transduction protocol due to the absence of any positive data from initial research or that this lack of positive data had slowed down the development of Enzo\u2019s gene therapy and delayed clinical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>trials. Despite Weiner\u2019s assurance that the HGTV-43 vector was ready for commercialization, Enzo had not marketed that product by the time the plaintiffs filed their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Although share prices for Enzo usually fluctuated by approximately $1 per share to $3 per share after annual meetings and trading volumes average only two million shares, in the eight trading days after the January 12 meeting Enzo\u2019s stock price soared $90 per share \u2014 from $43 to $133\u2014 at a trading volume of more than thirteen million shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Within a few months after the January 12 meeting, one Enzo director sold all of his holdings, valued at approximately $2 million. Three of Enzo\u2019s five directors sold a total of 600,000 shares at $81 per share, and Engelhardt, who made several of the statements at issue in this case, sold 5,000 shares at $70 per share. Enzo\u2019s stock price began to decline immediately, and within two weeks it was down to $35 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In response to this devaluing of the stock, Enzo managers issued a press release assuring investors that \u201c[t]he recent activity of the stock merely mirrors the general weakness that has affected the entire biotech industry and in no way reflects Enzo\u2019s intrinsic value.\u201d J.A. 274. This press release further stated that a clinical study at the University of California was moving toward its final stages; HGTV-43 had successfully delivered certain genes to blood stem cells outside the human body; following transduction and infusion into patients, the genetically engineered cells continue to survive and behave in a manner consistent with the goals of the treatment; an abstract concerning the therapy had been accepted for presentation to the American Society of Gene Therapy in June 2000; Enzo knew of no other therapy that had achieved the results that Enzo\u2019s gene therapy achieved; and plans for Phase II clinical studies were proceeding. J.A. 274-75. This press release misrepresented key facts concerning Enzo\u2019s gene therapy. Enzo\u2019s trials had not yielded particularly positive results, and in some cases produced negative results; Enzo failed to mention that the data it collected was based on only five patients; and Enzo had not applied for Phase II approval, nor did it have a schedule in place for Phase II testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Once its stock price dropped to $35, Enzo issued another press release. According to this release, all remained well with Enzo, the ongoing clinical trials were on schedule, and Enzo had no explanation for the collapse in the stock price. J.A. 277. These statements were false in that Enzo had no schedule in place for the ongoing clinical trials, and Enzo did have at least a partial explanation for the drop in stock price, <em>i. e., </em>the transfer of 600,000 shares by top-level managers.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">In October 2000, Enzo issued a press release reporting that \u201cnew data on the first individual treated in the Phase I clinical trial of HGTV-43, the company\u2019s HIV-1 gene medicine product, show that after nine and one-half months Enzo engineered cells have successfully engrafted the patient\u2019s bone marrow and were spawning new ... cells designed to fight the virus.\u201d J.A. 285-86. Contrary to this statement, Enzo disclosed data in March 2001 showing that engraftment had actually failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">The devaluation of Enzo stock resulted in significant losses for Glaser. By April 2000, Glaser held more than one million shares of Enzo stock, and he was forced to liquidate these holdings in order to cover debts for shares purchased on margin. Glaser and his wife ultimately filed for bankruptcy protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>During the course of his bankruptcy proceeding, Glaser came to believe that Enzo was involved in a \u201cmassive securities fraud\u201d and sought discovery from Enzo concerning that fraud. J.A. 740A. The bankruptcy court granted Glaser\u2019s motion for discovery. In March 2002 \u2014 more than a year after filing his motion for discovery in the bankruptcy court \u2014 Glaser filed a complaint alleging federal securities fraud and common law fraud against Enzo. Glaser voluntarily dismissed this initial complaint. In August 2003, Glaser and his family initiated this lawsuit by filing a new complaint alleging violations of federal securities laws, civil conspiracy, and common law fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The district court dismissed the federal securities fraud claim on the ground that the applicable one-year statute of limitations had run before the complaint was filed. The district court then dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 conspiracy claim as a matter of law, ruling that federal securities laws do not contemplate liability for conspiracy just as they do not for aiding and abetting. Finally, the district court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 common law fraud claim on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to allege (1) that the specified misrepresentations concerned material facts or (2) that they actually relied on any such misrepresentations. Although the plaintiffs sought leave to amend their complaint further, the district court ruled that any repleading would be futile and denied the request. The plaintiffs now appeal each of these adverse rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The district court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 federal securities fraud claim against Enzo based on the statute of limitations. The plaintiffs argue that their claim is timely under the one-year statute of limitations provided in the Securities Exchange Act. Even if their claim is not timely under the Securities Exchange Act, the plaintiffs contend that it is timely under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">The statute of limitations for a securities fraud claim under the Securities Exchange Act is one year, and it begins to run when the plaintiff is put on inquiry notice of the facts constituting the alleged violation. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78i(e); <em>Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow v. Gilbertson, </em>501 U.S. 350, 363, 111 S.Ct. 2773, 115 L.Ed.2d 321 (1991). A plaintiffs awareness of the possibility of fraud, not complete exposure of the fraud, triggers inquiry notice. <em>Brumbaugh v. Princeton Partners, </em>985 F.2d 157, 162 (4th Cir.1993). \u201cMerely bringing suit after the scheme has been laid bare ... will not satisfy the requirements of due diligence when there have been prior warnings that something was amiss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where the underlying facts are undisputed, the question whether the plaintiffs were on inquiry notice may be decided as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s ruling that the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit more than one year after being put on inquiry notice of possible fraud. <em>Franks v. Ross, </em>313 F.3d 184, 192 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">Glaser was on inquiry notice as early as February 7, 2001, when he sought discovery from Enzo in the bankruptcy court. Glaser explained to the bankruptcy court that he was seeking discovery because he had <em>already </em>\u201cgathered evidence to suggest a massive securities fraud and the manipulation of Enzo stock both inside and outside the company, the exact scope of which is presently unknown.\u201d J.A. 740A. Indeed, the amended complaint filed in this case states that the plaintiffs \u201csought to substantiate their suspicions concerning their belief that securities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>fraud had been committed by using Bankruptcy Rule 2004,\u201d which governs discovery. J.A. 291. Thus, by the time Glaser filed his motion for discovery on February 7, he was aware of \u201cevidence of the possibility of fraud,\u201d and the limitations period began to run. <em>Brumbaugh, </em>985 F.2d at 162. The plaintiffs did not file this lawsuit, however, until August 2002, more than one year after the date on which they were put on inquiry notice of possible securities fraud.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The plaintiffs seek to take advantage of the two-year limitations period provided by \u00a7 804(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which took effect on July 30, 2003. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-204, 116 Stat. 745, 804 (2002) (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d). The plaintiffs filed their original complaint prior to the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley but voluntarily dismissed that action. They filed the present complaint after the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley in an attempt to take advantage of the extended limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 refiling after Sarbanes-Oxley took effect did not revive any claim that was otherwise barred by the statute of limitations. As the Supreme Court has noted, \u201cextending a statute of limitations after the pre-existing period of limitations has expired\u201d essentially creates a new cause of action by reviving an otherwise \u201cmoribund cause of action.\u201d <em>Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, </em>520 U.S. 939, 950, 117 S.Ct. 1871, 138 L.Ed.2d 135 (1997); <em>accord In re Enterprise Mortgage, </em>391 F.3d 401, 407-408; <em>Chenault v. United States Postal Serv., </em>37 F.3d 535, 539 (9th Cir.1994). Section 804(c) of Sarbanes-Oxley, however expressly indicates an intention not to create any new causes of action. Although \u00a7 804(b) states that the new two-year statute of limitations \u201cshall apply to all proceedings ... that are commenced on or after the date of enactment of [Sarbanes-Oxley],\u201d this language does not clearly express an intention to revive otherwise stale claims. <em>See In re Enterprise Mortgage Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., </em>391 F.3d 401, 406-407 (2d Cir.2004). We agree with the district court that Sarbanes-Oxley does not revive the plaintiffs\u2019 otherwise untimely securities fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">The plaintiffs next argue that the district court erred in dismissing their conspiracy claim against the individual defendants. The Supreme Court held in <em>Central Bank, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank, N.A., </em>511 U.S. 164, 114 S.Ct. 1439, 128 L.Ed.2d 119 (1994), that there is no civil liability for aiding and abetting a violation of \u00a7 10(b). <em>Id. </em>at 177, 114 S.Ct. 1439. \u201c[T]he statute prohibits only the making of a material misstatement (or omission) or the commission of a manipulative act. The proscription does not include giving aid to a person who commits a manipulative or deceptive act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). Following <em>Central Bank, </em>we have stated that \u201ca misrepresentation must be directly attributable to [the defendant] and not to some other person.\u201d <em>Gariety v. Grant </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>Thornton, LLP, </em>368 F.3d 356, 369 (4th Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The rationale of <em>Central Bank </em>with respect to aiding and abetting applies equally to civil conspiracy. <em>See </em>511 U.S. at 200 n. 12, 114 S.Ct. 1439 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (stating that \u201c[t]he Court\u2019s rationale would sweep away the decisions recognizing that a defendant may be found liable in a private action for <em>conspiring </em>to violate \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b \u2014 5\u201d). The statute itself makes no mention of liability for conspiracy, and recognizing such liability would allow plaintiffs to \u201ccircumvent the reliance requirement,\u201d a key limitation on securities fraud claims. <em>Id. </em>at 180, 114 S.Ct. 1439. Thus, we conclude that there can be no civil liability for conspiracy to commit securities fraud. <em>Accord Dinsmore v. Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent, Sheinfeld &amp; Sorkin, </em>135 F.3d 837, 841 (2d Cir.1998); <em>In re GlenFed, Inc., Sec. Litig., </em>60 F.3d 591, 592 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Our conclusion is not altered by the <em>post-Central Bank </em>enactment of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(e), which authorizes <em>criminal </em>prosecution of persons who aid and abet securities law violations. Nothing in this provision creates a <em>private </em>right of action for aiding and abetting. <em>See Ziemba v. Cascade Int'l, Inc., </em>256 F.3d 1194, 1205 n. 6 (11th Cir.2001); <em>Wright v. Ernst &amp; Young LLP, </em>152 F.3d 169, 176 (2d Cir.1998). In sum, the district court properly followed the reasoning of <em>Central Bank </em>and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 conspiracy claims as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">The plaintiffs next challenge the dismissal of their common law fraud claim. Under Virginia law, a plaintiff seeking to recover for fraud must allege: (1) a false representation, (2) of a material fact, (3) made intentionally and knowingly, (4) with intent to mislead, (5) reliance by the party misled, and (6) resulting damage to the party misled. <em>Bank of Montreal v. Signet Bank, </em>193 F.3d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1999) (applying Virginia law); <em>Richmond Metro. Auth. v. McDevitt St. Bovis, Inc., </em>256 Va. 553, 507 S.E.2d 344, 346 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">At issue in this appeal are twelve alleged misrepresentations concerning Enzo\u2019s development of a new HIV treatment and gene therapy. The first category of misrepresentations includes statements made by Engelhardt at the January 12 shareholders meeting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">\u2022 \u201cIt works, they both work,\u201d referring to Enzo\u2019s gene therapy treatments for HIV and Hepatitis B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-12\">\u2022 The \u201cvirus goes in but does not come out,\u201d and Enzo has killed the virus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">The second category of misrepresentations include Enzo president Weiner\u2019s statements at the January 12 meeting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-14\">\u2022 Enzo would be opening three more clinics to treat HIV/AIDS patients by the end of fiscal year 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-15\">\u2022 Enzo had submitted Phase I data to the FDA and was awaiting Phase II approval.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-16\">\u2022 Enzo scientists had reduced the time required for HGTV-43 transduction from up to three months to eighteen hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-17\">\u2022 The HGTV-43 vector achieves levels of stable transduction greater than 30%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-18\">\u2022 The HGTV-43 vector was ready for commercialization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-19\">The final category of statements consists of statements made by Enzo in various press releases issued after the January 12 meeting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-20\">\u2022 Enzo was exploring expansion of the trials for its gene therapy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-21\">\u2022 The University of California clinical study was moving to its final stages, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>an abstract was to be presented to the American Society of Gene Therapy in June 2000, Enzo knew of no other system that achieved the results that its gene therapy had achieved, and plans for Phase II trials were proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\">\u2022 The HGTV-43 vector successfully delivered certain genes to blood stem cells and engineered cells continued to survive after transduction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">\u2022 All remained well and on schedule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u2022 Data from the first person treated in the Phase I trial of HGTV-43 showed successful engraftment of engineered cells into the patient\u2019s bone marrow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Accepting the material allegations of the amended complaint as admitted and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, <em>DeSole, </em>947 F.2d at 1171, these representations were false. Nevertheless, the district court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 fraud claim on the grounds that (1) none of these misrepresentations concerned a material fact, and (2) the plaintiffs had failed to allege that they reasonably relied on these misrepresentations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Under Virginia law, recovery for fraud requires proof that the fact misrepresented be material and substantially affect the interests of the plaintiff. <em>J.E. Robert Co. v. J. Robert Co., Inc. of Va., </em>343 S.E.2d 350, 345 (1986) (citing <em>Packard Norfolk, Inc. v. Miller, </em>198 Va. 557, 95 S.E.2d 207, 211 (1956)). A fact is material if it \u201cinfluences a person to enter into a contract,\u201d or if it \u201cdeceives him and induces him to act,\u201d or if \u201cwithout it the transaction would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Packard Norfolk, </em>95 S.E.2d at 211-12. Unfulfilled promises or statements as to future events typically do not constitute material facts that will support a fraud claim, and \u201c[s]tatements which are vague and indefinite in their nature and terms, or are merely loose, conjectural or exaggerated, go for nothing.\u201d <em>Tate v. Colony House Builders, Inc., </em>257 Va. 78, 508 S.E.2d 597, 599 (1999). Similarly, \u201ccommendatory statements, trade talk, or puffing, do not constitute fraud because statements of this nature are generally regarded as mere expressions of opinion.\u201d <em>Lambert v. Downtown Garage, Inc., </em>262 Va. 707, 553 S.E.2d 714, 717 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">There can be no doubt that the efficacy of Enzo\u2019s new HIV treatment\u2014 including both the direct treatment and the gene therapy \u2014 is a material fact for Enzo investors. The fact that Enzo\u2019s treatment works or does not work would be important to any investor\u2019s decision-making. Likewise, the progress of clinical trials for Enzo\u2019s new treatment would be an important fact to consider in deciding whether to buy or sell Enzo shares. Thus, all statements concerning the efficacy of Enzo\u2019s treatment or the actual progress of clinical trials satisfy the materiality requirement. <em>See Packard Norfolk, </em>95 S.E.2d at 211-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">By contrast, Weiner\u2019s statements that (1) Enzo would open three new clinics within the fiscal year and (2) the HGTV-43 vector was ready for commercialization are not actionable because they amount to unfulfilled promises or statements as to future events. <em>See Tate, </em>508 S.E.2d at 599. The statement in a press release that \u201call remained well\u201d at Enzo is vague and indefinite, a commendatory statement, or puffery that cannot give rise to an actionable fraud claim. <em>See Lambert, </em>553 S.E.2d at 717; <em>Tate, </em>508 S.E.2d at 599.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">\u201cIn order to prove reliance, a plaintiff must demonstrate that its reliance upon the [defendant\u2019s] representation was reasonable and justified.\u201d <em>Hitachi Credit Am. Corp. v. Signet Bank, </em>166 F.3d 614, 629 (4th Cir.1999) (applying Virginia law) (internal quotations omitted); <em>see also Bank of Montreal, </em>193 F.3d at 827 (stating that \u201c[i]n all cases of fraud [under Virginia law] the plaintiff must prove that it acted to its detriment in actual and justifiable reliance on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation (or on the assumption that the concealed fact does not exist)\u201d). With respect to representations concerning concrete facts, we have noted that \u201c[t]he touchstone of reasonableness is prudent investigation,\u201d and a plaintiff cannot claim to reasonably rely upon a misrepresentation when he \u201cmakes a partial inquiry, with full opportunity of complete investigation, and elects to act upon the knowledge obtained from the partial inquiry.\u201d <em>Hitachi Credit, </em>166 F.3d at 629 (citing <em>Harris v. Dunham, </em>203 Va. 760, 127 S.E.2d 65, 71-72 (1962)).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The plaintiffs alleged that they retained and continued to purchase Enzo stock in reliance on the good news coming from Engelhardt, Weiner, and the various press releases touting the new HIV treatment\u2019s preliminary success. J.A. 262, 270, 271, 277, 287, 293, 294. The district court ruled, however, that the plaintiffs could not have reasonably relied upon these misrepresentations because Enzo\u2019s Form 10-K contained a \u201cdisclaimer\u201d that should have put the plaintiffs on notice that Phase I trials did not actually test the efficacy of Enzo\u2019s treatment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">We disagree. The Form 10-K states that \u201cPhase I trials, concerned primarily with the safety and <em>preliminary effectiveness of the drugs, </em>involve fewer than 100 subjects. Phase II trials normally involve a few hundred patients and are designed primarily to demonstrate effectiveness in treating or diagnosing the disease .... \u201d J.A. 696 (emphasis added). This \u201cdisclaimer\u201d actually suggests that the Phase I trials of Enzo\u2019s HIV treatment <em>did </em>test the efficacy of that treatment, if only to a preliminary degree, and the district court\u2019s assertion that these trials \u201cmerely tested whether the drug was safe in order to proceed to Phase II,\u201d J.A. 48, is simply unsupported. Thus, we cannot say, for purposes of a motion to dismiss, that the \u2018plaintiffs\u2019 alleged reliance upon the various misrepresentations was unreasonable or unjustified as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">Finally, the plaintiffs argue that they should have been granted leave to amend their complaint. We review the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>court\u2019s decision to deny the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend for abuse of discretion. <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962); <em>GE Inv. Private Placement Partners II v. Parker, </em>247 F.3d 543, 548 (4th Cir.2001). Although leave to amend should \u201cbe freely given when justice so requires,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), the district court may deny leave to amend for reasons \u201csuch as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of the allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.\u201d <em>Foman, </em>371 U.S. at 182, 83 S.Ct. 227. Because we conclude that the federal securities fraud and conspiracy claims were barred as a matter of law, we agree with the district court that any amendment as to these claims would be futile. To the extent that the plaintiffs argue that they should have been permitted to amend their complaint to include a claim for conspiracy to commit common law fraud, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cmany opportunities ... to present their claim\u201d warranted denial of the motion to amend. <em>See Foman, </em>371 U.S. at 182, 83 5. Ct. 227 (recognizing that leave to amend may be denied because of \u201crepeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed\u201d). As the plaintiffs have adequately alleged a claim for common law fraud, amendment of perceived deficiencies in that claim is unnecessary. Of course, we do not foreclose any future amendments that may be appropriate under Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The district court properly dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 federal securities fraud and conspiracy claims as a matter of law. Because the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged common law fraud under Virginia law, however, we reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of that claim and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-7\">. Because we are reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, we \"must take all well-pleaded material allegations of the [amended] complaint as admitted and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d De <em>Sole v. United States, </em>947 F.2d 1169, 1171 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-11\">. Clinical trials for new treatments are conducted in phases. Phase I trials involve a smaller number of patients and primarily assess the safety and preliminaiy efficacy of the treatment. Phase II trials involve a larger number of patients and are focused on the ultimate efficacy of the treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\">. The plaintiffs argue that their failure to file within one year of inquiry notice should be excused because Enzo \"stonewalled and obstructed their discovery\u201d during the period from May 2001 to February 2003. This argument is meritless. As we have explained, the plaintiffs had sufficient knowledge on February 7, 2001, to be on inquiry notice. Even if Enzo's subsequent conduct in discovery delayed the plaintiffs' full understanding of the alleged fraud, it did not prevent the plaintiffs from filing a complaint within one year of inquiry notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b632-10\">. As an additional ground for dismissal, we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations with respect to Weiner\u2019s statements that (1) Enzo would open three new clinics to treat HIV/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>AIDS patients within the fiscal year and (2) the HGTV-43 vector was ready for commercialization, as well as the statement in a press release that Enzo was exploring expansion of its clinical trials, are allegations of \"fraud by hindsight.\u201d See <em>Hillson Partners Ltd. P'ship v. Adage, Inc., </em>42 F.3d 204, 209 (4th Cir. 1994) (\"Where fraudulent projections are alleged, the plaintiff must ... identify in the complaint with specificity some reason why the discrepancy between a company\u2019s optimistic projections and its subsequently disappointing results is attributable to fraud.... Mere allegations of \u2018fraud by hindsight\u2019 will not satisfy the requirements of Rule 9(b).\"). The plaintiffs alleged simply that (1) Enzo did not, in fact, open three new clinics, (2) the HGTV43 vector was not, in fact, commercialized, and (3) the clinical trials were not, in fact, expanded. The plaintiffs did not allege that these statements were known to be false when made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b633-13\">. The district court discussed the Form 10-K in its analysis of materiality under the federal securities laws. Under Virginia law, the district court\u2019s concern about the Form 10-K is more appropriately addressed as a matter of reliance rather than materiality.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b634-5\">. In sum, only eight of the twelve identified misrepresentations remain for consideration on remand. The statements concerning the opening of new clinics, the readiness of HGTV-43 for commercialization, and Enzo\u2019s exploring expansion of clinical trials, as well as the statement that all remained well at Enzo despite the drop in stock price, were properly dismissed as bases for the plaintiffs\u2019 common law fraud claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b634-9\">WILKINSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aru-\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">I concur in much of the majority opinion. The federal claims were properly dismissed as time-barred, and the conspiracy claims were properly dismissed as well. But as to the Virginia common law fraud claims, I do not believe that two of the eight remaining statements are actionable because they are too general. Specifically, representations that \u201cit works, they both work,\u201d and that the \u201cvirus goes in but does not come out,\u201d seem far too brief and too general to state a claim in fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">All of this is a matter of Virginia law. Nowhere has the Virginia Supreme Court come close to saying that statements of this general a nature present a viable basis for a fraud claim. Quite the opposite: the court has expressly rejected claims predicated on expressions of opinion, unfulfilled promises, statements as to future events, puffing, \u201cdealer talk,\u201d or \u201cbooster statements.\u201d The Virginia Supreme Court has repeated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-12\">[i]t is well settled that a misrepresentation ... must be of an existing fact, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>not the mere expression of an opinion. The mere expression of an opinion, however strong and positive the language may be, is no fraud. Such statements are not fraudulent in law, because ... they do not ordinarily deceive or mislead. Statements which are vague and indefinite in their nature and terms, or are merely loose, conjectural or exaggerated, go for nothing, though they may not be true, for a man is not justified in placing reliance upon them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxE\"><em>Mortarino v. Consultant Eng\u2019g Servs., Inc., </em>251 Va. 289, 467 S.E.2d 778, 781 (1996) (quoting <em>Saxby v. So. Land Co., </em>109 Va. 196, 63 S.E. 423, 424 (1909)). While the majority acknowledges that unfulfilled promises or future statements cannot be actionable, the Virginia Supreme Court has added that neither \u201ccan \u2018booster\u2019 statements of enthusiastic agents be depended upon. They are to be expected.\u201d <em>King v. Commercial Fin. Co., </em>163 Va. 260, 175 S.E. 733, 736 (1934) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">There is a reason for this reluctance to allow puffing, generalities, opinions, or merchant talk to form the basis for a foray into court. We live in a free enterprise system in which it is almost inescapable that people will puff their wares. One cannot, and the law does not, expect companies to disown their own products. Any reasonable investor, therefore, treats such statements with a healthy degree of skepticism. The law has never protected those who do not. <em>See Bank of Montreal v. Signet Bank, </em>193 F.3d 818, 827 (4th Cir. 1999) (collecting Virginia cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">This is one reason that the statements at issue are not actionable, and this reason is further connected with the reliance element of common law fraud. \u201c[0]ne who seeks to hold another in fraud must clearly show that he has relied upon the acts and statements of the other.\u201d <em>Harris v. Bumham, </em>203 Va. 760, 127 S.E.2d 65, 70 (1962). Virginia law has long placed investors at their peril when they incautiously rely on puffing or \u201cbooster\u201d statements. In <em>Akers v. Radford State Bank, </em>153 Va. 1, 149 S.E. 528 (1929), the corporation\u2019s representative had stated that \u201cnot a cent of the [stock\u2019s] subscribers\u2019 money would be spent\u201d on a railroad until a contractor gave bond and let the railroad. <em>Id. </em>at 531. Appellants alleged that this induced them to subscribe to the stock, but the Virginia Supreme Court rejected the claim, because appellants did not \u201chave any right to rely upon these statements ... [which were] made at a public booster meeting\u201d held to secure stock subscriptions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Glaser\u2019s claim similarly lacks merit. He has shown great familiarity with Enzo\u2019s business yet relied recklessly on booster statements and puffing. The record discloses an astonishing history of day-trading by buying on margin. As the district court was careful to note, \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 brokerage statements evince a pattern of speculative day-trading, an inherently risky undertaking, by sophisticated investors, not \u2018hapless\u2019 plaintiffs, who systematically acquired over one million shares over a six-year period.\u201d <em>Glaser v. Enzo Bio-chem, Inc., </em>303 F.Supp.2d 724, 750 (E.D.Va.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Someone who evinces a trading sophistication like Glaser\u2019s should not receive the special solicitude of the law when he fails to observe the most basic norms of commercial activity. In <em>Harris, </em>for instance, after noting that reliance is an essential element of fraud, the Virginia Supreme Court pointedly observed that one party \u201cwas an experienced businessman\u201d with \u201cbusiness acumen, [a] familiarity with accounting procedures, and [a] knowledge of financial affairs.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>127 S.E.2d at 70. Sophisticated investors \u2014 such as those who have \u201cconducted [their] own indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>dent investigation into the subject matter of [their] purchase,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u2014 rely at their peril, because their reliance on statements like those at issue here are not justifiable. <em>See also Horner v. Ahem, </em>207 Va. 860, 153 S.E.2d 216, 219 (1967) (someone who has the ability to protect himself with \u201cordinary care and prudence\u201d is left by the law \u201cwhere he has been placed by his own imprudent confidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The majority\u2019s unwillingness to recognize this legal tradition in Virginia law would have unfortunate implications if it were ever adopted by Virginia courts. It is no accident that Virginia law has developed as it has. Insubstantial suits for securities fraud simply drain energy from an economy that, in essence, is meant to remain entrepreneurial. No one doubts that overselling products like a cure for AIDS would be unfair not only to investors. It would represent a cruel hoax played against a particularly vulnerable segment of our society. On the other hand, holding that statements like the two specifically addressed above are actionable is to pile multiple legal difficulties on top of the already difficult medical challenges involved in vaccine production. Such rulings make it more difficult for vaccines of any sort \u2014 flu, smallpox, AIDS \u2014 to reach market because many vaccine manufacturers now face additional legal disincentives to develop them. Over the past thirty years, the number of vaccine manufacturers in America has declined from twenty-five to a grand total of five manufacturers today. Denise Grady, <em>Before Shortage of Flu Vaccine, Many Warnings, N.Y. Times, </em>Oct. 17, 2004, at Al. It is not novel to attribute the disappearance of manufacturers in part to legal claims. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>(\u201cSome companies dropped out because of lawsuits,\u201d while others found it too burdensome \u201cto meet regulatory standards.\u201d) There may well be multiple causes for the dwindling numbers of vaccine manufacturers in our country, but it seems fair to observe that ungrounded suits in fraud will not assist in reversing the decline.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">If the law actually required this consequence, so be it. But at least the Virginia law of fraud does not. I agree that six of the twelve statements are more than puffing, although Glaser must still be able to demonstrate on remand a reasonable reliance upon them. Even if those six could survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the other two never could and were properly dismissed by the district court. It is this failure to strike an appropriate balance between warranted liability and the unwarranted encouragement of frivolous securities fraud actions that leads me to dissent in part from the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
