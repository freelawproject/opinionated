South Car</em>olina, No. 04-6489 (4th Cir. Aug. 19, 2004) (unpublished). Following the issuance of this court\u2019s opinion, Harrison filed a motion for a certificate of appealability in the district court. The district court noted this court\u2019s adjudication of Harrison\u2019s appeal and denied the motion on October 18, 2004. The clerk of the district court then filed Harrison\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability as a notice of appeal and forwarded the record to this court. Harrison has filed an informal brief requesting a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">To the extent Harrison seeks a certificate of appealability, the court has previously considered this request and denied it. Accordingly, we decline to consider the request, as it is duplicative. To the extent Harrison\u2019s motion could possibly be construed as a notice of appeal, such notice would clearly be untimely. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App. P. 4(a). Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
