We dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"ACj\">Diawara challenges the IJ\u2019s findings that his asylum application was untimely and he failed to establish extraordinary circumstances for an exception under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2) (2000). We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this claim or the merits of his asylum application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000); <em>Zaidi v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 678, 680-81 (7th Cir.2004). We also lack jurisdiction over Diawara\u2019s challenges to the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of deportation and relief under the Convention Against Torture because he failed to properly exhaust these claims in his appeal to the Board. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d) (2000); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-26\">Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
