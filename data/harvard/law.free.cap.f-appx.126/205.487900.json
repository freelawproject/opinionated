On motion of the Government, Wiley\u2019s release on bond pending trial was revoked after the court heard evidence that Wiley continues to engage in the conduct for which he has been indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-25\">On appeal, absent an error of law, this court must affirm the district court\u2019s order revoking bond and detaining Wiley pending trial if the order \u201cis supported by the proceedings below.\u201d The statute states that, \u201cIf there is probable cause to believe that, while on release, the person committed a Federal ... felony, a rebuttable presumption arises that no condition or combination of conditions will assure that the person will not pose a danger to the safety of any other person in the community.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-26\">Wiley offered no evidence challenging the testimony of Inspector Callahan that Wiley has continued to dispense dosages of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>hydrocodone in amounts far in excess of usual medical practice, under conditions that suggested dispensation for non-medical reasons. Wiley\u2019s appeal does not challenge the evidence, but instead simply disagrees with the legal characterization of his conduct, <em>i.e., </em>with the characterization of the conduct for which he is also now on trial. We express no opinion on the ultimate legal issues. The district court\u2019s order, in any event, is fully supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b237-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited, circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
