Elijah Hakeem Muhammad, federal prisoner # 02791-088, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his Bivens<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> action. Muhammad argues that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint without giving him the opportunity to amend it. He further asserts that his claims against Larry Weston and Enrique Ortiz were not barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, 512 </em>U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because his disciplinary conviction was expunged. He additionally contends that he had a protected liberty interest in the good-time credits that he lost because of the disciplinary conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-22\">Muhammad\u2019s complaint and accompanying factual allegations were extensive and consisted of a total of 70 pages. While he alleged that he exhausted his administrative remedies against Weston and Ortiz, he did not allege that he exhausted his administrative remedies against Dr. C. Lohmann and Dr. Tamara Misc.el. His complaint showed that his disciplinary conviction had not been overturned or otherwise called into question. The district court dismissed the complaint over two years after Muhammad filed it; Muhammad had ample time to amend it. Accordingly, the district court did not err by dismissing Muhammad\u2019s complaint without expressly giving him an opportunity to amend it. <em>See Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 327 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Muhammad\u2019s claims against Weston and Ortiz, if successful, would undermine the validity of his disciplinary conviction. While the disciplinary conviction was erroneously expunged, it was reinstated once the error was discovered. Thus, Muhammad\u2019s disciplinary conviction was \u201cstill outstanding\u201d and his claims for damages and declaratory relief were barred by <em>Heck. See Hudson v. Hughes, </em>98 F.3d 868, 872 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997). To the extent that Muhammad sought the expunction of his disciplinary conviction and the return of his good-time credits, his claims were cognizable only in a habeas corpus action, not in a <em>Bivens </em>action. <em>See Spina v. Aaron, </em>821 F.2d 1126, 1128 (5th Cir.1987). We need not reach Muhammad\u2019s argument that he had a protected liberty interest in his good-time credits because that argument goes only to the merits of his incognizable challenge to his disciplinary conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Muhammad\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We warn Muhammad that if he accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b679-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
