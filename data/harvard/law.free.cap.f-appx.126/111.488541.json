We have carefully reviewed the record and find no indication that Garrett intended his action to be filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, or that it was appropriate to construe it as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-23\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings consistent with a Title VII complaint. We grant Garrett\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis and deny his motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-24\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
