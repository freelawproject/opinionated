His argument that the district court erred in not holding an evidentiary hearing and in not ordering the defendants to file answers to his compliant before dismissing his complaint is without merit. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). Neal\u2019s argument that the magistrate judge\u2019s report violated 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636 because the parties had not consented to proceed before a magistrate judge is also without merit. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Neal argues that the prison\u2019s forced interview of him relating to a criminal matter in the prison and his subsequent placement in segregation for his failure to cooperate during the interview violated his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and to equal protection under the law. His self-incrimination claim is without merit as he conceded in his complaint that the interview regarded the actions of \u201canother inmate,\u201d <em>see Cal. Bankers Ass\u2019n v. Schultz, </em>416 U.S. 21, 55, 94 S.Ct. 1494, 39 L.Ed.2d 812 (1974), and he did not adequately allege an equal protection violation, <em>see Muhammad v. Lynaugh, </em>966 F.2d 901, 903 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">He argues that abuses of the inmate trust fund by prison employees violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause. His allegations regarding the typewriter print wheels, the equipment bought for the prison staffs personal use, his grievances regarding the purchase of that equipment, and the prison\u2019s alleged violation of his rights under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause are raised for the first time in this court and will not be considered. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). Neal\u2019s allegations that the prison\u2019s selling of typewriter ribbon to the inmates violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and was a continuing criminal enterprise were conclusory in the district court and are conclusory before this court. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, those claims also will not be considered. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">Neal argues that abuses of the prison grievance system by prison employees violated his First and Eighth Amendment rights. As he provides no support for his Eighth Amendment claim, it will not be considered. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, as he fails to identify when he was unable to petition the Government for redress of his grievances, when he was retaliated against for filing grievances, or how the named defendants were involved in the alleged abuses, he has failed to show how his First Amendment rights were violated. <em>See Allen v. Thomas, </em>388 F.3d 147, 149 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Thompson v. Steele, </em>709 F.2d 381, 382 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">He argues that prison employees tampered with his mail and that the mail tampering violated his First Amendment rights. Neal does not demonstrate any error in the district court\u2019s analysis of this claim or otherwise show how the reading or opening of his mail violated his constitutional rights. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 225. Neal also has not demonstrated that the postmaster general violated any criminal statute or that she had a legal duty to investigate his claims of mail tampering.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">All of Neal\u2019s remaining arguments before the district court have been abandoned. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 225. Neal\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Neal\u2019s case as frivolous or for failure to state a claim counts as one strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), and the dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous counts as another strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We warn Neal that if he accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
