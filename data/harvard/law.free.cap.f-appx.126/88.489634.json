Praylow seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>denying relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude on the reasoning of the district court that Praylow has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Praylow v. Condon, </em>No. CA-02-3308-4-25 (D.S.C. Oct. 29, 2004). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
