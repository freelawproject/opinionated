INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). We have reviewed the evidence of record, the immigration judge\u2019s decision, and the Board\u2019s order and find substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Cai failed to establish the past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2004) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483 (same). Moreover, because Cai cannot sustain his burden on the asylum claim, he cannot establish his entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">Accordingly, we deny Cai\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b674-22\"> Cai does not seek review of that part of the order that denied protection under the Convention Against Torture. Therefore, he has abandoned any such claim. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Al-Hamdi, </em>356 F.3d 564, 571 n. 8 (4th Cir.2004); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
