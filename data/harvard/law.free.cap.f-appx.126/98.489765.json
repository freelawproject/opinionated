Because we agreed that the court lacks jurisdiction to review the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Omalin\u2019s application for a \u00a7 212(i) waiver, we granted the motion to dismiss to the extent that Omalin\u2019s petition challenged this denial. We now address the remaining issues raised in Omalin\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">Omalin first contends that the Board\u2019s use of the summary affirmance procedure as set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2004) violated his rights under the Due Process Clause. This argument, however, has been squarely rejected by our decision in <em>Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272 (4th Cir.2004). In <em>Blanco de Belbruno, </em>we held that \u201cthe [Boardj\u2019s streamlining regulations do not violate an alien\u2019s rights to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283. Accordingly, Omalin is not entitled to relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">Omalin also argues that the immigration judge\u2019s comments regarding the presence of his young child at his immigration hearing evidenced such a bias on the part of the immigration judge as to violate his right to due process of law. Because the remarks of the immigration judge fall well short of displaying a \u201cdeep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible,\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994), we find that Omalin has failed to show judicial bias and therefore cannot establish a violation of his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">We therefore deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
