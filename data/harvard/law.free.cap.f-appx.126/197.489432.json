He argues that his counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to investigate adequately his criminal history. Alonzo alleges that, before advising him to enter a plea agreement, counsel did not have an accurate idea of the applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-26\">The trial court allowed Alonzo\u2019s initial attorney to withdraw and substituted new counsel prior to sentencing Alonzo. Thereafter, Alonzo neither moved to withdraw his guilty plea nor raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in the district court. We conclude that the record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration of this issue on direct appeal. See <em>United States v. Price, </em>95 F.3d 364, 369 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 314 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, without prejudice to Alonzo\u2019s right to file a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u00a7 2255, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b229-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
