We review the district court\u2019s decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992). The district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West Supp.2004). Because Dawson did not dispute the allegations presented in the petition to revoke his supervised release, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to revoke Dawson\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-28\">Dawson argues on appeal that the district court lacked jurisdiction to impose his sentence in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) . In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that, under <em>Blakely, </em>the Sixth Amendment is violated when a district court, acting pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act and the guidelines, imposes a sentence greater than the maximum guideline sentence authorized by the facts found by the jury alone. The Court concluded that, if the guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory, the failure to submit guidelines issues to a jury would not violate the Sixth Amendment. Having determined that the mandatory nature of the federal sentencing regime was unconstitutional, the <em>Booker </em>Court adopted a remedial scheme that preserved the majority of the guidelines, excising only those portions mandating sentencing and appellate review in conformance with the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Because the sentencing guideline range calculated under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 7B1.4(a) (2000) is purely advisory, <em>Booker </em>does not apply to sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Denard, </em>24 F.3d 599, 602 (4th Cir.1994). Accordingly, we affirm Dawson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
