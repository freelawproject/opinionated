The district court ruled for Calabrian based on its legal conclusion that Ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>nett failed to proffer any competent evidence to establish a prima facie case that there was a \u201crecord\u201d of impairment or that Bennett was \u201cregarded as\u201d being disabled. <em>See Bennett v. Calabrian Chemicals Corp., </em>324 F.Supp.2d 815 (E.D.Tex.2004). Bennett argues that there is competent evidence to support both of these conclusions. The following discussion can add little to the district court\u2019s careful opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and are bound by the same standards as those employed by the district court. <em>See Chaplin v. NationsCredit Corp., </em>307 F.3d 368, 371 (5th Cir.2002). Namely, summary judgment is appropriate only where the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, when viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. <em>TIG Ins. Co. v. Sedgwick James, </em>276 F.3d 754, 759 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The record does not support the conclusion that Bennett has a record of a \u201cphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of [Bennett\u2019s] major life activities.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 12102(2). The fact that Bennett was temporarily off work for a medical condition and surgery does not mean that he was disabled under the ADA. <em>See Pryor v. Trane Co., </em>138 F.3d 1024, 1026 (5th Cir.1998) (stating that temporary, non-chronic impairments of short duration, with little or no longer term or permanent impact, are usually not disabilities).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Moreover, the fact that Calabrian previously granted Bennett\u2019s request for twenty-six weeks of short term disability leave under Calabrian\u2019s self-funded plan does not by itself establish that Calabrian \u201cregarded\u201d Bennett as disabled. <em>See, e.g., Linser v. State of Ohio, Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>234 F.3d 1268, 2000 WL 1529809, *4 (6th Cir.2000). The legal definition of a disability under the ADA is different from the eligibility criterion for Calabrian\u2019s short term disability plan (\u201cnot able to perform any work for pay or profit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Finally, Bennett fails in arguing that the letter to him from Charles Cogliandro, President of Calabrian, is competent evidence to demonstrate that Calabrian regarded Bennett as disabled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cogliandro testified that he developed a suspicion Bennett was not in fact unable to work, and when Bennett attempted to return to work, Cogliandro regarded Bennett as unworthy to return. This letter tends to show that Cogliandro was disturbed that Bennett had been on medical leave for a condition that did not prevent him from working at the plant. The letter, standing by itself, does not establish a factual basis for the conclusion that Calabrian regarded Bennett as having an impairment substantially limiting a major life activity. At most, it shows that Cogliandro believed that Bennett had the medical condition of arterial occlusive disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b203-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\">. Cogliandro\u2019s letter states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">[S]ince Dr. Foley had determined that Mr. Bennett was fully disabled due to his condition (arterial occlusive disease), that a release from Dr. Foley must state that he no longer has the condition in order for Mr. Bennett to return to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU_J\">To date, Mr. Bennett has failed to produce a release from Dr. Foley with the requested information. Hence, he cannot return to work.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
