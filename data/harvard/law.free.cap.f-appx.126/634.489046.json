Hill appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing as moot his appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss an involuntary Chapter 7 petition filed against him by the Appellees. In No. 04-2471, Hill appeals from the district court\u2019s order that denied his motion to reconsider a prior order and dismissed as untimely his appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s order for relief in the underlying bankruptcy proceeding. Our review of the record included on appeal, the opinions of the courts below, and the parties\u2019 briefs discloses no reversible error. Accordingly, we grant the Appellees\u2019 motion to consolidate these appeals and affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Hill v. Neill (In re Hill), </em>Nos. CA-04-55-1; BK-03-11498 (W.D.N.C. filed June 10, 2004 &amp; entered June 15, 2004; filed Oct. 12, 2004 &amp; entered Oct. 14, 2004). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>deny Hill\u2019s motion for summary remand and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
