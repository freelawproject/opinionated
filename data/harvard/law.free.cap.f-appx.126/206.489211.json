We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-22\">We hold that the district court did not erroneously determine that the confidential informant\u2019s tip, which had been corroborated by the officers\u2019 observations, was sufficient to establish probable cause to search Davis\u2019s vehicle. <em>See United States v. Morales, </em>171 F.3d 978, 981-82 (5th Cir. 1999). We further hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to disclose the informant\u2019s identity. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Burciaga, </em>981 F.2d 192, 195 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-23\">Davis failed to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence; therefore, we review his sufficiency of the evidence argument only for a determination whether the record is devoid of evidence pointing to his guilt and hold that circumstantial evidence other than Davis\u2019s mere presence in the vehicle supported the jury\u2019s finding that he knowingly possessed the crack seized from the dashboard compartment. <em>See United States v. Herrera, </em>313 F.3d 882, 885 (5th Cir.2002) (en banc); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>185 F.3d 459, 464 (5th Cir.1999). Davis has failed to show an abuse of discretion on the part of the district court in allowing Agent Jeff Killion\u2019s phone call testimony into evidence. <em>See United States v. Lewis, </em>902 F.2d 1176, 1179 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-24\">Finally, Davis contends that the Mississippi statutory scheme under which he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>convicted as an adult for crimes committed when he was a juvenile is unconstitutional and, therefore, that his designation as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 was erroneous. The district court, however, in its discretion chose not to inquire into the validity of those prior convictions on that basis, and Davis has not shown the district court\u2019s decision to be an abuse of its discretion. <em>See United States v. Canales, </em>960 F.2d 1311, 1315 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"AkQ\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b238-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
