In No. 04-2306, we review the district court\u2019s dismissal de novo. We have reviewed the record and find the district court properly dismissed some claims and some defendants as frivolous. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal as frivolous. In No. 04-2568, we have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order and affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Richardson v. Roslyn Children Center, </em>No. CA-04-867 (E.D. Va. filed Nov. 17, 2004; entered Nov. 19, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-17\">\n<em>No. 04-2306 DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AII\">\n<em>No. 04-2568 AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
