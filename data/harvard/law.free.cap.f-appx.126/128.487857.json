Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Chisholm was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Counsel asserts that the district court\u2019s imposition of a seventeen-month sentence was plainly unreasonable. Because Chisholm did not object to the sentence in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>345 F.3d 281, 284 (4th Cir.2003) (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). Chisholm\u2019s sentence fell within the statutory maximum and within the suggested, nonbinding guideline range set forth in <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a), p.s. (2003). We therefore find that the district court did not plainly err in sentencing Chisholm.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
