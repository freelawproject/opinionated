This court\u2019s review of the denial of a motion to reopen is extremely deferential, and the decision will not be reversed absent abuse of discretion. <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999). Motions to reopen are disfavored. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). We find no abuse of discretion in the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Tchiengang failed to establish exceptional circumstances warranting reopening. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), (e)(1) (2000). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
