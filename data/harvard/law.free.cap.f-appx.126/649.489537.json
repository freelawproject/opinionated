Valchar contends that the file maintained by the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles (\u201cthe Board\u201d) contains erroneous information regarding his gang affiliation. The district court dismissed this claim as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">Valchar has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing as frivolous his claim concerning the presence of false information in his parole file. <em>See Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 291 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Johnson v. Rodriguez, </em>110 F.3d 299, 308 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-15\">This court will not consider Valchar\u2019s argument that the Board failed to comply with provisions of the Texas Open Records Act requiring that information be divulged to an inmate or his attorney because Val-char did not raise this claim in the district court. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-16\">Valchar does not address the dismissal of the remaining claims raised in the district court. Accordingly, these claims have been abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-17\">Valchar\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-18\">The dismissal of Valchar\u2019s appeal by this court counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Val-char has accumulated at least two additional strikes based on the dismissal of a previous civil rights complaint and appeal as frivolous. <em>See Valchar v. Swart, </em>193 F.3d 518, No. 99-10186 (5th Cir. Aug.24, 1999) (unpublished). Valchar has now accumulated at least three strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Accordingly, Valchar is now BARRED from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
