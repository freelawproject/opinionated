The district court also specified an alternative sentence of thirty-six months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to this court\u2019s recommendation in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.2004) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316, 353-54 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc), <em>cert, granted and judgment vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-25\">Fisher now moves for an expedited remand of this case to the district court in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We grant Fisher\u2019s motion for remand to allow the district court to recon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>sider Fisher\u2019s sentence in light of <em>Booker. </em>Fisher states that the sentencing issue is the only one he would pursue on appeal. Therefore, we affirm his conviction, vacate the sentence imposed by the district court, and remand for reconsideration of the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><em>AFFIRMED IN </em>PARTi <em>VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b654-16\"> Fisher does not attack the voluntariness of his guilty plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
