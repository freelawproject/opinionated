Das contends that he faces torture at the hands of an organized crime syndicate because Das can testify against members of the organization in connection with a series of bombings. Although review of an immigration decision is ordinarily limited to the BIA\u2019s decision, when the BIA adopts the decision of the Immigration Judge (IJ), this court may review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). As the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, but added its own reasons, we review both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">Das\u2019s contention that the BIA applied the wrong legal standard and relied on inapplicable precedent is without merit. The BIA\u2019s decision correctly sets forth the legal standard for a claim under the Convention. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">As to Das\u2019s claim that the IJ\u2019s findings of fact were erroneous, this court will uphold a finding that an alien is not entitled to relief under the CAT if that finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 353 (5th Cir.2002). The substantial evidence standard requires that the decision be based on the evidence presented and that the decision be substantially reasonable. Carba<em>jal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">The decisions of the BIA and the IJ are supported by substantial evidence, including exhibits demonstrating that the Indian government prosecuted members of the criminal organization as well as Das\u2019s testimony that the Indian government is actively pursuing the organization\u2019s leader. The record does not compel the conclusion that Indian government officials would inflict, instigate, consent to or acquiesce in Das\u2019s torture. <em>See id.; </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">Acordingly, Das\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b215-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
