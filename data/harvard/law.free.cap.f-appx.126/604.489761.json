(\u201cUnum\u201d) in her action seeking to recover the proceeds of an accidental death and dismemberment plan pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">On June 9, 2000, Jamie Watson died as the result of injuries sustained in a single-car collision in Ware Shoals, South Carolina. At the time of his death, Jamie was an employee of Lowe\u2019s Companies, which established an employee accidental death and dismemberment plan with Unum. Nancy Watson \u2014 Jamie\u2019s grandmother\u2014 was designated as sole beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">The traffic report stated that the driver of Jamie\u2019s vehicle was \u201cdriving at a high rate of speed lost control of the vehicle and ran off right side of the roadway striking a ditch which caused the vehicle to overturn and strike two trees.\u201d The toxicology report disclosed that, at the time of the accident, Jamie was driving with a blood alcohol level of .175%.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">Unum denied Watson\u2019s claim for benefits on the grounds that Jamie \u201cdid not sustain an \u2018Injury\u2019 that resulted in a covered loss as defined in the Policy,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>Jamie \u201cdid not sustain an accidental bodily injury that resulted directly and independently of all other causes.\u201d J.A. 151. Unum concluded, instead, that Jamie\u2019s \u201caction of driving while under the influence of alcohol at a blood alcohol level of .175% was deemed to have caused, contributed to or resulted in his motor vehicle accident.\u201d Watson then filed this action in district court alleging that she was denied benefits under the policy in contravention of ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">After a bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of Unum, finding that Unum did not abuse its discretion in deciding that Jamie\u2019s death was not the result of an \u201cinjury\u201d as defined in the policy. We have reviewed the record on appeal, including the district court\u2019s opinion and the parties\u2019 briefs, and have found no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
