Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Tchokonte fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly we cannot grant the relief that she seeks. We further uphold the immigration judge\u2019s determination that Tchokonte\u2019s asylum application was frivolous. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.20 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-18\">Nor can Tehokonte show that she was entitled to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2000). \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-19\">We find Tchokonte\u2019s due process claims to be without merit. We therefore deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b652-15\"> Tehokonte raises no claim on appeal regarding the Convention Against Torture. Therefore, she has abandoned this claim. <em>See United States v. Al-Hamdi, </em>356 F.3d 564, 571 n. 8 (4th Cir.2004); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999). Although Tehokonte seeks to challenge the denial of voluntary departure, \"a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to entertain a request to reinstate voluntary departure.\u201d <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 193 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
