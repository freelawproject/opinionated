Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Petitioners fail to show the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Petitioners cannot meet the higher standard to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">We also conclude Petitioners failed to prove they are entitled to protection under the Convention Against Torture by establishing it is more likely than not they will be subjected to torture upon their return to Cameroon. Based on our review of the record, we find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Petitioners failed to sustain their burden of proof. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2)(2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
