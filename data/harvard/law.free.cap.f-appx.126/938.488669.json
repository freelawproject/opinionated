Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). As the fact-finder, it is the IJ\u2019s duty to determine credibility, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ with respect to credibility findings. <em>See Vasquez-Mondragon v. INS, </em>560 F.2d 1225, 1226 (5th Cir.1977) (citation omitted). The IJ\u2019s factual determination that an alien is not entitled to asylum must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Mazariegos v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). Under this highly deferential standard of review, a denial of asylum may be reversed only if the evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to find that the requisite fear of persecution exists. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815 n. 1, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201cadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is any person who is unwilling to return to his home country or to avail himself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this burden by showing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his or her statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. A \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution may be established based on (1) past persecution that creates a presumption of a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d and by overcoming any rebuttal by the INS; (2) a reasonable possibility of personal persecution that cannot be avoided by relocating within the subject country; or (3) a pattern or practice in the subject country of persecuting members of a statutorily defined group of which the alien is a part. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">On appeal, Ramirez-Cardona argues that the IJ abused his discretion by denying her asylum application because the evidence demonstrated that she had suffered past persecution and had a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her father\u2019s political opinion and opposition to the FARC. More specifically, Ramirez-Cardona asserts that she satisfied her burden to establish statutory eligibility for asylum based on her own testimony, which she states must be accepted as credible because the IJ did not make an adverse credibility finding. Based on this proposition, Ramirez-Cardona further argues that, although the IJ noted her failure to provide medical or police reports to corroborate her claims, the law does not require corroborating evidence when a petitioner\u2019s testimony is found to be credible, which Ramirez-Cardona maintains we must find (based on the lack of an express adverse credibility finding in the IJ\u2019s order).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Ramirez-Cardona failed to demonstrate asylum eligibility because she did not establish that she suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor. Although Ramirez-Car-dona contended that the FARC targeted her family on account of her father\u2019s membership in a community action group and a conservative political group, and the IJ found her testimony to- be credible, she provided <em>no </em>evidence demonstrating that her father expressed his political opinion to the FARC or that the FARC was even aware of his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Although there is some evidence that Ramirez-Cardona\u2019s family was targeted after her father refused to cooperate with FARC guerillas when they requested to store weapons at the father\u2019s house and asked for food and clothing, such evidence, standing alone, is insufficient to satisfy Ramirez-Cardona\u2019s burden. <em>See Sanchez v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004) (finding that petitioner\u2019s claim, based on harassment by FARC guerillas and petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with the guerrillas or to join their forces, did nqt establish persecution for purposes of withholding of removal under INA); <em>see also Perlera-Escobar v. Executive Office for Immigration, </em>894 F.2d 1292, 1296 n. 4 (11th Cir.1990) (noting that this Circuit \u201chas not adopted the ... belief that political neutrality is a political opinion\u201d for purposes of the INA). Ramirez-Cardona has failed to establish that the record compels a finding that the FARC persecuted her, or that she had a well-founded fear of future persecution by the FARC, because of her father\u2019s political opinion, rather than solely on account of his refusal to cooperate. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-8\">. Ramirez-Cardona\u2019s removal proceedings commenced after April 1, 1997, the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRI-RA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996). Accordingly, this case is governed by the permanent provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\u201d), as amended by IIRIRA. <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Balogun v.

Because we find that Ramirez-Cardona has not established a case for asylum, we do not address her arguments that she also satisfied the higher standards for withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>See Najjar v.
