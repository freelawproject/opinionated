Given that no evidence exits that jurors saw Dukes handcuffed, and in light of the district court\u2019s curative instruction, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Dukes\u2019s motion for a mistrial. <em>See United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 441-42 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Honer, </em>225 F.3d 549, 555-56 (5th Cir. 2000); <em>Hardin v. United States, </em>324 F.2d 553, 554 (5th Cir.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Dukes\u2019s argument that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms of cocaine is unavailing. Detective Brittain\u2019s testimony provided evidence of a knowing and voluntary agreement between two or more people to violate federal narcotics laws. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>79 F.3d 413, 423 (5th Cir.1996). Dukes\u2019s argument that the verdict is irreconcilable with the district court\u2019s sentence, which was based on only two kilograms, fails because the Government was not required to prove that Dukes was reasonably capable of producing the cocaine that he agreed to deliver. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>319 F.3d 716, 721-22 (5th Cir. 2003); <em>Gonzales, </em>79 F.3d at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Dukes\u2019s argument that his sentence must be reversed in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is raised for the first time on direct appeal and is, therefore, reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 32, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-520 (5th Cir.2005). Dukes fails to establish plain error because he fails to carry his burden of demonstrating that he would have received a different sentence had he been sentenced under the <em>Booker </em>advisory Guidelines regime rather than the pre<em>Booker </em>mandatory regime. <em>See Mares, 402 F.3d </em>511, 521-522.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">De novo review of Dukes\u2019s argument that the district court erred when it increased his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(b)(l) reveals that it is unavailing in light of Officer Litton\u2019s testimony. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 360-61 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Ortiz-Granados, </em>12 F.3d 39, 42 (5th Cir. 1994). Dukes\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(b)(l) constituted double counting in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause also fails. <em>See United States v. Hudson, </em>522 U.S. 93, 98, 118 S.Ct. 488, 139 L.Ed.2d 450 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
