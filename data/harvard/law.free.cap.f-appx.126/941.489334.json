Stat. \u00a7 760.01 <em>et seq. </em>Record Vol. 4 at Tab 172. Plaintiff now appeals that judgment, contending that material issues of fact preclude summary judgment, and the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-17\">The district court concluded that plaintiff established a prima <em>facie </em>case of age discrimination under the <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), procedural rubric and that defendant had articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its decision to terminate plaintiffs employment. The court then examined the record to determine whether plaintiff had shown defendant\u2019s reason to be a pretext for discrimination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After considering what plaintiff offered on this point, the court concluded that plaintiffs evidence was insufficient to permit a trier of fact to conclude that defendant\u2019s reason for terminating the employment was a \u201cpretext for age discrimination or that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated\u201d defendant to discharge plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-20\">, We find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusions, and we discern no abuse of discretion in its decision denying plaintiffs motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-18\">. Our analysis of the state law age discrimination claim is the same as our analysis of its federal counterpart.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
