Northway\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting, in his opinion, there are no meritorious legal issues but arguing the district court abused its discretion because a sentence within the range established by the Guidelines\u2019 Chapter Seven policy statements would have provided adequate punishment. North-way has been informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. Because our review of the record convinces us the district court did not abuse its discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">We review a district court\u2019s judgment revoking a probation sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Burns v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 216, 222, 53 S.Ct. 154, 77 L.Ed. 266 (1932). Upon finding a probation violation, the district court may revoke probation and resentence the defendant to any sentence within the statutory maximum for the original offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a) (2000); <em>United States v. Schaefer, </em>120 F.3d 505, 507 (4th Cir.1997). Although North-way\u2019s sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum, it did exceed the applicable range under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a) (2003). However, while the applicable sentencing range is one of the factors to be considered, it is advisory only. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B) (2000); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 640-41 (4th Cir.1995). We find the district court properly considered Northway\u2019s need for intensive drug treatment when determining his sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
