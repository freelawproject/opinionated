INS, </em>998 F.2d 231, 234 (4th Cir.1993). A motion to reconsider asserts that the Board made an error in its earlier decision. The motion must \u201cstate the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Such motions are especially disfavored \u201cin a deportation proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-22\">We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and conclude the Board did not abuse its discretion when it found that Yemane failed to establish that the documents she submitted with her motion to reopen were material and previously unavailable. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-23\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
