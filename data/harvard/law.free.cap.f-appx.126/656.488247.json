We have jurisdiction to determine, as a matter of law, whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity, after accepting all of the plaintiffs factual allegations as true, by determining whether those facts show, <em>inter alia, </em>that the defendant\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable under clearly established law at the time of the conduct. <em>E.g., Kinney v. Weaver, </em>367 F.3d 337, 346-50 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). (We need not reach whether Allred reasonably relied on the field test he conducted to determine probable cause.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">The district court ruled that, based upon our court\u2019s precedent, the arrest could not be supported by the probable cause that existed for the traffic violations discovered by Allred before and during his stop of Greenlee\u2019s vehicle. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Devenpeck v. Alford, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,---, 125 S.Ct. 588, 593-95, 160 L.Ed.2d 537 (2004), abrogates our court\u2019s rule that the uncharged offense establishing probable cause be related to, and based upon the same conduct as, the offense identified by the arresting officer at the time of the arrest, <em>see Trejo v. Perez, </em>693 F.2d 482, 485-86 (5th Cir.1982), or given by the officer at booking, <em>see Gassner v. City of Garland, </em>864 F.2d 394, 398 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-17\">Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s determinations in regard to All-red\u2019s summary judgment motion based upon qualified immunity and REMAND the case to the district court for consideration in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Devenpeck. </em>(On remand, should the district court continue to deny qualified immunity and should Allred pursue another interlocutory appeal, the field-test issue <em>not </em>reached in this opinion will be subject to our review, should Allred again present it.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-18\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b689-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
