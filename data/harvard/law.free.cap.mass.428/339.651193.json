The trial judge directed a verdict for Potter. In a special verdict, the jury decided certain claims in favor of Rowe, but also answered that Rowe, as lawyer for the plaintiff, was negligent in representing her in connection with the refinancing of a loan secured by property in Haverhill. That negligence, the jury found, was a substantial contributing cause of certain of the plaintiff\u2019s substantial losses. The jury also found, however, that the plaintiff was negligent in connection with that refinancing and that seventy per cent of all the negligence was hers and thirty per cent was Rowe\u2019s. The judge ordered the entry of judgment for Rowe, applying principles of comparative negligence to deny the plaintiff recovery for Rowe\u2019s malpractice in the refinancing of the Haverhill property. The plaintiff\u2019s principal contention in her appeal, which we transferred here on our own motion, is that comparative fault is inapplicable to her claim against Rowe. We affirm the judgments for Rowe and Potter.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">1. We turn first to the question of the appropriateness of the entry of judgment in favor of Rowe notwithstanding the jury\u2019s special verdict in favor of the plaintiff. In her appeal, the plaintiff does not argue, as she did below, that the evidence was insufficient to submit the question of her contributory fault to the jury. There was evidence that she had substantial experience in real estate matters and was a sophisticated business person.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">In her challenge to the judge\u2019s application of comparative fault principles to her claim against Rowe, the plaintiff runs into an insurmountable barrier. She did not preserve the issue for appellate review. The plaintiff did not object appropriately to the judge\u2019s jury instruction on the application of comparative negligence in this case. Counsel only objected to \u201call instructions on contributory negligence on the basis of our claim that there is insufficient evidence that Mrs. Clark was negligent.\u201d There was no objection to the jury instruction insofar as it announced that the plaintiff\u2019s fault was an element to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\u201cNo party may assign as error the giving or the failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>give an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 51 (b), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). The plaintiff did not present an appropriate objection to the comparative negligence instruction. See <em>Lysak </em>v. <em>Seiler Corp., </em>415 Mass. 625, 629-630 (1993); <em>Coupounas </em>v. <em>Madden, </em>401 Mass. 125, 130 (1987); <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Yurchak, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 371, 379 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The plaintiff moved to expand the record to include her counsels\u2019 recollections of an unrecorded charge conference. See Mass. R. A. P. 8 (e), as amended, 378 Mass. 932 (1979). The trial judge denied the motion. If we were to consider the plaintiff\u2019s proffer, it would not support the conclusion that the purpose of rule 51 (b), to put the judge on notice of the objection, was fairly met or that the objection was conclusively rejected in the charge conference. See <em>Flood </em>v. <em>Southland Corp., </em>416 Mass. 62, 67 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">2. Although the issue was not preserved for appellate review, the question whether comparative fault can properly be considered in a malpractice action against a lawyer is unanswered in this Commonwealth.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issue is fully briefed and likely to arise in other cases. We choose in our discretion to discuss the issue. Moreover, the question of comparative fault comes up in dealing with the judge\u2019s ruling against the plaintiff on her G. L. c. 93A claim against Rowe, a matter we discuss briefly later in this opinion. See note 6, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The fact that a malpractice claim against a lawyer may be viewed as an action in contract does not make contributory fault automatically irrelevant. The standard of care normally applied is whether the lawyer failed to exercise reasonable care and skill in handling the client\u2019s matter, a classical tort negligence standard. See <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>419 Mass. 86, 89 (1994); <em>Colucci </em>v. <em>Rosen, Goldberg, Slavet, Levenson &amp; Wekstein, P.C., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 107, 111 (1987). A malpractice claim does not sound exclusively in either contract or tort. See <em>McStowe </em>v. <em>Bornstein, </em>377 Mass. 804, 807-808 (1979); <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>365 Mass. 83, 85 (1974); 1 R. Mallen &amp; J. Smith, Legal Malpractice \u00a7 8.12, at 601-602 (4th ed. 1996); W.L. Prosser &amp; W.P. Keeton, Torts \u00a7 92, at 660-661 (5th ed. 1984). A lawyer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>negligence may constitute a violation of an implied condition of the contractual relationship between lawyer and client but that does not foreclose the application of contributory fault principles to the client\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">To further her claim that legal malpractice should only be viewed as an action in contract, thereby rendering the application of comparative negligence irrelevant, the plaintiff argues that the economic loss rule precludes viewing malpractice as a tort. We have not applied the economic loss rule to claims of negligence by a fiduciary, such as a lawyer. The rule, which precludes recovery in negligence for purely economic loss, has been applied in very different circumstances. See <em>FMR Corp. </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>415 Mass. 393, 395 (1993) (no recovery in tort for purely economic losses in the absence of harm to plaintiff\u2019s person or property); <em>Bay State-Spray &amp; Provincetown S.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>Caterpillar Tractor Co., </em>404 Mass. 103, 107 (1989) (no recovery in tort for losses caused by engine malfunction); <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos. </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>387 Mass. 889, 893 (1983) (no recovery for loss of business revenue caused by defendant\u2019s negligent collision with bridge causing obstruction of access to plaintiff\u2019s business); <em>New England Power Co. </em>v. <em>Riley Stoker Corp., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 35 (1985); <em>Marcil </em>v. <em>John Deere Indus. Equip. Co., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 625, 631 (1980). When the economic loss rule has been applied, the parties usually were in a position to bargain freely concerning the allocation of risk, and, more importantly, there was no fiduciary relationship. See <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Coakley, </em>243 Mass. 348, 354-355 (1923) (\u201cThe attorney and client do not deal with each other at arms\u2019 length. The client often is in many respects powerless to resist the influence of his attorney\u201d); R. Anderson &amp; W. Steele, Jr., Fiduciary Duty, Tort and Contract: A Primer on the Legal Malpractice Puzzle, 47 S.M.U. L. Rev. 235, 242 (1994) (\u201c[I]n the eyes of the law, fiduciary relationships are never arms length\u201d). The general rule in this country is that the economic loss rule is inapplicable to claims of legal malpractice. See <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Reynard, </em>154 Ill. 2d 48, 50 (1992); <em>Id. </em>at 56 (Miller, C.J., concurring); <em>Resolution Trust Corp. </em>v. <em>Holland &amp; Knight, </em>832 F. Supp. 1528, 1532 (S.D. Fla. 1993) (Florida law). Cf. <em>People Express Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>100 N.J. 246, 263 (1985) (\u201ca defendant owes a duty of care to take reasonable measures to avoid the risk of causing economic damages, aside from physical injury, to particular plaintiffs or plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>comprising an identifiable class [who] defendant knows or has reason to know are likely to suffer such damages from its conduct. A defendant failing to adhere to this duty of care may be found liable for such economic damages proximately caused by its breach of duty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The plaintiff makes a persuasive argument that our comparative negligence statute does not apply to an action based on a claim of financial loss caused by a lawyer\u2019s negligence. That statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, which is set forth in part in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> concerns recovery of damages for negligence \u201cresulting in death or in injury to person or property.\u201d The quoted language is a limitation on the word \u201cdamages.\u201d If the injury to \u201cproperty\u201d included economic loss, little would be left of the limitation in \u00a7 85 that concerns property. Moreover, cases have suggested that pecuniary loss is not injury or damage to property. See <em>Rockwell </em>v. <em>Furness, </em>215 Mass. 557, 558 (1913); <em>Dhanda </em>v. <em>Tri M, Ltd., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 700, 703 (1987) (\u201c[t]hat language [in \u00a7 85] suggests physical harm, rather than economic loss from negligent misrepresentation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The inapplicability of \u00a7 85 to claims of legal malpractice does not dispose of the matter. The question remains whether we would apply the public policy considerations underlying \u00a7 85 to support a common law rule of comparative negligence in a case such as this. See Uniform Comparative Fault Act, 12 U.L.A. \u00a7 1 comment (Master ed. 1996) (\u201cfailure to include these [economic loss] harms specifically in the Act is not intended to preclude application of the general principle to them if a court determines that the common law of the state would make the application\u201d). Many courts in jurisdictions having a comparative negligence statute similar to ours (\u201cdamages . . . resulting in . . . injury to . . . property\u201d) have, expressly or implicitly, without even referring to the statute, recognized that contributory fault properly may apply in a malpractice action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>against a lawyer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We recognize the doctrine of comparative negligence in medical malpractice actions (see <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Chin, </em>405 Mass. 697, 706-708 [1989]), and there is no reason not to do so in legal malpractice actions. See <em>Theobald </em>v. <em>Byers, </em>193 Cal. App. 2d 147, 150 (1961) (\u201cDoctors and dentists are held to this higher standard of care and their services can also be said to be of a fiduciary and confidential nature. Hence it would seem clear that similar rules of law would be applicable to all three professions\u201d); <em>Lyle, Siegel, Croshaw &amp; Beale, P.C. </em>v. <em>Tidewater Capital Corp., </em>249 Va. 426, 432 (1995) (\u201cWith respect to contributory negligence, we discern no logical reason for treating differently legal malpractice and medical malpractice actions.\u201d); <em>Cicorelli </em>v. <em>Capobianco, </em>90 A.D.2d 524, 524 (N.Y. 1982), aff'd, 59 N.Y.2d 626 (1983) (\u201c[T]he courts of this State have recognized that both physicians and attorneys may plead subsequent negligence by other parties as a mitigating factor\u201d). Cf. <em>Somma </em>v. <em>Gracey, </em>15 Conn. App. 371, 378 (1988) (\u201c[w]e see no basis for distinguishing between actions for legal malpractice and other claims sounding in negligence\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 76 comment d (Tent. Draft No. 8, 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Comparative fault appropriately applies to a client\u2019s claim of malpractice by a lawyer. See <em>Pinkham </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>933 F.2d 1066, 1073 (1st Cir. 1991) (\u201c[a]ll of the courts that have considered the issue have held that the defense of contributory negligence applies in legal malpractice actions, despite the fiduciary nature of the attorney-client relationship\u201d). The limitations on recovery stated in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, appropriately guide us to adopt them as a common law rule. Because the plaintiff\u2019s negligence exceeded that of the defendant Rowe, the judge was correct in entering judgment for Rowe on the count alleging malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">3. The plaintiff challenges the judge\u2019s order dismissing her count alleging that Rowe violated his fiduciary duty as a lawyer. When the judge announced that, in her opinion, any breach of fiduciary duty would be duplicative of the malpractice claim and thus the breach of fiduciary duty count should be dismissed, counsel for the plaintiff did not object.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When the judge instructed the jury on contributory fault and sought a special verdict on contributory fault, the plaintiff did not object that contributory fault was inapplicable to that aspect of her claim that was founded on a non-negligent breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff simply did not preserve for appellate review the propriety of the dismissal of her breach of fiduciary duty claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">We add that there are bases for the civil liability of a lawyer apart from a claim of malpractice. Intentional breaches of fiduciary duties, such as the misappropriation of funds, surely can be a basis for attorney liability. Breaches of client confidences, inappropriate conflicts of interest, and the use of advantages arising out of the client-lawyer relationship may be intentional wrongs or may be negligent acts depending on the circumstances. If a breach of one of these fiduciary duties is a substantial cause of injury to the client, the lawyer could be liable to the client. We need not decide the extent to which, if at all, the client\u2019s negligence in particular circumstances would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>reduce or eliminate the client\u2019s right to recover damages for the lawyer\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">4. We come finally to the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the judge erred in directing verdicts for the defendant Potter. The plaintiff claimed that Potter, acting for the bank that refinanced the loan on the Haverhill property, violated his fiduciary duty to her and was negligent. She also claimed that she reasonably relied to her detriment on Potter to monitor and approve the distribution of loan funds as advances for construction on the Haverhill property. The judge directed verdicts for Potter, concluding that Potter did not owe the plaintiff any fiduciary duty or any duty to monitor disbursements from the loan account.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The evidence, taken most favorably to the plaintiff, fails to show, or to warrant an inference of, a fiduciary or special relationship between Potter, as agent for the lender, and the plaintiff, as borrower. See <em>Broomfield </em>v. <em>Kosow, </em>349 Mass. 749, 755 (1965). Potter, as an agent of a disclosed principal, cannot be liable on the contractual theory of detrimental reliance. See <em>Loranger Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>E.F. Hauserman Co., 376 </em>Mass. 757, 761 (1978); <em>Porshin </em>v. <em>Snider, </em>349 Mass. 653, 655 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">As to the negligence count, Potter, as the lender\u2019s agent, owed no duty of care to the plaintiff borrower. See <em>Shawmut Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Wayman, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 20, 24 (1993). Any duty of the lender under the loan agreement to monitor the account was for its benefit and was waivable by it. The loan agreement stated that \u201cthe Bank shall always have the right to make an advance . . . without satisfaction of each and every condition set forth herein upon the Bank\u2019s obligation to make an advance under this Agreement; and the Borrower agrees to accept any advance which the Bank may elect to make under this Agreement.\u201d See <em>In re Fordham, </em>130 B.R. 632, 646 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1991).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The loan agreement, absent any claim of fraud, superseded any earlier understandings. See <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Riemer, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 364 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\"> The opinion in <em>Salisbury </em>v. <em>Gourgas, </em>10 Met. 442, 443 (1845), sets forth facts that might have constituted a client\u2019s contributory fault, but the court does not discuss, much less decide, the significance of contributory fault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\"> General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 85, as relevant here, states: \u201cContributory negligence shall not bar recovery in any action by any person or legal representative to recover damages for negligence <em>resulting in death or in injury to person or property, </em>if such negligence was not greater than the total amount of negligence attributable to the person or persons against whom recovery is sought, but any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person for whose injury, damage or death recovery is made\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b368-5\"> Statutes using similar language to that appearing in G.
