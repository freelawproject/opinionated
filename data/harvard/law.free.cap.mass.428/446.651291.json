L. c. 265, \u00a7 1) on the theory of deliberate premeditation. The victim was his twenty-four year old girl friend. The cause of death was a wound to the left side of her head from a gun fired at close range. The defense was that the gun had discharged accidentally.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant claims that the judge erred in failing to instruct the jury on manslaughter as a lesser included offense, despite his trial counsel\u2019s express request that the jury be instructed on the two degrees of murder only. He also contends that inferences argued by the prosecutor in his closing argument were not supported by the evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>were so prejudicial as to require a new trial. We affirm the conviction, and see no reason to grant any relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">1. The jury permissibly could have found the following facts. The defendant first met the victim when he was twenty and she was fourteen years old. Over the ensuing ten years, they had a tumultuous, on-again-off-again relationship. The couple moved into an apartment together in April, 1994. On the evening of June 25, 1994, the defendant and the victim attended a festival in Gloucester. During the course of the evening they both consumed alcohol, and at some point they began to argue. They returned home. A neighbor heard them arguing before they entered their building, and heard the argument escalate over the next several hours. He could hear the couple clearly. Later that night, the victim spoke to her mother on three separate occasions, using a telephone in the kitchen. During the first and last conversations, the victim\u2019s mother could also hear the defendant; the victim informed her that the speaker of the telephone extension in the bedroom was activated. Neither the victim\u2019s mother nor the neighbor heard the victim or the defendant mention suicide or a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The victim\u2019s mother and neighbor both heard, but could not see, the last moments of the victim\u2019s fife. Shortly before she was shot, the victim had agreed to leave the apartment with her mother, who had said she would come within forty-five minutes. The defendant was aware that the victim had decided to leave that night. The victim\u2019s mother then heard a bang, which the neighbor also heard; both believed that it was a gunshot. For ten to fifteen seconds before she heard the shot, the victim\u2019s mother was listening to her daughter on the telephone but could no longer hear any sounds from the defendant. Immediately after hearing the shot, the mother heard a thump, the sound of the telephone dropping, and the defendant yelling to call an ambulance. The defendant ran onto the apartment balcony, and the neighbor heard him shouting: \u201cI shot her. I shot her. Somebody call the ambulance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Two police officers reached the scene a few minutes later. They broke down the apartment door and found the defendant kneeling over the body of the victim, repeating, \u201cBreathe, breathe. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The victim was still breathing, but had no pulse. The officers recovered a revolver approximately three feet from the victim\u2019s body. An ambulance took the victim to a hospital, where she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>The defendant gave several statements to the police, after receiving Miranda warnings and waiving his rights on each occasion. The defendant told police officers that immediately before the shooting, the victim had been holding the gun and threatening to kill herself. He said he approached her, demanding that she put the gun down, then tackled her in an attempt to take the gun away. As they fell to the ground, he said, he seized the gun but accidentally depressed the trigger, shooting the victim in the head. The defendant gave conflicting reports about the location of the gun before the argument began, and could not account for how or when the victim had obtained it. He also told the officers that he and the victim had been arguing furiously, and that when they arrived at the apartment, the victim started \u201cthrowing punches\u201d and \u201cscreaming\u201d at him. The gun was fired less than three to six inches from the victim\u2019s left temple, at an upward angle. The victim was right-handed. No physical evidence supported the defendant\u2019s contention that the victim had been holding the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">2. During a conference at the close of the evidence, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel requested that the judge instruct the jury on the degrees of murder only.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The prosecutor concurred, stating that in his view the evidence would not support a manslaughter conviction. The judge agreed, and instructed the jury on murder in the first degree on the theory of deliberate premeditation and on murder in the second degree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardone, </em>406 Mass. 123 (1989), the defendant now claims that the evidence would have supported a conviction of manslaughter had the jurors found that the unlawful killing \u201carose from the frailty of human nature, as in instances of sudden passion induced by reasonable provocation [or] sudden combat,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 130-131, and that, despite the defendant\u2019s request to the contrary, the judge should have instructed on manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">We infer in this case that the judge did not give an instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>on manslaughter at least in part because he agreed with the prosecutor that the evidence did not support it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree with that assessment of the evidence. \u201cA jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter is warranted \u2018if there is evidence of provocation deemed adequate in law to cause the accused to lose his self-control in the heat of passion, and if the killing followed the provocation before sufficient time had elapsed for the accused\u2019s temper to cool.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seabrooks, </em>425 Mass. 507, 514 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schnopps, </em>383 Mass. 178, 180 (1981), <em>S.C., </em>390 Mass. 722 (1984). In deciding whether the evidence might have supported a manslaughter instruction, we draw all reasonable inferences in the defendant\u2019s favor, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nichypor, </em>419 Mass. 209, 216 (1994), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanderpool, 367 </em>Mass. 743, 746 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The defendant recognizes that a heated oral argument that escalated during the course of the evening, without more, does not constitute adequate provocation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seabrooks, supra </em>at 514-515. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrion, </em>407 Mass. 263, 267 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>401 Mass. 627, 632 (1988), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zukoski, </em>370 Mass. 23, 28 (1976) (\u201c[ijnsults and quarreling alone cannot provide a reasonable provocation\u201d). To support his theory of provocation, he points to evidence of a physical struggle with the victim, noting that there was disarray in the apartment and that the victim had been \u201cthrowing punches\u201d at him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He adds that the jury could have found, as the prosecutor had argued, that the defendant \u201chad no control over his temper\u201d and that he acted \u201cin a rage at the time of the shooting.\u201d The intensity and the duration of the argument, he claims, warranted a voluntary manslaughter instruction. We disagree. Even if we \u201ctreatfl the defendant\u2019s story, regardless of its credibility, as if it were entirely true,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>387 Mass. 220, 227 (1982), his story does not recount provocation adequate in law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619, 629 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>380 Mass. 724, 727 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Here there was scant evidence that the victim had attacked the defendant or struck any blows,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and there is no evidence that any punches thrown by the victim caused the defendant to attack the victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, supra </em>at 629 n.6 (\u201c[ejven when the victim strikes a blow, a heat of passion voluntary manslaughter instruction is not always required\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garabedian, </em>399 Mass. 304, 314 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 227 (evidence that victim choked husband with shirt insufficient to require manslaughter instruction when husband had stabbed her twenty-seven times); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zukoski, </em>370 Mass. 23, 29 (1976) (victim throwing glass at defendant not reasonable provocation to trigger his kicking her to death, especially since threat from thrown glass had passed); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszewski, </em>363 Mass. 311, 321 (1973) (suggestion that scratches inflicted on defendant by his wife could serve as provocation for ferocious yet \u201cmalice-free\u201d attack by defendant with deadly instrument was \u201cextravagant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Moreover, as the defendant described the events, there was more than sufficient time for the defendant to \u201ccool off\u201d between his alleged physical confrontation with the victim and the time that the victim was shot. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>366 Mass. 705, 707-708, 715 (1975). In his statements to the police, the defendant said that the victim had been \u201cthrowing punches\u201d at him before he initiated the first telephone call to the victim\u2019s mother. That call occurred several hours before the killing. He also said he went into the bedroom and listened \u201cfor a while\u201d to the last conversation before returning to the kitchen. The judge was entirely correct to conclude that the evidence did not support a manslaughter instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">3. The defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper because he used inferences, not supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>by the evidence, that were prejudicial to the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument to which the defendant objects was a narration of the minutes preceding the shooting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">\u201cSo, he went into the bedroom in a rage, I suggest to you, but with that focus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">\u201c \u2018You want to leave? You\u2019ll leave. But you\u2019ll leave on your back.\u2019 And he got that gun, in that rage, in that anger, with the intention of killing [the victim], because look at this: He went first into the bedroom; he pulled this loaded gun out of the holster; he walked back into the kitchen; he pointed it at her head; three inches away, he pulled the trigger. His intention could not have been anything else. It was not accidental. It was not in [the victim\u2019s] hand. It was an execution. He did it on purpose. He thought about it before he did it.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The defendant argues that there was no evidence proving that the defendant had left the kitchen to retrieve a gun from the bedroom, or that he had returned to the kitchen with a loaded gun. Arguments that are unsupported by the evidence are improper, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. 838, 853 (1984); however, the inferences that the prosecutor drew of the defendant\u2019s actions immediately before the shooting were not inappropriate. The defendant\u2019s story was that the victim had held the gun and threatened to shoot herself, and that he had attempted to wrestle the gun from her. But the prosecutor\u2019s story was consistent with a different view of the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>411 Mass. 120, 121 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Travis, </em>408 Mass. 1, 11-12 (1990). The defendant told the police that he kept the loaded gun in the bedroom. He said that he sometimes cleaned his gun in the kitchen, but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the gun was always unloaded when he cleaned it. He gave conflicting statements about when he had last cleaned the gun,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and he could not explain why the loaded gun might have been left in the kitchen, or how the victim came to possess the weapon. There was no physical evidence linking the victim to the gun, and neither the victim\u2019s mother nor the neighbor heard the victim speak of a gun or of killing herself. For ten to fifteen seconds immediately preceding the shooting, the victim\u2019s mother no longer could hear the defendant. The evidence was adequate to support an inference that, immediately before the shooting, the defendant had retrieved the loaded gun from the bedroom.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that, prior to the shooting, the defendant had been thinking: \u201cYou want to leave? You\u2019ll leave. But you\u2019ll leave on your back,\u201d is argument of a different order. There was no testimony at trial that this was the defendant\u2019s state of mind. Nor is it the kind of \u201centhusiastic rhetoric\u201d that we have tolerated. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>427 Mass. 336, 350 (1998). It was entirely unnecessary: the Commonwealth\u2019s case against the defendant was strong, and the evidence before the jury, together with the prosecutor\u2019s reasonable inferences, if accepted, was sufficient to establish murder in the first degree. The statement should not have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">. The vengeful sentiment attributed by the prosecutor to the defendant nevertheless may not be unduly prejudicial if cured by adequate instructions to the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 500 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>416 Mass. 347, 352 n.5 (1993). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>374 Mass. 466, 470-471 (1978). While he did not comment on the specific objections raised by defense counsel, the judge did tell the jury more than once that counsels\u2019 closing arguments were not evidence, and that the jury were to test the arguments against their own recollection of the evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We may rely on the jury\u2019s ability to distinguish hyperbole, and their attention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the judge\u2019s instructions, to cure otherwise prejudicial errors in arguments. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, supra </em>at 495. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 350 (jury is assumed to have a \u201ccertain measure of sophistication\u201d). Curative instructions have insulated far more egregious imaginary sentiments and appeals to jury sympathy from reversible error. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McColl, </em>375 Mass. 316, 324-325 (1978) (prosecutor outlines imaginary conversation between defense counsel and defendant about construction of insanity defense). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, supra </em>at 494, 501, 503 (repeated references to homicide victim\u2019s age and pregnant status would not have been reversible given stronger Commonwealth case and more specific curative instructions).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">We view with disfavor unnecessary and hyperbolic embellishments in prosecutorial closing arguments. We expect prosecutors to present their closing arguments on the basis of the evidence presented, and reasonable inferences drawn from that evidence. Evaluating whether an improper statement was prejudicial to a defendant, when we have access to a written transcript only, is a difficult task that need not occur if counsel adhere to our clear guidelines on this subject. The Commonwealth\u2019s prosecutors should avoid engaging in inappropriate rhetoric that requires us to undertake this kind of analysis. In this case we are confident, in light of the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case against the defendant<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the instructions of the judge, that the isolated improper statement by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>prosecutor was not unduly prejudicial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>427 Mass. 26, 30 (1998), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nadworny, </em>396 Mass. 342, 354 (1985), cert. denied, 477 U.S. 904 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>373 Mass. 329, 341 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">4. The defendant asks that we reduce or reverse the verdict pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. He suggests that the jury may have been reluctant to acquit him in view of the compelling evidence against him, but had no option to find him guilty of manslaughter. He argues that his consumption of alcohol on the night of the shooting, and his lack of a substantial prior criminal record, are mitigating factors that we should consider in his favor. We have already concluded that the evidence did not require a manslaughter instruction. We have considered his other arguments and conducted our own review of the entire proceedings. We are not convinced that the verdict is unjustly severe, and we decline to exercise our extraordinary power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\"> The judge inquired of counsel, \u201cHow many variations of homicide should be presented to the jury?\u201d Defense counsel replied: \u201cYour Honor, as far as the defendant is concerned, neither one. . . . You have to give the second-degree instruction. Other than that, we aren\u2019t requesting any further instructions.\u201d Defense counsel did not explain why he sought no other homicide instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b472-8\"> The prosecutor informed the judge: \u201cI don\u2019t think the evidence fairly suggests manslaughter.\u201d The judge responded: \u201cBoth sides having requested that I give just murder one and murder two, that\u2019s what I will do. By the way, I don\u2019t think that that is an unreasonable position for either side to take.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b473-6\"> See note 2, <em>supra. </em>Earlier, in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty, the judge stated: \u201cI think that the evidence is sufficient to permit the jury to consider both a charge of murder in the first degree and a charge of murder in the second degree. So, I will deny the motion for a required finding.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\"> The defendant also told a police officer that at some point the victim \u201cstarted pounding him with her fists\u201d and that she had been \u201cthrowing whacks at [him] and started screaming.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b474-8\"> The defendant argues that the jury \u201ccould very well have found\u201d that the victim initiated the physical confrontation described by the defendant. Even if initiated by the victim, the physical confrontation that he described took place several hours before the shooting. The disarray, in the apartment and the \u201cclump of hair\u201d that had been ripped from the victim\u2019s head is evidence of a physical struggle between the defendant and the victim, but does not point to any provocation by the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\"> Following the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, the defendant moved for a mistrial on the grounds that the inferences the prosecutor drew were not supported by the evidence and were inflammatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\"> Earlier in his closing statement the prosecutor had argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">\u201cI suggest to you that the evidence builds and increases in intensity until that point, just before 3 a.m. when he went into the other room, and he picked up his gun, and he walked back into the kitchen, with the intention of shooting [the victim]. And, without a word, he silently walked into that kitchen, raised the gun, and shot her in the head.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> After the defendant had made at least four statements to the police about the gun, he said he then recalled that he had taken it out to polish it on the afternoon before the shooting. He did not say that he had left the gun in the kitchen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\"> In denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the judge also concluded that the evidence supported a \u201creasonable inference\u201d that the defendant had walked into the bedroom and then returned with a gun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\"> The judge addressed the subject several times. Before the evidence was presented, he told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agr-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u201cThe closing arguments are an opportunity for the attorneys to marshal the evidence, to put it together, to summarize it which, they hope, will be persuasive to you of their particular side\u2019s point of view. Keep in mind though, again, and I will mention this at the time of closing: When you hear a closing, the attorneys are not witnesses; they are not able to add any facts beyond that which is supported by the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">He gave similar instructions following the presentation of the evidence, and before closing arguments were made. On that occasion, he admonished the jury: \u201c[Wjhen you hear the summary of the evidence, from the attorneys, it is just a summary of the evidence. The attorneys are not witnesses. And if they unintentionally add a fact that is not supported by the evidence, you should disregard that fact.\u201d He repeated the instructions after the closing argument and after defense counsel\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b477-8\"> The defendant argues that the evidence against him was \u201cfar from overwhelming\u201d because, he claims, he told the police from the outset that the shooting was accidental. We disagree. Two witnesses \u2014 the victim\u2019s mother and the neighbor \u2014 overheard the last minutes before the victim was shot. Both testified that the statements the defendant attributed to the victim about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>killing herself had not been uttered, nor did they hear any sounds of a struggle or statements of the defendant attempting to gain possession of the gun.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
