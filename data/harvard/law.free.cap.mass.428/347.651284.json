Wyatt, filed a petition pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9, seeking to be discharged from his commitment to the Massachusetts Treatment Center (center)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as a sexually dangerous person.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 8, 1998, after a six-day trial, a jury in the Superior Court found that the petitioner is not sexually dangerous, as defined by G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That same day, a judge in the Superior Court entered a judgment ordering him discharged from custody on April 21, 1998.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On April 15, 1998, the Commonwealth filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>alternative, a new trial, and a motion to stay the petitioner\u2019s discharge pending resolution of its posttrial motions and appeal. On April 16, 1998, the judge denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">On April 17, 1998, the Commonwealth petitioned a single justice of the Appeals Court for a stay pending appeal, or for a temporary stay pending resolution of its motion for a stay pending appeal. The single justice stayed the petitioner\u2019s discharge pending appeal or further order of the Appeals Court. On April 23, 1998, the Commonwealth filed in the Appeals Court a <em>notice of </em>appeal from the denial of its posttrial motion and from the judgment entered in favor of the petitioner. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for direct appellate review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We find no error in the judge\u2019s rulings, and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">1. We summarize the relevant facts in evidence, reserving for later discussion additional evidence in connection with the issues raised. In 1974, the petitioner was convicted of indecent assault and battery for forcing a thirteen year old boy to perform oral sex on him and to submit while the petitioner performed oral sex on the boy. The petitioner was sentenced to a two-year term of imprisonment in a house of correction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The record does not reflect on what date or on what terms he was released from imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">On July 20, 1979, the petitioner pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. The petitioner had forced a sixteen year old boy to perform oral sex on him. He was sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment of from three to five years, the sentence to be served in the Hampshire County house of correction. Ten days after he was released on parole from that sentence, the petitioner committed further sexual offenses. Specifically, on February 15, 1983, the petitioner pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with three counts of rape of a child by force, and one count each of assault by means of a dangerous weapon and kidnapping. The petitioner had forced a fourteen year old boy to perform oral sex on him and to submit while he performed oral sex on the boy. The petitioner was sentenced to concurrent terms of from eight to twelve years for each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>rape of a child and kidnapping convictions, and a concurrent term of not more than five and not less than three years for the assault conviction, at Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Cedar Junction.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">After his 1983 convictions, upon the Commonwealth\u2019s petition pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 6, a judge in the Superior Court determined the petitioner to be a sexually dangerous person (SDP). On December 20, 1983, the judge committed the petitioner to the center for a minimum of one day and a maximum of life. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 5. The petitioner\u2019s criminal sentence was completed on December 1, 1993. He has remained in custody at the center since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">2. As a threshold issue, we address the petitioner\u2019s claim that the Commonwealth may not appeal a judgment entered upon a jury\u2019s determination that a petitioner is not sexually dangerous.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Hill, petitioner, </em>422 Mass. 147, cert, denied, 519 U.S. 867 (1996), we considered the Commonwealth\u2019s right to appeal a judge\u2019s determination that a petitioner was no longer sexually dangerous, and concluded that neither double jeopardy nor substantive due process concerns prevented the appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 151, 155.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We stated, in dicta, that allowing the Commonwealth to invoke appellate review of an adjudication of sexual dangerousness was \u201cparticularly appropriate where the right to a trial by jury is not implicated and the appellate process does not trench on a jury\u2019s historic preserve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155. Relying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>that dicta, the petitioner argues that the Commonwealth may not seek review of a jury\u2019s adjudication of sexual dangerousness. That determination, he says, is analogous to an acquittal by a jury in a criminal trial, from which the Commonwealth could not appeal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">We consistently have declined to equate civil hearings held pursuant to G. L. c. 123A with proceedings that result in criminal sanctions. <em>Hill, petitioner, supra </em>at 153 (double jeopardy not implicated in \u00a7 9 proceedings because statute does not intend or impose punishment); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barboza, </em>387 Mass. 105, 111-113, cert, denied, 459 U.S. 1020 (1982) (not all due process procedures applicable to criminal proceedings required in G. L. c. 123A proceedings). See <em>Sheridan, petitioner, </em>422 Mass. 776, 779 (1996), and cases cited. There is no reason why the Commonwealth\u2019s right to appeal a determination of sexual dangerousness should depend on whether the determination is made by a judge or jury. Our reasoning in <em>Hill, supra, </em>that G. L. c. 123A is not punitive, applies with equal force to all determinations of sexual dangerousness; the trier of fact does not change the nature of the proceedings. Were we to rule otherwise, a petitioner challenging his continuing confinement in the center might invoke his statutory right to a trial by jury for the sole purpose of defeating the Commonwealth\u2019s right of appeal. Neither the statutory scheme nor any concerns of due process warrant that result. The Commonwealth may appeal from any ruling or judgment adverse to it in a c. 123A proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">3. The Commonwealth contends that the judge erroneously instructed the jury that the petitioner was presumed not to be a sexually dangerous person.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Commonwealth takes issue with the instructions on two grounds. First, it says, the judge concluded that his instruction on presumption was \u201cconstitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ally required.\u201d The judge reached no such conclusion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He correctly determined that he was required to instruct the jury that the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person is sexually dangerous. <em>Andrews, petitioner, </em>368 Mass. 468, 489 (1975). He then instructed the jury on the presumption because, in his view, it \u201cis part of the standard charge on proof beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d and \u201c[wjithout reference in some form of words to the presumption of innocence, it is questionable whether a charge on proof beyond a reasonable doubt would pass muster.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge believed the instruction was necessary to give meaning to, and to focus the jury\u2019s attention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>on, the requirement that the Commonwealth had the burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a petitioner is sexually dangerous. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>367 Mass. 169, 188 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Second, the Commonwealth argues that it was \u201cper se\u201d prejudicial error for the judge to give the challenged instruction because the instruction \u201cessentially negated\u201d the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence of the petitioner\u2019s prior adjudication as an SDP and his prior misdeeds. We disagree. The judge carefully explained to the jury the elements of sexual dangerousness, and the nature of the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Regarding the first element, the petitioner\u2019s prior adjudication as an SDP, the judge informed the jury that \u201cthe parties have stipulated that [the petitioner] was committed as \u00e1 sexually dangerous person pursuant to Chapter 123A, on December 20, 1983.\u201d He thereby told the jury that the Commonwealth had met its burden of proof as to that element. Moreover, the jury were well aware from repeated mention of the fact throughout trial that the petitioner previously had been adjudicated an SDP. The claim that the judge\u2019s instruction on a presumption negated that evidence is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">As to the petitioner\u2019s prior misdeeds, the jury considered extensive written and testimonial evidence of his previous crimes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Commonwealth also described the petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>criminal history in considerable detail in closing argument. The judge then instructed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">\u201cin deciding the likelihood that [the petitioner] will attack or inflict injury, you are free to draw inferences based on [the petitioner\u2019s] past sexual misconduct and the testimony of the experts. Chapter 123A does not require evidence of contemporaneous or recent sexual misconduct indicating sexual dangerousness or indeed any evidence of sexual misconduct while in a secure environment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The judge\u2019s instruction correctly made clear to the jury that they could and should consider the evidence of the petitioner\u2019s past sexual misconduct and could draw inferences based on that misconduct. In light of his explicit charge to the jury, and the extensive evidence regarding petitioner\u2019s earlier misdeeds, we conclude that the instruction on a presumption did not negate the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The Commonwealth also argues that the judge erroneously instructed the jury to determine whether the petitioner \u201cis\u201d sexually dangerous, rather than whether he \u201cremains\u201d sexually dangerous.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This instruction, it claims, also prevented the jury from considering the petitioner\u2019s prior adjudication as an SDP. General Laws c. 123 A, \u00a7 9, states that, \u201c[u]nless the trier of fact finds that such person <em>remains </em>a sexually dangerous person, it shall order such person to be discharged from the treatment center\u201d (emphasis supplied). In <em>Hill, petitioner, supra </em>at 156, we confirmed that the Commonwealth \u201cbears the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner continues to be an SDP at the time of the section nine hearing.\u201d See <em>Page </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 384, 387 (1982) (petitioner must be found sexually dangerous at time of hearing). The judge instructed the jury that the petition \u201craises the issue of whether today [the petitioner] is a sexually dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>person.\u201d He instructed them to \u201cfocus on the here and now,\u201d observing that \u201c[t]he Commonwealth bears the burden of proving that at this time [the petitioner] is a sexually dangerous person. . . .\u201d Although an instruction that mirrored the statutory language would also suffice, the judge correctly instructed the jury to focus on the petitioner\u2019s present condition. The jury could not have determined that the petitioner no longer \u201cremains\u201d sexually dangerous without concluding that he \u201cis\u201d not sexually dangerous. See <em>Gagnon, petitioner, </em>416 Mass. 775, 778 (1994), quoting <em>Davis, petitioner, </em>383 Mass. 645, 649-650 (1981) (\u201c[proceedings under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9, are to determine the single issue whether or not the petitioner is a sexually dangerous person\u201d). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">4. The Commonwealth argues that it is entitled to a new trial because the judge erroneously admitted in evidence testimony regarding the adequacy of treatment available to the petitioner and the conditions of confinement at the center. Any such evidence, it claims, is irrelevant to a determination of the petitioner\u2019s sexual dangerousness. We have reviewed the entire record, paying close attention to the evidence to which the Commonwealth takes exception, and conclude that no evidence was improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The Commonwealth sought to prove that the petitioner remains a sexually dangerous person because he had refused to participate in certain treatment. The Commonwealth elicited testimony from its three experts that the petitioner\u2019s refusal to participate in the treatment was an important factor contributing to the opinion of each. The Commonwealth repeated this theme in its opening statement and closing argument. In response, the petitioner sought to explain his refusal to participate, and to counter the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that his refusal was evidence of his continuing sexual dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">\u201cWhether evidence is relevant is a question \u2018addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 477 (1991), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>386 Mass. 466, 469 (1982), and cases cited. \u201cThe issue of \u2018relevancy is \u201ca matter on which the opinion of the trial judge will be accepted on review except for palpable error.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Booker, supra </em>at 470, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 463 (1981). We evaluate whether the admission of the challenged testimony constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>palpable error. Section 9 hearings \u201care to determine the single issue whether or not the petitioner is a sexually dangerous person . . . [and] should be restricted to the sole issue for which they were intended.\u201d <em>Gagnon, petitioner, supra </em>at 778, quoting <em>Davis, petitioner, supra </em>at 649-650. The judge adhered to that admonishment, and admitted evidence regarding the adequacy of petitioner\u2019s treatment only when it countered the Commonwealth\u2019s theory.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The Commonwealth called three expert witnesses: Dr. William Meadows, a forensic psychologist at the center and a member of the Community Access Board<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>; Dr. Don Greif, a clinical psychologist and qualified examiner<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>; and Dr. Ira Sil-verman, a forensic psychologist and qualified examiner. All three opined that the petitioner remains sexually dangerous. The petitioner\u2019s refusal to participate in treatment at the center contributed to each expert\u2019s opinion. The petitioner countered the expert opinions by vigorously cross-examining the expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>witnesses,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and through the testimony of Paula Erickson, a former therapist at the center.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>\u2019 <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Commonwealth sought to exclude her testimony, claiming that she would testify to <em>\u201ca </em>conspiracy theory of incredible proportions dealing with the treatment center.\u201d The judge limited Erickson\u2019s testimony to \u201cher involvement with [the petitioner] as far as treatment is concerned . . . [and] the types of treatment actually provided during the times that she was at the center.\u201d The judge emphasized: \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean by vast conspiracy theory. But obviously I\u2019m not going to let her have carte blanche just to criticize the institution that she may have disagreed with.\u201d Similarly, the judge \u201cconstrain[ed] [the petitioner\u2019s attorney] not to go into questions of opinion from Ms. Erickson,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>and permitted her to \u201cdeal with factual matters in which she was involved\u201d only.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Evidence introduced by the Commonwealth was hotly contested. The judge remained alert to the requirement that the trial was to determine a \u201csingle issue,\u201d the petitioner\u2019s sexual dangerousness. <em>Gagnon, petitioner, supra </em>at 778, quoting <em>Davis, petitioner, supra </em>at 649-650. He kept a tight rein on petitioner\u2019s counsel, making clear that he would not tolerate efforts to attack the conditions at the center or the viability of treatment programs unless they were probative of the petitioner\u2019s sexual dangerousness. The Commonwealth\u2019s argument rests in large measure on its contention that the judge improperly permitted the petitioner to present a \u201cconstitutional\u201d challenge to his commitment. See <em>Gagnon, petitioner, supra </em>(\u00a7 9 hearing is not appropriate forum in which to make constitutional challenge to petitioner\u2019s commitment to center). The judge effectively countered that claim.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We conclude that the judge committed no error in determining that certain, but not all, of the petitioner\u2019s proffered evidence regarding the adequacy of his treatment and his conditions of confinement was relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The Commonwealth contends that, even if such evidence was relevant, its probative value was far outweighed by its prejudicial impact on the jury. It points to counsel\u2019s opening statement and closing argument that the petitioner was being held in a penal rather than a remedial facility. At trial the Commonwealth objected to counsel\u2019s opening statement because it was argumentative, not because counsel described the prison-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>like conditions at the center. It also did not object on these grounds to his closing argument. In any event, we do not accept the Commonwealth\u2019s characterization that the judge permitted the petitioner to claim \u201cin essence\u201d that he should be released because of the conditions in the center. To the contrary, the judge carefully instructed the jury that they were to determine whether the petitioner is sexually dangerous, \u201cregardless of any opinion you may have as to the adequacy or the appropriateness of the treatment being offered to [petitioner] at the Center and regardless of any opinion you may have as to whether [petitioner] is being offered the best kind of treatment and regardless of any opinion you may have as to the environment or staff of the Center.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We presume that the jury followed the judge\u2019s instructions. See <em>Mailman\u2019s Steam Carpet Cleaning Corp. </em>v. <em>Lizotte, </em>415 Mass. 865, 870 (1993), citing <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Raymark Indus., Inc., </em>401 Mass. 586, 590 (1988); <em>Saragan </em>v. <em>Bousquet, </em>322 Mass. 14, 20 (1947). We are satisfied that the judge appropriately limited the evidence to testimony relevant to a determination of the petitioner\u2019s sexual dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">5. Finally, the Commonwealth argues that a new trial should be granted because the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It asserts that it presented uncontroverted and \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence of the petitioner\u2019s sexual dangerousness, and that there was \u201calmost no\u201d evidence to the contrary. The denial of a motion for a new trial \u201con the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence rests in the discretion of the judge.\u201d <em>Turnpike Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Newbury Group, Inc., </em>413 Mass. 119, 127 (1992), quoting <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Gaston Snow &amp; Ely Bartlett, </em>404 Mass. 515, 520, cert, denied, 493 U.S. 894 (1989), quoting <em>Bergdoll </em>v. <em>Suprynowicz, </em>359 Mass. 173, 175 (1971). \u201c[A] judge should exercise this discretion only when the verdict \u2018is so greatly against the weight of the evidence as to induce in his mind the strong belief that it was not due to a careful consideration of the evidence, but that it was the product <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>of bias, misapprehension or prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Scannell </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>208 Mass. 513, 514 (1911). We will disturb a judge\u2019s denial of a new trial only if the judge has abused his discretion. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Gaston Snow &amp; Ely Bartlett, supra </em>at 520-521.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The Commonwealth had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner remains a sexually dangerous person under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9. <em>Andrews, petitioner, supra </em>at 489-490. The petitioner need not produce any evidence that he no longer is sexually dangerous, and the Commonwealth\u2019s argument \u2014 to the extent that it rests on a claim to the contrary \u2014 fails.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMinico, </em>408 Mass. 230, 235 (1990). The Commonwealth sought to prove the petitioner\u2019s sexual dangerousness through the testimony of its three experts. As the judge correctly noted in his posttrial memorandum and order, although a jury could have found the petitioner sexually dangerous, it was not bound to accept the opinions of those witnesses. \u201cThe law should not, and does not, give the opinions of experts on either side of . . . [an] issue the benefit of conclusiveness, even if there are no contrary opinions introduced at the trial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>372 Mass. 17, 24 (1977), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>357 Mass. 168, 178 (1970). The experts\u2019 opinion that the petitioner was sexually dangerous did not \u201cmandate a finding\u201d of dangerousness. <em>DeMinico, supra </em>at 235. In the judge\u2019s view, the Commonwealth\u2019s argument \u201cthat the evidence entitled it to a judgment as a matter of law\u201d is \u201cutterly frivolous.\u201d Certainly in this civil proceeding, the Commonwealth was held to a high burden of proof. That a jury determined it had not met that burden is insufficient reason for us to conclude that the judge abused his discretion in denying its motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The petitioner has a statutory right to challenge his continuing confinement at the center. \u201c[U]nlike a criminal prisoner, the SDP is continuously evaluated to determine if treatment is necessary, and, if not, the petitioner will be released from the treatment center, either to serve out his sentence in a correctional institution or to return to society if his sentence has expired.\u201d <em>Hill, petitioner, supra </em>at 154. The Legislature has provided that either a judge or a jury may determine whether a petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>remains sexually dangerous. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In this case, the petitioner invoked his statutory right to have that determination made by a jury. The jury heard the testimony of expert witnesses for the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth also called the petitioner as a witness, subjecting him to a rigorous examination over the course of two days. The jury had ample evidence on which to consider whether the petitioner remains sexually dangerous. The judge also reminded the jury prior to their deliberations that \u201cnothing in the statute requires a person who has been civilly committed to spend time in a transition program before being discharged. Therefore if you conclude that the Commonwealth has not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that [the petitioner] is a sexually dangerous person, you must answer the question on the special verdict form, \u2018No\u2019 regardless of any views you may have about the benefits of an individual spending time in a transition program before being discharged.\u201d The Commonwealth makes no claim that the verdict was the product of bias, misapprehension, or prejudice. We see no reason to conclude that the judge abused his discretion in deciding that the jury\u2019s verdict was based on a \u201ccareful consideration of the evidence.\u201d <em>Turnpike Motors, Inc., supra </em>at 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\"> On January 14, 1994, the Legislature transferred control of the Massachusetts Treatment Center (center) from the Department of Mental Health to the Department of Correction and renamed it the Nemansket Correctional Center. St. 1993, c. 489, \u00a7 2. The Commissioner of Correction has determined that the center should continue to be referred to as the Massachusetts Treatment Center, apparently in deference to members of the Native American community who objected to the use of the name Nemansket to describe a center for sexually dangerous persons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\"> General Laws c. 123A, \u00a7 9, authorizes a person who is committed to the treatment center to file a petition for examination and discharge.

The presumption of innocence (or, as modified to fit the case, the presumption that petitioner is not a sexually dangerous person) is part of the standard charge on proof beyond a reasonable doubt as set forth originally in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850) (\u2018All the presumptions of law independent of evidence are in favor of innocence; and every person is presumed to be innocent until he is proven guilty.\u2019) The presumption of innocence is an integral part of the Webster-verbatim charge and the so-called \u2018modem syntax\u2019 version of <em>Webster, </em>which I used in this case.
