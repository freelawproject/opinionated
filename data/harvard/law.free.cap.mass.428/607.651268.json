Therrien, appeals from a denial of his fifth motion for a new trial, which raises the issue of the judge\u2019s instructions in light of <em>Cage </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>498 U.S. 39 (1990). A single justice allowed the defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal from the order denying his motion for a new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ambers, </em>397 Mass. 705, 706 (1986). We affirm the order denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">On September 17, 1975, the defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree (two indictments), of assault with intent to murder, of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and of unlawful possession of a weapon. A description of the facts surrounding these convictions is reported at <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>371 Mass. 203 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>In 1996, the defendant filed his fifth motion for a new trial, arguing that the jury instruction using \u201cmoral certainty\u201d as the standard for defining reasonable doubt violated his constitutional right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The motion was denied. The defendant filed a motion for reconsideration asserting that recent developments in the law concerning the use of \u201cmoral certainty\u201d in defining reasonable doubt entitled him to a new trial. After hearing, the defendant\u2019s motion was denied by a Superior Court judge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant then petitioned a single justice of this court, pursuant to the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d provision, see G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, for leave to appeal the denial of his postconviction motion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>427 Mass. 245, 247 (1998); <em>Ambers, supra </em>at 706. The single justice allowed the defendant\u2019s appeal on the jury instructions in light of recent cases criticizing the use of \u201cmoral certainty\u201d language.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We turn now to the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\"><em>Moral certainty. </em>The defendant contends that the judge erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>in explaining reasonable doubt to the jury by employing the term \u201cmoral certainty\u201d without adequately explaining or giving content to that phrase. The defendant asserts that the judge\u2019s use of the term \u201cmoral certainty\u201d alone \u201cfailed to impress upon the jury the \u2018high degree of certainty\u2019 required to convict the defendant . . . beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In reviewing the defendant\u2019s claim, we review the instructions on \u201cmoral certainty\u201d to determine whether \u201ca reasonable juror could have used the instruction incorrectly.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 27 (1996). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 249 n.6. The only issue now before us is whether the term \u201cmoral certainty\u201d was explained adequately.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Relying in part on <em>Cage </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>498 U.S. 39 (1990), the defendant contends that the judge\u2019s instructions \u201cfailed to impress upon the jury the high degree of certainty required to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In <em>Cage, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>the trial judge defined reasonable doubt as \u201csuch doubt as would give rise to a grave uncertainty . . . . It is an actual substantial doubt. . . . What is required is ... a moral certainty.\u201d <em>Cage, supra </em>at 40. The United States Supreme Court held that the use of these statements could have suggested a \u201chigher degree of doubt than is required for acquittal under the reasonable doubt standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1 (1994), the United States Supreme Court criticized the use of \u201cmoral certainty\u201d language in the abstract. <em>Id. </em>at 13-16. However, the Supreme Court said that \u201cmoral certainty\u201d language, if used with language which lends content and meaning to the phrase, is not reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at 14, 16. In <em>Victor, </em>the jurors were told they needed \u201can abiding conviction, to a moral certainty, of the truth of the charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. The jurors were instructed that their conclusions had to be based \u201con the evidence in the case . . . [and that they] must not be swayed by mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. Because the jurors were so instructed in <em>Victor, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cthere [was] no reasonable likelihood that the jury would have understood moral certainty to be disassociated from the evidence. [The Court did] not think it reasonably likely that the jury understood the words \u2018moral certainty\u2019 ... as suggesting a standard of proof lower than due process requires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">We also have reversed a conviction for murder in the first degree based on a faulty \u201cmoral certainty\u201d instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinckney, </em>419 Mass. 341 (1995). In <em>Pinck-ney, </em>we said that the combination of moral certainty language, conflicting and incorrect definitions of reasonable doubt, and a misstatement of a disfavored charge from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madeiros, </em>255 Mass. 304 (1926), \u201clead us to the conclusion that the instruction failed to convey accurately to the jury the meaning of reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Pinckney, supra </em>at 349. We noted, however, that use of \u201cmoral certainty\u201d language \u201cwas not reversible error where it was used with an additional instruction which impressed upon the fact finder the need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Similarly, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonds, </em>424 Mass. 698, 703 (1997), we reversed a conviction because the judge equated proof beyond a reasonable doubt with moral certainty, \u201cand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>then [gave] no content to the phrase \u2018moral certainty\u2019 except to compare it with the certainty required to make important personal decisions.\u201d Again, we stressed that \u201cmoral certainty\u201d language must be explained adequately.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The defendant contends that the instructions in his case were analogous to the unconstitutional instructions in <em>Cage, Pinck-ney, </em>and <em>Bonds. </em>He argues that the judge used moral certainty language without adding content or meaning to the phrase.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the instructions at his trial were closer to those upheld in <em>Victor </em>than to those in <em>Cage </em>or <em>Pinckney. </em>The judge instructed the jurors that they \u201cshould evaluate the testimony and the exhibits, place them against each other, use [their] common sense and try to come to a determination of whether or not the Commonwealth has proven . . . that the defendant is guilty of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The judge stated that the defendant need not \u201cprove that there is some other explanation of the evidence.\u201d The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>stated, \u201c[I]f there is any other reasonable explanation of the evidence of what [the jurors] find happened, if that has caused [the jurors] to have serious unanswered questions about the guilt of the defendant, then he must be given the benefit of the doubt and acquitted.\u201d The judge added reasonable doubt \u201cmeans in simple language that before [the jurors could] convict a person of a crime, [they] must be sure, sure to a moral certainty.\u201d The judge stated that the standard of proof required \u201cthat, when the case [was] all over, no matter which way it goes, that the twelve [jurors should] be able to five with each other and [them]selves.\u201d The judge then restated that the reasonable doubt standard required \u201cevidence which would enable . . . jurors to live with [them]selves and with one another.\u201d Finally, the judge warned the jurors that the reasonable doubt instruction did not mean \u201canything based on emotion or sympathy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Taken as a whole, these instructions adequately conveyed the meaning and content of the phrase \u201cmoral certainty.\u201d Indeed, the judge\u2019s emphasis of the need for the jurors to be \u201csure\u201d accords with our requirement that jurors reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused. See <em>Pinckney, supra </em>at 344. Unlike the erroneous instructions in <em>Cage, </em>nothing the judge said suggested a \u201chigher degree of doubt than is required for acquittal under the reasonable-doubt standard.\u201d <em>Cage, supra </em>at 41. Therefore, we conclude that a reasonable juror could not have used the instruction incorrectly. See <em>Rosa, supra </em>at 27.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-6\"> The defendant first unsuccessfully moved for a new trial in September, 1975, arguing that the trial judge erred in charging the jury by citing to the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence when distinguishing between murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree. The defendant then challenged his ponvictions before this court, arguing that the judge erred by: (1) citing to the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence in the jury instructions; (2) giving instructions which invited an emotional verdict; and (3) explaining to the jurors that the defendant must be acquitted if the jurors had \u201cserious unanswered questions\u201d about the defendant\u2019s guilt. We affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>371 Mass. 203, 209 (1976). In December, 1976, the defendant unsuccessfully moved for a new trial, based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. In November, 1980, the defendant filed a third motion for a new trial, arguing that the jury instructions regarding malice were erroneous. The motion was denied in September, 1981, and a single justice of this court denied leave to appeal to the full court in 1983. In March, 1985, the defendant was denied habeas corpus relief by a Federal District Court.- The First Circuit affirmed, concluding that there was no error in the jury instruction\u2019s explanation of malice and that the instructions did not establish wrongly a presumption in favor of the Commonwealth. See <em>Therrien </em>v. <em>Vose, </em>782 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1162 (1986). In January, 1987, the defendant filed a fourth motion for a new trial, this time challenging the felony-murder instructions. The motion was denied and a single justice of this court denied leave to appeal to the full court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\"> The trial judge had retired by the time of the fourth motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\"> The order of the single justice allowed the Commonwealth to assert that the cases relied on by the defendant clearly were foreshadowed and therefore the new trial motion did not present anything \u201cnew and substantial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>427 Mass. 245, 248 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ambers, </em>397 Mass. 705, 707 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b633-6\"> The Commonwealth argues that the defendant\u2019s claim should be deemed waived because problems associated with moral certainty language were foreshadowed well before the defendant\u2019s prior postconviction motions. There is merit to the Commonwealth\u2019s argument. See, e.g., <em>Hopt </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>120 U.S. 430, 440 (1887) (\u201cthe words \u2018to a reasonable and moral certainty\u2019 add nothing to the words \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt;\u2019 one may require explanation as much as the other\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Drake, </em>673 F.2d 15, 21 (1st Cir. 1982) (\u201cAs for \u2018moral certainty\u2019 language our disapproval of it as a definition of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is by now well-settled\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Indorato, </em>628 F.2d 711, 720-721 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1016 (1980) (\u201cThe interchangeable use of the phrases \u2018morally certain\u2019 and \u2018reasonably certain\u2019 is ... of dubious value\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ariza-Ibarra, </em>605 F.2d 1216, 1228 (1st Cir. 1979) (\u201c[W]e have cautioned previously against use of language suggesting that [reasonable doubt] means proof to a moral certainty\u201d); <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Perrin, </em>570 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 437 U.S. 910 (1978) (\u201cAuthorities differ on the advisability of equating proof beyond a reasonable doubt with establishment of guilt to a moral certainty\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Byrd, </em>352 F.2d 570, 575 (2d Cir. 1965) (\u201c \u2018Doubt\u2019 and \u2018certainty\u2019 are antithetical and . . . the use of them in this manner and for this purpose would tend to create more confusion than light in the minds of the jury\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Brigham, </em>25 Cal. 3d 283, 300 (1979) (Mosk, J., concurring) (\u201cMoral certainty\u201d has \u201cdrawn . . . scholarly and judicial criticism over the years\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kloiber, </em>378 Pa. 412, 427, cert. denied, 348 U.S. 875 (1954) (\u201cthe use of the words \u2018moral certainty\u2019 serves to confuse and befog the jury\u201d). On the view we take of the defendant\u2019s appeal, we need not address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">We disagree with the implication inherent in <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Matesanz, </em>29 F. Supp. 2d 11 (D. Mass. 1998), that the problems associated with \u201cmoral certainty\u201d language were not foreshadowed prior to the decision in <em>Cage </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>498 U.S. 39 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\"> The Federal Judicial Center has recommended the following definition of reasonable doubt: \u201cProof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt. There are very few things in this world that we know with absolute certainty, and in criminal cases the law does not require proof that overcomes every possible doubt. If, based on your consideration of the evidence, you are firmly convinced that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged, you must find him guilty. If on the other hand, you think there is a real possibility that he is not guilty, you must give him the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty.\u201d Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions, Instruction 21 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\"> The defendant also asserts that the instruction that the jury must acquit if the jurors had \u201cserious unanswered questions\u201d was equivalent to the \u201cgrave uncertainty\u201d language criticized in <em>Cage </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>498 U.S. 39 (1990). This argument lacks merit. First, the use of the term \u201cserious unanswered questions\u201d was unsuccessfully challenged on direct appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, supra </em>at 208. Second, the motion judge found, reading the instruction as a whole, the word \u201cserious,\u201d as employed, did not mean \u201cgrave.\u201d Rather, a reasonable juror would have understood the term to mean \u201cbeing in earnest.\u201d The term was used to distinguish reasonable and unreasonable unanswered questions. We note that trial counsel, who heard the language in context, did not object to the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">The defendant also argues matters not before the single justice and not addressed below. We do not discuss these issues as they are not properly before us. However, we note that the issues about which the defendant complains were well developed during the course of the defendant\u2019s repeated posttrial proceedings. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bumpus, </em>362 Mass. 672 (1972), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 411 U.S. 945 (1973), aff'd on rehearing, 365 Mass. 66 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\"> We disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention that the recent decision in <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Matesanz, </em>29 F. Supp. 2d 11, 13 (D. Mass. 1998), should alter our conclusions. In <em>Simpson, </em>the judge (1) instructed that the jurors had to be \u201csure to a moral certainty,\u201d (2) equated the degree of certainty required for conviction with that required for \u201cdecisions of importance\u201d in the lives of the jurors, and (3) instructed that if the jurors had serious unanswered questions about the defendant\u2019s guilt, the defendant must be acquitted. Citing the compounding effect of these three problematic instructions and the lack of redeeming language, a Federal District Court granted the defendant\u2019s habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The instructions here are distinguishable. First, unlike in <em>Simpson, </em>the judge did not introduce the concept of important life decisions. Rather the <em>defense </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>attorney compared reasonable doubt to important life decisions in closing argument. The judge then reacted to this comparison by stating that the examples given by the defense attorney \u201cwere close, but\u201d that he believed that reasonable doubt should be described differently. After stating that the jurors \u201cmust be sure\u201d in order to convict a defendant, the judge defined the certainty required as that which, \u201cwhen the case [was] all over, no matter which way it [was decided], that the twelve [jurors would] be able to live with each other and [them]selves.\u201d The judge\u2019s brief reference to the defense attorney\u2019s examples by itself or in conjunction with the term \u201cmoral certainty\u201d does not amount to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Second, unlike the instructions in <em>Simpson, </em>here there was sufficient \u201credeeming language\u201d to lend content and meaning to the other problematic instructions. The judge stated that the jurors \u201cmust be sure\u201d and twice repeated that the certainty required for conviction was such that jurors be able to live with themselves and each other after the trial. This instruction, absent in <em>Simpson, </em>informed the jurors of the level of certitude required for conviction. Cf. <em>Cage </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>498 U.S. 39, 41 (1990) (erroneous instructions suggested a \u201chigher degree of doubt than is required for acquittal under the reasonable doubt standard,\u201d a problem not found in these instructions).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
