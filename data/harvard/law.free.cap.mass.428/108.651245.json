We transferred that appeal here on our own motion. This appeal presents the question whether circumstances have changed significantly since our opinion in <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>387 Mass. 258 (1982), so that principles stated in that opinion, concerning conditions under which the BHA may evict a tenant, no longer apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The facts on which the BHA based its case for eviction of the tenant are not in dispute. The tenant\u2019s son, who was a member of her household, physically assaulted a BHA police officer while that officer and another BHA officer were trying to arrest one of the son\u2019s friends (for possession of a gun, according to the testimony). Under her lease, the tenant agreed to \u201cforbid any member of Resident\u2019s household . . . from engaging in any criminal or illegal activity.\u201d The BHA did not seek to evict the tenant for violation of that provision. There was no evidence that she had violated it.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">As grounds for the eviction, the BHA relies on lease language permitting its termination if a member of the tenant\u2019s household commits \u201c[a]ny criminal or other activity which threatens the health or safety of . . . BHA employees.\u201d The tenant\u2019s son unquestionably committed a criminal act that threatened the health and safety of the BHA police officer whom he attacked. If the lease alone controlled our decision, the BHA would be entitled to possession of the premises. The terms of the lease are not, however, the sole consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The BHA is subject to the statute governing the termination of public housing tenancies, G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 32. In <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, supra, </em>involving evictions sought because of firebombings of BHA apartments by tenants\u2019 sons <em>(id. </em>at 259, 260), we concluded that \u00a7 32 provides \u201ca limited protection against termination when special circumstances . . . indicate that the tenant could not have foreseen the violence or taken steps to prevent it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261. Section 32, then <em>(id. </em>at 263) and now, provides that a housing authority may terminate a tenancy only for \u201ccause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded in <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley </em>that \u201c[wjhen the wrongdoer is a household member, a fair inference exists that the tenant is aware of potential problems, and able to exercise some influence or otherwise prevent violent and destructive conduct on the premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265. We continued, noting that this inference may not hold true in every case, and, if it were not true in a specific case, there would be a question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>of fairness in evicting the tenant. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the \u201ccause\u201d requirement of \u00a7 32 means that a tenant should not be evicted if special circumstances negate the inference that she could have averted the lease violation. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn other words, if the tenant can show that she could not have foreseen and prevented her son\u2019s violence, there is no \u2018cause\u2019 to evict her within \u00a7 32.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Although the Legislature has amended \u00a7 32 several times since our 1982 opinion in <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>the word \u201ccause\u201d and its context have not changed (\u201cThe tenancy of a tenant of a housing authority shall not be terminated without cause . . .\u201d). There is no indication that the Legislature intended any amendment of \u00a7 32 to change the principles announced in <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley. </em>Reenactment of statutory language following a judicial interpretation of it presumes legislative acceptance of that interpretation. See <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Wareham, </em>401 Mass. 408, 411 (1988); <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>363 Mass. 685, 691 (1973); <em>Leal </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 330, 333 (1997).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The 1995 amendment of \u00a7 32 gives the BHA the right not to grant a tenant a pretermination hearing, if there is reason to believe that a member of a tenant\u2019s household has threatened serious harm to a BHA employee, but that amendment did not eliminate the \u201ccause\u201d requirement of \u00a7 32. St. 1995, \u00a7 179, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such threatening conduct is a statutorily recognized ground for termination of a tenancy, but the 1995 amendment of \u00a7 32 did not make such conduct an incontestable \u201ccause\u201d for termination. In the face of the requirement of cause in \u00a7 32, the provision in the lease permitting termination of the tenancy cannot be enforced as written.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The question then is whether, pursuant to the principles of <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>the tenant has shown that she could not have foreseen and prevented her son\u2019s violence. Some testimony tended to show that the tenant had no reason to foresee that her son would act violently. But the judge made no findings of fact bearing on the foreseeability question. On the question whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the tenant could have prevented the attack, he found only that the altercation occurred away from her apartment. He stated that \u201c[t]here is no evidence that the defendant could reasonably have foreseen and prevented her son\u2019s conduct.\u201d That statement seems to place the burden on the BHA to prove foreseeability and preventability. <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>however, places the burden on the tenant to show special circumstances warranting denial of eviction in this case. <em>Id. </em>at 265. See <em>Hodess </em>v. <em>Bonefont, </em>401 Mass. 693, 697 (1988). The judge neither ruled on whether the tenant had met her burden of proof nor found facts sufficient to permit any such ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">We vacate the judgment and remand the case for findings of fact and a ruling on whether the tenant has proved special circumstances that justify rejection of the BHA\u2019s attempt to evict her. The judge in his discretion may authorize a further evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-7\"> The sixth paragraph, which contains the cause requirement, was amended by St. 1995, c. 179, \u00a7\u00a7 5 &amp; 6, which reenacted the \u201ccause\u201d language verbatim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\"> Before 1995, such conduct would have permitted only a request to waive an agency hearing.
