L. c. 63, \u00a7 39, which establishes the excise imposed on foreign corporations. In 1987, the Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) determined that Aloha Freightways, Inc. (Aloha), an Illinois-based trucking company, had a substantial nexus with Massachusetts, triggering the imposition of an excise under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 39. Aloha was notified that it had failed to file corporate excise returns for the years 1980 through 1986. Aloha then filed its 1986 return, paid $228 (the then existing minimum corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>excise)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and filed an application for an abatement. See G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37. The commissioner denied the abatement, and Aloha appealed to the Appellate Tax Board (board). See G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 39. The board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s denial of the abatement. The board concluded that (1) by using its trucks in the Commonwealth Aloha is \u201cdoing business\u201d in the Commonwealth and, consequently, is subject to the \u00a7 39 corporate excise; (2) imposition of the excise does not violate the commerce clause because Aloha has a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d with the Commonwealth; (3) the corporate excise is fairly apportioned; (4) the excise does not discriminate against interstate commerce; and (5) the excise is fairly related to the in-State activities of Aloha. Aloha appealed from the board\u2019s decision under G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13. We transferred the appeal on our own initiative and now affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We recite the facts briefly.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Aloha is an Illinois corporation that specializes in transporting machinery throughout the country on flatbed trailers. During 1986, the year in question, Aloha had thirty trucks in operation. Aloha operated as a certified interstate motor carrier of property under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued to Aloha by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Aloha registered its ICC authority in each State it served, including Massachusetts. As part of its registration with Massachusetts, Aloha purchased registration stamps covering sixteen of its vehicles. Aloha obtained special fuel user licenses and decals for its tractor units from the Department of Revenue (department) at a cost of $483.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">During 1986 Aloha used more than twenty different trucks to make fifty-four trips to the Commonwealth to pick up and deliver machinery. The typical freight delivery consisted of heavy machinery with an average weight of 16,000 pounds, and an average dimension of ten cubic feet. Aloha picked up or delivered equipment in thirty-two separate Massachusetts cities and towns. In making these pickups and deliveries Aloha\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>tracks traveled 10,926 miles on Massachusetts roads, and billed more than $55,000 for its services related to Massachusetts. Aloha did not make any intrastate shipments within Massachusetts. It either shipped goods into Massachusetts from another State, or picked up goods in Massachusetts for delivery out of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">During 1986 Aloha did not own or lease any property in Massachusetts, nor did it advertise or otherwise solicit business in Massachusetts. Customers contacted Aloha at its Illinois headquarters. None of Aloha\u2019s drivers was a resident of Massachusetts. If they were required to stay overnight in Massachusetts, they would sleep in their tractor units.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">2. <em>General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 39. </em>\u201c[E]very foreign corporation, exercising its charter, or qualified to do business or actually doing business in the commonwealth, or owning or using any part or all of its capital, plant or any other property in the commonwealth, shall pay [the corporate excise].\u201d G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 39. The excise imposed is the \u201cgreater\u201d of either a combination of property tax and income tax amounts designated in \u00a7 39 (a), or the statutory minimum of $200 set out in \u00a7 39 <em>(b). </em>Section 39 further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">\u201cThe excise levied herein is due and payable on any one or all of the following alternative incidents:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">\u201c(1) The qualification to carry on or do business in this state or the actual doing of business within the commonwealth in a corporate form. The term \u2018doing business\u2019 as used herein shall mean and include each and every act, power, right, privilege, or immunity exercised or enjoyed in the commonwealth, as an incident to or by virtue of the powers and privileges acquired by the nature of such organizations, as well as, the buying, selling or procuring of services or property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">\u201c(2) The exercising of a corporation\u2019s charter or the continuance of its charter within the commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">\u201c(3) The owning or using any part or all of its capital, plant or other property in the commonwealth in a corporate capacity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-11\">\u201cIt is the purpose of this section to require the payment of this excise to the commonwealth by foreign corporations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>for the enjoyment under the protection of the laws of the commonwealth, of the powers, rights, privileges and immunities derived by reason of the corporate form of existence and operation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">3. <em>The commerce clause. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s power to tax foreign corporations is constrained by the Federal government\u2019s broad power to regulate interstate commerce under the commerce clause of the United States Constitution. The commerce clause grants Congress the power \u201cto regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States.\u201d The commerce clause seeks to foster and protect economic intercourse between the States. \u201cThe very purpose of the Commerce Clause [is] to create an area of free trade among the several States.\u201d <em>McLeod </em>v. <em>J.E. Dilworth Co., </em>322 U.S. 327, 330 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">When a State imposes a tax that touches on interstate commerce it implicates the dormant commerce clause. \u201c[W]e have consistently held [the commerce clause] to contain a further, negative command, known as the dormant Commerce Clause, prohibiting certain state taxation even when Congress has failed to legislate on the subject.\u201d <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Jefferson Lines, Inc., </em>514 U.S. 175, 179 (1995). A State tax will be upheld \u201cagainst [a] Commerce Clause challenge when the tax is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided by the State.\u201d <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>430 U.S. 274, 279 (1977). <em>Brady </em>focuses on the practical effect on interstate commerce of a challenged tax statute, not the specific language used in the statute. <em>Id. Brady </em>achieves its goal of focusing on the effect of the tax by way of its four-prong test.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The first prong is self-explanatory. The tax must be applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State. The business must have some constitutionally sufficient degree of contact with the taxing State before the State can impose any tax on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">The next prong, apportionment, is designed to \u201censure that each State taxes only its fair share of an interstate transaction.\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Sweet, </em>488 U.S. 252, 261 (1989). Apportionment also seeks to avoid multiple taxation by different States. <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 184. \u201c[W]e determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>a tax is fairly apportioned by examining whether it is internally and externally consistent.\u201d <em>Goldberg, supra </em>at 261, citing <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019ns </em>v. <em>Scheiner, </em>483 U.S. 266, 285 (1987). A tax is internally consistent if it is \u201cstructured so that if every State were to impose an identical tax, no multiple taxation would result.\u201d <em>Goldberg, supra. </em>External consistency exists where \u201cthe State has taxed only that portion of the revenues from the interstate activity which reasonably reflects the in-state component of the activity being taxed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262, citing <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. 159, 169-170 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The third prong, that the tax cannot discriminate against interstate commerce, prevents States from aiding local business in competition with foreign businesses. <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The final prong requires that there be a fair relation between the tax imposed and the services provided by the State. The test here is closely related to the requirement of \u201cnexus.\u201d While \u201cnexus\u201d demands some constitutionally sufficient degree of contact with the taxing State before any tax can be imposed, fair relation requires that the degree of contact justifies the degree of the specific tax imposed. <em>Commonwealth Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>453 U.S. 609, 626 (1981). The requirement that there be a fair relation does not require that the tax be compensatory in nature, merely reimbursing the State for its cost incurred supporting the activity. It is an \u201cincorrect assumption that the amount of state taxes that may be levied on an activity connected to interstate commerce is limited to the costs incurred by the State on account of that activity. . . . [Ijnterstate commerce may be required to contribute to the cost of providing <em>all </em>governmental services, including those services from which it arguably receives no direct \u2018benefit\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth Edison Co., supra </em>at 627 <em>n.16. </em>The Court also rejected the assertion that it is the role of the judiciary to undertake a \u201cfactual inquiry\u201d to decide whether the tax imposed is excessive in relation to the costs incurred by the taxing State. \u201cThe simple fact is that the appropriate level or rate of taxation is essentially a matter for legislative, and not judicial, resolution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627, and cases cited. It is only when \u201cthe measure of a tax bears no relationship to the taxpayers\u2019 presence or activities in a State, [that] a court may properly conclude under the fourth prong of the <em>Complete Auto Transit </em>test that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the State is imposing an undue burden on interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">4. <em>Discussion. </em>A decision of the board will not be disturbed \u201cunless it is not supported by substantial evidence or is based on an error of law.\u201d <em>M &amp; T Charters, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>404 Mass. 137, 140 (1989), and cases cited. Aloha asserts that the decision of the board fails on both counts. It claims that the board\u2019s finding of nexus, which subjects Aloha to G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 39, is not supported by substantial evidence, and that the board\u2019s finding that G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 39, does not violate the commerce clause constitutes an error of law. We consider Aloha\u2019s claims against the standard that tax measures are presumed constitutionally valid and the burden of proving the measure invalid rests with the party challenging it. <em>Andover Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>387 Mass. 229, 235 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">a. <em>Nexus. </em>We are not persuaded by Aloha\u2019s first argument, that during 1986 Aloha\u2019s contacts with Massachusetts were insufficient to establish \u201cnexus.\u201d The nexus requirement seeks to prevent overreaching by States, and limits a State\u2019s ability to tax businesses operating within interstate commerce which lack a sufficient connection to the taxing State. Aloha\u2019s business consists of picking up, transporting, and delivering freight throughout the United States. During 1986, Aloha performed each of these business functions within the Commonwealth on a regular basis: Aloha\u2019s trucks made fifty-four trips to Massachusetts; serviced customers in thirty-two separate Massachusetts cities and towns; and logged 10,926 miles on Massachusetts roads. Aloha clearly had sufficient contact with Massachusetts, in 1986, to establish \u201cnexus,\u201d and justify the imposition of the $228 corporate minimum excise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">b. <em>Fair relation. </em>Aloha next argues that there was no showing that the minimum corporate excise is fairly related to the services provided by the Commonwealth, and as a result the excise fails the fourth prong of the <em>Brady </em>case. Aloha argues that it has already paid for any services it receives from the Commonwealth by payment of the registration and licensing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>fees, and the fuel taxes. Aloha states that these payments covered its use of the highways and services directly related to interstate trucking. In focusing solely on those services of which it directly avails itself, Aloha misconstrues the United States Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>Goldberg, supra. </em>\u201cThe tax which may be imposed on a particular interstate transaction need not be limited to the cost of the services incurred by the State on account of that particular activity.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>267, citing <em>Commonwealth Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>453 U.S. 609, 627 n.16 (1981). Consequently, the focus is not on what specific services are utilized by the taxpayers in its day-to-day operations, but rather, \u201cthe wide range of benefits\u201d made available to them. <em>Goldberg, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The board found <em>that the $228 </em>minimum corporate excise was reasonable in light of the wide range of government services available for Aloha\u2019s use \u2014 police, fire, access to the courts, and road maintenance. The board made factual findings as to the activities of Aloha and the corresponding State services and protections made available to it. \u201cThe decision of the board shall be final as to findings of fact.\u201d G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13. We find that the minimum corporate excise was fairly related to the wide range of governmental services available to Aloha as a corporation conducting its business in the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Aloha argues that the excise is \u201cflat,\u201d and therefore invalid, because it would apply to any motor carrier who drove so little as one mile into Massachusetts. The Commonwealth argues that the excise is reasonable because the commissioner has instituted an exclusion for de minimis contact. The commissioner has the power, under G. L. c. 14, \u00a7 6 (1), to \u201cmake . . . and from time to time . . . revise . . . such reasonable regulations ... as may be necessary to interpret any statute imposing any tax, excise or fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">General Laws c. 62C, \u00a7 3, states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">\u201cThe Commissioner may prescribe regulations and rulings, not inconsistent with law, to carry into effect the provisions of said statutes, which regulations and rulings, when reasonably designed to carry out the intent and purpose of said provisions, shall be prima facie evidence of their proper interpretation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Unless the regulation provides otherwise, it is retroactive in ef-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>feet. Pursuant to this authority the department promulgated 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 63.39.1(l)(a) (1993) to \u201cdescribe[] the circumstances under which a foreign corporation is subject to the tax jurisdiction of Massachusetts under [G. L.] c. 63, \u00a7 39.\u201d Title 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 63.39.1(10) (1993) states that trucks that \u201cfrequently transport goods over the roads of Massachusetts\u201d have a substantial nexus for imposition of the corporate excise.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To elaborate on what was meant by \u201cfrequent\u201d the department issued DD 95-7, 3 Official MassTax Guide 504-506 (West 1998). This directive established a de minimis exception under which a foreign corporation is only subject to the corporate excise if it \u201cmakes more than twelve pickups, deliveries, trips through Massachusetts without pickup or delivery, or any combination thereof totaling more than twelve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">c. <em>Apportionment. </em>Aloha next argues that the corporate excise is invalid because it fails the second <em>Brady </em>prong, that the tax be fairly apportioned. We analyze this claim mindful \u201cthat the central purpose behind the apportionment requirement is to ensure that each State taxes only its fair share of an interstate transaction.\u201d <em>Goldberg, supra </em>at 260-261. When a tax is fairly apportioned, the danger of overlapping taxation of business activity with a tax situs in multiple States is alleviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In making this argument Aloha relies on <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019ns </em>v. <em>Scheiner, </em>483 U.S. 266 (1987), and our holding in <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019ns </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin., </em>415 Mass. 337 (1993). In <em>Scheiner, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that two Pennsylvania statutes that imposed annual lump-sum taxes on every truck traveling on Pennsylvania highways violated the commerce clause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court found that, while all trucks operating on the State\u2019s highways would pay the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>fees, local truckers would derive a greater benefit in return because they would make greater use of the roads. <em>Scheiner, supra </em>at 296. Because the fees, in effect, imposed a greater cost per mile on interstate trucks than on local trucks they were found to discriminate against interstate commerce. The Court also concluded that the fees failed the \u201cinternal consistency\u201d test of <em>Armco Inc. </em>v. <em>Hardesty, </em>467 U.S. 638, 644 (1984). <em>Schei-ner, supra </em>at 284. \u201cTo pass the \u2018internal consistency\u2019 test, a state tax must be of a kind that, \u2018if applied by every jurisdiction, there would be no impermissible interference with free trade.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Armco, supra. </em>The Court found that interstate commerce would suffer if every State imposed such a tax because the taxes imposed a greater economic burden on out-of-State truckers than on local truckers.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>we discussed <em>Scheiner, supra, </em>at some length. We determined that the fees in question, in that case, failed the internal consistency test. In doing so we noted the \u201cdiscriminatory impact\u201d of the challenged flat annual fees at issue. <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, supra </em>at 345-346. Specifically, we found objectionable that application of the fees was triggered by a single entry of even one mile into Massachusetts. <em>Id. </em>at 345, 347, 348. We also stated that, in the context of user fees, a fee is internally consistent where \u201cthe taxing States\u2019 borders are essentially irrelevant to the measure of the tax imposed and the fees [are] not excessive in relation to the benefits received for their payment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348. Because the fees in <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019ns </em>discriminated against out-of-State trucking and did not fairly approximate the value of any benefit conferred in Massachusetts, they failed the internal consistency test. <em>Id. </em>at 348-349.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The excise presently before us, G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 39, does not implicate the concerns about discrimination that were central to the reasoning of both the <em>Scheiner </em>and <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019ns </em>cases. The Court in <em>Scheiner </em>noted that the challenged fees were discriminatory in effect because they were assessed with no consideration given to the frequency or duration of the interstate carriers\u2019 travels over the Pennsylvania highways. <em>Scheiner, supra </em>at 286. Similarly, in <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>pra </em>at 345, we observed that \u201cthe imposition of the full measure of each [of the challenged fees] is triggered by an interstate truck simply crossing the border of Massachusetts and making just one commercial entry into the state.\u201d Consequently, we held that \u201c[t]he fees here discriminate against out-of-State truckers by subjecting them to a higher charge per mile traveled in Massachusetts . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348. The Massachusetts foreign corporate excise, by contrast, exempts from its application those carriers with only de minimis contact with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Nor does Aloha, as an out-of-State company, pay more for its Massachusetts-related business than it would were it an in-State company. During the tax year in question, Aloha traveled to Massachusetts on fifty-four occasions. The company logged over 10,000 miles on the roads of the Commonwealth, making pickups and deliveries in thirty-two separate communities. Under the Massachusetts excise scheme, Aloha was assessed a minimum excise of $228 for the privilege of conducting this business within the Commonwealth. A local trucking company engaged in the same level of business would likely face a higher total excise burden under the Massachusetts excise scheme because they would have a greater over-all presence in the State. General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 32, establishes the excise imposed on domestic corporations. Section 32 is almost identical in its language to \u00a7 39. Under either \u00a7 32 or \u00a7 39 the excise imposed is the <em>greater </em>of the minimum excise under \u00a7 32 <em>(b) </em>or \u00a7 39 <em>(b); </em>or a combination of income tax and property tax amounts as set forth \u00a7 32 <em>(a) </em>and \u00a7 39 <em>(a). </em>While the record does not provide sufficient data to compute the excise Aloha would pay if it was a \u201clocal\u201d business, a local company\u2019s property and income would be subject to the excise scheme, \u00a7 32 <em>(a), </em>likely resulting in an excise greater than the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The excise also satisfies the \u201cexternal consistency\u201d test. External consistency ensures that each State taxes only that portion of the interstate transaction that is attributable to the local activity. During 1986 Aloha generated more than $55,000 in revenue from its pickups and deliveries in the Commonwealth. The record does not disclose what percentage of this revenue is directly attributable to activity conducted within Massachusetts. However, an excise of $228 was reasonable given the level of in-State activity conducted by Aloha. We hold that the Commonwealth has taxed only \u201cthat portion of the revenues from the interstate activity which reasonably reflects the in-state component of the activity being taxed.\u201d <em>Goldberg, supra </em>at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>d. <em>Discrimination against interstate commerce. </em>Aloha\u2019s final argument is that G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 39, discriminates against interstate commerce. In support of this assertion Aloha asserts that it is \u201cobvious\u201d that local truckers make greater use of the Commonwealth\u2019s roads and services than do interstate carriers. Aloha goes on to state that a trucker who travels only one mile on the highways of the Commonwealth will pay a disproportionately higher excise tax than intrastate truckers. We note as a preliminary matter that Aloha is clearly not this hypothetical company. Regardless, a company making fewer than twelve trips into the Commonwealth is exempted from the excise tax by the department\u2019s de minimis exclusion. As to the broader question of discrimination, we do not find that the Massachusetts excise scheme in any way aids local business or inhibits foreign companies operating within the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\"> In 1986 the minimum excise was $200 plus a surtax of fourteen per cent, for a total of $228.
