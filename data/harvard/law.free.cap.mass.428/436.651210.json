L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, from a decision of the Department of Telecommunications &amp; Energy (department) approving a holding company proposal of the intervener Boston Edison Company (Edison).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, only an \u201caggrieved party in interest\u201d may appeal from a decision of the department. The department did not grant Cablevision status as a party but did allow it the role of a limited participant. The department and Edison moved to dismiss Cablevision\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">A limited participant does not qualify as a party in interest entitled to appeal department decisions. See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>416 Mass. 668, 671 n.3 (1993); <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>390 Mass. 208, 216-217 (1983).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is well established, however, that a petitioner would have standing to appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, if the department improperly denied it full intervener status. See <em>KES Brockton, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>416 Mass. 158, 164 (1993); <em>Save the Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>366 Mass. 667, 673 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Cablevision, a provider of telecommunications and cable systems, contends that the department committed an error of law and an abuse of discretion in denying it status as a party, pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (3) (c). It argues that the department failed to recognize that the effect on Cablevision of Edison\u2019s corporate restructuring was a relevant consideration in the commission\u2019s decision. It argues that it would be \u201csubstantially and specifically affected\u201d by approval of Edison\u2019s proposal because it is a competitor and potential competitor of Edison\u2019s unregulated video and telecommunications affiliate. In particular, Cablevision claims that the holding company structure would allow Edison to use assets of its regulated activities unfairly and unlawfully to subsidize its affiliate\u2019s activities in the cable and communications market.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Under G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 96, the department was charged with deciding whether Edison\u2019s proposal was \u201cconsistent with the public interest.\u201d The department determined that Cablevision was not \u201csubstantially and specifically affected\u201d by the proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ing because its claims arose out of its status as a competitor of .Edison\u2019s unregulated cable industry affiliate. Therefore, the department rejected Cablevision\u2019s petition to intervene as a full party. The department concluded that its task was to assess the public interest in terms of how the proposed merger might affect Edison\u2019s monopoly ratepayers. To that end it would \u201cconsider appropriate safeguards to ensure that monopoly ratepayers do not subsidize unregulated activities.\u201d Any investigation concerning the impact of competition was limited to the effects of competition within the electric industry. The department ruled that to consider the impact over competition in other industries \u201cwould have been impracticable given the vast array of markets a company may choose to pursue.\u201d The department approved the merger.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Cablevision claims that the department\u2019s narrow definition of the words \u201cconsistent with the public interest\u201d led to the department\u2019s denial of Cablevision\u2019s motion for full party status. The department did not commit an error of law in concluding that its statutory obligation to consider the public interest did not require it to consider the consequences of competition between Cablevision and Edison\u2019s unregulated affiliate. The department has not considered inter-industry competition to be a relevant factor in evaluating the public interest under G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 96. In various circumstances, intra-industry competitors have had standing to challenge agency action that allegedly caused them harm. See <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 295-296 (1977); <em>Everett Town Taxi, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Everett, </em>366 Mass. 534, 538-539 (1974); <em>South Shore Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Board of Bank Incorporation, </em>351 Mass. 363, 367-368 (1966); <em>A.B. &amp; C. Motor Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>327 Mass. 550, 551 (1951). There is, however, no parallel inter-industry authority that supports standing. Our cases have recognized that the department\u2019s task, assigned by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Legislature, is the \u201cprotection of ratepayers.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>397 Mass. 361, 369 (1986), cert. denied, 418 U.S. 1036 (1987), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Cablevision did not have the right to full standing as a party in the agency proceeding (G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 [3]), and the department did not abuse its broad discretion in denying Cablevision that status. The department, on its own motion, commenced a proceeding to investigate Cablevision\u2019s allegation that Edison had improperly subsidized its unregulated activities with assets of its regulated activities. Moreover, the department commenced a rulemaking proceeding to consider revision of its standards of conduct governing relationships between gas and electric distribution companies and their unregulated affiliates. The fact that these other proceedings were undertaken, with Cablevision as a full participant, certainly justifies, without more, the department\u2019s exercise of discretion to limit Cablevision\u2019s status in Edison\u2019s holding company proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Cablevision\u2019s other arguments require little discussion. There is no merit to Cablevision\u2019s claim that the department deviated from established practice and thus failed to apply reasoned consistency in its decision. The department\u2019s findings of fact and reasons for its decision were adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Although Cablevision\u2019s arguments on appeal are not persuasive, we reject Edison\u2019s claim, pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a710, that Cablevision\u2019s appeal is frivolous, justifying the imposition of double costs. Cablevision presented an issue not previously decided, and, although its argument has been found to be unpersuasive, its appeal is not frivolous. The convergence of the telecommunications and cable television industries with energy industries presents new challenges, and Cablevision\u2019s attempt to obtain consideration of inter-industry competition is not wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">A judgment shall be entered in the county court dismissing the appeal of Cablevision Systems Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b461-8\"> The department is the successor to the Department of Public Utilities (DPU). Where appropriate, references to the department include the DPU.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b461-9\"> An agency may allow a person to become a party who shows \u201cthat he may be substantially and specifically affected by the proceeding.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 10 (4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b462-6\"> At the time of the department\u2019s decision, Edison was the only Massachusetts-based, investor-owned electric utility not organized in a holding company structure. The department concluded, among other things, that, through formation of a holding company that would own all Edison\u2019s stock, Edison\u2019s affiliate could pursue unregulated business opportunities in competitive markets without the delays inherent in the regulatory process. The department determined that structural separation of regulated business activities from unregulated business activities would insulate ratepayers from the risks inherent in a single corporate entity engaging in both activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
