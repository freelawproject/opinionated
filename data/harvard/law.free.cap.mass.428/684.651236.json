L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>and (/), immunity provisions of the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act. The defendants in <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 318 (1998), sought further appellate review after the decision of the Appeals Court overturned the Superior Court judge\u2019s order granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. King vs. Commonwealth is before this court on direct appellate review of the Superior Court judge\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The public employers in both cases are not liable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">King vs. Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">In November, 1993, a judge released Dalton O. Simpson, who had been in custody on various criminal charges, on personal recognizance in response to an agreement between Simpson and the district attorney\u2019s office. Almost three months later, in February, 1994, Simpson shot and killed Boston police officer Berisford Wayne Anderson. Frances B. King, administra-trix of Anderson\u2019s estate, filed suit against the Commonwealth and the district attorney\u2019s office,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> seeking actual and punitive damages under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258, claiming that Anderson\u2019s conscious suffering and wrongful death were the result of an assistant district attorney\u2019s gross negligence in agreeing to Simpson\u2019s release and the district attorney\u2019s negligent supervision of the assistant district attorney. The Commonwealth and the district attorney\u2019s office moved to dismiss on the ground that they were shielded from suit by G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>and <em>(j), </em>which provide immunity from Torts Claims Act actions in certain circumstances. That motion was denied by a Superior Court judge in August, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Brum vs. Dartmouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">Jason Robinson, son of the plaintiff Elaine Brum, was stabbed to death at Dartmouth high school in April, 1993, by three armed individuals, at least one of whom was not a student at the school. Earlier that morning, the three assailants had been involved in a violent interaction at the school with two of Rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>inson\u2019s classmates and possibly with Robinson as well, but had left the school immediately afterward. After the altercation, the school principal detained Robinson\u2019s two classmates, but not Robinson, and one of the classmates informed the principal that the three individuals who had fled planned to return to the school and retaliate against him and his friends, including Robinson. Later that morning, the assailants, visibly armed, did return to the school and proceeded to a second floor classroom, unimpeded by school officials, where one of them stabbed Robinson to death.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Brum brought suit against the town of Dartmouth and several town and school officials under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1994), alleging that the defendants\u2019 negligent failure to maintain adequate security measures at the school and specific failure to protect her son in the presence of a known threat resulted in Robinson\u2019s death and violated his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Superior Court\u2019s order granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss based on the immunity provisions of \u00a7 10 (/) was subsequently overturned by the Appeals Court. See <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Interlocutory rulings, such as the Superior Court\u2019s order denying the motion to dismiss in <em>King, </em>generally are not appealable until the ultimate disposition of the case because they are not \u201cfinal orders.\u201d See <em>Kargman </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>371 Mass. 324, 329-330 (1976). In a limited class of cases, however, such an order is immediately appealable if it concerns an issue that is \u201ccollateral to the basic controversy,\u201d <em>Maddocks </em>v. <em>Ricker, </em>403 Mass. 592, 600 (1988), and if \u201cany later appeal would be futile\u201d were the order to be presently executed. <em>Breault </em>v. <em>Chairman of the Bd. of Fire Comm\u2019rs of Springfield, </em>401 Mass. 26, 30 (1987), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Forastiere </em>v. <em>Breault, </em>485 U.S. 906 (1988). See <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775, 780 (1979), quoting <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>Plecker, </em>319 Mass. 560, 564 n.2 (1946). Thus, \u201cif an appeal from [final disposition of the case] would not be likely to protect the [party\u2019s] interests,\u201d the order is appealable. <em>Maddocks, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>In <em>Breault </em>v. <em>Chairman of the Bd. of Fire Comm\u2019rs of Springfield, supra </em>at 31, which dealt with an immunity defense under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, this court distinguished between immunity from liability and immunity from suit, holding that only orders denying immunity from suit enjoy the benefit of the present execution rule. See <em>Hopper </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>408 Mass. 621, 624 (1990) (interlocutory appeal of denial of summary judgment motion asserting immunity); <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Rakiey, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 490, 493 (1995). The right to immunity from suit would be \u201clost forever\u201d if an order denying it were not appeal-able until the close of litigation, and, thus, such an order meets the criteria of the rule of present execution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss in <em>King </em>was based on a claim of immunity under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10, which sets out several exceptions to the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act. An order denying such a motion is a \u201cfinal order\u201d meeting the criteria described above, and is immediately appealable. Section 10 of the Act confers immunity from suit, see <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Geriatric Auth. of Holyoke, </em>394 Mass. 274, 285 (1985), a right that is \u201clost as litigation proceeds past motion practice,\u201d <em>Puerto Rico Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. </em>v. <em>Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., </em>506 U.S. 139, 145 (1993). This court has noted the importance of \u201cdetermining immunity issues early if immunity is to serve one of its primary purposes: to protect public officials from harassing litigation.\u201d <em>Duarte </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>405 Mass. 43, 44 n.2 (1989). As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 525 (1985), with respect to suits against immunized officials, \u201ceven such pretrial matters as discovery are to be avoided if possible, as \u2018[ijnquiries of this kind can be peculiarly disruptive of effective government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526, quoting <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 817 (1982). In light of the desirability of resolving immunity issues quickly, it is preferable to dispose of the question before discovery, as on a motion to dismiss. See <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Silvia, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 273 (1992). We do not in fact reach this immunity issue in King vs. Commonwealth, because we conclude the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss on other grounds should have been granted. This does not, however, deprive us of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">King claims that the Commonwealth and the Middlesex district attorney\u2019s office are liable under the Massachusetts Tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Claims Act, G. L. c. 258 (Act), for the wrongful death of Anderson because his death was proximately caused by the defendants\u2019 grossly negligent release of Simpson from custody. Regardless of whether the defendants acted negligently, they are not hable under the Act for Anderson\u2019s death because they were not ultimately responsible for Simpson\u2019s release.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">King asserts that the defendants \u201callowed\u201d Simpson to be released from custody on personal recognizance. A prosecutor, however, does not have the authority to allow or disallow the release of a prisoner. Although the prosecutor may make a recommendation concerning bail, only a judge, clerk, bail commissioner, or master in chancery has the authority to set bail or release an individual on personal recognizance. See G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 57, 58. Even assuming that the prosecutor had recommended that Simpson be released on personal recognizance, and even if a judicial officer may be more likely to release a prisoner on personal recognizance where the prosecutor recommends this course of action, the fact remains that the power to release the individual is ultimately in the hands of the judicial officer, not the prosecutor. At most, King may have been able to show that, but for the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation, the judge would not have released Simpson on his own recognizance and that Simpson would have been unable to meet any bail requirements placed on him and so would have remained in custody. Such a chain of causation is too long and contains too many speculative links to connect the assistant district attorney\u2019s action to the violence that ultimately befell Anderson.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Any effect the assistant district attorney\u2019s actions may have had in effectuating Simpson\u2019s release and subsequent killing of Officer Anderson is simply too remote to serve as a source of liability under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The defendants in both of these cases argue that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are barred by the immunities set out in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>and 10 (/). Because we have concluded in King vs. Commonwealth that, as a matter of law, the defendants\u2019 actions were not a proximate cause of Simpson\u2019s release, and, thus, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>King\u2019s claims should have been dismissed, we need not decide the applicability of \u00a7 10 immunities in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In Brum <em>vs. </em>Dartmouth, the defendant town of Dartmouth invokes \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>asserting that deciding what security measures to implement at a public school is an act involving discretion on a matter of policy or planning. The essence of Brum\u2019s claim, however, is not that the school officials abused their discretion by implementing faulty security measures, but that the school had no security measures at all, in violation of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37H, which requires each school district to implement and publish school policies including \u201cstandards and procedures to assure school building security and safety of students and school personnel.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Discretionary function immunity does not apply in cases in which a government official\u2019s actions were mandated by statute or regulation. See <em>Dobos </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>404 Mass. 634, 652, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Kehoe </em>v. <em>Dobos, </em>493 U.S. 850 (1989). Section 37H clearly mandates the adoption of some measures, and, therefore, school officials have no discretion in that matter. Thus, if the school in fact had failed to adopt any security measures at all, claims based on this failure would not be barred by \u00a7 10 <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The pleadings establish that a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign and a sign asking all visitors to sign in at the school office were posted at the school. The parties disagree about whether these signs amount to \u201cstandards and procedures\u201d under \u00a7 37H. Because Brum\u2019s suit is barred by \u00a7 10 (/\"), however, see <em>infra, </em>we decline to decide whether, in the circumstances of this school at this time, these signs amounted to a security policy and, consequently, do not decide whether the town\u2019s alleged failure to adopt a school security policy would be actionable despite \u00a7 10 <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Defendants in both Brum vs. Dartmouth and King <em>vs. </em>Commonwealth argue that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against them are barred by the so-called statutory public duty rule of G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (/), which exempts from the Tort Claims Act \u201cany claim based on an act or failure to act to prevent or diminish the harmful consequences of a condition or situation, including the violent or tortious conduct of a third person, which is not originally caused by the public employer or any other person acting on behalf of the public employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">As indicated above, we need not consider this claim as it applies in King <em>vs. </em>Commonwealth. The plaintiff in Brum <em>vs. </em>Dartmouth argues that \u00a7 10 (/) does not bar her claim because the condition that led to her son\u2019s death was the lack of security on the school premises, which was originally caused by the defendants\u2019 failure to adopt security policies as they were required to do by G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37H. The Appeals Court agreed, reasoning that, by failing to implement a security policy at the school, the defendants created the \u201cinitial injury-causing condition of physical insecurity,\u201d and subsequently, by failing to apprehend the perpetrators on the day of the murder, they \u201cexacerbated the hazardous condition\u201d they had created, \u201cthereby materially contributing to the circumstances that directly led to the tortious injury. Those scenarios constitute risk-creating conduct on the part of public employees that is sufficient to overcome the bar of \u00a7 10 (/').\u201d <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 318, 326 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Thus, the plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>does not confer immunity on the defendants because the defendants \u201coriginally caused\u201d the dangerous \u201ccondition or situation\u201d that resulted in the killings by the \u201cviolent. . . conduct of a third person.\u201d But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>it is also true that those killings came about because the defendants \u201cfailed to prevent\u201d them. We are thus forced to construe the first sentence of \u00a7 10 (/) to give meaning both to what appears to be its announced principal purpose, which is to confer immunity on public employees for harm that comes about as a result of their \u201cfailure ... to prevent\u201d the \u201cviolent or tortious conduct of a third person,\u201d and to do so in the presence of the clause which removes that immunity where the \u201charmful consequences\u201d were \u201coriginally caused by the public employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">To say that \u00a7 10 (/) presents an interpretive quagmire would be an understatement. The language is convoluted and ambiguous, as evidenced by the difficulty Superior Court judges have had in applying it and the inconsistency of outcomes. The particular issue in question in these cases, the meaning of the \u201coriginally caused\u201d clause in \u00a7 10 (/), has not to date been directly addressed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The principal purpose of the provision, as we have said, must be taken to be announced in its opening clause: to exclude liability for \u201can act or failure to act to prevent or diminish\u201d certain \u201charmful consequences.\u201d Which harmful consequences? All those \u201cincluding the violent or tortious conduct of a third person.\u201d The \u201cincluding\u201d clause must modify the noun \u201cconsequences,\u201d rather than the nearer nouns \u201ccondition\u201d or \u201csituation,\u201d because conduct cannot grammatically or logically constitute \u201ca condition or situation.\u201d Thus, there is immunity in respect to all consequences except where \u201cthe condition or situation\u201d was \u201coriginally caused by the public employer.\u201d We take the \u201coriginally caused\u201d clause to modify \u201ccondition or situation,\u201d although it might also be read to qualify only the nearer term \u201cconduct of a third person.\u201d If the latter interpretation were adopted, the exception to the exclusion would apply only if the public employer had caused the third party\u2019s wrongful act and not in the broader circumstance, if it caused the \u201ccondition or situation\u201d leading to \u201charmful consequences\u201d generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s contention is that the neglect of duty by the school officials in Brum w. Dartmouth \u201coriginally caused\u201d the \u201ccondition[s] or situation[s]\u201d of which either the killers\u2019 acts or the death of their victim were \u201cthe harmful consequences.\u201d But if a neglect of duty can be taken to \u201coriginally cause[]\u201d such a \u201csituation,\u201d then the opening words of \u00a7 10 (/'), immunizing \u201cact[s] or failure[s] to act to prevent,\u201d which we take to an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>nounce the provision\u2019s principal purpose, would be virtually read out of the provision. What plaintiff describes as the defendants\u2019 neglect of duty just <em>was </em>\u201ca failure to act to prevent or diminish.\u201d And that is the burden of Justice Kass\u2019s pithy dissent in Brum: \u201cThe school authorities might have <em>prevented </em>the killing but failing to prevent, under the statute, is in the excluded category\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Brum, supra </em>at 329 (Kass, J., dissenting). Indeed, on the plaintiff\u2019s and the Appeals Court\u2019s interpretation, practically every \u201cfailure to prevent\u201d might be recast in this way as \u201coriginally caus[ing]\u201d a condition, the \u201charmful consequences\u201d of which are the wrongful \u201cconduct of a third person\u201d and the ensuing harm to the plaintiff, and the exception would swallow the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">We acknowledge that, if the principal clause is not qualified out of existence in the way that the Appeals Court and the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation would do, we are hard put to discover what the range of application of the subordinate exception to the exclusion \u2014 \u201coriginally caused\u201d \u201charmful consequences\u201d \u2014 might be. What is needed is an example of a condition leading to a harmful consequence, where that condition was originally caused by the public employer but not brought about by the public employer\u2019s failure to prevent it. Many frequently recurring situations are the subject of specific provisions elsewhere in \u00a7 10. See, e.g., \u00a710 <em>if) </em>(claim based on failure to inspect); \u00a7 10 <em>(i) </em>(claim based on release of prisoner); \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>(3) (claim based on negligent maintenance of public property). Some of these specific provisions require exclusion of liability, some withdraw the exclusion, and some \u2014 \u00a7 10 (i), for example \u2014 do both. As they point in all directions, it is best not to look to these specific provisions to elucidate the obscure and convoluted meaning of \u00a7 10 <em>(j), </em>but rather to allow them to stand on their own bottoms, applying them directly where appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The history of the provision and subsequent decisions of this court provide some confirmation of our conclusion to apply \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>to exclude liability here. Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Cyran </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>413 Mass. 452, 467 (1992), which preceded enactment of the statute, uses the words \u201coriginally caused\u201d and is a likely source for the language used in the statute. That case dealt with the common-law \u201cpublic duty rule,\u201d which provided, as a general rule, that \u201cno liability attaches for failure to use due care in carrying out general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>governmental functions . . . because the duty of due care is owed to the general public and not to any specific individual.\u201d <em>Cyran, supra </em>at 455, quoting <em>Dinsky </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>386 Mass. 801, 807 (1982). The concurring opinion would have applied that rule to bar government tort liability where \u201ca plaintiff has been harmed by a condition or situation which was not originally caused by the public employee, and is attributable to the employee only in the sense that the employee failed to prevent or mitigate it.\u201d <em>Cyran, supra </em>at 467 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). And that is what w\u00bf have identified, from the text itself, as the most eligible principal thrust of the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The circumstances surrounding the enactment of \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>also provide some insight into the meaning of the section.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Subsections <em>(d) </em>through <em>(j) </em>of \u00a7 10 were added to the Tort Claims Act by St. 1993, c. 495, \u00a7 57, effective January, 1994. That amendment was passed shortly after this court in <em>Jean </em>W. v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>414 Mass. 496, 499 (1993), announced its intention to do away with the common-law public duty rule at the next available opportunity after the close of the 1993 legislative ses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>sion because that rule appeared to be inconsistent with the Tort Claims Act and had proved impossible to apply in a consistent fashion. Since \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>was enacted, this court has noted that it is, in effect, a \u201cstatutory public duty rule providing governmental immunity.\u201d <em>Carleton </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>418 Mass. 623, 627 (1994). It is clear, therefore, that \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>was intended to provide some substantial measure of immunity from tort liability to government employers. In light of this, we must not adopt an interpretation of the statute that construes the words \u201coriginally caused\u201d so broadly as to encompass the remotest causation and preclude immunity in nearly all circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The construction of the statute adopted here is consistent with the few opinions of this court that have decided cases under \u00a7 10 <em>(j), </em>although none of those cases has defined original causation. In <em>Bonnie W. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>419 Mass. 122, 125 (1994), the plaintiff, who had been sexually assaulted by a probationer employed as a maintenance worker in the trailer park where she lived, brought suit under the Tort Claims Act, alleging that, by recommending her assailant for employment at the park and by failing to supervise him properly under the parole board rules, his parole officer had been responsible for her injuries. Without discussing the meaning of the words \u201coriginally caused,\u201d this court decided that \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>barred her claim regarding the parole officer\u2019s negligent failure to supervise, but did not bar her claim alleging the officer\u2019s negligence in recommending the assailant for employment at the trailer park. The officer\u2019s failure to supervise, barred by \u00a7 10 (/), can be characterized only as failure to prevent the assailant from being in a position to attack the plaintiff, whereas the negligent recommendation was an affirmative act on the part of the officer that created a situation in which a sexual predator held a job giving him access to the keys to every trailer in the park. This distinction is consistent with our decision in this case. In <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>422 Mass. 406, 409 (1996), the plaintiff\u2019s suit was not barred by \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>because it fell within one of the specific statutory exceptionsto \u00a7 10 <em>(j),</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but this court noted in dicta that, if the exception had not applied, \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>would have immunized the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>defendants. In that case, after being robbed outside the store where he worked, the plaintiff agreed to testify before a grand jury. The police promised to protect him when he closed the store each night and did so for three nights, but, on the fourth night, no police officer was outside when the plaintiff closed the store, and an armed assailant shot him in the face. See <em>id. </em>at 407. The plaintiff\u2019s claim that the police negligently failed to prevent his injuries is similar to Brum\u2019s claim in the instant case that the school failed to protect Robinson from his attackers. In Lawrence, the police could not be taken to have originally caused the criminal conduct of the individual who shot the plaintiff, just as here the school had not originally caused the actions of the persons who killed Robinson. As the plaintiff\u2019s claim in <em>Lawrence </em>would have been barred by \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>if the exception for \u201cclaim[s] based upon explicit and specific assurances,\u201d G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>(1), had not applied, the plaintiff\u2019s claim in this case is barred by \u00a7 10 (/').</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In sum, the principal purpose of \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>is to preclude liability for failures to prevent or diminish harm, including harm brought about by the wrongful act of a third party. And to interpret, as the Appeals Court did, the subordinate clause referring to \u201coriginally caused\u201d conditions, to include conditions that are, in effect, failures to prevent harm, would undermine that principal purpose. Accordingly, we conclude that, in Brum v\u00ed. Dartmouth, \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>excludes the defendants\u2019 liability for their failure to prevent the killing. King vj. Commonwealth presents an easier case because the killing in that case was so far removed from the prosecutor\u2019s misfeasance, if misfeasance it was, that it cannot even be taken to be a proximate cause or \u201cfailure to prevent\u201d it at all. Because the defendants\u2019 liability in that case is excluded on other grounds, we need not resolve the issue of the application of \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The plaintiff in King <em>vs. </em>Commonwealth claims that \u00a7 10 <em>(i) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>establishes that where a plaintiff can make out a claim that a government actor has acted with gross negligence in releasing an individual, the other immunities provided by \u00a7 10 cannot operate to bar that claim. Section 10 (z) excepts from the Tort Claims Act any \u201cclaim based upon the release, parole, furlough or escape of any person . . . from the custody of a public employee . . . unless gross negligence is shown in allowing such release, parole, furlough or escape.\u201d The plaintiff argues that \u00a7 10 (z) creates a cause of action for gross negligence and that, if the immunities provided by \u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>and <em>(j) </em>were applied to bar claims under \u00a7 10 (z), the cause of action created by \u00a7 10 (z) would be effectively read out of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">This argument is meritless. Section 10 (z) creates no cause of action for gross negligence. Subsection (i), like the other subsections of \u00a7 10, creates an immunity from suit; the provision regarding cases of gross negligence is an exception to that immunity. Thus, a claim alleging gross negligence in releasing an individual may be brought invoking the exception to \u00a7 10 (z) only if no other immunity under \u00a7 10 bars the claim. The immunities provided by \u00a7 10 operate in the alternative; even if one immunity contains an exception that would permit a claim to be brought, that claim is barred if any of the other immunities apply. Whether or not King\u2019s claim would be barred by either \u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>or \u00a7 10 <em>(j), </em>we need not consider whether the plaintiff\u2019s claim could survive \u00a7 10 (z), because we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct cannot, as a matter of law, be considered a proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s harm. Accordingly, we need not address whether the plaintiff adequately stated a claim for gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Brum asserts a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that, by failing to protect her son from harm while in school, the defendants violated his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Not all torts recognized by State law give rise to liability under \u00a7 1983. See <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 332 (1986), quoting <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 701 (1976) (Fourteenth Amendment not a \u201cfont of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever systems may already be administered by the States\u201d); <em>Martinez </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number><em>California, </em>444 U.S. 277, 285 (1980) (\u201cnot every injury in which a state official has played some part is actionable\u201d under \u00a7 1983). To state a cause of action under that statute, a plaintiff must allege the deprivation of a Federal constitutional or statutory right; \u00a7 1983 itself creates no substantive rights. See <em>Martinez, supra </em>at 283; <em>Leffall </em>v. <em>Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>28 F.3d 521, 525 (5th Cir. 1994); <em>Maldonado </em>v. <em>Josey, </em>975 F.2d 727, 729 (10th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 914 (1993); <em>Cornelius </em>v. <em>Highland Lake, </em>880 F.2d 348, 352 (11th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1066 (1990); <em>Estate of Gilmore </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>787 F.2d 714, 719 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 882 (1986); <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Byrne, </em>738 F.2d 1443, 1445 (7th Cir. 1984), citing <em>Baker </em>v. <em>McCollan, </em>443 U.S. 137, 146-147 (1979). Therefore, our first inquiry must be whether Robinson enjoyed any due process right to be protected by school officials from whatever harm he might encounter while attending school.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The due process clause, generally, operates as a restriction against \u201cunwarranted government interference\u201d but does not guarantee citizens protection from dangers posed by nongovernmental sources. <em>DeShaney </em>v. <em>Winnebago County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>489 U.S. 189, 196-197 (1989), quoting <em>Harris </em>v. <em>McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 317-318 (1980). The due process clause is not an \u201caffirmative charter of governmental duties\u201d and does not guarantee \u201ccertain minimal levels of safety and security\u201d in private life. <em>J.O. </em>v. <em>Alton Community Unit Sch. Dist. 11, </em>909 F.2d 267, 272 (7th Cir. 1990), quoting <em>DeShaney, supra. </em>See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Joliet, </em>715 F.2d 1200, 1203 (7th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1049 (1984). Therefore, as the Supreme Court explicitly concluded in <em>DeShaney </em>v. <em>Winnebago County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., supra </em>at 196-197, a \u201cState\u2019s failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause.\u201d See <em>D.R. </em>v. <em>Middle Bucks Area Vocational Tech. Sch., </em>972 F.2d 1364, 1369 (3d Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1079 (1993); <em>L.W. </em>v. <em>Grubbs, 974 </em>F.2d 119, 121 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 951 (1993); <em>Estate of Gilmore, supra </em>at 720. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has also explicitly addressed this issue, holding that \u201cthere is no constitutional right to be protected by the state against being murdered by criminals or madmen. It is monstrous if the state fails to protect its residents against such predators but it does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment .... [The Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>does not require] the state to provide services, even so elementary a service as maintaining law and order.\u201d <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>DeVito, </em>686 F.2d 616, 618 (7th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The facts pleaded in Brum vs. Dartmouth indicate that Robinson\u2019s death was caused by three private individuals who invaded the school uninvited, none of whom can be considered a school official or in any way an agent of the State. Therefore, unless an exception to the reasoning of <em>DeShaney </em>applies to this case, the school owed no duty of protection to Robinson, and Brum\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Brum asserts that she has stated a valid claim under \u00a7 1983 because her case falls within two exceptions to the rule of <em>De-Shaney </em>that the government has no duty to protect individuals from harm at the hands of private actors.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">First, Brum argues that her son was in a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the school. When such a relationship exists, the government has an affirmative duty to protect an individual from private harm. The <em>DeShaney </em>Court explicitly noted this \u201cspecial relationship\u201d exception to its ruling, but spoke of it only in terms of custody situations, mentioning, by way of example, incarcerated individuals and those who have been involuntarily committed to state psychiatric facilities. See <em>DeShaney, supra </em>at 200. See also <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Phyfer, </em>761 F.2d 642, 644-645 (11th Cir. 1985). \u201c[W]hen the State takes a person into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>its custody and holds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general well-being.\u201d <em>DeShaney, supra </em>at 199-200. The source of this duty to the person in custody is neither the government\u2019s knowledge of any particular danger to the individual nor any governmental promise of aid to the individual, but the \u201cState\u2019s affirmative act of restraining the individual\u2019s freedom to act on his own behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Brum urges us either to hold that a special relationship may exist in noncustodial situations or, alternatively, that a high school student is in school custody. The case law interpreting <em>DeShaney, </em>however, weighs heavily against any such holding. Several courts have considered whether a special relationship might exist in a noncustodial situation. Although some have indicated a willingness to extend the special relationship exception to circumstances other than prisons or State psychiatric institutions, the concept of custody or State restriction of movement remains central to the creation of a special relationship. See, e.g., <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>20 F.3d 1350, 1355 (5th Cir. 1994), 44 F.3d 1297 (5th Cir. 1995) (special relationship may exist with respect to \u201cother categories of persons in custody by means of \u2018similar restraints of personal liberty,\u2019 \u201d including handicapped students in custody of residential special education school twenty-four hours a day who are \u201cnot free to leave\u201d school premises); <em>Middle Bucks Area Vocational Tech. Sch., </em>972 F.2d 1364, 1369 (3d Cir. 1992); <em>Estate of Gilmore, supra </em>at 722 (special relationship might be created if state, by exercising \u201ccustody or control. . . effectively strips [victim] of her capacity to defend herself\u201d). Other courts, such as the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Independent Sch. Dist. No. I-89, </em>22 F.3d 991, 995 (10th Cir. 1994), have explicitly refused to acknowledge an affirmative duty to protect in the \u201cabsence of a custodial relationship.\u201d The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in a case involving harm to a mentally ill person residing at a State-run group home, found no special relationship between the plaintiff and the State because the plaintiff had voluntarily committed himself to the facility; \u201che was not being held \u2018against his will,\u2019 nor had the state used its sovereign power to \u2018render[] him unable to care for himself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>Dorchester Counseling Ctr., Inc., </em>961 F.2d 987, 991 (1st Cir. 1992). The court acknowledged the individual\u2019s close relationship with the State, but decided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>the case was governed by the general rule of <em>DeShaney. </em>See <em>Monahan, supra </em>at 990. The State had not taken the \u201caffirmative act\u201d of restraining the plaintiff\u2019s liberty; therefore, it had acquired no duty to protect him. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Because the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>DeShaney </em>makes clear that the special relationship exception applies only to individuals in State custody, we must consider whether Robinson was in the custody of the defendants at the time he was murdered. The circuit courts that have considered this question have uniformly decided that a student in Robinson\u2019s position is not in the custody of the school.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>infra. </em>Many cases that have raised the issue have dealt with situations in which the student injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>was mandated by compulsory education laws to be in school at the time the harm occurred. It might be argued that truancy laws create a close analogy to the custodial circumstances described in <em>DeShaney. </em>But, even in such cases, the courts have found that a school\u2019s authority over its students \u201ccannot be said to create the type of physical custody necessary to bring it within the special relationship noted in <em>DeShaney.\u201d Middle Bucks Area Vocational Tech. Sch., supra </em>at 1372. <em>See Armijo </em>v. <em>Wagon Mound Pub. Schs., </em>159 F.3d. 1253, 1261 (10th Cir. 1998), quoting <em>Seamons </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>84 F.3d 1226, 1235-1236 (10th Cir. 1996); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Hillsboro Indep. Sch.

Supp. 56, 60 (D.P.R. 1990) (\u201c[although young children are required by law to attend school and it may be said that these children are under the custody of the state while they attend classes, the determining factor in this case is that the death of [the victim] was caused solely by a private individual\u201d); <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Fannin County Sch. Dist., </em>784 F. Supp. 1576, 1582-1583 (N.D. Ga. 1992). Cf. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Dallas Indep. Sch.

In <em>Sargi </em>v. <em>Kent City Bd. of Educ., </em>70 F.3d 907, 911 (6th Cir. 1995), for example, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the school owed no duty to protect a child riding a school bus because a special relationship \u201ccan only arise when the state restrains an individual,\u201d the child was not compelled by law to ride the school bus, and the fact that alternatives to the school bus \u201cmay be limited for practical or financial reasons\u201d was not enough to give rise to a custodial relationship. See <em>Black </em>v. <em>Indiana Area Sch. Dist., </em>985 F.2d 707, 714 (3d Cir. 1993) (no special relationship between school and students molested by private party on school bus where bus riding not compulsory). In <em>Leffall </em>v. <em>Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>28 F.3d 521, 529 (5th Cir. 1994), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the school owed no duty of protection to a student attending an after-school dance because the student was not compelled to attend and because \u201cany special relationship that may have existed lapsed when compulsory school attendance ended.\u201d See also <em>Santamorena </em>v. <em>Georgia Military College, </em>147 F.3d 1337, 1341 n.10 (11th Cir. 1998) (no special relationship where parents voluntarily enrolled student in State-run residential military college); <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Umsted, </em>131 F.3d 697, 703 (7th Cir. 1997) (no special relationship between State and mentally handicapped student where parents voluntarily enrolled student in State-run residential school); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Duval County Sch. Bd., </em>107 F.3d 837, 838-840 (11th Cir. 1997) (no special relationship between student and school when student was killed by private party during voluntary school-sponsored program). But see <em>Spivey </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>41 F.3d 1497, 1526 (11th Cir. 1994) (special relationship existed between State and student in residential school for the deaf, even though parents voluntarily enrolled student in school; \u201cquestion is not so much how the individual got into state custody, but to what extent the State exercises dominion and control over that individual\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In the instant case, Brum\u2019s son, who had passed his sixteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>birthday on the day he was killed, was not compelled to attend school. See G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1. Robinson was not in a custodial relationship with the school, nor was he in a situation so analogous to custody as to create a due process right to be protected by the defendants from harm.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">This outcome is not changed by Brum\u2019s allegation that the defendants were aware of the danger to Robinson on the day he was killed. The <em>DeShaney </em>Court specifically stated that the source of the special relationship between the government and those in its custody is not a \u201cknowledge of the individual\u2019s predicament.\u201d <em>DeShaney, supra </em>at 200. Other courts have held that where a third party, and not a government actor, injured the plaintiff, the fact that the government defendants were aware of the potential danger did not render them liable. See <em>Graham, supra </em>at 994 (\u201cforeseeability [of the danger] cannot create an affirmative duty to protect when plaintiff remains unable to allege a custodial relationship\u201d); <em>Estate of Gilmore, supra </em>at 722 (rejecting argument that knowledge that \u201cthird party poses a special danger to an identified victim will alone support a claim for relief under section 1983\u201d); <em>Arroyo, supra </em>at 61 (\u201c[although the defendants may have known of other shooting incidents or violent acts that had taken place on school premises, the injury here was caused by a third person and not by a school official\u201d); <em>Russell, supra </em>at 1581 (citing <em>DeShaney </em>as deciding \u201ceven when state officials know that a person is in imminent harm from a third party,\u201d United States Constitution imposes no duty to protect). Nor does the fact that the defendants may have had a state-law duty under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37H, to adopt security policies expose them to liability under \u00a7 1983. \u201c[I]n light of <em>DeShaney, </em>the Court cannot rely on state laws that impose on state agents an affirmative duty of protection as the premise for federal constitutional liability when the injury is caused by a private third person.\u201d <em>Arroyo, supra </em>at 60. Section 1983 does not create a Federal right of action for every act that may be actionable under State law, see <em>Martinez, supra </em>at 285, and acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>that are merely negligent based upon State law principles do not necessarily implicate the due process clause, see <em>Daniels, supra </em>at 328 (neither \u201cnegligent act[s] of an official causing unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty, or property\u201d nor \u201cmere lack of due care by a state official\u201d implicates due process clause of Fourteenth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The plaintiff in Brum v\u00ed. Dartmouth also argues that her case falls within the \u201cstate-created danger\u201d exception to the rule of <em>DeShaney. </em>This doctrine is derived from the <em>DeShaney </em>Court\u2019s comment that the State had \u201cplayed no part in [the dangers\u2019] creation, nor did it do anything to render [the plaintiff] any more vulnerable to them.\u201d <em>DeShaney, supra </em>at 201. It is used by the courts that have adopted it \u201cto find a constitutional tort duty under \u00a7 1983 outside of a strictly custodial context,\u201d <em>Middle Bucks Area Vocational Tech. Sch., supra </em>at 1373; see <em>L.W. </em>v. <em>Grubbs, supra </em>at 122, and provides that the government may have a duty to protect an individual from harm by a third party where the State actor was culpable in \u201caffirmatively placing an individual in a position of danger, effectively stripping a person of her ability to defend herself, or cutting off potential sources of private aid,\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., supra </em>at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The courts that have adopted this doctrine have uniformly held that, to be liable under it, a government defendant must have committed an affirmative act placing the victim in danger. It must have \u201cused [its] authority to create an opportunity that would not otherwise have existed for the third party\u2019s crime to occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Middle Bucks Area Vocational Tech. Sch., supra </em>at 1374-1375 (liability \u201cpredicated upon the states\u2019 affirmative acts which work to plaintiffs\u2019 detriments in terms of exposure to danger . . . [T]he state can fairly be said to have affirmatively acted to create the danger to the victims\u201d); <em>L.W. </em>v. <em>Grubbs, supra </em>at 121; <em>Estate of Gilmore, supra </em>at 721-722 (furloughed prisoner who murdered plaintiff\u2019s decedent \u201cwas in no sense an agent of the state. The state played no part in creating the threat that [he] posed to [the decedent], [his] murderous design was independently conceived and executed, and the state neither condoned nor encouraged his behavior\u201d). As the United States Court of Appeals for the First and Eighth Circuits have written, merely increasing an already existing risk of harm from a private source is insufficient to create governmental liability under this doctrine. See <em>Monahan, supra </em>at 993 (rendering plaintiff \u201cmore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>vulnerable to danger\u201d not \u201cthe kind of \u2018affirmative act\u2019 \u201d giving rise to constitutional duty); <em>Dorothy J. </em>v. <em>Little Rock Sch. Dist., </em>7 F.3d 729, 734 (8th Cir. 1993). \u201cSuch a ruling would make \u00a7 1983 virtually coterminous with traditional tort law, the very expansion of constitutional tort liability that the Supreme Court has rejected.\u201d <em>Dorothy J., supra </em>at 734. Nor is failure to protect an individual from injury at the hands of a private actor the type of act which confers liability under this doctrine. See <em>Monahan, supra </em>at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Courts have rejected application of this doctrine in circumstances very similar to those in the instant case. For example, in <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Independent School Dist. No. 1-89, supra </em>at 995, a student was killed by another student who, to school officials\u2019 knowledge, had previously threatened the victim and was on school grounds with a gun, and school officials failed to protect the victim from this known threat. Yet the court held that the school was not liable under the State-created danger doctrine because plaintiffs could not \u201cpoint to any affirmative actions by the defendants that created or increased the danger to the victim[].\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., supra </em>at 202 (rejecting liability under State-created danger doctrine because \u201c[n]o state actor placed [the student] in a \u2018unique, confrontational encounter\u2019 with a violent criminal.... No official in the performance of her duties abandoned him in a crack house or released a known criminal in front of his locker. . . . [T]he facts here pleaded suggest only that [the student] was the tragic victim of random criminal conduct rather than of school officials\u2019 deliberate, callous decisions to interpose him in the midst of a criminally dangerous environment\u201d); <em>Sargi, supra </em>at 913 (\u201cno evidence that the Board took any affirmative action that exposed decedent to any danger to which she was not already exposed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The defendants in the instant case did not create the danger that resulted in Robinson\u2019s death. They neither created the three assailants\u2019 murderous intent nor invited them onto school property. \u201cThe most that can be said of the state functionaries in this case is that they stood by and did nothing when suspicious circumstances dictated a more active role for them.\u201d <em>De-Shaney, supra </em>at 203. This inaction does not make the defendants liable under \u00a7 1983. See <em>id.-, Graham, supra </em>at 995 (\u201cInaction by the state in the face of a known danger is not enough to trigger the obligation [to protect]; according to <em>De-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number><em>Shaney, </em>the state must have limited in some way the liberty of a citizen to act on his own behalf\u201d); <em>Estate of Gilmore, supra </em>at 721 (no liability under \u00a7 1983 because, \u201cirrespective of any knowledge the state defendants had of the special danger that [the assailant] posed to [the victim, it] did nothing to render [her] any more or less capable of defending herself from a violent attacker than any other member of the general public\u201d). Nor does the defendants\u2019 failure, if any, to follow the State law requirements of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37H, make them liable under the State-created danger doctrine. See <em>Middle Bucks Area Vocational Tech. Sch., supra </em>at 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Because the plaintiff in Brum vs. Dartmouth has failed to allege a violation of any constitutional right, she has not made out a valid claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We need not, therefore, address the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the availability to defendants of a qualified immunity defense. See <em>Estate of Gilmore, supra </em>at 723; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Fannin County Sch. Dist., </em>784 F. Supp. 1576, 1582-1583 (N.D.

In order to make out a claim under \u00a7 111,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which incorporates by reference G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H, the plaintiff must prove that the defendants used \u201cthreats, intimidation or coercion\u201d to interfere with, or attempt to interfere with, rights secured by the. Constitution or laws of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of W.

As the Appeals Court noted, the Superior Court judge correctly held that the \u201ccomplaint failed to allege, however liberally construed, the requisite threats, intimidation or coercion required to give rise to a claim under\u201d G.

L. c. 71, \u00a7 37H \u2014 mandating adoption of security measures by school committees \u2014 was added to the statute in an amendment taking effect in June, 1993 (St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 36), and, therefore, was not in effect at the time of Robinson\u2019s death in April, 1993. Were that true, the discretionary function would clearly apply, and the plaintiff\u2019s claim would be disposed of easily.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">As Brum\u2019s counsel pointed out in a postargument letter to this court, however, the language of \u00a7 37H has, since 1987, stated that: \u201c[e]ach school committee\u2019s rules or regulations pertaining to the conduct of students shall include the following: . . . procedures to assure school building security and safety of students and school personnel . . . .\u201d The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d makes adoption of security measures mandatory, and the 1993 amendments, which in no way changed this provision, are irrelevant to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Counsel for the town quoted, as support for its argument, G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37, which is entirely separate from \u00a7 37H, and which, before June, 1993, contained the word \u201cmay\u201d with reference to school committees\u2019 adoption of policies regarding the length of the school week and year. It was rewritten in 1993 to use the word \u201cshall.\u201d St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 35. It is not apparent how that provision is in any way relevant to whether schools are compelled to adopt security policies. Therefore, the fact that its language was changed from \u201cmay\u201d to \u201cshall\u201d is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b718-6\"> The plaintiffs as well as the Appeals Court and several decisions by Superior Court judges have cited Glannon, Liability for \u201cPublic Duties\u201d Under the Tort Claims Act: The Legislature Reconsiders the Public Duty Rule, 79 Mass. L. Rev. 17 (1994), as a source of clarification of the meaning of \u00a7 10 <em>(j). </em>See, e.g., Enterprise Rent A Car of Boston, Inc. vs. Imbrogna, No. Civ. A. 94-2000 (Norfolk Superior Court July 2, 1996); McConnell vs. Dooling, No. Civ. A. 94-1503 (Norfolk Superior Court June 7, 1995); Hardy vs. Somerville, No. Civ. A. 94-2979 (Middlesex Superior Court Dec. 15, 1994). That article, of course, is not part of the legislative history of the statute \u2014 not even part of what is sometimes oxymoronically called subsequent legislative history \u2014 and should not be treated as such, notwithstanding the fact that Professor Glannon \u201cparticipated in the committee discussions which led to\u201d \u00a7 10 (/'). Glannon, <em>supra </em>at 17 n.*. In fact, the article, although its description of the statute is useful in a number of respects, perpetuates some of the confusion caused by the statute. It argues, for example, that \u00a7 10 <em>(j) </em>would not bar a suit brought by the parents of a child injured on the schoolyard by another child where the injury occurred under the negligent supervision of a government-employed teacher, but fails to provide any adequate explanation of how such a situation differs from other scenarios \u2014 such as one he mentions in which a child is bitten by a rabid raccoon after the public health director had been notified of the raccoon\u2019s presence and negligently delayed in responding until after the child had been bitten \u2014 which, Glannon argues, may not be the basis of a Tort Claims Act suit due to \u00a7 10 (/'). It will not do (and Glannon does not suggest that it should) to account for the difference by noting that the child\u2019s act but not the raccoon\u2019s bite is \u201cthe violent . . . conduct of a third person,\u201d because by its terms such an act of a third person is included in the circumstances giving rise to immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b719-6\"> \u201cSection 10 <em>(j) </em>provides that its exception to liability \u201cshall not apply to: (1) any claim based upon explicit and specific assurances of safety or assistance, beyond general representations that investigation or assistance will be or has been undertaken, made to the direct victim or a member of his fam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>ily or household by a public employee, provided that the injury resulted in part from reliance on those assurances. A permit, certificate or report of findings of an investigation or inspection shall not constitute such assurances of safety or assistance; and (2) any claim based upon the intervention of a public employee which causes injury to the victim or places the victim in a worse position than he was in before the intervention; and (3) any claim based on negligent maintenance of public property; (4) any claim by or on behalf of a patient for negligent medical or other therapeutic treatment received by the patient from a public employee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\"> Brum provides at least two other arguments why she has stated a valid cause of action despite the rule of <em>DeShaney </em>v. <em>Winnebago County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>489 U.S. 189 (1989). The first, and most curious, is that <em>DeShaney\u2019s </em>holding that the due process clause \u201cdoes not protect people from private violence\u201d is not \u201ca majority opinion among the jurisdictions.\u201d Apart from being incorrect as a matter of fact, this statement would be unhelpful to her case even if it were true. Once the Supreme Court of the United States has decided an issue of law under the United States Constitution, we need not consider whether the majority of the jurisdictions are in agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">Second, the plaintiff argues that municipal policymakers may be held liable, regardless of the presence of a \u201cspecial relationship,\u201d see <em>infra, </em>under the ruling in <em>Stoneking </em>v. <em>Bradford Area Sch. Dist., </em>882 F.2d 720, 726 (3d Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1044 (1990). This argument need not be discussed at length because the holding of <em>Stoneking </em>is explicitly limited to violations of constitutional rights by State actors. In a case such as the present one, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit itself has stated that \u201c\u00a7 1983 liability may not be predicated upon a Stoneking-type theory because private actors committed the underlying violative acts.\u201d <em>D.R. </em>v. <em>Middle Bucks Area Vocational Tech. Sch., </em>972 F.2d 1364, 1376 (3d Cir. 1992), cert. denied, <em>506 </em>U.S. 1079 (1993). See <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Fannin County Sch. Dist., </em>784 F. Supp. 1576, 1581 (N.D. Ga. 1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b725-6\"> None of the cases on which Brum relies alters this conclusion. The only Federal circuit opinion cited by Brum on this topic is <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Taylor Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>975 F.2d 137, 146 (5th Cir. 1992), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Caplinger </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>506 U.S. 1087 (1993). There, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit decided that the State acquired a duty to a student where the State \u201chas in some significant way separated the child from the persons otherwise responsible for taking precautions to shield the child from the social milieu.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Not only was that opinion vacated and the case reheard, 15 F.3d 443 (5th Cir. 1994), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Lankford </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>513 U.S. 815 (1994), but, even if it were still valid, it would be unhelpful to Brum\u2019s case because a State-employed teacher, and not a private third party, caused the injury in question in that case, <em>Taylor Indep Sch. Dist., supra </em>at 146, and the court specifically noted that the school\u2019s duty, \u201cas it pertains to injuries inflicted by someone other than\u201d a school employee, \u201cis not before us.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148 n.14. Moreover, compulsory attendance laws were in effect in that case. See <em>infra </em>for a discussion of the relevance of such laws. Brum\u2019s reliance on <em>Waechter </em>v. <em>School Dist. No. 14-030 of Cassopolis, </em>773 F. Supp. 1005, 1009 (W.D. Mich. 1991) (\u201c[I]t is clear that decedent [student] was in a custodial relationship with defendant [teacher]\u201d), is similarly misplaced because the harm to the student was caused by a public school teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The only other cases cited by Brum for the proposition that schools owe some duty of protection to their students depend on facts involving a situation more analogous to custody than the facts in the instant case. Two district court \u25a0 cases that found that a student is owed some duty of care by the school specifically cited compulsory education laws as a basis for their holdings. See <em>Lichtler </em>v. <em>County of Orange, </em>813 F. Supp. 1054, 1056 (S.D.N.Y. 1993); <em>Pa-gano </em>v. <em>Massapequa Pub. Schs., </em>714 F. Supp. 641, 643 (E.D.N.Y. 1989) (elementary school students, \u201ctruancy laws still being in effect, [are] owed some duty of care by defendants\u201d). In holding that compulsory education laws create a duty to protect on the part of school officials, these courts are distinctly in the minority. See <em>infra. Walton </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>20 F.3d 1350 (5th Cir. 1994), also cited by Brum, involved a handicapped student attending a residential school who was in the day-and-night custody of school officials and was not allowed to leave the premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b728-6\"> Because Brum has not stated a viable cause of action under the due process clause and \u00a7 1983, this court need not address her claim that the defendants acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to the threat of harm to Robinson. Even if the alleged indifference violated some duty under state tort law, because the defendants\u2019 \u201cmisconduct violated no constitutional duty . . . [the plaintiff\u2019s] remedies ... lie in the arena of tort, not constitutional law.\u201d <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>Dorchester Counseling Ctr., Inc., </em>961 F.2d 987, 990-991 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\"> General Laws c. 12, \u00a7 111, provides: \u201cAny person whose exercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the United States, or of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the commonwealth, has been interfered with, or attempted to be interfered with, as described in section 11H, may institute and prosecute in his own name and on his own behalf a civil action for injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief . . . including the award of compensatory money damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">General Laws c. 12, \u00a7 11H, referred to by \u00a7 111, states: \u201cWhenever any person or persons, whether or not acting under color of law, interfere by threats, intimidation or coercion, or attempt to interfere by threats, intimidation or coercion, with the exercise or enjoyment by any other person or persons of rights secured by the constitution or laws ... of the commonwealth, the attorney general may bring a civil action for injunctive or other appropriate equitable relief.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b732-10\"> The plaintiff\u2019s argument on appeal that the defendants\u2019 failure to provide a safe environment constituted a \u201cnon-physical threat to students\u2019 well-being\u201d is purely semantic and borders on the frivolous. Although the word \u201cthreat\u201d may be used to connote \u201cdanger,\u201d as it does in Brum\u2019s argument, that mean: ing of the word is obviously not the one intended in \u00a7 11H.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b732-11\"> We are in complete sympathy with the concurrence\u2019s observations that it is unfortunate that school officials should .escape all legal accountability for their failure to protect the children under their supervision.

I believe, however, that the result in Brum vs. Dartmouth is unfortunate. Although constrained by the words of the statute and the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in <em>DeShaney </em>to reach that result, I believe that the practical effect of today\u2019s ruling is wrong because I think that parents reasonably should be able to expect that the schools to which they entrust their children will take reasonable steps to protect their children from harm where, as here, the school officials are put on notice that the children are or may well be in jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Local schools lie at the heart of our communities. Each morning, parents across the Commonwealth send their children off to school. They entrust the schools with nothing less than the safety and well-being of those most dear to them \u2014 their own children. No arm of government touches more closely the core of our families and our children than our schools. <em>Care &amp; Protection of Charles, </em>399 Mass. 324, 334-335 (1987), reminds us of the \u201ccrucial importance\u201d we all place \u201cin the education of [our] children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335. Underlying the crucial role schools play in our children\u2019s lives and, in fact, the entire relationship between school and family is the parents\u2019 basic assumption that school officials will do all they can to protect the children who they entrust to the school\u2019s care. In apparent recognition of this responsibility, the Legislature requires that each school district implement and publish \u201cstandards and procedures <em>to assure </em>school building security and <em>safety of students </em>and school personnel\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37H. One could reasonably assume from that that the security measures mandated by the statute are intended to protect students against dangers \u201coriginally caused\u201d by persons other than \u201cthe public employer\u201d who happens to be on school property.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In the present case, the school principal was told that the assailants had threatened to return to the school and retaliate against the students who were involved in a prior altercation. Apparently, the school took no action in response to that warning. Several school officials then witnessed three armed individuals enter the school, but again they took no action. Those armed individuals then stabbed Robinson to death in front of his classmates as he sat in a classroom. At the time that he was stabbed, the school\u2019s security \u201cstandards and procedures\u201d \u2014 if one could refer to them as such.\u2014 consisted of a \u201cno-trespassing\u201d sign and a sign asking visitors to report to the school office. See <em>ante </em>at 691. On such facts, parents should be able to submit to a jury the claim that the school breached a duty owed to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">While G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37H, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 <em>(j), </em>and <em>De-Shanery, supra, </em>may compel the outcome we reach today, I believe that parents should be entitled to believe that the school officials to whom they entrust their children will not be deliberately indifferent and simply stand by and do nothing when made aware of an imminent threat to the safety of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>children. I believe, too, that school officials should not be allowed to figuratively shrug and say, \u201cthe problem did not originate with us, so we are not responsible.\u201d While not absolute guarantors of safety, school officials should, at the least, be expected to take reasonable measures to protect children when they have advance notice of danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">This entire matter is within the control of the Legislature, which, I hope, will act to impose an obligation on school districts, and to ensure that the restrictions in the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act do not apply to these cases.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
