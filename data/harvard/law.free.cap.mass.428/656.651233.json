The respondent makes numerous challenges to the two-year suspension recommended by the Board of Bar Overseers (board) and imposed by the single justice. We limit our discussion to his claims regarding the sufficiency of the evidence on which the board concluded he had violated several provisions of the Canons of Ethics, the authority of the appeal panel of the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>to amend the decision of the hearing committee, and the appropriate discipline to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Bar counsel filed a petition for discipline against the respondent on May 23, 1994, alleging violations of S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 1, DR 1-102 (A) (4), (5), and (6), as appearing in 382 Mass. 769 (1981); Canon 6, DR 6-101 (A) (3), as appearing in 382 Mass. 783 (1981); Canon 7, DR 7-101 (A) (1), (2), and (3), as appearing in 382 Mass. 784 (1981); and DR 7-102 (A) (2), (5), and (7), and (B) (1), as appearing in 382 Mass. 785 (1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Between October, 1994, and March, 1995, a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>committee of the board conducted six days of hearings at which two witnesses testified and 167 exhibits were introduced in evidence. Bar counsel recommended a three-year suspension. On December 11, 1995, the hearing committee issued its report recommending a one-year suspension with readmission \u201conly upon application and the satisfactory completion of an ethics examination.\u201d The hearing committee concluded that the respondent had violated DR 6-101 (A) (3), DR 7-101 (A) (1), (2), and (3), DR 7-102 (A) (2) and (7), and DR 7-102 (B) (1), and that the respondent had not violated any of the provisions of Canon 1. Both parties took an appeal from the hearing committee\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">On July 30, 1996, an appeal panel of the board remanded the case to the hearing committee for clarification of its findings and rulings. The appeal panel sought information regarding whether the respondent\u2019s violation of DR 7-101 (A) (1), (2), and (3) was intentional, whether his violation of DR 7-102 (A) (2) and (7) was done knowingly, and whether the respondent had knowingly violated DR 7-102 (A) (5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The hearing committee issued supplemental findings and a report on August 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>1996, finding that the respondent\u2019s conduct, and therefore his violation of DR 7-101 (A) (1), (2), and (3), was intentional, that he knowingly violated DR 7-102 (A) (2), and that he had not violated DR 7-102 (A) (5). The committee also noted that the respondent had knowingly violated DR 7-102 (A) (7). On May 29, 1997, the appeal panel issued its report, adopting the initial and supplemental findings of the hearing committee and upholding the hearing committee\u2019s rulings that the respondent had violated Canons 6 and 7. The appeal panel disagreed with the hearing committee\u2019s dismissal of the alleged violations of Canon 1, and ruled that the respondent had violated DR 1-102 (A) (4), (5), and (6). The appeal panel recommended a two-year suspension, and suggested that \u201cthe respondent complete continuing legal education courses in ethics, and pass the MPRE between the date of suspension and any petition for reinstatement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">On July 14, 1997, the board voted unanimously to adopt the appeal panel report and recommended discipline. The board filed an information in the county court on September 2, 1997, and a single justice of this court suspended the respondent for two years on December 3, 1997, from which the respondent appeals. We vacate the decision of the single justice and order that the respondent be suspended for a period of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">1. We summarize the extensive facts found by the hearing committee and upheld by the appeal panel. Some details of other cases related to the one giving rise to the discipline sought here illuminate the challenged conduct of the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The respondent was admitted to the bar of the Commonwealth in 1952, and has represented Kourouvacilis in a number of matters, including a 1981 divorce; a personal injury and property damage suit arising from an automobile accident in 1983; a wrongful discharge case filed in December, 1987; and the automobile fire suit against GM and Avis at issue here, filed in October, 1988. In July, 1983, Kourouvacilis was involved in an automobile accident while driving a Chevrolet automobile that she had purchased from Avis in 1979.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The respondent agreed to represent Kourouvacilis on a contingent fee basis in a suit against the other driver, and, in June, 1984, filed suit on behalf of his client. The complaint alleged that the automobile had been seriously damaged in the 1983 accident, that it was unsafe to drive, and that as a result of the accident Kourouvacilis was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>being treated for migraine headaches by Dr. Lawrence Metz. The respondent later settled that case by negotiating payments of the policy limits from the insurers of both Kourouvacilis and the other driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In August, 1984, Kourouvacilis was discharged from employment at Monson State Hospital (Monson) for excessive absenteeism. In November, 1987, the respondent agreed to represent Kourouvacilis, again on a contingent fee basis, in a wrongful termination suit against the Commonwealth and Mon-son (Monson suit).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In December, 1987, he filed a suit on her behalf that was still pending at the time of respondent\u2019s hearing in this disciplinary matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In or about November, 1985, the Chevrolet automobile that Kourouvacilis purchased from Avis caught fire while she was operating it; the car was destroyed. The respondent agreed to represent Kourouvacilis on a contingent fee basis in the suit against GM and Avis. The respondent failed adequately to investigate the cause of the automobile fire,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and failed to have the automobile inspected by an expert before Kourouvacilis\u2019s insurer sold it for salvage. Nonetheless, the suit against GM and Avis raised warranty, negligence, deceit, fraud, and G. L. c. 93A claims, specifically alleging that the fire was caused by \u201cdefective wiring.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Neither did the respondent investigate his Ghent\u2019s claims of personal injury. When he first agreed to represent her, Kourou-vacilis made no claims of physical injury, or that she had sought medical treatment as a result of the fire. The fire department official\u2019s report similarly stated that Kourouvacilis had suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>no injuries.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The respondent attempted to document Kourouva-cilis\u2019s alleged injuries through Dr. Metz, alleging that Dr. Metz treated her for migraine headaches resulting from \u201csmoke inhalation.\u201d Dr. Metz\u2019s records, however, indicated that Kour-ouvacilis last visited his office in February, 1985, nine months before the fire. Kourouvacilis testified during depositions that Dr. Metz had treated her for migraines after the fire; the respondent did not counsel her to correct her misstatements, even after she was unable to produce documentation of any postfire treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The respondent also drafted a statement for Walter Grzebian, a front-end mechanic, stating that, based on his experience and training, the fire was caused by defective wiring installed by GM.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In a telephone conversation, Grzebian told the respondent that it was \u201cridiculous\u201d that he had been subpoenaed to give deposition testimony because he did not \u201cknow anything [about] the [Chevrolet] or what could cause the fire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">In interrogatories and an affidavit prepared by the respondent, he falsely represented that expert witnesses were available to testify in support of Kourouvacilis\u2019s claims. He prepared interrogatory answers identifying \u201cMatheson,\u201d \u201cGrez,\u201d \u201cLt. Col-burn, Fire Marshall [ric],\u201d and Dr. Metz as expert witnesses, despite the fact that he had neither consulted nor retained any of them as expert witnesses, and knew that none would testify in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>support of any of his client\u2019s claims. In support of his opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the respondent prepared an affidavit on October 6, 1989, signed by Kourouvacilis, which stated that she had been treated by Dr. Metz after the fire in \u201cOctober, 1985,\u201d and that she had bills that she had received from Dr. Metz for treatment in 1986. He also attempted to file an unsworn statement of \u201c-Gerz,\u201d that he prepared, offering Grzebian\u2019s \u201cexpert opinion.\u201d A judge in the Superior Court allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. On appeal we affirmed the entry of summary judgment. <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The respondent also advanced misstatements about Kourou-vacilis\u2019s employment and alleged wages lost as a result of the fire. In answers to GM interrogatories, he advanced his client\u2019s claim that she lost two weeks of wages and her position at \u201cAdral Co.\u201d In answers to Avis\u2019s interrogatories, he advanced her claim that she had not been employed for two years after the fire because of resulting emotional problems, and that her lost earning capacity totaled $36,000. These statements were not only inconsistent as between GM and Avis, but they contradicted and jeopardized the theory of Kourouvacilis\u2019s Mon-son suit. In that case, Kourouvacilis claimed that she was ready and able to work after her 1984 termination, but had been unable to find work until June, 1986. The respondent advanced these misstatements of his client, and did not counsel her to correct either the misstatements or the inconsistencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">2. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The respondent makes numerous challenges regarding the sufficiency of the evidence on which the board concluded that he had violated the several provisions of Canons 1, 6, and 7. Among other challenges, he claims that he did not neglect any legal matter entrusted to him, that he did not fail to represent his client zealously, that he did not advance a claim that was unwarranted under existing law, that his client did not clearly perpetrate a fraud that he was thereby required to reveal, and that he did not counsel or assist his client in conduct that he knew to be illegal or fraudulent. We have reviewed the entire record and are satisfied that there was more than adequate evidence to support each of the violations. We see no reason to provide a point-by-point rebuttal to the respondent\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">3. <em>Authority of the panel. </em>The respondent challenges the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>authority of the appeal panel to reverse the hearing committee\u2019s finding that he did not violate DR 1-102 (A) (4), (5), and (6). The appeal panel erred, he claims, because these violations require a determination of intent, a matter within the province of the hearing committee as the \u201csole judge of the credibility of the testimony presented at the hearing.\u201d <em>Matter of Saab, </em>406 Mass. 315, 328 (1989). Supreme Judicial Court Rule 4:01, \u00a7 8 (3), as appearing in 381 Mass. 784 (1980), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">\u201cThe Board may adopt the findings of fact submitted by the hearing committee or the panel or revise such findings which it determines to be erroneous, paying due respect to the role of the hearing committee or the panel as the sole judge of the credibility of the testimony presented at the hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The appeal panel noted specifically that it was authorized to make the revision \u201csince it does not involve the determination of the credibility of any witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d We are satisfied that the appeal panel\u2019s amendment of the hearing committee\u2019s report was proper, and involved no credibility determination. Rather, in our assessment, the appeal panel rightfully corrected errors it concluded the hearing committee had made in applying its findings to the disciplinary rules at hand. The appeal panel concluded that the respondent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\">\u201c(1) prepared and served opposing counsel with discovery material and pleadings based on false statements of fact the respondent knew to be false; (2) fraudulently procured affidavits; (3) permitted deposition testimony to stand uncorrected when he knew it contained false statements; and (4) engaged in conduct that delayed litigation, complicated discovery, and wasted the time and resources of the courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The hearing committee\u2019s initial and supplemental findings contained more than adequate support for the conclusion that this behavior constituted \u201cfraudulent, dishonest conduct which was prejudicial to the administration of justice, and reflected adversely upon the respondent\u2019s fitness to practice in violation of DR 1-102(A)(4), (5), and (6).\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">4. <em>Appropriate discipline. </em>The respondent argues that a two-year suspension of his license is a \u201cmiscarriage of justice and grossly disparate.\u201d We disagree. In bar discipline cases, we \u201cinquire whether the judgment is markedly disparate from those ordinarily entered by the various single justices in similar cases.\u201d <em>Matter of Clooney, </em>403 Mass. 654, 658 (1988), quoting <em>Matter of Alter, </em>389 Mass. 153, 156 (1983). The \u201cprimary factor\u201d in bar discipline is \u201cthe effect upon, and perception of, the public and the bar.\u201d <em>Matter of Finnerty, </em>418 Mass. 821, 829 (1994), quoting <em>Matter of Alter, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The facts of this case establish that the respondent engaged in a \u201c \u2018persistent and extended pattern of improper and unethical behavior\u2019 of the sort that would justify a suspension.\u201d <em>Matter of Saab, supra </em>at 325, quoting <em>Matter of McInerney, </em>389 Mass. 528, 531 (1983). The respondent neglected his client\u2019s case. He prosecuted a frivolous claim, needlessly consuming the resources of the judicial system for several years. He filed false and misleading affidavits and interrogatory answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The appeal panel concluded that a two-year period of suspension from the practice of law was appropriate. It did so reasoning \u201c[t]he existence of prior discipline, unlike the absence of prior discipline, is a \u2018substantial factor in selecting the level of discipline.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matter of Dawkins, </em>412 Mass. 90, 96 (1992), quoting <em>Matter of Bryan, </em>411 Mass. 288, 291 (1991). \u201cWe consistently have considered a record of past misconduct, even if unrelated to the current charges, in determining the appropriate sanction.\u201d <em>Matter of Dawkins, supra, </em>and cases cited. The existence, as well as the timing, of the respondent\u2019s prior disciplinary record persuades us that a suspension longer than that imposed by the single justice is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>The respondent was publicly censured in 1989 for charging a fee in excess of the fee set out in the contingent fee agreement. He refused to turn over the portion of the recovery to which the client was entitled, and withheld funds from the client to pay another attorney without his client\u2019s consent. <em>Matter of Kerlin-sky, </em>406 Mass. 67 (1989). That the respondent continued to engage in the unethical behavior at issue in this case during the pendency of and subsequent to his earlier disciplinary proceedings warrants more severe discipline.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> His earlier public censure obviously was not sufficient to dissuade him^from engaging in further unethical behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">In <em>Matter of Tobin, </em>417 Mass. 81 (1994), we last surveyed cases in which three-year suspensions were imposed. In that case, we reduced a three-year suspension imposed by a single justice to eighteen months.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 91. We noted that \u201c[tjhose attorneys who had not been convicted of crime yet received three-year suspensions demonstrated a pattern of neglect and deceit or misused substantial sums of clients\u2019 funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89 n.8. We are satisfied that the respondent\u2019s conduct in this case rises to the level of a \u201cpattern of neglect\u201d warranting a three-year suspension. <em>Id. </em>Since <em>Tobin, </em>a single justice has imposed a three-year suspension in <em>Matter of Dittami, </em>12 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 98 (1996), which we view as analogous to the present case. In that case, the attorney engaged in conflicts of interest while mediating a business dispute and made written misrepresentations while defending himself in a civil action. <em>Id. </em>at 101. The respondent in that case, as in this case, previously had received a public censure. <em>Id. </em>at 113. Although the board in that case, as it did here, recommended a two-year suspension, the single justice increased the suspension to three years. <em>Id. </em>at 98, 101. While we note that many of the cases in which three-year suspensions have been imposed involve criminal convictions, we reiterate our observation in <em>Tobin </em>that such a suspension may be appropriate where, as here, the respondent has engaged in behavior that demonstrates a \u201cpattern of neglect or deceit.\u201d <em>Matter of Tobin, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>We are persuaded that an increase in the period of suspension is appropriate based on the number of violations the respondent committed both here and in his earlier disciplinary case. \u201cThe simultaneous consideration of separate violations ... is an established part of the disciplinary system of this Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Matter of Saab, supra </em>at 326. The board found that the respondent violated ten separate disciplinary rules in this case and six in the earlier case. <em>Matter of Kerlinsky, supra </em>at 71-72. The cumulative effect of these violations further supports our conclusion that an additional period of suspension is appropriate. The board concluded, accurately in our view, that the \u201crespondent lacks any appreciation that his behavior was improper and violated the Canons of Ethics.\u201d \u201cimposing any sanction less severe . . . would \u2018undermineQ the clear standards of <em>[Matter of the Discipline of an Attorney, </em>392 Mass. 827 (1984)], and, in the process . . . diminish[] the court\u2019s credibility in an area where the public interest requires steadfast protection of clients\u2019 rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matter of Dawkins, supra </em>at 97, quoting <em>Matter of Driscoll, </em>695, 705 (1991) (Greaney, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The decision of the single justice is vacated and a judgment is to be entered in the Supreme Judicial Court for the county of Suffolk ordering that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a three-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-6\"> New Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct became effective on January 1, 1998, replacing the former Canons of Ethics and Disciplinary Rules.

Two and one-half years after agreeing to represent Kourouvacilis in this matter, the respondent wrote to the fire department official responsible for investigating the fire, and received his report in May, 1988. In June, 1988, the fire official left a message for the respondent, stating that he did not remember anything about the fire. The respondent never returned the telephone call, and never spoke directly to the fire official.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b684-10\"> The respondent also failed to investigate whether, as Kourouvacilis had told him, the Chevrolet was new at the time she purchased it from Avis.

Mathison stated that she only had an \u201cimpression\u201d of the effect of the fire on Kourouvacilis, and that Kourouvacilis had a short attention span and poor memory. In her August, 1989, deposition, Mathison stated that Kourouvacilis had reported no physical injury from the fire, and that Mathison \u201ccould not provide the nexus between the 1985 fire and Kourouvacilis\u2019s emotional and academic problems because she was not qualified to identify the cause of the post-traumatic stress disorder she observed in Kourouvacilis.\u201d She was not retained as an expert.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b685-8\"> The respondent had requested that Kourouvacilis obtain statements from \u201cauto mechanics regarding the cause of [her] fire.\u201d She left a message for the respondent, stating that her mechanic, \u201cGrez,\u201d was a front-end and suspension specialist who did not do wiring or electrical repairs but would be willing to help. Kourouvacilis drafted a statement for Grzebian, stating that he did not perform wiring or electrical repairs, but that he had been advised by Kourouvacilis that the fire marshal believed the fire had -been caused by defective wiring. The respondent redrafted this statement without speaking to Grzebian, removed the qualification about his experience, and substituted the language discussed above.
