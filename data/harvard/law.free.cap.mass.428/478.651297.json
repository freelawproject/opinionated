The jury also convicted the defendant of armed robbery, breaking and entering in the daytime (two indictments), unlawfully carrying a firearm, removing or defacing the firearm\u2019s serial or identification number, assault by means of a dangerous weapon (three indictments), larceny of a motor vehicle, and larceny over $250 (two indictments).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">The convictions arose from events surrounding the shooting death of the chief of police of the town of Paxton, Robert J. Mortell. He was shot while pursuing three men, believed to be armed burglars, in a heavily wooded area in the town of Holden.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">On April 14, 1995, the defendant filed notice of his appeal. On January 14, 1997, he filed in this court a motion for a new trial raising a single issue concerning an instruction on self-defense. A single justice transferred the motion to the trial court. On November 20, 1997, a judge in the Superior Court, who was also the trial judge, denied the motion without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant challenges only his convictions of murder in the first degree and armed robbery. He claims error in the denial of his motion to suppress statements he gave to the police; the judge\u2019s giving of an instruction on self-defense despite his request that no such instruction be given; the judge\u2019s refusal to give a requested instruction on involuntary manslaughter; the denial of his motion for a required finding of not guilty on the armed robbery indictment; trial counsel\u2019s failure to request and the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>failure to give instructions on lesser included offenses of armed robbery and on felony-murder in the second degree; and trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the form of the verdict slip for the murder indictment because it did not require the jury to specify whether they found that the defendant had acted as a principal or as a joint venturer. The defendant also challenges the armed robbery conviction on the ground that it is duplicative. We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions and see no reason to grant any relief pursuant to our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">1. <em>Facts.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On the morning of February 1, 1994, the defendant and two others, Kenneth Padgett and Jamie Richards, committed two burglaries while armed with handguns supplied by the defendant. While the coventurers fled from the second burglary in a stolen van, the van collided with a city of Worcester department of public works (DPW) truck and lodged in a snowbank. A DPW crew was working nearby. The defendant and his co-venturers then took the DPW truck at gunpoint. When that vehicle got stuck in the snow after a few hundred yards, they abandoned it and fled on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Chief Mortell received word of the burglaries and the incident involving the city crew shortly afterward. Responding to a call for help from the Holden police, he saw three men running across a road into a thickly wooded area near the Kendall Reservoir. Leaving his car on the road, he pursued the men into the woods on foot. As he passed a bush behind which the defendant hid, the defendant shot him. Chief Mortell returned fire, and then collapsed. The defendant fired at him repeatedly, eleven times in all. The fatal shot entered the victim\u2019s left side, just under his armpit, traveled through his lungs and heart, exited his right side and lodged in the inside of his upper right arm. A second shot hit the victim while he was bent over. The defendant threw his gun into the snow and fled. The tracks in the snow suggested that the three coventurers split up near the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>location of the victim\u2019s body: Padgett and Richards went in one direction, the defendant went in another. The police apprehended the defendant shortly after the shooting, and apprehended Padgett and Richards the following day.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">2. <em>Suppression of the defendant\u2019s statements. </em>The defendant first claims that, because of an improper inducement by the police, the waiver of his Miranda rights and his subsequent statements to the police were not voluntary and should have been suppressed. At the scene of his arrest in the woods, the defendant received Miranda warnings and indicated that he understood them. He was taken to the Holden police station, where he was first interviewed by State Trooper Robert O\u2019Keefe and Holden Detective Albert Bourget for approximately forty minutes. At the beginning of the interview Trooper O\u2019Keefe again informed the defendant of his Miranda rights. Trooper O\u2019Keefe then told the defendant it was in his \u201cbest interest\u201d to \u201cset the record straight\u201d and tell them what happened that day.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant characterizes O\u2019Keefe\u2019s statement as \u201cunsolicited advice of a legal nature\u201d designed to elicit a waiver of his rights in violation of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Meehan, 377 Mass. 552, 564 (1979), cert. dismissed, 445 U.S. 39 (1980). In <em>Meehan, supra, </em>we said that an officer may suggest that it would be \u201c \u2018better\u2019 for a suspect to tell the truth,\u201d but that \u201can assurance, express or implied,\u201d that a statement \u201cwill aid the defense or result in a lesser sentence\u201d is prohibited. <em>Id., </em>and cases cited. More recently, we held that an officer\u2019s suggestion that it would be in the defendant\u2019s \u201cbest interests to get out his side of the story\u201d did not violate the prohibitions of <em>Meehan, </em>\u201cand was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>more closely related to \u2018suggesting] broadly that it would be \u201cbetter\u201d for a suspect to tell the truth,\u2019 which we have expressly allowed police officers to do.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 395-396 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, supra </em>at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Trooper O\u2019Keefe\u2019s statement to the defendant is all but identical to the one at issue in <em>Raymond </em>and, for the reasons we explained in that case, fell within the permissible zone of questioning. <em>Id. </em>at 395-396. We do not agree with the defendant that the officer\u2019s statement \u201cimplicitly assures something short of a prosecution for first degree murder.\u201d The officer made no promises of any kind to the defendant, express or implied. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, supra </em>at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The defendant also argues that his statements were the product of physical and psychological intimidation. We conclude that the judge\u2019s finding that the police conduct from the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest until his arraignment \u201cwas not coercive or otherwise overbearing or deceptive\u201d is warranted by the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, supra </em>at 395. At the Holden police station, the defendant was placed in a cell and told to remove his clothing, except his underwear. The defendant was given a blanket to cover himself, and taken to an interview room approximately eight feet by ten feet. He was seated in a chair in a comer directly across from a glass paneled door, and was handcuffed to a bar on the wall, where he remained until he was arraigned later that afternoon. The defendant points to the fact that he was questioned by a series of officers over approximately three and one-half hours. After the initial forty-minute interrogation, a Worcester detective interviewed the defendant for approximately one and three-quarter hours.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A State trooper also interviewed the defendant for approximately twenty minutes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s conclusion that the interviews, conducted in the middle of the day, were \u201cnot a stratagem designed to wear [the defendant] down\u201d but were reasonable and investigative is fully supported: the defendant was a suspect in the murder of a police officer, and the subject of an investigation in which several local police departments and the State police were involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The defendant further claims that he was \u201chumiliated\u201d and \u201cdeprived of his dignity\u201d because he was questioned while stripped of his clothing, handcuffed to a bar in a small room, observed in this condition by percipient witnesses and deprived of his privacy. We would not tolerate the custodial interrogation of a suspect who is nude. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 126, 131 (1981) (the \u201ccoercive effect of being nude during custodial interrogation is well settled\u201d). But the defendant was not nude; he was permitted to wear his underwear and the police provided him with a blanket to cover himself. The removal of his clothing was not for coercive purposes: the police had a legitimate interest in preserving his clothing as possible evidence. The judge also made no error in concluding that the police took reasonable precautions by handcuffing the defendant to a bar: the defendant was an escape risk.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He makes no claim that the handcuffs caused him any pain, nor does he suggest that he was in any other kind of discomfort.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>Five workers from the Worcester DPW arrived at the Holden police station during the interrogation and looked at him through the glass door. The judge found this was for the purpose of identifying the suspect. For the police to seek assistance in identifying a suspect in this manner is not inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u201cThe test for voluntariness of a confession[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] is \u2018whether, in light of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>ing of the statement, the will of the defendant was overborne to the extent that the statement was not the result of a free and voluntary act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, supra </em>at 395, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>420 Mass. 656, 663 (1995). On our own review of the record of the hearing, we are satisfied that the defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">3. <em>Self-defense instruction. </em>The defendant next claims that the judge committed reversible error by instructing the jury on self-defense over his objection.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> First, he says, the instruction was not warranted by the evidence. Were the defendant correct \u2014 and we conclude he is not \u25a0\u2014 any error would not be prejudicial. A defendant is rarely prejudiced when a judge has given an instruction on self-defense to which he is not entitled because the instruction is generally \u201cmore favorable to the defendant than he deserved.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>420 Mass. 479, 492 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619, 632 (1994) (where defendants were not entitled to any instruction on self-defense, \u201cwhatever the judge said about self-defense, and the use of excessive force in self-defense, was more favorable to the defendants than they deserved and could not have prejudiced their positions\u201d). We conclude, however, that the evidence did support an instruction on self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">During his postarrest interrogations the defendant told the officers, \u201cI\u2019m a [breaking and entering] guy. Maybe I\u2019ve committed some [breaking and enterings]. But just because someone is [breaking and entering], doesn\u2019t give the police the right to shoot them.\u201d When asked if he was suggesting that the police fired first, the defendant responded, \u201cIf I\u2019m given a chance to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>stop, I stop,\u201d a statement he repeated on several occasions. He also stated three times that \u201che was being shot at, he had no choice.\u201d Those statements were in evidence. Collectively, they permit an inference that the victim, rather than the defendant, fired the first shot or shots.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We recognize that there was scant evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the defendant, assuming that he had not been the first to fire, used no more force than was reasonably necessary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, supra </em>at 632. Nevertheless, taking the facts in the light most favorable to the defendant, <em>Torres, supra </em>at 492, we cannot conclude that it was error for the judge to interpret the defendant\u2019s postarrest statements as requiring a self-defense instruction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>427 Mass. 100, 102 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The defendant\u2019s second claim that, even if warranted by the evidence, it was reversible error for the judge to give a self-defense instruction sua sponte and over his express objection raises a different question. The defendant did not present a self-defense theory to the jury; at trial he never contended that self-defense played any role in the case. He claims the instruction violated his right to choose his theory of defense and vitiated his \u201crather strong\u201d defense that he was not the shooter who killed the victim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018It is the rule that where the issue of self-defense has been sufficiently raised <em>by the evidence, </em>the defendant is entitled to an instruction which places on the Commonwealth the burden of disproving the factor of self-defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 \u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, supra </em>at 631, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>375 Mass. 768, 772 (1978). We have also said that a judge <em>\u201cmust </em>instruct on self-defense in a homicide case if the evidence most favorable to the defendant warrants a reasonable doubt whether \u2018the defendant: (1) had reasonable ground to believe and actually did believe that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm, from which he could save himself only by using deadly force, (2) had availed himself of all proper means to avoid physical combat before resorting to the use of deadly force, and (3) used no more force than was reasonably necessary in all the circumstances of the case\u2019 \u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, supra </em>at 492, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, supra </em>at 632. But we have not addressed previously whether a defendant may veto a self-defense instmction in a case where the evidence may warrant the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Although a defendant\u2019s trial strategy is respected, <em>Breese </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 249, 251 (1993), and although there was no requirement that the judge give a self-defense instruction because there was no such request from the defendant or the Commonwealth, we conclude that in this case it was not prejudicial to do so. First, the defendant\u2019s story to the police \u2014 a story that the jury, correctly, were permitted to hear \u2014 suggested that he had no choice but to shoot at his pursuer. There was, of course, conflicting evidence that undermined the story the defendant gave to the police. But the jury reasonably could have concluded that a police officer pursuing a suspect might have fired one or more shots first. See note 11, <em>supra. </em>The self-defense instruction was favorable to the defendant precisely because it permitted the jury to consider that evidence in a way that was wholly beneficial to him.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Second, to negate the element of malice, the defendant requested and the judge gave an instruction on hot blood upon sudden combat<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>; the evidence, he said, supported the conclusion that the victim was the first to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>shoot. In requesting that instruction, the defendant must have concluded that the jury might disbelieve his defense that he was not the shooter. The self-defense instruction similarly anticipated that the jury might disbelieve the defendant\u2019s story that he was not the shooter. Any prejudice that the defendant claims resulted from the self-defense instruction is no different than the \u201cprejudice\u201d that resulted from the hot blood upon sudden combat instruction he requested and received.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Finally, the defendant claims that the self-defense instruction gave the Commonwealth an opportunity to comment unfavorably on such a defense in its closing argument and thereby shifted the burden to the defendant to justify his earlier statements to the police suggesting that he acted in self-defense.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Here, the prosecutor based his closing argument on the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>and it would have been proper even in the absence of an instruction on self-defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, 392 </em>Mass. 838, 853 (1984). The \u201copportunity\u201d to make the argument arose from the defendant\u2019s own statements to the police, not from any anticipation that the judge would give a self-defense instruction. Nor was the burden shifted to the defendant. The judge instructed the jury that the Commonwealth bore the burden of proving that the defendant had not shot the victim in self-defense, and the burden of proof never shifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">4. <em>Joint venture theory of murder. </em>The judge instructed the jury on individual liability and joint venture theories of murder. The defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to warrant a finding that he acted not as the shooter, but as a joint venturer,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and because the jury were not asked to specify on which basis \u2014 principal or joint venturer \u2014 he was guilty, he may have been convicted improperly as a joint venturer. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, there was adequate evidence to support a conviction of murder on a theory of joint venture. It is, therefore, immaterial that the jury did not specify whether they convicted him as a principal or a joint venturer. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>412 Mass. 375, 380 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">To prove joint venture beyond a reasonable doubt, the Commonwealth had to establish that the \u201cdefendant was (1) present at the scene of the crime, (2) with knowledge that another intends to commit the crime or with intent to commit a crime, and (3) by agreement is willing and available to help the other if necessary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>422 Mass. 111, 121 (1996). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Semedo, </em>422 Mass. 716, 719 (1996) (Commonwealth must show that defendant \u201cshared with the principal the mental state required for the crime of murder\u201d). The defendant complains that there was no evidence even \u201cremotely suggesting\u201d that either Padgett or Richards had ambushed the victim and the defendant could only have been convicted as a principal.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We disagree. To support a joint venture conviction, \u201c[t]he inferences drawn by the jury need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>only be reasonable and possible and need not be necessary or inescapable,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>422 Mass. 574, 577 (1996), and cases cited. The evidence meets that standard. All three coventurers fled into the woods together. At some point they parted, but the evidence concerning their tracks in the snow is not inconsistent with a theory that Padgett and the defendant had hidden close to each other<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and waited for the victim to approach before Padgett or the defendant shot the victim. The defendant knew that at least one of his coventurers was armed, and there was overwhelming evidence that one or another of the coventurers shot the victim. \u201cDirect evidence of who shot the victim[] \u2018is not required where, as here, there is strong circumstantial evidence that one of the [assailants] shot\u2019 the victim[].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, supra </em>at 381, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casale, </em>381 Mass. 167, 174 (1980). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, supra </em>at 577 (\u201c[although there was no direct evidence that the defendant fired a gun, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence that the defendant was either one of the shooters or had joined in the others\u2019 intent\u201d). While the Commonwealth did not dwell on this theory of liability, the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">5. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence: armed robbery. </em>The indictment for armed robbery was tied to the events surrounding the confrontation between the coventurers and the DPW crew. By a motion for a required finding of not guilty, denied by the judge before he instructed the jury, the defendant raised the question whether sufficient evidence existed to convict him of armed robbery. He claimed that the Commonwealth had not proved that he intended permanently to deprive the owner of \u2014 that is, to steal \u2014 its DPW truck.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> He challenges the judge\u2019s denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u201cThe standard for evaluating a motion for a required finding of not guilty is \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>424 Mass. 770, 784 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979). \u201cOne who takes property without the authority of the owner and so uses or disposes of it as to show indifference whether the owner recovers possession may be found to intend to deprive the owner of it permanently.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>356 Mass. 642, 648 (1970).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> There was evidence that the truck was taken at gunpoint and that the defendant and his coventurers drove off in the truck. The jury could have inferred that the defendant intended to drive the truck to effectuate his escape and that he did not intend to return it. This was no \u201cjoyride.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pena, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 332, 334 (1995), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, supra </em>at 677-678. The judge properly submitted this issue to the jury. \u201cWhether the taking was larcenous was for the jury to decide on all the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo the extent that conflicting inferences are possible from the evidence, \u2018it is for the jury to determine where the truth lies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pena, supra </em>at 334, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilborne, </em>382 Mass. 241, 245 (1981). We do not agree with the defendant that he took the city vehicle as an \u201cafterthought\u201d in response to the \u201coffer\u201d of the foreman. The defendant was intent on escaping and secured an escape vehicle at gunpoint. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Padgett, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 359, 364 (1998). It matters little that he was forced to abandon the stolen vehicle shortly afterward.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The judge properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>for a required finding of not guilty of armed robbery.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">One further aspect of the defendant\u2019s claim requires comment. We have sustained a conviction of larceny for the taking of a vehicle to effectuate an escape because the intent to deprive the owner permanently <em>may </em>be found where the defendant uses or disposes of the vehicle so \u201cas to show indifference\u201d whether the owner recovers possession of it. <em>Salerno, supra </em>at 648. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Padgett, supra </em>at 364, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Barts, </em>316 N.C. 666, 690 (1986) (taking and subsequent abandonment of truck indicated complete lack of concern as to whether the owner ever recovered it and constituted sufficient evidence of an intent to deprive the owner permanently of his property). After the judge gave the jury an initial instruction that was consistent with our holding in <em>Salerno, </em>defense counsel challenged the instruction. He argued that it was erroneous to instruct the jury \u201cto the effect that that would include any indifference to whether or not the owner recovered. I believe there must be a specific intent to permanently deprive.\u201d The judge agreed, apparently relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 455, 457 (1994).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Accordingly, the judge revised his initial instruction and told the jury that the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>indifference to the city\u2019s recovery of its truck would not be sufficient to prove the element of permanent deprivation.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The revised instruction, argues the defendant, is indicative of the judge\u2019s own conclusion that evidence of the use of the vehicle merely to escape would not be sufficient to prove larceny and would \u201ceradicate]\u201d the element of permanent deprivation. The judge\u2019s revised instructions to the jury were erroneous, but are not challenged by the defendant. The defendant concedes that the judge\u2019s initial (and correct) instructions, \u201cif considered by the jury, could have conceivably justified a robbery conviction.\u201d In tib\u00edese circumstances, there is no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice even though the jury considered the evidence through the lens of an erroneous instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">6. <em>Involuntary manslaughter. </em>The defendant claims that the judge erred in refusing to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter. \u201cAn instruction on involuntary manslaughter is required where any view of the evidence wifi permit a finding of manslaughter and not murder.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>419 Mass. 28, 33 (1994), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 301 (1992). During a lobby conference, defense counsel told the judge that the jury could conclude that the defendant fired at the victim in order to slow him down, and that such an action would constitute wanton and reckless conduct, as opposed to an intentional killing. The judge was correct to refuse to give the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">An involuntary manslaughter instruction is warranted if death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>was \u201cthe unintentional result of an act committed with such disregard of its probable harm to another as to amount to wanton or reckless conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nichypor, </em>419 Mass. 209, 217 (1994). But \u201c[a]n involuntary manslaughter charge is not required when it is obvious that \u2018the risk of physical harm to the victim creates a \u201cplain and strong likelihood that death would follow.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, supra </em>at 578, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzmeyer, </em>414 Mass. 540, 547 (1993).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The victim was shot twice, once through the heart, and once in the back while he was kneeling down and bent over. Another bullet hit the tree against which the victim fell, lodging near where his head rested. The defendant fired at least eleven times, emptying the magazine of his nine millimeter handgun. It is obvious that a \u201cplain and strong likelihood that death would follow\u201d can be found in these actions, making an involuntary manslaughter charge unsupportable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, supra </em>at 578. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>426 Mass. 617, 623 (1998) (\u201cdefendant shot his victim three times, twice after he had fallen and was lying helpless in the street. There can be no doubt that [he] subjectively understood that a plain and strong likelihood of death would result from his actions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">7. <em>Lesser included offense instructions. </em>The defendant claims that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to request, and the judge\u2019s failure to give, jury instructions on larceny, use without authority, and \u201ccarjacking,\u201d as lesser included offenses of armed robbery, as well as a corresponding instruction on second degree felony murder, created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u201cAs a general rule, the jury should receive an instruction on a particular offense where: (1) the offense is, as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>of law, a lesser included offense of the crime charged; and (2) \u2018the evidence provides a rational basis for acquitting the defendant of the crime charged and convicting him of the lesser included offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Donovan, 422 Mass. 349, 352 (1996), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santo, </em>375 Mass. 299, 305 (1978). \u201cEven when evidence is introduced that would justify conviction for a lesser included offense, the defendant is not entitled to an instruction thereupon unless the proof on the \u2018elements differentiating the two crimes is sufficiently in dispute so that the jury may consistently find the defendant innocent of the greater and guilty of the lesser included offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egerton, </em>396 Mass. 499, 504 (1986), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brischetto, </em>538 F.2d 208, 209 (8th Cir. 1976). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 78, 81 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>427 Mass. 642 (1998) (\u201cthe jury must be presented with some rational basis on which to reject the Commonwealth\u2019s proof on one or more of the requisite elements of the greater offense\u201d). Larceny and use of a motor vehicle without authority are lesser included offenses of armed robbery, as is \u201ccarjacking\u201d in the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The omission of these instructions did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice where the evidence was uncontroverted that the defendant, armed with a nine millimeter handgun, took the truck at gunpoint from the foreman, who had been in lawful, possession of and driving it immediately beforehand. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">8. <em>Duplicative conviction. </em>The defendant urges us to vacate! his armed robbery conviction because, he claims, it is duplica- ; five of his conviction of murder in the first degree on the theory of felony-murder, with armed robbery as the underlying felony. The jury specified, and the evidence supports, that the defendant\u2019s conviction of murder was based on a theory of deliberate premeditation and on a theory of felony-murder. Because the former is an \u201cadditional, independent basis . . . for the conviction of murder in the first degree, a separate sentence for the underlying felony is appropriate.\u201d <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>426 Mass. 692, 702 (1998), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, supra </em>at 396-397; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Buckley, 410 Mass. 209, 222 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">9. We have reviewed the record in accordance with our statutory obligations under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and determine that there is no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice in the defendant\u2019s convictions. We have considered and rejected each of the defendant\u2019s claims of legal error. We further observe that to escape arrest, the defendant ambushed a pursuer whom he reasonably must have known was a law enforcement officer. Had the defendant surrendered, as he readily could have, the homicide of the officer would in all likelihood have been avoided. In these circumstances the interests of justice do not warrant a reduction of the crimes of which the defendant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\"> Our recitation of the facts is taken entirely from the evidence introduced by the Commonwealth at trial. The defendant objects to the Commonwealth\u2019s inclusion in its appendix of statements made to the police by Padgett and Richards after their respective arrests. The statements were not introduced in evidence at the trial in this case. They were introduced at the joint hearing on the motions to suppress the statements filed by each of the three coventurers, but the statements were not relevant to any issues pertaining to the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and were not referred to by the motion judge in ruling on Souza\u2019s motion. We have not referred to the statements of Padgett and Richards or relied on them in any respect in reaching our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-6\"> The conviction of Kenneth Padgett of murder in the second degree on a theory of felony-murder and of ten other offenses was affirmed on appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Padgett, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 359 (1998). On July 5, 1995, Jamie Richards pleaded guilty to murder in the second degree and other offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\"> At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Trooper O\u2019Keefe testified as follows: \u201cWe began by telling him again why we were there, and we thought that he should speak to us in regards to this matter. Especially after we had learned that he was Michael Souza, that he had been arrested for [breaking and enterings] before and so forth. In fact, the investigation included [breaking and enterings] in the town of Holden. We said to Michael that we thought it was in his best interest to deal with us at this point, to set the record straight in regards to what happened today. We said, \u2018What happened today?\u2019 During these questions that we\u2019re asking Michael, Michael would momentarily cry and he would state, \u2018What does it matter? Nothing matters. I\u2019ve [szc] never going home again. I\u2019m never going to see my kid again. A cop got shot.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\"> The detective was sent from Worcester to conduct the interview because he thought he knew the defendant. He immediately realized that he was mistaken, but nevertheless continued the interview.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b506-8\"> The trooper was also sent to interview the defendant because he thought he knew him, but realized immediately that he, too, was mistaken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b507-6\"> The judge found that during one interview the defendant said that \u201ceverything had gone wrong,\u201d and that the police \u201ccould let him escape out the door and then shoot him.\u201d He said that \u201che would not go to trial, that he would take his own life first.\u201d He found that the defendant told another officer that \u201cin all likelihood the other suspects would be apprehended and that there was nothing they could say that would help him.\u201d See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\"> Near the end of the third interview, the trooper noticed some dried blood in the defendant\u2019s ear. The defendant then indicated for the first time that he was injured. The defendant was examined and treated later in the day at the infirmary at the jail and then at St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, where it was discovered that he had suffered a ruptured eardrum. The defendant\u2019s medical history indicated that he had long-term difficulties with that ear. The judge concluded that it was impossible to determine whether the rupture had occurred in connection with his arrest. The judge also concluded that the injury to the defendant\u2019s ear did not cause him any particular distress until just before he was arraigned. His findings are supported by the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\"> The defendant did not confess to the shooting of the victim. The judge found that \u201c[mjost of the statements made by him were quite guarded and designed to allow himself to later explain his actions, as well as could be done under the circumstances. He provided only the information he wished to provide and he did so very carefully.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> The defendant also claims error in the judge\u2019s failure to give the jury a humane practice instruction sua sponte. The voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statements to the police was not a live issue at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 150, cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982). There is, in any event, no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice because the defendant waived his rights and made his subsequent statements voluntarily.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> The judge instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">\u201cThe evidence in this case raises the issue of whether this killing was justified or excused as a result of acts of self-defense. The defendant does not bear the burden of proving the justification or excuse. Rather, the Commonwealth must prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not the result of the defendant\u2019s acts of self-defense. If it fails in its burden to prove the killing was unlawful and not in self-defense, then you need not proceed further, but must return a verdict on the entire charge of murder, that is, not guilty of murder in the first degree, and the lesser included charges of murder in the second degree, and manslaughter.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b509-6\"> At trial a police officer who had joined in the search for the armed burglars testified that someone other than the victim fired the initial volley of shots. The jury were not required to believe that evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\"> In denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the judge stated that \u201cthe jury could have inferred that the defendant was a house breaker who on the day in question was fleeing with two accomplices after having committed a number of house breaks. It was his practice under those circumstances in the past when he was told to stop fleeing by the police he always did so. In other words, he did not resist arrest, but gave up immediately and peacefully.\u201d It was the judge\u2019s view that this evidence \u201crequired an explanation to the jury of the law of self-defense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\"> The motion judge noted that the relationship between the defendant\u2019s trial strategy and the instruction on self-defense \u201cbecame much clearer during the closing arguments when the defendant raised the argument for the first time that a codefendant was the shooter.\u201d We note that in his opening statement defense counsel told the jury that the evidence would show that the defendant was not the shooter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b510-6\"> The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deeran, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 646, 649 (1980), is misplaced. In that case, the judge concluded, and the Appeals Court agreed, that the evidence was insufficient to raise the issue of self-defense. <em>Id. </em>at 648-649.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\"> The defendant requested the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">\u201c \u2018HOT BLOOD\u2019 ARISING FROM SUDDEN COMBAT.

He changes his mode and he goes into the self-defense mode. Think about that. \u2018When I\u2019m told to stop, I stop. He just kept shooting, I had no choice.\u2019 Is there any ambiguity about that comment?

Now it is blame Kenneth Padgett.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\"> The defendant does not contend that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction of premeditated murder, i.e., that he acted as the principal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\"> Trial counsel took a different position. He told the jury that it was Padgett who had shot the victim: \u201cAnd it is clear, ladies and gentlemen, from the evidence in this case, that [the shooter] is Kenneth Padgett.\u201d Similarly, on ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>peal the defendant insists that his only defense at trial was that Padgett had killed the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\"> Trial counsel told the jury, \u201c[Mjaybe you believe from the evidence that maybe [the defendant] was . . . sitting next to Padgett when Padgett was firing.

This contention is without merit. The defendant brandished a nine millimeter handgun, ordered the city workers to the ground, fired a shot in the air, and twice pointed his gun at the crew foreman. This was \u201cobjectively menacing conduct by the defendant, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>110 Mass. 407, 409 (1872), undertaken with the intent to put the victim in fear for the purpose of stealing his property, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>360 Mass. 566, 568 (1971), and resulting in reasonable fear or apprehension on the part of the victim, facilitating the theft, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>363 Mass. 299, 304 (1973).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marcotte, </em>18 Mass.

App. Ct. 455, 457 (1994), did not alter our holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>356 Mass. 642, 648 (1970). <em>Moore </em>held that it was erroneous for a judge to instruct that the jury must find the defendant \u201cto have intended to permanently deprive the owner of the property <em>or </em>... to have taken the property without authority in a state of mind wherein he was indifferent to whether [the owner] ever got it back or not.

In other words, in that case the judge erroneously instructed the jury that they <em>must </em>find that the defendant intended permanent deprivation if they found that he was indifferent as to whether the owner recovered possession, making it easier for the jury to find the required intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b516-8\"> The judge instructed: \u201cWhen I was discussing the charge of armed robbery, I made a statement to you regarding one of the elements of that offense which I wish to correct.

When I was discussing about the intent that the offender must have to permanently deprive the owner of his property, and that that intent can be inferred if the jury so chooses from a defendant\u2019s words or conduct, I gave an example that said that such an intent to steal may be inferred where a person takes property without the owner\u2019s permission and then uses or disposes of it in a way which shows indifference as to whether the owner recovers possession or not. I am going to strike that and ask you to disregard it. So far as it states this concept of using or disposing of property in a way which shows indifference.
