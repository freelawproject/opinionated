While the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>defendant\u2019s appeal has been pending, he moved for a new trial claiming that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to impeach the Commonwealth\u2019s three main witnesses with evidence of their prior convictions and charges pending against them. The motion was remanded to the trial judge, who denied it. The defendant also appeals from the denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">In addition to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant claims he was denied a fair trial by improper statements made by the Commonwealth in closing argument. He also asks that, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we either order a new trial or reduce the verdict to manslaughter. We affirm the conviction, and decline the defendant\u2019s request to exercise our statutory power.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">1. The Commonwealth presented evidence from which the jury could have found the following. On November 5, 1990, the defendant, a member of the street gang known as the Big Head Boys, shot the victim, Bryant Tarpley, because the victim sold drugs for someone other than the Big Head Boys on their turf. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy on the victim testified that the victim, who was seventeen years old, died as a result of two gunshot wounds, one to the head and one to the neck. The Commonwealth presented the testimony of three individuals, also members of the Big Head Boys: Tyrone Dickerson, Steven Niles, and Arthur Dickerson. Their testimony was the foundation of the Commonwealth\u2019s case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each witness testified that the defendant had admitted to him, or in his presence, that he had killed the victim. They also testified to circumstantial facts suggesting that the defendant was the killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">There was evidence that Craig Holiday (whose whereabouts at the time of trial were not known) was the leader of the Big Head Boys, and that the defendant was his \u201cfirst lieutenant.\u201d There was evidence that the defendant was acting on instructions from Holiday when he shot the victim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">2. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant challenges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>the conduct of his trial counsel for failing to use evidence of prior convictions and pending charges to impeach the Commonwealth\u2019s three key witnesses, the members of the Big Head Boys.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant raised this same claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a motion for a new trial that was denied by the trial judge. He appeals that decision and argues, in addition, that ineffective assistance of his trial counsel created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice warranting relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. Because our standard of review under that statute is more favorable to the defendant than is the constitutional standard for determining the ineffectiveness of counsel, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>426 Mass. 725, 730 (1998), we consider \u201cwhether there was an error in the course of the trial [by defense counsel] and, if there was, whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 730, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992). We consider the defendant\u2019s claim \u201ceven if the alleged error on the part of trial counsel does not constitute conduct falling \u2018measurably below\u2019 that of \u2018an ordinary fallible lawyer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>413 Mass. 498, 517 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The judge found that trial counsel was \u201cfully aware\u201d of the criminal histories of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses (certified copies of the convictions had been obtained by trial counsel before the trial) and that she had made a \u201ctactical\u201d decision not to use their criminal records to impeach them. Cf. <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Daigle, </em>379 Mass. 541, 543 (1980) (defense counsel did not know specifics of witnesses\u2019 prior criminal records or indictments pending against them and did not seek to obtain such records). We see no tactical advantage to the defendant in counsel\u2019s decision not to impeach the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses with available evidence of their prior convictions and charges pending against them. We nevertheless reach the same conclusion as did the judge that the failure to use the available evidence does not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">In <em>Daigle, supra, </em>we concluded that, where defense counsel did not produce criminal records of the defendant\u2019s accomplices in order to impeach them, but did establish that the accomplice-witnesses were \u201cseasoned criminals\u201d through their own admissions and the circumstances of the robbery, defense counsel\u2019s approach was not manifestly unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 544. For much the same reasons as we explained in that case, we conclude that counsel\u2019s approach in this case did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. The judge observed, and based on our own review of the record we concur in his judgment, that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel brought out frequently and clearly on cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, \u201c\u00bfte criminal character of all three of these individuals,\u201d and \u201cclearly demonstrated to the jury that each one was a seasoned criminal.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge reasoned \u00bfiat nothing further of any significance would have been gained if counsel had introduced the records of the witnesses\u2019 convictions. See <em>Daigle, supra </em>at 545. Recently, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carmona, ante </em>268, 275 (1998), we agreed with the conclusions of the motion judge who, as here, was also the trial judge, that the impeachment value of criminal records of the Commonwealth\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>witnesses would have been minimal where the evidence established that the defendant and witnesses were operating in a criminal environment. <em>Id. </em>In this case the evidence demonstrated, at least as strongly as the evidence in the <em>Carmona </em>case, that the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses had criminal backgrounds and were engaged in criminal activities. This jury surely knew that the three witnesses were armed drug dealers, each of whom had experience with, and extensive knowledge of the criminal justice system. Trial counsel made that point in her opening statement and again forcefully in her closing argument to the jury. The jury were well aware that the witnesses not only were drug dealers, but that Niles and Arthur Dickerson had been incarcerated on conviction of serious offenses as armed criminals. In addition, the Commonwealth proved that statements to the police two years after the killing from the three gang members had been obtained without the others knowing the content of their respective statements, i.e., they had not conferred before they gave their statements to the police. Such powerful and incriminating testimony would not have been undercut by impeachment of the witnesses with their prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The trial judge did not expressly address the defendant\u2019s claim that his trial counsel failed to impeach Tyrone Dickerson and Arthur Dickerson with evidence of criminal charges and probation violation matters that were pending against them. While pending charges and probation violations may be used to show that a witness is biased in favor of the Commonwealth, counsel\u2019s failure to elicit such evidence for that purpose does not necessarily constitute reversible error. A preliminary showing that a witness was providing testimony favorable to the Commonwealth in the hope of receiving more lenient treatment on his pending matters, or that inducements or promises had been made in exchange for his testimony, is required. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>423 Mass. 17, 20-21 (1996). There has been no such showing here. Based on our own review of the entire record, we conclude that the defendant has failed to show that trial counsel\u2019s failure to introduce further evidence of the criminal records of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses likely affected the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">3. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant did not object at trial to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. On appeal, he challenges several statements claiming they constituted improper personal opinion of the evidence. In referring to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>defendant\u2019s alleged admissions of guilt to the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, the prosecutor said, \u201cBelieve him what he said from his own mouth. . . .\u201d In referring to the witnesses\u2019s testimony, the prosecutor stated, \u201cI suggest to you there\u2019s some corroboration .... There\u2019s some credibility there,\u201d and \u201cI suggest to you that that\u2019s probably what happened.\u201d Viewed in context, these remarks were not presented, explicitly or implicitly, as personal opinion. The prosecutor\u2019s urging the jury to \u201cbelieve\u201d certain testimony, and to find \u201ccorroboration\u201d and \u201ccredibility\u201d in certain respects was proper argument. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>425 Mass. 223, 232-233 (1997). His use of the phrases \u201cI think\u201d and \u201cI suggest\u201d to preface some remarks did not, viewed in their proper context, imply that the prosecutor had personal knowledge or was stating a personal belief. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 499 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>427 Mass. 298 (1998) (isolated use of first-person pronouns does not amount to serious error); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>401 Mass. 318, 329 (1987) (phrases \u201cI submit\u201d and \u201cI suggest\u201d not improper testimonial interpretation but permissible rhetorical device to urge jury to draw inferences from evidence). The jury are presumed to recognize that the prosecutor is an advocate, not a witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 107 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>366 Mass. 705, 714 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The defendant claims the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jury\u2019s sympathy for the victim when he said, \u201c[Wje\u2019re talking about a human being here: [the victim] who will be seventeen forever because he was killed,\u201d and later when he told the jury, \u201c[the defendant] has all sorts of rights. But, you know Bryant Tarpley didn\u2019t have a jury. He didn\u2019t have a trial. He didn\u2019t have any opportunity for that. No breaks.\u201d These remarks should not have been made. We do not accept the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that the remarks were mere attempts to \u201chumanize\u201d the victim. But the error did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. The remarks were isolated and were not a significant or even a focal portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 258, 264 (1998) (repeated claim by prosecutor that defendant had determined victim\u2019s life was of no value combined with prosecutor\u2019s request to jury to \u201cdo something\u201d about killing prejudicial error). Moreover, the brief comments were adequately offset by the judge\u2019s careful and clear instructions describing the role of closing argument, and telling the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>jury not to be swayed by prejudice or sympathy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, supra </em>at 107-108; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCicco, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 111, 121 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">The defendant challenges other remarks, claiming they impugned his character and, in effect, implied guilt by association. In referring to the witnesses, the prosecutor stated, \u201c[I]f we have to go to hell to get our witnesses to convict somebody honestly for what happened, we will do it. We don\u2019t have doctors and nurses coming in here.\u201d He later added, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have priests coming in here to testify [to] what they saw. You\u2019re going to have the people that were there.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s reference to the criminal background of the witnesses was a fair response to the defendant\u2019s attack on the witnesses\u2019 credibility. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>425 Mass. 223, 230-231 (1997). The prosecutor did not suggest to the jury that the defendant should be viewed in the same way as the witnesses. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Worcester, supra </em>at 265 (prosecutor improperly implied that defendant, who had no criminal record, was \u201cdrug abusing criminal\u201d). Even if the prosecutor\u2019s statement was overly dramatic, the judge\u2019s instructions made clear to the jury that it was but argument.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Sanna, supra </em>at 107. The prosecutor also said that the defendant was a \u201cright-hand man of Craig [Holiday], and Craig is a fugitive.\u201d The statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>of fact was supported by the evidence; there was evidence that Holiday was \u201cwanted on a default [warrant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The defendant argues that the cumulative effect of all these statements denied the defendant his right to a fair trial because credibility was the crux of the case. Moreover, he says, this was a close case for the jury: it deliberated over several days.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This case is unlike <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Worcester, supra, </em>where the Appeals Court concluded that improper closing argument by the prosecutor required a new trial because it \u201cpossibly [made] a difference in the jury\u2019s conclusions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 268, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 518 (1987) (requiring a new trial). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Worcester, supra, </em>the defendant testified, his account was pitted against that of the other witnesses, and the improper attack on his credibility went to the crucial issue in the case. Moreover, in that case the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks were not isolated, but numerous, were challenged by the defendant at trial, and were not adequately addressed by the judge in his instructions to the jury. We have considered here the cumulative effect of all the challenged statements, including those that were proper, and are confident, in light of the careful instructions to the jury, that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">4. <em>Plenary review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>The defendant\u2019s arguments under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, focus on the same alleged errors that we previously have addressed. We see no reason to grant a new trial. The defendant executed Bryant Tarpley because he sold drugs for someone other than the gang to which the defendant belonged. Even if the killing was undertaken at the suggestion of, or indeed the instruction of, the leader of the gang \u2014 and there was scant evidence to that effect \u2014 these are not circumstances that, without more, support a reduction in sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-9\"> The defendant did not make any statement to the police and there was no evidence other than the testimony of the three witnesses linking the defendant to the killing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b877-10\"> Tyrone Dickerson testified that the defendant had said to him: \u201cCraig told me to kill him, to kill [Tarpley],\u201d and described to Tyrone how he had killed the victim. Steven Niles testified that he heard a gunshot that sounded to him as if it came from the apartment where the victim was killed and that when the defendant joined him immediately afterward, the defendant said that the victim was dead, described the shooting and, motioning with his hands, said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>\u201cGot him in the neck.\u201d Niles also testified the defendant later told him that he shot the victim in the head, as well as the neck, and that the victim was killed \u201cto set an example.\u201d Arthur Dickerson testified that the defendant said, \u201cHe had to do it, he did it,\u201d and that Craig Holiday had said, \u201cCan\u2019t nobody come on the block and take money out of our pockets.\u201d Others in the gang had agreed after the shooting that the \u201cdude deserved to die.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b878-7\"> The defendant complains that the jurors were unaware that Tyrone Dickerson had been found delinquent by a jury in the Boston Juvenile Court on three occasions (for possession of ammunition, possession of a Class B controlled substance, and for distributing a controlled substance) and that at the time of trial he had three pending cases against him (possession of a Class D controlled substance, trespassing, and curfew violation). He complains that certified copies of Steven Niles\u2019s convictions of assault with intent to murder, possession of a firearm, assault by means of a dangerous weapon, and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, were not introduced, and that the jury heard only of Niles\u2019s \u201csingle brush with the law.\u201d As to Arthur Dickerson, the defendant complains that a certified copy of Dickerson\u2019s conviction for possession of a firearm was not introduced, and that the jurors did not hear that he had two cases pending against him (for assault with intent to kill and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, a knife).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b879-6\"> As noted by the judge in ruling on the motion for a new trial, defendant\u2019s trial counsel elicited on cross-examination that Tyrone Dickerson was a drug dealer who earned thousands of dollars selling crack cocaine, that he was a member of the \u201cBig Head Boys,\u201d and that he owned a .38 caliber pistol. The judge further noted that cross-examination by trial counsel established that Steven Niles was serving a lengthy prison sentence for assault with intent to murder, that he had used a gun to commit the offense, and that he sold drugs for Craig Holiday permitting him to earn several thousand dollars a week. Counsel also established that Niles had great familiarity with firearms and that he had fired .38 caliber, .25 caliber, and .22 caliber handguns. On cross-examination, trial counsel established that Arthur Dickerson had been incarcerated for possessing a firearm the year before the trial, that he was on probation, that he was unemployed, and that he both sold and used drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b882-6\"> At the outset of the trial, before opening statements, the judge told the jury that the opening and closing statements \u201care not evidence\u201d and accordingly the jury were to take no notes during counsels\u2019 arguments. In his instructions to the jury, he carefully distinguished between evidence on the one hand and argument on the other: \u201cThe opening statement and the summation are not evidence. I ask you not to consider them as evidence. . . . The summation, which is the highest art of lawyering, is a persuasive statement that is made to the jury to persuade the jury in respect to the evidence so that the jury can reach an ultimate conclusion that is a correct one. But as I suggested to you, it\u2019s not evidence. You may only consider the evidence that you receive from the witnesses and from the exhibits.\u201d He later stressed: \u201cYou should determine the facts of this case based solely on a fair consideration of the evidence. You are to be completely impartial and not be swayed by prejudice or sympathy, personal likes or dislikes toward one side or the other. You must decide this case only on what you have heard in the courtroom from the witness stand and from the exhibits. . . . [Y]ou have to decide this case on what was presented here from the witness stand and from the exhibits.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b882-7\"> In addition, at the request of the defendant and immediately before the jury retired the judge further instructed: \u201cCounsel remind me that I should charge you that in our country there is no guilt by association. Mere presence at the scene of a crime is not sufficient to prove either murder in the first degree or murder in the second degree beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b883-9\"> The trial commenced on May 3, 1993, with testimony beginning on May 4. The Commonwealth rested on May 5, 1993. The jury deliberated on May 5, 6, 10, and 11, 1993, when they returned a verdict of guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
