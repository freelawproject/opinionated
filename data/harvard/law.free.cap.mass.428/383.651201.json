He appeals from the jury verdict and from the denial of his motion for a new trial. The jury charge regarding third prong malice was erroneous. Because this error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, we reverse the judgment of conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">In January, 1992, the defendant\u2019s younger sister disappeared from home. After three days had passed, she called their mother, crying hysterically, and reported that she had been kidnapped by a cab driver, held at his residence, and raped. She described her assailant to the defendant in some detail at that time. During a police investigation that failed to apprehend the alleged rapist, she made photographic identifications of him and accompanied police on at least two occasions to view houses that she identified as the house in which she had been held; the defendant accompanied her on one of these occasions. None of the identifications turned out to be correct. Independently, over the course of six weeks after the alleged rape, the defendant observed at least one cab which he believed to be the same as that driven by the rapist and called his mother or the police to report what he had seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">On March 13, 1992, the defendant stopped at a gasoline station in the Dorchester section of Boston to talk with a friend. Shortly afterward, at the gasoline pump he saw a cab driver, Joseph Celestin, who fit his sister\u2019s description of the rapist. He called his sister from a public telephone and asked her to come to the station. When she arrived and was asked whether Celes-tin was the one who had raped her, she began to cry and told the defendant, \u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d The defendant then sent her home to tell their mother to telephone the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">As Celestin prepared to leave the gasoline station, the defendant grabbed him by the collar, saying, \u201cSo you like to rape people?\u201d When Celestin responded, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the defendant took this to be an admission and flew into a \u201cblind rage.\u201d He stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d and began to strike Celestin with his fists, knocking him to the ground and beating him for several minutes. The defendant then backed away from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Celestin and raised his hands in the air; he testified at trial that he had begun to have an asthma attack and was raising his arms to help himself breathe, but others testified that he raised his arms and shouted, as if in victory. Around this time, the defendant\u2019s girl friend and another of his sisters arrived at the gasoline station and tried to convince the defendant to stop the beating. He said, \u201cThis is the man who raped our sister.\u201d After a brief rest, he again began to beat Celestin, and his sister joined in the attack. The defendant and his sister each testified that they struck Celestin only with their fists, but others testified that the defendant kicked Celestin and that his sister sat on the ground with Celestin\u2019s head in a \u201cscissors hold\u201d between her legs while the defendant beat him. After a period of several more minutes, the defendant, according to his testimony, suffered another asthma attack, once again halting the beating and raising his arms in the air. He and his sister left the scene at that point, walking to a nearby park.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">At the end of the beating, Celestin was on the ground; the defendant and his sister testified that Celestin was on his knees and moving, but other witnesses testified that he was prone and barely conscious. Celestin was bleeding profusely from the mouth and had sustained bruises on his head, hands, and neck, internal bleeding in his head, and a crushed throat. He died twenty-four hours later as a result of blunt head and neck trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The defendant raises numerous objections to the jury instructions provided by the judge. Because he failed to preserve these issues for appeal, we review his claims under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and consider whether any errors in the charge created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>426 Mass. 395, 401 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagles, </em>419 Mass. 825, 834 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>414 Mass. 252, 265 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 297 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Malice aforethought, one of the essential elements of murder, \u201cmay be inferred if, in the circumstances known to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>defendant, a reasonably prudent person would have known that according to common experience there was a plain and strong likelihood that death would follow the contemplated act.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>399 Mass. 469, 470 n.1 (1987). Malice proved in this way is referred to as \u201cthird prong malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The defendant correctly complains that the judge erred in instructing the jury that malice may be inferred from an act creating a plain and strong likelihood that death <em>or grievous bodily harm </em>would follow.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is well settled that third prong malice \u201ccan only be satisfied by proof that \u2018there was a plain and strong likelihood of death\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>421 Mass. 400, 412 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, supra </em>at 303 n.14. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>422 Mass. 574, 580 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The first two prongs of malice are intent to kill and intent to cause grievous bodily injury. See <em>Grey, supra </em>at 470 n.1. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>jury\u2019s failure to specify third prong malice would have been nonprejudicial if they had found malice on either of these grounds. But the basis for the malice finding is unknown because the judge failed to instruct the jury to specify whether their first degree murder verdict was based on deliberate premeditation \u2014 which would have required a finding of first prong malice \u2014 or on extreme atrocity or cruelty, which is often based on third prong malice. In such a circumstance, where it is \u201cimpossible to discern which of the two grounds for conviction the jury selected\u201d in convicting the defendant of murder in the first degree, the verdict must be supportable on both grounds and is vitiated by an erroneous instruction on any of the three prongs of malice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Morgan, 422 Mass. 373, 384 (1996).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, where the jury might have based their decision on a theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty, an erroneous third prong malice instruction cannot be deemed nonprejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">At trial, the defendant not only failed to object to the judge\u2019s erroneous use of the bodily injury language, but actually requested the language used by the trial judge. Nevertheless, this error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice warranting reversal under \u00a7 33E. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 681 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Where the defendant\u2019s attack is inherently deadly, the lowering of the third prong malice standard to include grievous bodily injury may be nonprejudicial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vizcar-rondo, </em>427 Mass. 392, 397-398 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 390 (1995) (defendant had set fire to an apartment building in the middle of the night, which, under the circumstances known to the defendant, caused a plain and strong likelihood of death). In this case, however, there is a substantial likelihood, based on the evidence presented at trial, that a reasonable jury might have found that the defendant\u2019s acts created a plain and strong likelihood of grievous bodily injury, but not a plain and strong likelihood of death. If the jury grounded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>their finding of malice on the likelihood of injury, as the charge improperly allowed them to do, the defendant was convicted without the prosecution\u2019s having proved each element of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In addressing whether a particular defendant\u2019s conduct was inherently deadly, this court has held, at one end of the spectrum, that \u201ca simple blow with the hand administered to a healthy adult\u201d creates no \u201cplain and strong likelihood that death will follow.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Mahnke, 368 Mass. 662, 702-703 (1975), cert, denied, 425 U.S. 959 (1976). An attack by means of a deadly weapon, on the other hand, has often been held to be inherently deadly. See, e.g., <em>Mello, supra. </em>The facts of this case fall somewhere between the two. The beating was prolonged \u2014certainly more severe than a \u201csimple blow with the hand\u201d \u2014 and the victim was visibly and severely injured, yet the attack was not carried out by means of a deadly weapon. The length of the attack is in dispute; estimates provided at trial ranged from six minutes to twenty-five minutes. Evidence presented at trial is also in conflict regarding whether the defendant kicked the victim. A kick with a shod foot may be inherently deadly in some circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>356 Mass. 442, 445 (1969); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>307 Mass. 155, 158 (1940). We must take the view of the evidence most favorable to the defendant, however, and here, where it is unclear whether the defendant kicked the victim, we must assume he did not. Finally, the condition of the victim apparent during and after the attack is contested; some witnesses testified that the victim was prostrate and barely conscious when the defendant left the scene, whereas others testified that he was on his knees and moving.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Given the state of the evidence, a reasonable jury might have come to the conclusion that, in the circumstances known to the defendant, his actions did not create a plain and strong likelihood of death. It is fairly obvious, however, that the defendant\u2019s attack was sure to cause serious bodily injury. In these circumstances, there is a substantial likelihood that the jury, instructed that there is malice if the defendant\u2019s actions created a plain and strong likelihood of death or grievous bodily harm, based their finding of malice on the bodily harm portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>charge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Given the obvious risk of grievous bodily injury caused by repeated blows with a fist, they were presented with no need to decide the more difficult question whether those blows also were likely to cause death.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">We briefly consider the defendant\u2019s other complaints for guidance in the event of a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The defendant argues that the judge, in addition to providing the three prong definition of malice, used the \u201cframe of mind\u201d definition, which was specifically disapproved by this court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagles, </em>419 Mass. 825, 836-837 (1995), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, supra </em>at 470 n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">In recent cases, this court has consistently discouraged use of the frame of mind definition, which describes malice as a \u201cframe of mind which includes not only anger, hatred and revenge, but also any other unlawful and unjustifiable motive.\u201d <em>Eagles, supra </em>at 836. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>414 Mass. 252, 265 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>420 Mass. 479, 484 n.5 (1995). In <em>Eagles, supra </em>at 836, we stated that the language of the frame of mind definition is \u201cnot helpful and ought in the future to be omitted\u201d and that malice should be defined by \u201creference to the three prongs described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey.\u201d </em>On retrial, that language should be omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">The defendant also challenges the charge regarding the burden of proof on the issue of provocation. The judge, in explaining manslaughter to the jury, twice stated correctly that, if the evidence showed the existence of provocation, the Commonwealth bore the burden of proving its nonexistence in order to sustain a murder conviction. At three other points, however, the judge incorrectly stated that the Commonwealth bore the burden of proving the existence of provocation in order to sustain a manslaughter conviction. The judge clearly erred in instructing the jury that the Commonwealth bore the burden of proving the existence of provocation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>427 Mass. 714, 716 (1998). On retrial, the judge should make clear that the Commonwealth has the burden of proving the absence of provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The defendant complains that the judge understated the degree of risk required to sustain a conviction for \u201cwanton and reckless\u201d involuntary manslaughter by stating that conduct that \u201ccould lead to substantial harm or death\u201d would suffice. The proper standard is conduct producing a \u201chigh degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to another.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>413 Mass. 387, 394 (1992), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 399 (1944). This is the instruction that should be given on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The defendant also challenges the charge regarding involuntary manslaughter by battery. The judge described battery manslaughter merely as an \u201cassault and battery causing] the death of th[e] victim\u201d where the killing was unlawful. For a battery resulting in death to be battery manslaughter, there must have been a \u201c \u2018battery not amounting to a felony, when the defendant knew or should have known that the battery he was committing endangered human life.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>427 Mass. 100, 104 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitz-meyer, </em>414 Mass. 540, 547 (1993). This court has also described battery manslaughter as requiring a showing that the \u201cdefendant knew, or should have known, that his conduct created a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm would result to another.\u201d <em>Sneed, supra </em>at 393. On retrial, the judge should charge accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Finally, on retrial, the judge should charge the jury, in accordance with our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>416 Mass. 831, 837 (1994), that at least one of the factors listed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass. 216 (1983), must be present to support a verdict based on extreme atrocity or cruelty.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The defendant claims that the Commonwealth committed prosecutorial misconduct by both asking questions on cross-examination and making closing statements that indicated that Celestin had not committed rape and that alluded to his sister\u2019s prior incorrect identifications of the rapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Before trial, the judge ruled that, although he would not in opening statements allow allusion to evidence exculpating Celestin, he might allow the evidence to be introduced later. At the opening of the defendant\u2019s case, he ruled that, if the rape became an issue in the defendant\u2019s case, the prosecution would be allowed to explore the issue fully on rebuttal. Not until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Commonwealth called rebuttal witnesses did the judge rule that evidence tending to exonerate Celestin of the accusation of rape would be limited to facts known to the defendant. This ruling was correct, as the prosecutor\u2019s questions bore on whether the facts known to the defendant were such as would allow him to claim that a reasonable person in his situation would have been provoked to act as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">As to the defendant\u2019s complaint about two statements \u2014 to which he did not object at trial \u2014 made during the Commonwealth\u2019s summation, we make these comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">First, the prosecutor stated: \u201c[Wjhen you kill someone before knowing even whether or not it\u2019s the right person, whether or not that the [jic] person you\u2019re accusing was working on the day of the crime, whether or not the person that you\u2019re supposedly accusing was not there, whether or not someone else had already been identified\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s murder.\u201d Evidence had been presented that the defendant knew of his sister\u2019s mistaken identifications of the rapist. Because this knowledge was relevant, the Commonwealth was entitled to refer to it during closing argument. The phrase, \u201cwhether or not the person you\u2019re accusing was working on the day of the crime,\u201d goes beyond the permissible bounds of this argument, as Celestin\u2019s particular alibi was irrelevant. It should not be repeated on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The second portion of the closing argument to which the defendant objects is the statement that the defendant had been \u201cout looking for cab drivers, stopping cabs.\u201d This fact was not in evidence, and no mention of it should have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Finally, the defendant argues here, as he did in his motion for a new trial, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to investigate possible psychiatric defenses, to call expert witnesses to testify on that subject, and to request a mental impairment instruction. He challenges as well the judge\u2019s failure to provide a mental impairment instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">There can be no error in the judge\u2019s failure to provide a mental impairment instruction where no evidence of mental impairment was presented at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitz-meyer, </em>414 Mass. 540, 549 (1993). An examination of the full trial transcript has revealed nothing requiring a mental impairment instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>The defendant argues that the absence of such evidence in the record was due to trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate psychiatric defenses and produce expert testimony. The defendant has not, however, offered any evidence now that, if produced at trial, would have supported the instruction he seeks. Prior to retrial, defense counsel should look into this claimed defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, the verdict set aside, and the case remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-9\"> On his motion for a new trial, made before this appeal was heard, the defendant raised only the ineffective assistance of counsel claim discussed below, and as to that, in a case charging murder in the first degree, we review as if the objection had been made at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\"> The defendant makes two other arguments concerning the third prong malice charge. First, the judge used the language \u201ccould lead to\u201d death, as opposed to the \u201cplain and strong likelihood that death would follow\u201d standard set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>399 Mass. 469, 470 n.1 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Second, the charge inaccurately explained third prong malice\u2019s knowledge requirement. Third prong malice has both subjective and objective knowledge components. The proper standard is that, \u201cin the circumstances known to the defendant, a reasonably prudent person would have known that. . . there was a plain and strong likelihood that death would follow the contemplated act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant must have actual, subjective knowledge of circumstances that objectively would cause the reasonably prudent person to realize the likelihood of death. The judge at one point failed to state any knowledge requirement, instructing the jury that, \u201cintent to do an act creating a plain and strong likelihood that death or grievous bodily harm would follow\u201d would suffice. He later stated that \u201cmalice aforethought includes . . . any specific intent to do an act in circumstances where doing that act they knew or reasonably should have known that the doing of that act could lead to either grievous bodily injury or death.\u201d In neither of these instances did he instruct the jury that they must find that the defendant had actual knowledge of the circumstances creating the objective likelihood of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">These errors, by themselves, would not require a new trial. The judge\u2019s use of the terms \u201ccould result\u201d in injury or death was outweighed by his use of the \u201cplain and strong likelihood\u201d language at least once in the initial jury instructions and at least twice after the jury requested reinstruction regarding the elements of murder and manslaughter. The judge also stated once that the defendant should know that his conduct \u201cwould\u201d result in injury or death, an even higher threshold. The judge\u2019s improper use of the objective \u201cshould have known\u201d language with reference to third prong malice is outweighed by at least two instances in which he used the proper subjective knowledge language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\"> Almost two years after the defendant\u2019s trial, we held in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>420 Mass. 95, 112 (1995), that, on request, a judge should instruct the jury that they must unanimously agree on a theory of culpability when the defendant has been charged with murder in the first degree. <em>Berry </em>was inapplicable at the defendant\u2019s trial because it was decided after the jury\u2019s verdict and was explicitly held to be prospective. It should be noted, however, that <em>Berry </em>will be controlling on retrial and would require such an instruction to be given if requested. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b413-10\"> This likelihood is strengthened by the number of times the judge reiterated the bodily injury language during the instruction on malice. He used the words \u201cdeath or grievous bodily harm,\u201d three times; \u201cgrievous bodily injury or death,\u201d once.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
