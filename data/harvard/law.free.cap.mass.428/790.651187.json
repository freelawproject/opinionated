We conclude that the defendant is barred from holding the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The background of the case is as follows. In 1975, or thereabouts, the defendant was appointed a police officer in Chelsea, and in the mid-1980\u2019s, he was promoted to the rank of captain and became commander of the vice squad.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">On August 20, 1993, after a jury trial in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the defendant was convicted of six felony counts of filing false income tax returns.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The charges covered the tax years 1987 through 1992, and involved $51,314.36 in unreported income from electrician and snowplowing businesses conducted by the defendant. The parties stipulated that the defendant\u2019s failure to report this income resulted in a tax loss of $14,368.02 to the United States government. In addition, the sentencing judge found that the total tax loss from the defendant\u2019s filing false tax returns was approximately $43,103.95, a sum which reflected the judge\u2019s determination of additional unreported income for the tax years 1974 through 1985. (These years were not the subject of indictments.) The defendant was sentenced to a term of one year in prison, an additional year of supervised release, and he was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine. The defendant\u2019s sentence was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in an unpublished decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">On December 15, 1993, the defendant was notified by the receiver of Chelsea that, because of his felony convictions and prison sentence, he had been removed from his office as a member of the Chelsea police force by operation of G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 30, which automatically removes from public office any person sentenced to prison for a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">In 1994, the voters in Chelsea approved a new city charter that replaced the receivership that had been overseeing the city with a city council and city manager form of government. Section 9-6 of the charter is entitled \u201cDisqualification from Office,\u201d and provides, \u201cAny individual who has been finally convicted of a criminal offense involving misconduct in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>elective or appointive public office, trust or employment at any time held by him shall not be eligible to serve in any other elective or appointive office or position under the city.\u201d The Legislature subsequently enacted the new charter, and it was signed into law by the Governor. See St. 1994, c. 103, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">In May, 1997, the defendant obtained the necessary documents from the Chelsea city clerk to seek nomination as a candidate for city councillor from district 1. The defendant subsequently submitted sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot. No registered voter of district 1 filed a challenge under G. L. c. 55B, \u00a7 7, to the defendant\u2019s candidacy, and in the election held on November 4, 1997, he received the greater number of votes for the office of district 1 city councillor.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The Chelsea city manager requested that the Attorney General bring an action in the nature of quo warranto under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 9, to bar the defendant from taking office. The Attorney General filed an action under that statute in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County seeking a declaration that the defendant was ineligible to take office as a city councillor and an injunction preventing him from doing so. A single justice of this court transferred the case to the Superior Court under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A. A preliminary injunction was thereafter entered in that court enjoining the defendant from taking office or serving as a city councillor. The parties then submitted a statement of agreed facts together with cross motions for summary judgment. A judge in the Superior Court granted the defendant\u2019s motion, denied the Attorney General\u2019s motion, and entered a judgment dismissing the action. The judgment has been stayed pending the Attorney General\u2019s appeal which we transferred to this court on our own motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The phrase \u201cmisconduct in any elective or appointive public office, trust or employment\u201d in \u00a7 9-6 of the Chelsea city charter also appears in G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25, the statute providing for the suspension of public officials and employees who engage in such misconduct. It should be presumed that the Legislature, in approving \u00a7 9-6 of the Chelsea city charter, intended that the phrase be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with existing case law construing G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25, and similar provisions in related areas. See <em>Andover Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Commis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number><em>sioner of Revenue, </em>387 Mass. 229, 240-241 (1982). With respect to \u00a7 25, the Appeals Court has recognized that, although \u201ca crime arising from an employee\u2019s off-duty conduct is not generally considered misconduct in office .... [t]here are. . . circumstances where the crime charged, no matter where or when performed, is so inimical to the duties inherent in the employment that an indictment for that crime is for misconduct in office.\u201d <em>Dupree </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 535, 537 (1983). See <em>Perryman </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 346, 350-351 (1983) (indictment of two teachers for welfare fraud constituted \u201cmisconduct in office\u201d because lying to, and stealing from, the public violated a teacher\u2019s position of special public trust). In construing the phrase \u201cmisconduct in office\u201d appearing in G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 6, governing removal of members of housing authorities, we have said that such misconduct includes the \u201cintentional violation of a known and significant rule or duty inherent in the obligations of [the] office.\u201d <em>Bunte </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>361 Mass. 71, 76 (1972). In construing the phrase \u201cmisconduct ... in their offices\u201d appearing in the Massachusetts Constitution, Part n, c. 1, \u00a7 2, art. 8, concerning the impeachment of State officers, the Justices rejected the view that the phrase excluded acts of misconduct that were \u201cin no way related to the office held or the duties of said office,\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>308 Mass. 619, 621 (1941), and they went on to state that the phrase encompassed misconduct that \u201ccan be said reasonably to render [the officer] unfit to continue to hold [his] office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">There is case law pointing out that police officers voluntarily undertake to adhere to a higher standard of conduct than that imposed on ordinary citizens. Citing four previous decisions of this court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as \"but a sample\u201d of the law on the obligations of police officers, the Appeals Court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">\u201cThese cases teach a simple lesson. Police officers must comport themselves in accordance with the laws that they are sworn to enforce <em>and </em>behave in a manner that brings honor and respect for rather than public distrust of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>enforcement personnel. They are required to do more than refrain from indictable conduct. Police officers are not drafted into public service; rather, they compete for their positions. In accepting employment by the public, they implicitly agree that they will not engage in conduct which calls into question their ability and fitness to perform their official responsibilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-5\"><em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 364, 371 (1986). Consistent with these observations, the Appeals Court has upheld the discharge of police officers who behaved inappropriately while off duty. See <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 594, 601 (1996) (officer lost his firearm while intoxicated and verbally abused other officers); <em>McIsaac </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 475, 476 (1995) (officer negligently handled firearm while intoxicated and verbally abused other officers). See also <em>Commissioners of Civil Serv. </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Brighton Dist., </em>369 Mass. 166, 170-171 (1975), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Patuto </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Civil Serv., </em>429 U.S. 845 (1976) (upholding discharge of off-duty police officer who accompanied others while they uttered forged money orders). We note as well that the Legislature has recognized the need for a high standard of conduct for police officers in G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 96A, which prohibits the appointment of anyone who has been convicted of a felony as a police officer of a city, town, or district, and G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 14, which imposes a similar prohibition on appointments to the State police.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted misconduct in office which bars him under \u00a7 9-6 of the Chelsea city charter from holding the position of city councillor. His six convictions for Federal income tax evasion constituted convictions of serious felonies involving \u201clying to and stealing from the public.\u201d <em>Perryman </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, supra </em>at 351. These convictions required his termination under G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 30, from the position of rank and responsibility held by him in the Chelsea police department. Had he committed the offenses prior to his appointment, he would have been disqualified from being appointed a police officer at either the State or local level.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The defendant\u2019s criminal dishonesty also violated the oath he took when he became a police officer to uphold the laws of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>United States, as well as regulations of the Chelsea police department establishing a \u201cLaw Enforcement Code of Ethics.\u201d Provisions of the latter called on a police officer to \u201ckeep [his] private life unsullied as an example to all\u201d; to \u201crecognize the badge of [his] office as a symbol of public faith and . . . accept it as a public trust\u201d; to be \u201c[h]onest in thought and deed . . . both [in] personal and official life\u201d; and to be \u201cexemplary in obeying the laws of the land.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The United States District Court judge who sentenced the defendant recognized that the defendant had committed a serious violation of his sworn obligations to obey and uphold the law. The judge, as part of the sentencing proceedings, admonished the defendant for his crimes in these terms: \u201c[Y]ou, of all people, as a senior law enforcement officer, had a duty to obey to the letter all of the laws you swore to uphold. You abused that duty and your office. . . . Any time you as a senior police officer knowingly violate a public law, you compromise your ability to enforce the law fully and you make yourself a target for blackmail. . . . When you or any other senior officer in a police force violates the law, you abuse a position of public and private trust; and your conviction for violating the tax laws unfairly taints the reputation of every honest police officer in Chelsea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">In reaching our conclusion, we have considered and rejected the defendant\u2019s arguments that the misconduct is not significant enough to render him unfit to hold the office of city councillor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The case does not involve a minor offense. It involves dishonest and felonious conduct knowingly committed by the defendant, over a period of at least six years, amounting, in effect, to a theft of a substantial amount of money from the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The judgment is vacated. A new judgment is to enter (a) declaring that the defendant\u2019s criminal convictions and sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>ing are for misconduct which, under \u00a7 9-6 of the Chelsea city charter, renders him ineligible to serve in an elective or appointive office or position in or under the Chelsea city government; and (b) enjoining him from talcing office or serving as the city councillor for district one.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-9\"> The jury acquitted the defendant of additional charges of racketeering and conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\"> Pending resolution of the appeal, the incumbent district one councillor has continued to serve in that position in accordance with \u00a7 2(c) of the new Chelsea city charter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\"> The decisions referred to were <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>368 Mass. 33, 41-43 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1048 (1976); <em>Huntoon </em>v. <em>Quincy, </em>349 Mass. 9, 14 (1965); <em>Mayor of Newton </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>333 Mass. 340, 343 (1955); <em>Mayor of Medford </em>v. <em>First Dist. Court of E. Middle-sex, </em>249 Mass. 465, 470 (1924).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\"> As a corollary to the conclusion that police officers can be disciplined for serious off-duty conduct, we have acknowledged that police are subject to the rules and regulations of their department when off duty. See <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>368 Mass. 33, 34 n.1 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b819-11\"> We discern nothing in <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, </em>377 Mass. 212 (1979), that calls for a different conclusion. In particular, the dictum, <em>id. </em>at 213 n.3 (stating that, \u201c[b]ecause the plaintiff [an Appeals Court chief deputy sheriff] was not indicted \u2018for misconduct in [his public] office or employment,\u2019 the sheriff did not have the power to suspend him under G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25\u201d), has no application to this case where serious off-duty behavior constitutes misconduct in office based on the case law and other considerations we have discussed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
