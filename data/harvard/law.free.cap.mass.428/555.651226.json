In a related case, <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501 (1997) <em>(Demoulas I), </em>we affirmed, for the most part, judgments entered in stockholder derivative and contempt actions. We upheld the judge\u2019s conclusions that Telemachus A. Demoulas (Telemachus), the primary defendant in this case, and other defendants (several of whom are also defendants in this case), had participated in, or benefited from, numerous improper diversions of corporate opportunities and self-dealing transactions to the detriment of Demoulas Super Markets, Inc. (DSM), and other corporations and businesses. We concluded as well that the judge had correctly based her remedies for the many wrongs committed on the principle of preventing unjust enrichment, and that she appropriately ordered (with certain adjustments) rescission of the improper transactions and disgorgement of wrongful gains. We also affirmed a judgment of contempt against DSM for violating an injunction through the wrongful payout of undistributed corporate earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>In this action, the widow and children of George Demoulas (George), the brother of Telemachus, charged that Telemachus, acting for himself, DSM, and his children (defendant children), had used wrongful means to acquire a greater share of ownership in DSM and other entities, at the expense of members of George\u2019s family. The case was tried to a jury. At the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, a motion for directed verdict filed by the defendant children was allowed, and the jury did not consider the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against them. The jury returned answers to special questions on the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims and found that Telemachus had committed fraud, conversion, and breach of fiduciary duties with respect to substantial estate and trust assets. The jury went on to conclude, in great detail, that Telemachus\u2019s considerable wrongdoing included the transfer, purchase, and redemption of DSM and other stock belonging to George\u2019s widow, Evanthea Demoulas (Evanthea), and Evanthea and George\u2019s children (plaintiff children), the other plaintiffs, as well as wrongdoing in connection with the ownership of real estate. Among other effects, the result of the misdeeds found by the jury was, over a period of time, to increase the proportion of DSM stock in the control of Telemachus\u2019s side of the family to 92%, to the almost total exclusion of George\u2019s side of the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Based on the jury\u2019s findings, the judge, after lengthy and contentious posttrial hearings, ordered relief essentially in the form of rescission and reformation. On appeal, the defendants do not dispute that the jury\u2019s findings were warranted on the evidence they heard. Telemachus maintains, however, that there must be a new trial for several reasons. The defendant children claim that it was error for the judge to impose a constructive trust on DSM stock they own, and to reform a real estate partnership to take away some of their ownership. DSM challenges a ruling concerning redemption of some of its shares and contests the relief ordered against it. The respective arguments of the defendants will be explained as we resolve the issues in each of the three appeals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that Telemachus and DSM make no argument that entitles them to judgment in their favor or a new trial. We also conclude that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>children are entitled to an evidentiary hearing to decide whether they were bona fide purchasers of the DSM stock and partnership interests they acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Appeal of Telemachus.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">1. Telemachus contends that there must be a new trial because the judge failed to grant the defendants the correct number of peremptory challenges. The background necessary to resolution of this issue is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The trial posed a challenge for the judge in terms of its complexity and the need to deal with the considerable acrimony between the parties. The plaintiffs\u2019 fourth amended complaint was 125 pages long, and a voluminous file of pretrial pleadings had been assembled. There were teams of lawyers on each side. It was anticipated that the trial would be long. (It lasted eighty-five days. There were seventy-two days of actual trial, and the jury deliberated for thirteen days and delivered twenty-six pages of findings in answer to special questions.)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The judge held a pretrial conference which was recorded. At that conference, the allotment of peremptory challenges was discussed in connection with the judge\u2019s decision (agreed to by all counsel) to empanel a jury of sixteen members.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">At the time of trial, there were five plaintiffs, and six defendants. There was considerable indecision and disagreement on the part of all counsel as to the proper number of peremptory challenges available to each side. One of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel thought that requirements governing the number of peremptory challenges, when a jury of sixteen members are selected, called for twenty-four challenges. Another of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated that, the plaintiffs\u2019 team had done \u201cthe math,\u201d and the team had concluded that each side should get 120 peremptory challenges. In response to this proposition, the judge stated, \u201cIt is not going to happen.\u201d Counsel for Telemachus (acting on behalf of all defendants) stated that he wanted to \u201ccheck [the] Rule,\u201d before agreeing to a prescribed number of peremptory challenges because, as he said, \u201ceach one of [the defendants] has his or her own peremp-tories.\u201d The judge concluded the disagreement among counsel with the following ruling: \u201cWell, whatever the Rule is, I am going to be efficient here. I think, having given it a little thought before you all came in here, I think you are each [meaning each side] going to get twenty-five.\u201d The plaintiffs accepted this al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>lotment. Counsel for Telemachus (still acting on behalf of all the defendants) did not, and he stated his opinion that the defendants were entitled to five more challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Jury selection proceeded. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel exercised twenty peremptory challenges. Counsel for Telemachus exercised all twenty-five challenges granted by the judge, and was denied the five additional challenges to which he claimed the defendants were entitled. He later argued to the judge that the defendants \u201cwould have used some or all of [the five additional claimed challenges]\u201d in selecting the jury if they had been granted, but he failed to designate which juror or jurors in the final seating would have been struck had the extra challenges been made available.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The matter of peremptory challenges in a civil case is governed by G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 29, which states that \u201ceach party shall be entitled to four peremptory challenges,\u201d and by Mass. R. Civ. P. 47 (b), 365 Mass. 812 (1974), which states, in pertinent part, that, in addition to the challenges allowed by the statute, \u201c[e]ach side [will be] entitled to ... 2 peremptory challenges if 3 or 4 additional jurors are to be impanelled.\u201d There is a difference between the language of the statute (\u201ceach party\u201d), and that of the rule (\u201ceach side\u201d). \u201cAlthough Rule 47(b), in setting forth the right to additional peremptory challenges when additional jurors are impaneled, talks of each <em>\u2018side\u2019 </em>(as opposed to <em>\u2018party\u2019), </em>no sound reason precludes allowing the additional challenges to each party entitled to the four initial peremptory challenges (although on the same side of the <em>versus).\u201d </em>J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 47.4, at 167-168 (1977 &amp; Supp. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Reading the statute and the rule to give them consistency, we calculate that the plaintiffs and the defendants should have had thirty-six peremptory challenges on each side.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In arguing that there must be a new trial because the defendants were deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>of additional peremptory challenges, Telemachus relies primarily on criminal cases where we have carefully scrutinized any claimed errors with respect to such challenges in order to protect the liberty interests of defendants. A representative list of decisions which he cites is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">This case stands on a different footing. In a civil case, \u201c \u2018a refusal to allow the proper number of peremptory challenges [is] regarded as immaterial in the absence of a showing that the party affected was required to accept one or more jurors whom he wished to challenge\u2019 <em>(Tamburello </em>v. Welch, 392 S.W.2d 114, 116 [Tex. 1965]), or in the absence of a showing that the ruling affected the jury\u2019s verdict in some material way. <em>Id. </em>at 117-118.\u201d <em>Andras </em>v. <em>Marcyoniak, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1043, 1044 (1982), citing <em>Upchurch </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>197 So. 2d 26, 27-28 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1967). Cf. <em>Rickett </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>256 Ark. 893, 895-896 (1974). When a new trial is sought in a civil case because of a miscalculation in the number of peremptory challenges, a measure of discretion exists in deciding whether either of these factors has been clearly demonstrated by the complaining party. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>See <em>Andras </em>v. <em>Marcyoniak, supra, </em>and cases cited. On the procedural background previously set forth, there has been no showing of error that would require a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">2. An important witness in the plaintiffs\u2019 case was the plaintiff, Evanthea, who, as George\u2019s widow, was a cofiduciary with Telemachus in administering and distributing George\u2019s estate and other assets. In answering the special questions posed to them, and finding that Telemachus had engaged in massive wrongdoing, the jury appear to have relied on Evanthea\u2019s testimony. That testimony was introduced through the reading of her deposition to the jury because Evanthea, at the time of trial, was incompetent to testify due to a serious \u201cmemory loss condition.\u201d Telemachus argues that the judge erred in admitting Evanthea\u2019s deposition testimony because Evanthea was incompetent when she gave her deposition. The following is the background necessary to resolution of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">One of the central questions at the trial was whether Evanthea was aware of, and understood, the transactions memorialized in the several documents she executed, involving both George\u2019s and her own assets. These transactions shifted some of the ownership in DSM and other businesses from George\u2019s side of the family to Telemachus\u2019s side. The plaintiffs alleged that she had not been fully informed by Telemachus as to the full legal significance of the transactions and as to the fairness of the prices received. The defendants maintained that Evanthea initiated the transactions and understood and consented to all their terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">On the sixteenth day of trial, February 1, 1994, counsel for the plaintiffs told the judge in a recorded lobby conference that it was unlikely they would be able to put Evanthea on the witness stand because of her then-existing medical condition. The plaintiffs sought instead to introduce in evidence before the jury Evanthea\u2019s deposition testimony, which had been taken in March, June, and July of 1991, and July of 1992, and which concerned transactions that had taken place between 1971 and 1982. The judge discussed with counsel the procedure by which she would decide Evanthea\u2019s competency, both current, and at the time of her deposition. The plaintiffs offered to present Evanthea\u2019s physician to the court ex parte. Counsel for the defendants objected to the offer. The judge, in response to the defense objection, said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you are entitled to cross-examine on that issue. Competency is a question for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Judge.\u201d Subsequently, the judge agreed to allow the defendants\u2019 counsel to examine Evanthea\u2019s medical records with their own expert and to present another opinion regarding her competency at the planned hearing with Evanthea\u2019s physician. On that day, the judge stated, once again, that, \u201cas a matter of law, the issue of competency is exclusively for [me to decide].\u201d The judge concluded that Evanthea was not competent to testify, but that her deposition could be read to the jury, and that she (the judge) would make a statement to them that Evanthea\u2019s condition was such that Evanthea could have both short term and long term memory loss. The judge went on to say: \u201cAnd [the deposition testimony will be admitted] for the weight that the jury [choose] to give [to it]. Since I can\u2019t decide and no one here knows, I\u2019m going to let them give it whatever weight they want.\u201d Further, the judge stated that there was a \u201cpresumption towards competency and [that a judge should] let the jury decide. [The jury\u2019s function] goes to weight, to the extent that it\u2019s unclear, when there\u2019s a question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">On the day that the doctors\u2019 statements as to Evanthea\u2019s past condition and her deposition were to be introduced in evidence, the judge stated that she had no basis on which to exclude Evanthea\u2019s deposition. The judge subsequently instructed the jury that she was \u201cunable, as a matter of law, to decide [Evanthea\u2019s] competency at [the] time [her deposition was given].\u201d The judge told the jury that counsel for both sides would be allowed to read statements prepared by medical experts, and that the deposition would be read to them. She charged them with the responsibility of deciding \u201cwhat weight to give [Evanthea\u2019s] testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Telemachus argues that (a) the judge erred by not affirmatively deciding Evanthea\u2019s competency to testify at the time of her deposition; and (b) an examination of the record of her deposition does not support a finding of her competence as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">(a) The judge understood her role as a gatekeeper, and, by not finding Evanthea to be unquestionably incompetent, admitted her testimony as competent. Under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, \u201cAny person of sufficient understanding, although a party, may testify in any proceeding, civil or criminal . . . .\u201d Preliminary questions concerning the qualification or competency of a person to be a witness are reserved almost exclusively to the judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brusgulis, </em>398 Mass. 325, 329 (1986). A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>judge possesses discretion to determine the method by which a witness\u2019s competency is to be tested. See <em>id. </em>at 329-330. In the usual case, the judge conducts a voir dire examination of the witness, but the judge may require an examination of the witness\u2019s mental condition by a physician or other expert if appropriate to resolution of the issue. See P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 6.3, at 262 (6th ed. 1994 &amp; Supp. 1998); G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 19. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gibbons, </em>378 Mass. 766, 771-773 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">This is not the usual case. The judge\u2019s and the medical experts\u2019 only tools to determine Evanthea\u2019s competency in 1991 and 1992, when her deposition was taken, were the text of her deposition testimony and a report from a physician who had examined her at about the time the deposition was taken. That physician\u2019s report indicated that she demonstrated at that time significant short-term memory loss, problems with concentration and possible depression. He apparently did not examine her for evidence of long-term memory loss.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The reports of the medical experts retained by the parties, as to Evanthea\u2019s competency at the time of her deposition, were inconclusive. The defendants\u2019 expert concluded that Evanthea\u2019s deposition testimony was unreliable because of memory impairments. The plaintiffs\u2019 expert equivocated as to whether Evanthea\u2019s inability to provide answers to many questions posed at the deposition was a result of memory impairment. Based on these inconclusive opinions, the judge decided to admit Evanthea\u2019s deposition testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The defendants principally rely on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reagan, </em>175 Mass. 335 (1900), and its progeny for the proposition that the judge erred in allowing Evanthea\u2019s deposition testimony in evidence. The <em>Reagan </em>case holds that, if the competency of a witness is challenged, the judge must examine the witness and can allow testimony only if satisfied as to competency. See <em>id. </em>at 340. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gibbons, supra </em>at 778. The plaintiffs rely on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>379 Mass. 640, 656 (1980), and argue that prior recorded testimony is to be admitted unless the judge is convinced the witness is incompetent. As Justice Kaplan said in the <em>Whitehead </em>case, \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>tendency . . . except in quite clear cases of incompetency, is to let the witness testify and have the triers make any proper discount for the quality of her understanding.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We read the cases together to mean that, under the modem trend, a judge may accept as competent for testimony a witness whose reliability is, in her judgment, at most, marginally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The judge, in allowing Evanthea\u2019s deposition testimony in evidence, implicitly decided that, at the time of her deposition, Evanthea was competent under the standard articulated in the <em>Whitehead </em>case. The judge\u2019s choice of language used in front of the jury was unfortunate, but viewed in the light of her prior statements clearly indicating that she understood her role as gatekeeper, we conclude that she admitted the evidence because she did not think Evanthea was \u201cclearly incompetent,\u201d and therefore, was \u201ccompetent.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Finally, the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury did not impose on them an improper duty to decide Evanthea\u2019s competency. While the judge told the jury that she could not decide Evanthea\u2019s competency, she assigned to the jury only the duty of weighing Evanthea\u2019s testimony. The judge\u2019s use of the word \u201cweight\u201d expresses a term of art. In the context of the entire jury instructions on the issue, the term reasonably suggested to the jury, not that they had the sole obligation of qualifying the deposition testimony as admissible evidence, but that they only had to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>decide how much to rely on the deposition in reaching their factual conclusions in answer to the special questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">(b) Telemachus next argues that the judge \u201cplainly erred in admitting the deposition testimony despite the clear absence of any affirmative evidence that Evanthea\u2019s memory was intact at the time her deposition was taken.\u201d He requests that we examine the record on the issue of Evanthea\u2019s competency de novo, and he maintains that such an inquiry establishes, as a matter of law, that the jury should not have been allowed to consider the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">A two-part test applies to determine competency: whether the witness has the general ability or capacity to (1) \u201cobserve, remember, and give expression to that which she ha[s] seen, heard, or experienced\u201d; and (2) \u201ccomprehend the difference between truth and falsehood.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brusgulis, supra </em>at 329, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tatisos, </em>238 Mass. 322, 325 (1921). While Evanthea was not directly questioned as to whether she understood truth from falsehood, she was able to remember, and to articulate, her recollection in several areas of the dispute that were highly relevant. For example, Evanthea testified that, when her signature was needed on a legal document, she would be called on the telephone by Telemachus and told to go to the family lawyer\u2019s office. Once there, the document\u2019s purpose was not explained by anyone; she was merely told to sign the document. Evanthea rarely read documents she was asked to sign. In at least one instance, she was not allowed to take a document home to show it to her children. Evanthea was emphatic that she had trusted Telemachus and the family lawyers, and she had believed that they were acting properly in her behalf and in behalf of George\u2019s estate. She recalled being told by, and not distrusting, Telemachus that she must sell her DSM stock because she did not work in the company, and she remembered hearing from her son Evan that Telemachus wanted Evan to sell him his DSM stock. Other key events were similarly recounted by Evanthea.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The defendants point to the medical experts\u2019 opinions and the inconsistency of Evanthea\u2019s answers to many questions as conclusive proof of incompetency. However, the medical experts disagreed about Evanthea\u2019s competency. Further, inconsistencies in a witness\u2019s testimony do not establish incompetency, but usually raise issues of credibility and weight for the factfinder to decide. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamontagne, </em>42 Mass. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Ct. 213, 218 (1997). While Evanthea\u2019s answers to questions frequently were, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d or occasionally inconsistent, she was able to remember and describe consistently many critical events that were relevant to the matters before the jury. It is difficult from the deposition testimony to determine whether Evanthea\u2019s inability to answer questions was due to lack of knowledge or memory impairment, but, considered as a whole, her testimony was not so inherently unreliable that the jury should not have heard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">3. Telemachus\u2019s final contention is that the judge erred in admitting evidence of the \u201cfair value\u201d of DSM stock and other interests purchased by Telemachus from the plaintiffs because that valuation technique does not discount for a minority interest or poor marketability of closely held interests. He contends that the jury\u2019s answers to special questions as to the values of the stocks and other interests are wrong because they were influenced by this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The plaintiffs claimed, and the jury found, that Telemachus had violated his fiduciary duty, committed fraud, and, in some cases, committed conversion with respect to twelve transactions in his role as coexecutor of George\u2019s estate with Evanthea and as her trusted advisor. Eleven of the twelve transactions involved the sale of corporate or partnership interests in family entities from George\u2019s estate to Telemachus, a member of Telemachus\u2019s immediate family, or DSM employees with whom Telemachus had a close working relationship.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These transactions gave, and later expanded, a controlling majority interest in the entities to Telemachus\u2019s family. The plaintiffs argued that Telemachus knowingly sold these assets to himself or his family members from George\u2019s estate at inadequate prices. The value of the assets was thus an important issue, both to determine whether the prices paid were inadequate, and as it turned out later, to determine an appropriate remedy for the wrongdoing that had been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Both sides introduced testimony from expert witnesses about the value of the closely held stock and the partnership interests.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The experts for the plaintiffs, over objection, provided testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>as to the \u201cfair value\u201d of the assets, and the experts for the defendants, over objection, provided testimony as to the \u201cfair market value\u201d of the assets. One of the plaintiffs\u2019 experts defined \u201cfair value,\u201d in regard to valuation of corporations, as \u201cthe proportional share of the [value of the] entire enterprise . . . owned by each stockholder in accordance with the percent of stock they own.\u201d \u201cFair market value,\u201d on the other hand, was defined by one of the defendants\u2019 experts as \u201cthe price at which an asset will change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller with neither party being under compulsion to buy or sell and with both parties having full knowledge of all relevant facts.\u201d Because the assets involved minority interests, not actively traded on the open market, one of the defendants\u2019 experts stated that, in order to arrive at \u201cfair market value,\u201d the price needed to be discounted to reflect lack of liquidity and additional risk. Further discounts were made to the price of the DSM and Valley stocks in George\u2019s estate to reflect that ownership was subject to voting trust agreements, which included a relinquishment of the right to vote the shares and receive dividends; that a right of first refusal was reserved by DSM and Valley as to the sale of any of their respective stocks; and that the companies were heavily dependent on the leadership of Telemachus, whose health had declined over the years. The valuation of the interests in Delta &amp; Delta was subject to a similar dispute. The application of these two different approaches to valuation resulted in a wide disparity in reported values.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Telemachus claims that it was error to admit the evidence of \u201cfair value\u201d because that calculation does not take into account the discounts mentioned above. He asserts that, \u201c[t]he evidence relating to price was admitted solely as evidence of [his] alleged misconduct in arranging the sales of the plaintiffs\u2019 stock and partnership interests,\u201d and that the evidence was only relevant to determine whether the plaintiffs received a fair price for their assets, and not whether he was receiving a personal gain or advantage from the transactions. Telemachus further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>contends that the judge allowed the jury to find violations of fiduciary duty, fraud, and conversion based on their valuation conclusions derived from the experts\u2019 testimony.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He agrees that a fiduciary in his various positions has a duty to obtain the \u201cbest price possible\u201d for assets sold, but he argues that that standard calls for \u201cfair market value,\u201d not \u201cfair value.\u201d If the jury\u2019s valuation conclusions were based even in part on \u201cfair values,\u201d Telemachus maintains, it is error. \u201cFair value,\u201d he says, may come into play in selecting a remedy, but it should not be used as a basis for finding liability. To support all these arguments, Telemachus relies heavily on the recent Appeals Court decision in <em>Shear </em>v. <em>Gabovitch, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 650 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">We reject his arguments. In the <em>Shear </em>case, the Appeals Court concluded that trustees did not breach their fiduciary duty by selling a minority interest to majority shareholders in a close corporation for \u201cfair market value,\u201d which included a discount for lack of marketability. See <em>id. </em>at 676-678. This conclusion does not mean, as Telemachus asserts, that fair market value is the only relevant value when examining sales of minority interests by a fiduciary. In <em>Shear, </em>the plaintiff was the beneficiary of trusts holding stock representing a one-third interest in a closely held corporation. She sued the trustees, alleging, among other issues, that the trustees violated their fiduciary duty by failing to obtain an adequate price when the trustees sold the stock, at her request, to the corporation\u2019s two other shareholders. In <em>Shear, </em>the minority shareholders themselves instigated the sale, and the trustees were not self-interested as shareholders. <em>Id. </em>at 677. In this case, the asset holders, Evanthea and the plaintiff children, did not precipitate the sales. Instead, Telemachus, acting as a fiduciary, initiated the sales, and he was, or stood to become (with his family), the majority shareholder in DSM and the other interests at issue. Telemachus\u2019s role cannot be equated in any relevant way with the role of the trustees in <em>Shear.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The <em>Shear </em>case goes on to expressly recognize that a minor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>ity discount is not always appropriate where minority shares are being sold to the majority shareholders. Id. at 677, citing 12B Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Private Corporations \u00a7 5906.120, at 435 (1993). In <em>Shear, </em>the court said, \u201c[i]n such a situation, the minority shares are freed from the limitations of minority status, and there is no reason the sellers should not receive hill, i.e., undiscounted, value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is no reason in this case, where a controlling shareholder (or one seeking to become one) has brought about the transactions, and where a minority shareholder is authorized, but not obligated, to sell, that evidence of the un-discounted value would not have relevance. These arguments are equally applicable to the valuation of the partnership interests in Delta &amp; Delta.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The \u201cclear error\u201d that Telemachus asserts would most logically apply in the reverse situation, where the minority shareholders or owners instigate and desire the sale. Here, had the plaintiffs known and understood that Telemachus, by acquiring the DSM and Valley shares for himself and his children, would make his family the controlling owners of the interests, they would have had no reason to think that the opening offer should include market discounts. Evidence of undiscounted value thus has probative force, because the minority interests might not have chosen to sell to Telemachus and his family at discounted values if full disclosure had been made. Therefore, evidence of fair value tended to show a violation of obligations on Telemachus\u2019s part, and tended to show that he was self-dealing in a way which failed to obtain the \u201cbest possible price\u201d for the assets transferred from George\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Appeal of the Children of Telemachus.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">4. The defendant children of Telemachus (Arthur T. Demou-las, Gloriarme D. Famham, Caren D. Pasquale, and Frances D. Kettenbach), appeal from the portion of the judgment imposing a constructive trust on the 400 shares of DSM stock they acquired from George\u2019s estate. They argue that the judge erred in concluding that, as a matter of law, they were not bona fide purchasers of the stock, and, if this contention is rejected, they argue alternatively, that they should have been allowed to present evidence that they were entitled to that protected status. The background necessary to resolution of these issues is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">When George died in 1971, he held, among other assets, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>1,220 shares of DSM stock. In his will, he directed that 920 shares be placed in one of two trusts for the benefit of Evanthea, and that 300 shares be placed in trusts for the benefit of the plaintiff children (Evan G. Demoulas, Diana D. Merriam, Fo-tene Demoulas, and Arthur S. Demoulas). Telemachus and Evanthea were named co-executors of the will and cotrustees of the testamentary trusts. On January 20, 1977, Telemachus, as coexecutor, arranged the sale of the 920 shares of DSM stock to the defendant children, the plaintiff children, two long-time employees of DSM (James Miamis and Julian Lacourse), and to himself.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 fourth amended complaint made claims against the defendant children, asserting that they were liable along with Telemachus for his fraud and violations of fiduciary duty, and further asserting that the defendant children were not bona fide purchasers for value of 400 shares of DSM stock transferred to them in 1977 from George\u2019s estate by Telemachus and Evanthea as coexecutors. The plaintiffs\u2019 fourth amended complaint also requested that the judge impose a constructive trust on all property unlawfully sold, transferred, or redeemed from the plaintiffs, including the DSM stock sold to the defendant children in 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">At the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 case against all the defendants, the defendant children moved under Mass. R. Civ. R 50 (a), 365 Mass. 814 (1974), for a directed verdict. The judge allowed the motion. In her written memorandum of decision, she concluded that (a) \u201c[tjhere has not been a scintilla of evidence that the defendant children directly participated in the alleged fraud [of Telemachus] or that they had knowledge of the fraud from which liability could be inferred\u201d; (b) there was no evidence to support a finding that Telemachus was acting as an agent of the defendant children when he transferred to them the 400 shares of DSM stock; and (c) there was \u201cno evidence to suggest that the defendant children had a fiduciary relationship with any of the plaintiffs.\u201d (This latter determination would appear to mean that there was no such relationship in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>with the administration of George\u2019s estate.) The judge also concluded that she did not have to decide whether the defendant children were bona fide purchasers of the DSM stock because, as she put the issue, \u201cthe plaintiffs have not sustained their claim of fraud against the defendant children.\u201d With the defendant children out of the case at this point, the trial proceeded to a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">After the jury returned their answers to the special questions, finding that Telemachus had acted wrongfully with respect to his duties to Evanthea and the plaintiff children, and had defrauded Evanthea, in connection with the 1977 sales of DSM stock, the defendant children moved, under Mass. R. Civ. R 54 (b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974), for the entry of a separate and final judgment, based on the prior grant of the directed verdict in their favor. The plaintiffs opposed the motion, and the parties filed legal memoranda in support of their respective positions. The judge entered a written memorandum of decision which (a) denied the defendant children\u2019s motion for the entry of separate and final judgment; (b) vacated the directed verdict in their favor; and (c) concluded, as a matter of law, that the defendant children were not bona fide purchasers of the 400 shares of DSM stock they had acquired. The judge then imposed a constructive trust on the stock for the benefit of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In reaching her determinations, the judge noted that her directed verdict order had been predicated on the lack of evidence in the plaintiffs\u2019 case that the defendant children had participated in Telemachus\u2019s fraud or could otherwise be held liable for his wrongdoing. The judge observed, however, that the plaintiffs\u2019 fourth amended complaint had also asserted that the defendant children were not bona fide purchasers of the 400 shares of DSM stock and had sought the imposition of a constructive trust on the stock. The judge perceived that her order allowing the directed verdict had not properly dealt with the plaintiffs\u2019 constructive trust claim. The judge then proceeded to look at that claim anew in light of the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the defendant children were not bona fide purchasers. Based on the jury\u2019s answer to one special question (question 6 [h]), in which the jury concluded that Evanthea did not \u201cknow\u201d of the 1977 transfers of DSM stock until 1987, the judge concluded that the 1977 transaction which shifted 400 shares of DSM stock to the defendant children was not \u201cvoluntary\u201d on Evanthea\u2019s part. From this conclusion, the judge went on to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>reason that an involuntary sale prevented the defendant children from claiming bona fide purchaser status as a matter of law. Further, the judge decided that Telemachus had been the defendant children\u2019s virtual representative at the trial, and, because he \u201crepresented\u201d them, they were bound on issue preclusion principles from relitigating any contention that they may have been bona fide purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The defendant children argue that the judge erred in concluding that they could not be bona fide purchasers. They maintain that they had that status as a matter of law. If we reject this argument (which we shall), they assert that the issue of their status as bona fide purchasers should have been determined at further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">(a) The judge had general authority to reconsider her order granting the defendant children a directed verdict. See <em>Linkage Corp. </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston Univ., </em>425 Mass. 1, 14, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1015 (1997). She correctly reopened the plaintiffs\u2019 constructive trust claim because, in the maelstrom of litigation, the question whether a constructive trust should be imposed on the 400 shares of DSM stock, determined by the jury to have been wrongfully transferred, apparently had been overlooked. The question stood in a peculiar posture because, after the grant of the- directed verdict, neither the plaintiffs or the defendant children had offered any evidence on the defendant children\u2019s possible status as bona fide purchasers, which was a matter directly relevant to whether a constructive trust should be imposed on the defendant children.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">We agree with the judge that, based on the significant wrongdoing committed by Telemachus (as found by the jury), the 400 shares of DSM stock could be made subject to a constructive trust. See <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Guggenheim, </em>417 Mass. 615, 618 (1994); <em>Massachusetts Wholesalers of Malt Beverages, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>409 Mass. 336, 342 (1991). This remedy could be imposed on the defendant children unless they established that they were bona fide purchasers. See <em>Demoulas I, supra </em>at 546. We disagree with the judge that the record establishes, as a matter of law, that the defendant children were not bona fide purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The bona fide purchaser question, pertaining to the DSM stock, is appropriately decided under the principles set forth in art. 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code (Code) governing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>investment securities.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A \u201cbona fide purchaser\u201d is defined therein as \u201ca purchaser for value in good faith and without notice of any adverse claim.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 8-302 (1). A \u201cpurchase\u201d is \u201cany . . . voluntary transaction creating an interest in property,\u201d including (among other transactions), a sale or issue. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-201 (32). The judge determined that the jury\u2019s answer to special question 6 (h) (that Evanthea did not \u201cknow\u201d of the stock transfer until 1987) conclusively established that Evanthea\u2019s role in the transfer was involuntary, as a matter of law. Therefore, she concluded, the transfer was not a \u201cpurchase,\u201d the defendant children were not \u201cpurchasers,\u201d and thus they could not be \u201cbona fide purchasers.\u201d This determination was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">First, special question 6 (h) was posed to the jury for their determination of the approximate date when Evanthea \u201cknew\u201d of the unlawful stock transfer for the purpose of deciding whether the applicable statute of limitations barred her claim. The jury\u2019s response simply informed the judge that Evanthea did not have a sufficient awareness of the implications of the transaction, or a perception that she had been wronged, until 1987, and it was at that time that the statute of limitations began to run. One cannot reasonably infer from the jury\u2019s response to question 6 (h), in the context of the evidence that led to that answer, that the purchase by the defendant children was the result of an involuntary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Second, and more fundamentally, the transfer by Evanthea was \u201cvoluntary\u201d in the sense of that term as used in the Code. Evanthea, as coexecutor, voluntarily signed the documents that transferred the stock, but she did so trusting Telemachus, who was subsequently found to have defrauded her (as well as having violated his fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries of the estate and having committed securities fraud) with respect to- the transaction. A transfer that is fraudulently induced (even if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>fraud is such as to impose criminal liability on the person making the misrepresentations) is considered a \u201cpurchase\u201d under the Code, and meets the threshold requirement of being \u201cvoluntary.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Further, it would be anomalous to interpret art. 8 to mean that bona fide purchaser status was unavailable as a matter of law when a transfer was effectuated by fraud induced by a coexecutor (and that therefore it was not \u201cvoluntary\u201d and could not be a \u201cpurchase\u201d), when bona fide purchaser status is available when a transfer is made in circumstances that might be larcenous. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 8-302; <em>Krick </em>v. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>8 Ill. App. 3d 663 (1972) (bona fide purchaser defense available to bank which purchased stolen bonds).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Because the judge\u2019s underlying determination \u2014 that the transfer of the DSM stock by Evanthea was involuntary \u2014 cannot be supported, there is no need to decide the correctness of her application of the concept of virtual representation and of issue preclusion principles to bind the defendant children to Telemachus\u2019s wrongdoing. The inquiry then turns to the status of the defendant children as bona fide purchasers \u2014 namely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>whether they are \u201cpurchaser[s] for value in good faith and without notice of any adverse claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">(b) We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the defendant children lack bona fide purchaser status as a matter of law. The plaintiffs argue that the record shows indisputably that the defendant children had constructive notice of Telemachus\u2019s fraud and violations of fiduciary duty, and thus cannot be bona fide purchasers.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">A party claiming bona fide purchaser status bears the burden of persuasion on the issue. See <em>Demoulas </em>/, <em>supra </em>at 548. In doing so, the party must convince the finder of fact that he or she undertook the transaction in good faith without notice of adverse claims. The term \u201c[gjood faith\u201d means \u201chonesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned.\u201d See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-201 (19). A party must show that he or she had a subjective honest belief in the legitimacy of the transaction. See <em>Demoulas I, supra </em>at 547, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">\u201cA person has \u2018notice\u2019 of a fact when <em>(a) </em>he has actual knowledge of it; or <em>(b) </em>he has received a notice or notification of it, or (c) from all the facts and circumstances known to him at the time in question he has reason to know that it exists. A person \u2018knows\u2019 or has \u2018knowledge\u2019 of a fact when he has actual knowledge of it. \u2018Discover\u2019 or \u2018learn\u2019 or a word or phrase of similar import refers to knowledge rather than to reason to know.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-201 (25). In some instances, notice is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>measured by an objective standard, as a matter of law, because if a person has actual notice of some facts or circumstances, a court may find an objective reason to know another fact. When examining transfers of stock, mere notice that one is dealing with a fiduciary does not create a duty of inquiry. However, knowledge that the transaction is for the individual benefit of the fiduciary, or is in violation of fiduciary duty, will charge the purchaser with notice of adverse claims. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 8-304 (3). See <em>Michelin Tires (Can.) Ltd. </em>v. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>666 F.2d 673, 682 (1st Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">\u201cAdverse claim\u201d is defined as \u201ca claim that a transfer was or would be unauthorized or wrongful or that a particular adverse person is the owner of or has an interest in the security.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 8-302 (2). The definition applies to a claim by a beneficial owner that a security has been, or is proposed to be transferred in breach of trust. 2C U.L.A. \u00a7 8-302 (2) official comment no. 4 at 357 (Master ed. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">It is obvious from these principles that a claim of bona fide purchaser status can be negated if the purchaser has an awareness, short of actual knowledge, of an adverse claim. The plaintiffs point to excerpts of deposition testimony that were not in evidence at the trial to support their assertions that the defendant children knew that their stock acquisitions would shift the majority ownership in DSM to their family, benefiting Telemachus and their side of the family, and thereby putting them on notice of an adverse claim. These assertions have not been fully established. An application of the principles stated above requires a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">(c) We similarly reject the defendant children\u2019s argument that the record establishes that they have bona fide purchaser status as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 failure of proof in their case-in-chief against the defendant children established only that the latter did not directly know of, or participate in, Telemachus\u2019s fraud, were not bound to his fraud on agency principles, and that they owed no fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs arising out of the administration of George\u2019s estate. There was some evidence at the trial that the defendant children had paid money for the stock. These determinations alone, however, do not make the defendant children bona fide purchasers. Having previously decided that the record also does not resolve the issues in favor of the plaintiffs, it follows that there must be further inquiry on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>whether the defendant children were bona fide purchasers of the DSM stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">In applying the standards set forth above, certain factors may be considered in determining whether the defendant children have established that they were bona fide purchasers.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> First, it is to be kept uppermost in mind that the jury have found Telemachus liable for massive wrongdoing and that the defendant children have been, and are, closely connected to him. The defendant children had reason to know of his role in DSM, the manner in which he conducted the company, and his role as co-executor and cotrustee in administering George\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> They cannot establish themselves as bona fide purchasers simply by claiming that they were \u201cblissfully unaware\u201d of what their father might have been doing. \u201cIf a person confronted with a state of facts closes his eyes in order that he may not see that which would be visible and therefore known to him if he looked, he is chargeable with \u2018knowledge\u2019 of what he would have seen had he looked.\u201d <em>West\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 146, 151 (1943), quoting <em>Zdunek </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>215 Mass. 11, 15 (1934). See <em>Nycal Corp. </em>v. <em>KPMG Peat Marwick LLP., </em>426 Mass. 491, 498-499 (1998); <em>Van Christo Advertising, Inc. </em>v. <em>M/A-COM/LCS, </em>426 Mass. 410, 417 (1998) (claim of wilful ignorance of information will not be excused if information could have been known had the person simply not consciously disregarded it).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Second, it is pertinent to consider what has been found, and affirmed, in <em>Demoulas I, </em>as to similar bona fide purchaser claims made by the defendant children in connection with numerous wrongful transactions involving DSM and several other entities from which they benefited. In <em>Demoulas I, </em>it was decided that the defendant children had not acted in good faith in acquiring the disputed interests; that they should have been aware of adverse claims that affected those interests; that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>knowledgeable about the fiduciary duties owed by corporate officers and directors when they made their acquisitions; and that, even if some of them may have paid value to purchase their interests, that fact alone would not shield them from the imposition of a constructive trust to prevent unjust enrichment. See <em>Demoulas I, supra </em>at 549-555. The defendant children\u2019s acquisition of their DSM stock was, of course, a transaction that was separate from those analyzed in <em>Demoulas I. </em>Nonetheless, all the latter transactions share with the transfer of the 400 shares of DSM stock the common connection of advancing the interests of Telemachus and his family, to the detriment of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Thirdly, the transfer of the DSM stock to the defendant children has been found to be in furtherance of Telemachus\u2019s plan to create a \u201ccontrol group\u201d to operate DSM which consisted principally of himself and his family. We think the well-established standards that govern the relationship between shareholders in a close corporation should be applied, at least by analogy, in evaluating the persuasiveness of the defendant children\u2019s claim that they were bona fide purchasers. See <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, </em>367 Mass. 578, 592-593 &amp; n.18 (1975). These standards were stated in the following terms in <em>Blank </em>v. <em>Chelmsford Ob/Gyn, P.C., </em>420 Mass. 404, 408 (1995), citing <em>id. </em>at 593: \u201cBecause of the relationship [of trust, confidence, and absolute loyalty], stockholders in a close corporation owe one another the same fiduciary duty in the operation of the corporation that partners owe to one another. This fiduciary duty is one of the utmost good faith and loyalty .... Stockholders in close corporations must discharge their management and stockholder responsibilities in conformity with this strict good faith standard. They may not act out of avarice, expediency, or self-interest in derogation of their duty of loyalty to the other stockholders and to the corporation.\u201d Whether the defendant children acted in strict conformity with these duties is therefore a pertinent consideration because some of them have stated that they knew their acquisition of DSM stock would alter the preexisting equal relationship between the families in the control of DSM\u2019s operations.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">It appears that the defendant children could have a difficult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>task in proving their claim. The judge has discretion to determine the scope and duration of any evidentiary hearing. If the shares in question are made subject to a constructive trust, that remedy should not require repayment of more than actual net gains attributable to the stock wrongly acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">5. As part of the remedy ordered for the plaintiffs as a result of Telemachus\u2019s wrongdoing, the judge reformed Delta &amp; Delta, a family entity, by transferring interests in the entity from the defendant children to Evanthea and the defendant children\u2019s mother, Irene. The defendant children argue that the relief ordered by the judge should be set aside because (a) they did not purchase these interests from the plaintiffs or from George\u2019s estate; (b) they were not implicated in any transaction relating to Delta &amp; Delta; and (c) they were denied due process because they never knew these interests were in issue at the trial, and they were never afforded the opportunity to present a defense before reformation was ordered. We agree that the defendant children should be given the opportunity to prove their status as bona fide purchasers of the Delta &amp; Delta interests. The background necessary to resolution of the issues is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Delta &amp; Delta was formed as a real estate trust on August 18, 1971, shortly after George\u2019s death on June 27 of that year. Telemachus was named as the sole trustee, and was authorized, among other powers, to purchase, develop and lease real estate. The initial beneficiaries of the trust were Telemachus; his wife, Irene; the defendant children; Evanthea; the plaintiff children; and Telemachus\u2019s brother-in-law, Costas Psoinos. Telemachus and his family owned a 50% interest, George\u2019s family owned a 40% interest, and Psoinos owned a 10% interest. Telemachus, beginning in 1976, transferred into Delta &amp; Delta real estate that had formerly been owned equally by the two families.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In 1973, Evanthea sold Telemachus a 5% share in her interest in Delta &amp; Delta for $48. The jury found the actual value of the interest to be $51,000. In 1976, she sold a 3% interest to Psoi-nos for $30,000 (the jury found the actual value of this interest to be $104,565), and she sold her remaining 2% interest in the trust to her daughters for $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">In 1984, Telemachus caused the beneficiaries of the trust to memorialize the fact that the trust had been operating as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>partnership, and to execute a document known as the Delta &amp; Delta Realty Confirmatory Partnership Agreement. This action appears to have organized the trust in a way that allowed the beneficiaries to claim the tax benefits of a partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The jury found that Telemachus had violated his fiduciary duty to Evanthea when he formed Delta &amp; Delta, which altered the long-standing arrangement of each side of the family owning an equal interest in real estate. Further, they found that he had violated his fiduciary duty to, and had defrauded, Evanthea in transferring her 5% interest in Delta &amp; Delta to himself and her 3% interest to Psoinos. The jury\u2019s findings express their conclusion that Telemachus engaged in a calculated scheme by forming Delta &amp; Delta and by arranging the transfer of interests to benefit his family and, that, in so doing, he had divested the plaintiffs of interests which would have kept the ownership of real estate at parity, as it had been before George died. Telemachus thus engaged in wrongful self-dealing, violating both the trust he owed as a cofiduciary in George\u2019s estate and as the sole trustee of Delta &amp; Delta.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Based on these findings, the judge rescinded these transfers and ordered the reformation of the interests in Delta &amp; Delta to reflect the approximate coequal position George\u2019s family had in the family entities at the time of George\u2019s death. To accomplish this, the judge ordered the divestment of Telemachus\u2019s 10% interest and the transfer of that interest to Evanthea. She additionally ordered the divestment of a 1% interest from each of the defendant children, and the transfer of 3% of those divested interests to Evanthea, and the transfer of the remaining 1% interest to Irene, the defendant children\u2019s mother.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Equitable remedies are flexible tools to be applied with the focus on fairness and justice. 1 D. Dobbs, Remedies \u00a7 2.1(3), at 63 (2d ed. 1993). A court has the power to grant equitable relief when there has been a violation of fiduciary duty and fraud, and rescission may be ordered to avoid unjust enrichment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>of the fiduciary at the expense of a beneficiary. See <em>Broomfield </em>v. <em>Kosow, </em>349 Mass. 749, 758 (1965); <em>Jose </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>316 Mass. 271, 278 (1944). A court may also reform an agreement to correct wrongdoing. See <em>Elias Bros. Restaurants </em>v. <em>Acorn Enters., Inc., </em>831 F. Supp. 920, 927 (D. Mass. 1993). See also <em>Beaton </em>v. <em>Land Court, </em>367 Mass. 385, 392, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 806 (1975); <em>Century Plastic Corp. </em>v. <em>Tapper Corp., </em>333 Mass. 531, 533 (1956); <em>Brodie </em>v. <em>Evirs, </em>313 Mass. 741, 744, (1943); <em>Barrell </em>v. <em>Britton, </em>252 Mass. 504, 508 (1925); <em>Torrao </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 247 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Rescission is appropriate where property has not been sold to a bona fide purchaser, and the wrongdoer still holds the property at the time of trial. See <em>Barshak </em>v. <em>Buccheri, </em>406 Mass. 187, 192-193 (1989). Where a fiduciary, in violation of his duty to the beneficiary, causes property to be transferred to a third person, the third person, if he had notice of the violation of duty, holds the property upon a constructive trust for the beneficiary. Restatement of Restitution \u00a7 201 (1937). If the third person, in acquiring the property, gave value, and was without notice of the violation of fiduciary duty, he may be entitled to the status of bona fide purchaser and thus take the property free of the claims of the beneficiary. Restatement of Restitution, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 172. These principles apply as well where the equitable remedy of reformation is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The interests in Delta &amp; Delta are not considered under art. 8, because they are not \u201csecurities\u201d as defined by the Code.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, as noted above, at common law, a bona fide purchaser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>defense is also available to transferees of property outside art. 8.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">A similar problem exists with regard to the passing of the Delta &amp; Delta interests to the children in 1971, when the realty trust was formed, as pertained to the transfer of the DSM stock to the children in 1977. The jury found considerable wrongdoing on the part of Telemachus with respect to Delta &amp; Delta, but did not address the issue whether the defendant children were aware of Telemachus\u2019s wrongdoing. As has been mentioned, the only facts flowing from the directed verdict are that the defendant children had no actual knowledge of, and did not directly participate in, Telemachus\u2019s violation of fiduciary duty and fraud on Evanthea in connection with the administration of George\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">There is no merit to the defendant children\u2019s argument that, because they did not purchase their beneficial or partnership interests from George\u2019s estate or from the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs are not entitled to receive these assets. Telemachus\u2019s wrongdoing dates from 1971, when Delta &amp; Delta was created just after George\u2019s death. The remedy ordered by the judge was meant to rectify the improper formation of Delta &amp; Delta with disproportionate interests between George\u2019s and Telemachus\u2019s families, into which Telemachus subsequently, and wrongfully, placed assets in which the families formerly had equal interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">However, because no evidence was presented implicating the defendant children in any wrongdoing involving Delta &amp; Delta, the judge should not have imposed a remedy reaching their assets without an inquiry on whether they were bona fide purchasers. The defendant children did not purchase the assets from the estate or from the plaintiffs, but the manner in which they obtained the assets is relevant. According to Telemachus, when he formed Delta &amp; Delta in 1971, he alone put money into the trust. If the defendant children received the disproportionate as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>sets by gift, the bona fide purchaser status is not available to them. See <em>Demoulas 1, supra </em>at 547; Restatement of Restitution, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 173 comment b, at 697. If they purchased the assets, they should have the opportunity to establish their status as bona fide purchasers. As is the case with the defendant children\u2019s DSM stock and subject to the factors already discussed (as may be applicable), a hearing is necessary as to their potential status as bona fide purchasers for value of the Delta &amp; Delta interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">If it is determined that the defendant children were not bona fide purchasers of the Delta &amp; Delta interests received in 1971, then correction of the agreement to reflect the original equal ownership between the families is appropriate, not taking into consideration the defendant children\u2019s purchase of Psoinos\u2019s interest. In this regard, having already divested Telemachus of his 10% interest and having reallocated that interest to Evanthea, George\u2019s side of the family will need only 3% more to reach the goal of 45% ownership. The judge must determine how the divestment and allocation of the defendant children\u2019s interests should be made, giving consideration, if appropriate, to the divestment or allocation of less than a 1% interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Appeal of DSM.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">6. The January 20, 1977, transfer of 920 shares of DSM stock from George\u2019s estate included, in addition to the 400 shares transferred to the defendant children which was the subject of their appeal, 200 shares that were transferred to two employees of DSM, James Miamis and Julian Lacourse (one hundred shares each, see note 13, <em>supra). </em>The jury found with respect to this transfer that Telemachus (a) had violated his fiduciary duty to Evanthea and defrauded her when he made the transfer; and (b) had, at the same time, and in the same respect, violated his fiduciary duty to the plaintiff children. DSM subsequently redeemed 150 of the 200 shares from Miamis and Lacourse.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The judge denied DSM\u2019s motion under Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b) for the entry of separate and final judgment as to the transfer of these 150 shares (and other DSM shares as well), and ordered the transfer rescinded and the shares returned to the plaintiffs. DSM argues that it is a bona fide purchaser of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>150 shares redeemed from Miamis and Lacourse because the two employees were bona fide purchasers from George\u2019s estate. As a consequence, DSM reasons, under the so-called \u201cshelter\u201d provision of the Code, G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 8-301 (l),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> DSM is entitled to the bona fide purchaser status enjoyed by Miamis and Lacourse. We reject the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The judge stated several reasons for concluding that DSM could not prevail as a bona fide purchaser as to these 150 shares. Among those reasons was her conclusion that DSM was on notice of an adverse claim because the wrongdoing of Telemachus was imputed to, and binding on, it. In this respect, the judge determined, based on the jury\u2019s answers to special questions, that \u201cTelemachus alone controlled and directed the De-moulas family empire. Telemachus alone made all of the decisions involving the financial interests of the [pjlaintiffs and his family, and ... he alone arranged for all of the transactions involved in this case.\u201d We agree with the conclusions and reasoning of the judge, and, as a result, we need not consider the other grounds on which she relied to rescind the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">DSM does not dispute that Telemachus was acting on its behalf when the stock was redeemed by him for DSM\u2019s benefit. The jury\u2019s answers establish conclusively that Telemachus, because of his wrongdoing, had notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 adverse claim. DSM argues that Telemachus\u2019 knowledge cannot be imputed to it because he was not acting on DSM\u2019s behalf when he wrongfully transferred the 150 shares out of George\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">\u201cThe general rule ... is that the knowledge of an officer of the corporation obtained while acting outside the scope of his official duties, in relation to a matter in which he acted for himself and not for the corporation, is not, merely because of his office, to be imputed to the corporation.\u201d <em>Phoenix Sav. &amp; Loan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>427 F.2d 862 (4th Cir. 1970), quoting <em>William Danzer &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Western Md. Ry., </em>164 Md. 448, 457 (1933). However, \u201cknowledge of officers and directors having substantial control of all activities of a corporation is imputed to the corporation.\u201d <em>Phoenix Sav. &amp; Loan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>381 F.2d 245, 250 (4th Cir. 1967), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>remanded, 302 F. Supp. 832 (D. Md. 1969), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 427 F.2d 862 (4th Cir. 1970). See Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Corporations \u00a7 826 (rev. ed. 1994) (general rule of not imputing knowledge to corporation not applicable where \u201cboard of directors has . . . complete control and direction of all of the business and affairs of the institution, and the president has habitually exercised the same\u201d). When \u201c \u2018all corporate power is exercised by a few who perform misdeeds, knowledge of those misdeeds must be imputed to the corporation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Phoenix Sav. &amp; Loan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>302 F. Supp. 832, 840 (D. Md. 1969). See <em>Jefferson Park Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Ridgely, 99 </em>Ind. App. 146, 164 (1934), quoting Thompson, Corporations \u00a7 1777 (3d ed. 1927) (\u201cif [an agent] is the sole representative in the transaction, and is in effect the alter ego, notice to him is imputable to the [corporation]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Early during the trial, the plaintiffs sought to introduce evidence to show that Telemachus was able to commit his wrongful acts based on his \u201cextraordinary control over [DSM].\u201d Counsel for the defendants (including DSM) objected to the evidence and responded, \u201c[W]e have conceded control. I said at the beginning, [Telemachus] is the sole voting trustee of 100 percent of the stock. We have never denied control.\u201d Counsel for the defendants later reiterated this position, when he objected to the plaintiffs\u2019 introduction of expert testimony showing that Telemachus\u2019s exercise of control over DSM did not comport with good \u201ccorporate governance.\u201d Counsel for the defendants stated, \u201ccontrol is not an issue in this case. I mean, Telemachus Demoulas certainly had control of all these corporations [DSM among them], he was the sole voting trustee, he was the sole voting trustee both before and after he acquired any of the shares.\u201d The exchange noted in the margin<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> concerned the defendants\u2019 objections to similar testimony, and the exchange further supports the conclusion that Telemachus exercised dominance over DSM.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>In view of this conclusion, DSM cannot improve its position by arguing that it purchased the stock from bona fide purchasers. Even if we were to assume Miarais and Lacourse were bona fide purchasers (an assumption which may be dubious), DSM could not obtain status as a bona fide purchaser based on the shelter rule. Although the shelter rule, stated in \u00a7 8-301 (1), permits a party to acquire the rights held by his transferor, G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 8-302 (4), limits the rights that can be acquired when it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">\u201cNotwithstanding subsection (1) of section 8-301, the transferee of a particular certified security who has been a party to any fraud or illegality affecting the security, or who as a prior holder of that certified security had notice of an adverse claim, cannot improve his position by taking from a bona fide purchaser.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">As we have previously decided, Telemachus\u2019s knowledge of the plaintiffs\u2019 adverse claims is imputed to DSM. While Telemachus was not strictly acting on behalf of DSM when he wrongfully transferred the DSM stock from George\u2019s estate, he was in control of DSM at the time, and he caused DSM to waive restrictions on transfer so that the shares could be sold. Telemachus also acted in his capacity as a DSM director when he allowed the restrictions on transfer of DSM stock to be waived so that he could accomplish the wrongful transfers from George\u2019s estate. DSM cannot take refuge from the fact that, while Telemachus was in the process of defrauding Evanthea, he was wearing his executor \u201chat,\u201d rather than his DSM \u201chat.\u201d Telemachus, acting in a way that bound DSM, committed wrongdoing in connection with the transfers of DSM stock when he allowed DSM to waive restrictions on transfer of the stock with full knowledge that the sole reason for the waiver was to facilitate an independent fraud. His self-dealing proceeded in an orderly, planned progression, to defraud George\u2019s estate and to benefit DSM in a way which wrongfully enriched his family and his interests. The shelter rule is not available to DSM.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">7. We next address DSM\u2019s arguments relating to the relief ordered by the judge.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 fourth amended complaint sought both legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>and equitable relief. Before the commencement of the trial, the judge, pursuant to a proposal submitted by the plaintiffs, separated the issues of liability and damages, thus bifurcating the trial. After the trial of the liability issues, the jury\u2019s answers to special questions determined extensive wrongdoing on the part of Telemachus, but found no liability on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims which were the basis of their request for purely legal relief. In view of the jury\u2019s responses, the plaintiffs filed a motion requesting only equitable relief and the entry of a separate and final judgment, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 54 (b). The defendants opposed this motion with memoranda of law arguing against the equitable remedies sought by the plaintiffs. In addition, the defendants moved for an evidentiary hearing on issues relevant to equitable relief, maintaining that such a hearing was necessary in order to establish facts that would help fashion the relief.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The judge heard arguments on the motions, and subsequently requested that the parties submit memoranda discussing remedies and offering arguments about the appropriateness of rescission, rescissory damages, and the reconfiguration of various family entities. The plaintiffs complied with this request; the defendants\u2019 memoranda (by this point DSM, Telemachus, and the defendant children were separately represented) repeated their arguments that an evidentiary hearing was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">After consideration of the record created by the parties on the issue of relief, the judge imposed a constructive trust on DSM and ordered that 1150 shares of its treasury stock be transferred to the plaintiff children and to the George A. Demoulas Trust (created by George\u2019s estate).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Additionally, the judge ordered relief in the form of rescission, requiring Telemachus and the defendant children to transfer DSM stock to the plaintiffs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>varying amounts. The result of these transfers caused the plaintiffs\u2019 family to hold a majority of stock in DSM and rendered Telemachus\u2019s family the minority interest.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The judge also ordered and prescribed (among other relief), the restructuring of DSM\u2019s board of directors, amendments to its articles of incorporation and by-laws, a method for electing new officers, an independent audit, and outside monitoring of the company\u2019s daily operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">DSM argues that the judge\u2019s award of equitable relief without an evidentiary hearing violated its due process rights. Specifically, DSM maintains that (a) the judge misinterpreted the jury\u2019s findings and violated the pretrial agreement that all factual issues would be determined by a jury; and (b) an evidentiary hearing was required on all issues pertaining to relief. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">(a) DSM contends first that the jury\u2019s findings do not support the conclusion reached by the judge that the sales by the plaintiffs were not voluntary, and that if, in fact, the sales were voluntary, the remedy of rescission is unavailable in the circumstances. The contention is unpersuasive. First, as we have previously discussed, even if the judge erroneously determined that the sales were \u201cinvoluntary\u201d under the Code, this determination does not negate the jury\u2019s specific finding that the sales were made in breach of Telemachus\u2019s fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Second, rescission is clearly an appropriate remedy when assets are wrongfully appropriated by a fiduciary. See <em>Coggins </em>v. <em>New England Patriots Football Club, Inc., </em>397 Mass. 525, 530, 535-536 (1986). DSM argues that the <em>Coggins </em>case stands for the proposition that, if the plaintiffs sold their shares voluntarily, money damages would be the only remedy available. This is incorrect. In the <em>Coggins </em>case, the plaintiffs were harmed by an illegal freeze-out, and the transfer of shares was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>involuntary. <em>Id. </em>at 530.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The <em>Coggins </em>case does not limit rescission solely to involuntary transactions. Thus, there is no link between the judge\u2019s application of the jury\u2019s findings to conclude that the transfers were involuntary, and the appropriateness of the remedy the judge imposed. There is also no \u201cfactual gap\u201d that was improperly filled by the judge, and no unfair or erroneous application by her of the jury\u2019s findings which spelled out a substantial case of wrongdoing which was more than appropriate for redress by equitable remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">(b) We discern no error in the judge\u2019s decision to grant the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for entry of separate and final judgment. We examine the judge\u2019s imposition of equitable remedies under an abuse of discretion standard. See <em>Bodio </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>401 Mass. 1, 10 (1987); <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Steamship Clerks Union, Local 1066, </em>48 F.3d 594, 608 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 814 (1995). Notwithstanding the pretrial order bifurcating the issues of liability and damages, the judge acted within her discretion in concluding that the interests of justice would best be served by granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion rather than by holding another lengthy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We reject DSM\u2019s further argument that the lack of an eviden-tiary hearing on relief violated fundamental notions of fairness. Before granting equitable relief, due process requires actual notice to all the parties that the judge is contemplating remedial action and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. See <em>Steamship Clerks Union, Local 1066, supra </em>at 608-609. See also <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>418 Mass. 380, 383 (1994). Due process does not require any particular type of hearing, and \u201cmany matters can lawfully \u2014 and satisfactorily \u2014 be heard on the papers.\u201d <em>Steamship Clerks Union Local 1066, supra </em>at 608, citing <em>Aoude </em>v. <em>Mobil Oil Corp., </em>862 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir. 1988); <em>Cia. Petrolera Caribe, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arco Caribbean, Inc., </em>754 F2d 404, 411 (1st Cir. 1985). The judge informed the parties of the need for detailed proposals to assist her in determining the most efficacious form of remedy. The defendants answered with repeated requests for evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>hearings, and furnished the judge with neither arguments in favor of their preferred remedies nor counterarguments to the remedies proposed by the plaintiffs. We would be hard pressed to detect any unfairness in the manner in which the issue of relief was handled in view of the defendants\u2019 failure to provide requested information or to assist the judge in any meaningful way.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">We further conclude that DSM has failed to demonstrate that the judge\u2019s relief violates governing principles. We recognize, as does DSM, that equitable principles are applied to return an aggrieved party to the status quo. DSM concedes that equal ownership between the two families preserves the status quo. Nonetheless, DSM argues that the judge\u2019s order creates a windfall to the plaintiffs because after rescission and transfer, the plaintiffs will obtain majority control of the corporation in violation of the preexisting state of parity.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The \u201cwindfall\u201d DSM complains of is grounded on the fact that Telemachus\u2019s family obtained control of DSM as a direct result of Telemachus\u2019s fraud and wrongdoing. It is more than appropriate to require Telemachus to disgorge benefits wrongfully obtained, as well as to return the plaintiffs to status quo. See <em>Coggins </em>v. <em>New England Patriots Football Club, Inc., supra </em>at 536; <em>Sher </em>v. <em>Sandler, </em>325 Mass. 348, 355-356 (1950). The fact that Telemachus, in a separate and unrelated transaction, gave some of his shares to the Demoulas Foundation, which will now leave his family with a minority interest, is irrelevant to the grant of proper relief. DSM decries the perceived inequity of the result by focusing on the fact that Telemachus has not been returned to status quo by the judge\u2019s action, pointing to cases where remedies include a return to defendants of plaintiffs\u2019 excess benefits by way of an accounting. See <em>Demou-las I, supra </em>at 557; <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Giraudo, </em>311 Mass. 132, 139 (1942). Here, the plaintiffs will not \u201cbenefit\u201d by any actions undertaken by them, but purely by actions taken independently and voluntarily by Telemachus.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">DSM also argues that the judge abused her discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>awarding equitable relief that essentially restructured DSM\u2019s corporate makeup. The judge had broad powers to determine the appropriate relief \u201cto remedy the wrong complained of and to make the [judgment] effective.\u201d <em>Bodio </em>v. <em>Ellis, supra. </em>It is true that courts ordinarily will not get involved in matters of corporate governance. This general principle, however, does not undermine a court\u2019s ability to fashion a remedy for closely-held corporations. See <em>id., </em>quoting <em>Hallahan </em>v. <em>Haltom Corp., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 68, 71 (1979) (concluding judge\u2019s order properly \u201crestored the balance of control among the [plaintiffs] and the [defendants] which ... the parties had envisioned and which they had a fiduciary duty to each other to maintain\u201d). The judge had discretion (and a basis in the record) to impose a remedy that balanced DSM\u2019s governance structure in a way to prevent the future occurrence of the type of wrongdoing found by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Finally, we need not consider DSM\u2019s arguments that non-party DSM shareholders, Irene Demoulas, and the Telemachus A. Demoulas Family Trust, should be given a credit for taxes paid on DSM\u2019s accumulated earnings that are in excess of the percentage ownership now attributable to their shares. The judge did not have jurisdiction over nonparties, and we cannot make awards in favor of nonparties. See <em>D\u2019Errico </em>v. <em>Assessors of Woburn, </em>384 Mass. 301, 305 (1981). Irene and the Telemachus A. Demoulas Family Trust may or may not have a cause of action against DSM or Telemachus as a result of overpayment of taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">8. The portions of the second amended judgment imposing a constructive trust on the 400 shares of DSM stock held by the defendant children and reforming Delta &amp; Delta to reallocate the 4% interest held by the defendant children therein, and granting any other relief pertaining to these transactions, are vacated. There are to be further proceedings, in accordance with this opinion on the question whether the children are bona fide purchasers of the stock and their respective interests in Delta &amp; Delta, after which an appropriate supplemental judgment is to be entered. In connection with the supplemental judgment, the judge may also make any other adjustments in the relief otherwise granted in the second amended judgment to reflect other matters which in fairness ought to be addressed or modi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>fled as a result of the evidentiary hearing. The second amended judgment awarding relief against Telemachus and DSM is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\"> The defendants also appeal from the judge\u2019s denial of the their motion to recuse her from the case on the ground of bias. This issue has been decided adversely to the defendants in <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., ante </em>543, 546-552 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b583-8\"> The language of G.

A treatise on the rules of civil procedure states that \u201cwhenever each defendant has four peremptory challenges, plaintiff is reciprocally entitled to four peremptory challenges for each defendant. The same principle obtains when an action involves multiple plaintiffs.\u201d J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 47.4, at 167-168 (1977 &amp; Supp. 1998). The treatise cites for this conclusion <em>Hendrickson </em>v. <em>Drewrys Ltd. U.S.A., </em>349 Mass. 679 (1965). While the treatise\u2019s citation predates the change in the statute\u2019s language, its observation of \u201cthe Rules\u2019 deliberate encouragement of free joinder,\u201d and the Legislature\u2019s efforts to make the statute consistent with the rules of civil procedure, persuade us that this principle may be applied in cases, such as the present one, where joinder brings multiple defendants into the case.

Telemachus caused Valley Properties, Inc. (Valley), to be formed in April of 1974. He merged three realty trusts, in which he and George had had equal ownership, into this corporation. Initially, the two families had equal ownership in Valley; by the end of 1977, Telemachus\u2019s family had a controlling interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\"> This does not mean that the jury did, in fact, base their findings on these issues solely on the valuations they found. The plaintiffs presented evidence warranting findings that considerable wrongdoing had taken place, including evidence that, because of the trust they placed in Telemachus and the family lawyers, they were not informed about, and did not understand, the nature of the transactions that took place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\"> He sold one hundred shares each to himself, the defendant children, and employees James Miamis and Julian Lacourse; eighty shares each to plaintiff children Arthur S. and Evan; and thirty shares each to plaintiff children Diana and Fotene. Each purchaser paid the estate $1,150 per share on January 7, 1977. In 1982, Telemachus sold the remaining 300 shares in George\u2019s estate to himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\"> All our references to art. 8 of the Code are to G. L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 8-101 et seq., as appearing in St. 1983, c. 522, \u00a7 5. The defendant children refer to no objection in the record on their behalf that the judge apply the version of the Code in effect at the time some of the causes of action accrued; e.g., the 1977 transfers of the DSM stock. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 8-101 et seq., inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1 (in effect January 20, 1977). It appears that all parties acquiesced to the use of the 1983 version of the Code. In <em>Demoulas </em>/, <em>supra </em>at 546-547, the shareholder derivative and contempt action, the same judge also applied the 1983 version of art. 8, and her use of that version was not challenged on appeal by any of the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b598-6\"> See, e.g., G.

A induces B to sign by fraud, and without authority from B delivers the note to P, who takes it for value, in good faith and without notice.\u201d 2 U.L.A. prior art. 3, \u00a7 3-302 official comment 2, at 487-488 (Master ed. 1991). For an application of this description of a holder in due course, see <em>New Bedford Inst. for Sav. </em>v. <em>Gildroy, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 647, 650-653, 654 (1994) (payee may try to prove it is a holder in due course even though one coowner was induced to sell through fraud).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b599-8\"> The plaintiffs also argue that the children waived the bona fide purchaser argument. We disagree. In their fourth amended complaint, the plaintiffs asserted that none of the defendant children \u201ctook possession or title to the shares transferred out of George\u2019s estate in 1977 as bona fide purchasers for value.\u201d The defendant children filed an answer denying that claim, but did not affirmatively plead that they were bona fide purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Rule 8 (c) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, 365 Mass. 749 (1974), states that parties must plead their affirmative defenses in their answer. The defendant children\u2019s denial is not in strict compliance with that rule. It is true that, generally, a failure to plead an affirmative defense results in a waiver and exclusion of the defense from the case. See <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assoc., </em>411 Mass. 451, 471 (1991). However, the purpose of rule 8 (c) is to provide notice to the plaintiffs of defenses that will be raised. There is no question that the plaintiffs were on notice that a bona fide purchaser defense would be raised, because they asserted that the defendant children lacked that status from the start. In addition, the issue was raised by both parties in briefs and at a hearing in connection with the defendant children\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. See <em>Bendetson </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Revere, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 615, 620 n.9 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\"> The plaintiffs appear to have assumed the burden of proof by asserting that the defendant children were not bona fide purchasers in their fourth amended complaint. As we articulated in <em>Demoulas I, supra </em>at 548, this is not the proper method for asserting this status. Once a defect in a purchase is identified, such as in this case, with Telemachus\u2019s wrongdoing regarding the sale of the 400 shares of DSM stock, the defendant children, to whom the stock was sold, must establish that they are bona fide purchasers in order to protect their purchase.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\"> Arthur T. was a director of Valley Properties, Inc., when the DSM stock was transferred. He became a corporate fiduciary of DSM in 1978. See <em>Demoulas I, supra </em>at 533, 537 n.42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b602-7\"> The parties in their briefs argue only the bona fide purchaser issue in the terms discussed above. Our remand of this issue to the trial court to conduct further proceedings should not be viewed as limiting the plaintiffs from seeking the imposition of a constructive trust on the defendant children\u2019s stock on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>any other equitable ground or grounds that are shown to apply, including any ground that might warrant equitable relief even if the defendant children can establish some standing as bona fide purchasers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b604-8\"> The judge divested and distributed only full percentage interests of Delta &amp; Delta. She distributed a 1% interest to Irene apparently to accomplish the goal of equalizing the two family sides without giving a disproportionate interest to one of the defendant children or giving any interest to Telemachus.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">After the transfers ordered by the judge, the defendant children and Irene have a 55% interest in Delta &amp; Delta, and the plaintiff children and Evanthea have a 45% interest. The inequality is a result of the sales of what was originally Costas Psoinos\u2019s 10% interest to the defendant children. The transactions with Psoinos have not been disputed by the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\"> See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 8-102 (1) (a), as appearing in St. 1963, c. 188, \u00a7 14, which defines a \u201csecurity,\u201d in part, as an instrument issued in bearer or registered form, that is commonly traded at securities exchanges or markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">General partnership interests are not commonly exchanged in the securities markets. Partnership interests are governed by contract rights. \u201cOne of the key differences of th[e] distinction [between securities under art. 8 and partnership interests] concerns transfer of the two kinds of property interest. While the rules for transfer of securities is governed by Article 8, transfer of a . . . partnership interest is often governed, as it is in this case, by the partnership agreement itself. . . . Securities, on the other hand, can usually be transferred by endorsement of the owner or holder, without the consent of the issuer of the security.\u201d <em>Motobecane America, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Patrick Petroleum Co., </em>600 F.
