R. Crim. R 44, 378 Mass. 920 (1979). We transferred the case here on our own motion. The defendant contends that his motion to dismiss the criminal contempt charge should have been allowed because the judge lacked authority to impose pretrial conditions on his release on personal recognizance and because the conditions attached to his release failed to constitute a clear and unequivocal judicial order. In addition to challenging the defendant\u2019s contentions, the Commonwealth argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>the defendant has waived his right to challenge the terms of his release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\"><em>Facts. </em>On May 8, 1996, the defendant was arraigned in the Orange Division of the District Court Department on a complaint charging operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24. On the Commonwealth\u2019s request, the judge ordered the defendant, as a condition of his release, to undergo drug and alcohol screening as determined by probation and to participate in any outpatient counselling as determined by probation, including attending Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous meetings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After repeatedly refusing to undergo urinalysis testing the defendant moved to vacate the conditions of his release. The judge denied the motion and informed the defendant that his refusal to comply with the conditions would constitute contempt. Again, the defendant acknowledged that he understood the judge\u2019s order but still refused to comply. Consequently, the judge entered a judgment of contempt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">1. <em>Criminal contempt. </em>The defendant\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that the judge erred in denying his motion to dismiss the criminal contempt charge because the judge had no authority to impose conditions on his release from custody. Alternatively, the defendant maintains that the imposition of conditions on his release was not an order on which a finding of criminal contempt could be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">\u201c[Cjontempt decrees, or those parts of such decrees, which are aimed at vindicating the authority and dignity of the court and punishing the contemnor for an affront to it, that is criminal contempts, will survive the reversal of the [erroneous] decree which was disobeyed.\u201d <em>Stow </em>v. <em>Marinelli, </em>352 Mass. 738, 744 (1967), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>United Mine </em>Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 293-294 (1947), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>In <em>Stow </em>v. <em>Marinelli, supra, </em>the court described the proper way to contest criminal contempt proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-5\">\u201c \u2018The final decree becomes effective as soon as entered. The final decree is vacated . . . and proceedings under it are stayed . . . only upon the conjunction of two things, (a) an appeal therefrom seasonably claimed by one having a right to appeal . . . and (b) the entry of that appeal in this court.\u2019 <em>Lowell Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>315 Mass. 176, 189 [(1943)]. When the acts which gave rise to the contempt petition occurred an appeal had been claimed but it had not been entered in this court. The decree, therefore, was in full force and effect and the conduct of [the contemnor] was a palpable violation of it. If [he] desired to be relieved from the effects of the decree pending the appeal, a remedy was open to [him]. As we pointed out in the <em>Loeb </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at pages 189-190, \u2018As soon as an appeal has been claimed, and before the final decree is vacated by entry of the appeal in this court, a statutory power arises in the court that entered the decree and also in this court, to grant any needed injunction and to make any other proper interlocutory order pending the appeal. G. L. . . . c. 214, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 22.\u2019 Thus, [he] could have applied for a stay pending the appeal. Instead of availing [himself] of this remedy, [he] went ahead and flouted the decree. [He was] rightly adjudicated in contempt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-6\"><em>Stow </em>v. <em>Marinelli, supra </em>at 743-744. In the present case, the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the pretrial conditions was denied after a hearing. The defendant then disregarded the judge\u2019s order rather than complying with it and filing an appeal. He could not attack the propriety of the order in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">We must decide whether the violation of the order of release subject to conditions was a sufficient basis to warrant a judgment of criminal contempt. \u201cIn order to prove a defendant guilty of criminal contempt, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u2018there was a clear, outstanding order of the court, that the defendant knew of that order, and that the defendant clearly and intentionally disobeyed that order in circumstances in which he was able to obey it.! \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>425 Mass. 587, 596 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1058 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brogan, </em>415 Mass. 169, 171 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">We conclude that the order was a proper foundation on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>to base an adjudication of criminal contempt. Any lack of clarity regarding the judge\u2019s order that may have existed at the outset was dispelled during the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate pretrial conditions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Similarly this hearing removed any doubt about the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the order and his intentional violation of it. As a result, we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction of criminal contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Although the defendant did not appeal from the order granting his release from custody on personal recognizance subject to conditions, we nevertheless comment on the propriety of this order to aid trial judges and promote the fair administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">2. <em>Judge\u2019s authority. </em>We consider whether the judge had authority to impose pretrial conditions on the defendant\u2019s release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>on personal recognizance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">(a) <em>Statutory authority. </em>The Legislature has expressly authorized the imposition of pretrial conditions for a defendant\u2019s release on bail or personal recognizance under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 42A, 87, and 58A (\u00a7 42A gives authority to impose conditions in domestic abuse related crimes; \u00a7 87 authority to impose conditions on pretrial release when defendant consents and is placed on probation<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; and \u00a7 58A authority to impose pretrial detention or conditions of release based on the defendant\u2019s dangerousness<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>). However, none of these statutes is applicable to the defendant, and the general bail statute, G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, contains no such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">General Laws c. 276, \u00a7 58, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-7\">\u201cA justice ... in accordance with the applicable provisions of section fifty-seven,[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] shall . . . hold a hearing in which the defendant and his counsel, if any, may participate and inquire into the case and shall admit such person to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>bail on his personal recognizance without surety unless said justice . . . determines, in the exercise of his discretion, that such a release will not reasonably assure the appearance of the person before the court. In his determination under this section as to whether release will reasonably assure the appearance of the person before the court . . . said justice . . . shall, on the basis of any information which he can reasonably obtain, take into account the nature and circumstances of the offense charged, ... his record of convictions, if any, any illegal drug distribution or present drug dependency . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The preferred disposition under the bail statute is release on personal recognizance. <em>Mendonza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>423 Mass. 771, <em>774 </em>(1996). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perito, </em>417 Mass. 674, 678 (1994); <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 490, 495 (1993) (\u201cOur Legislature intended \u00a7 58 to protect the rights of the defendant by establishing a presumption that he or she will be admitted to bail on personal recognizance without surety and by delineating carefully the circumstances under which bail may be denied\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Thus, where the Legislature has provided in three separate statutes the specific circumstances under which bail may be made subject to conditions, we find no implication in the detailed general bail statute that any bail determination not falling within the specific provision of those three statutes can be made subject to conditions. Such a reading of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, would render the other three statutes superfluous. \u201c[Wjhere the Legislature has employed specific language in one [section of an act], but not in another, the language should not be implied where it is not present.\u201d <em>Care &amp; Protection of Rebecca, </em>419 Mass. 67, 76-77 (1994), quoting <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 616 (1982). \u201c[W]e must read the statute in a way to give it a sensible meaning.\u201d <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, supra, </em>citing <em>Lexington </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>378 Mass. 562, 570 (1979). We conclude, therefore, that no explicit statutory authority exists under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, to make a defendant\u2019s pretrial release subject to conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">(b) <em>Inherent authority. </em>It is the Commonwealth\u2019s position that, absent an explicit statutory provision to the contrary, the judge had the inherent authority to set conditions on the defendant\u2019s release.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Inherent powers of the judiciary are \u201cthose \u2018whose exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>is essential to the function of the judicial department, to the maintenance of its authority, or to its capacity to decide cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brach </em>v. <em>Chief Justice of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>386 Mass. 528, 535 (1982), quoting <em>Sheriff of Middlesex County </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>383 Mass. 631, 636 (1981). We have recognized that the courts\u2019 inherent powers need not be expressed by statute, but must involve the internal functioning of the judiciary. <em>Brach </em>v. <em>Chief Justice of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, supra. </em>The power to impose pretrial conditions on release from custody is not essential to the function of the judiciary. Furthermore, that such authority is expressly granted in \u00a7\u00a7 42A, 58A, and 87, cuts against the claim that it is within the inherent power of the court. \u201cThe very conception of inherent power carries with it the implication that its use is for occasions not provided for by established methods. . . . [Only wjhen . . . [established] methods fail, and the court shall determine that by observing them the assistance necessary for the due and effective exercise of its own functions cannot be had, or when an emergency arises which the established methods cannot or do not instantly meet, then and not till then does occasion arise for the exercise of the inherent power.\u201d <em>Brach </em>v. <em>Chief Justice of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 536, quoting <em>O\u2019Coin\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer of the County of Worcester, </em>362 Mass. 507, 516 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Therefore, we reluctantly reach the conclusion that the judge did not have authority in these circumstances to impose pretrial conditions on the defendant\u2019s release under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58. The judge was faced with a difficult situation and understandably was not eager to release unconditionally this defendant whose history of substance abuse created a strong possibility that his behavior, while on bail, would present a danger to himself or to the general public. The solution to the dilemma, however, is in the hands of the Legislature.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The judgment of contempt is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-8\"> Because of the view that we take of this case it is unnecessary to discuss the Commonwealth\u2019s claim of waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b885-9\"> The defendant acknowledged that he understood the conditions of his release. However, he questioned the judge\u2019s reasoning for requiring such conditions. The judge explained to him that his record supported the inference that he was under the influence and that his record illustrated a history of substance abuse offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b885-10\"> Initially a judgment of contempt was entered pursuant to Mass. R Crim. P. 43, 378 Mass. 919 (1979), but that judgment was later vacated and a new one was entered pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 44, 378 Mass. 920 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b887-7\"> The following discussion took place between the defendant and the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-8\">The judge: \u201cI want to be clear about one thing now. You understand that when you were arraigned before the court at that time that I made certain conditions and set certain conditions of your release and they were to comply with any pretrial drug and alcohol counseling including attending AA meetings or any other counseling and take any drug and alcohol screens, is that right?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-9\">The defendant: \u201cI know you did say that, yes, I\u2019m not sure of all the, everything, but I know you did say I was supposed to do that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-10\">The judge: \u201cAnd it\u2019s my understanding and it\u2019s been my understanding since that time that you have refused to comply with those conditions, is that correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-11\">The defendant: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-12\">The judge: \u201cAnd you understand, based on the way in which this matter now gets to the court, that you may be subject to contempt for your refusal to comply?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-13\">The defendant: \u201cI understand that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-14\">The judge: \u201cAnd have you had any, I\u2019m gonna ask you one more time now, before I actually tell you what I\u2019m going to do which is make a determination that you are in contempt but I want to be sure that you understand that your refusal to comply with a court order as I\u2019ve ordered it to you would be a basis for me finding you in contempt and ordering a punishment. Do you understand that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-15\">The defendant: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-16\">it</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-17\">The judge: \u201cAlright, I\u2019m going to make a finding of contempt, order that he be sanctioned and I\u2019m going to issue a written memorandum to that effect. The purpose would be, while perhaps I referred to requiring his compliance with the order of the court, it would not be that, the purpose would be for purposes of punishment. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b888-8\"> The judge stated that there was \u201cinherent common law authority as well as statutory authority\u201d for his order and cited express statutory authority pursuant to G.
