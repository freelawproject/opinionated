Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant argues that his motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>a required finding of not guilty should have been allowed. We reject the argument. The defendant also argues that he was improperly charged as an accessory because a principal felon had been acquitted of the murder before the defendant\u2019s trial; that evidence of prior bad acts prejudiced his defense; and that the lack of a jury instruction on consciousness of guilt evidence may have created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. We reject these arguments as well. There is no basis to grant the defendant relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Angiulo, </em>415 Mass. 502, 507-510 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The defendant, known by the nickname \u201cPolo,\u201d was, in May, 1994, president of the Springfield chapter of an organization known as Los Solidos (described in the testimony as a \u201cgang\u201d). Under the defendant\u2019s leadership, membership in Los Solidos became \u201cstricter.\u201d The defendant\u2019s apparent goal was to keep the stronger members of Los Solidos (and weed out the weaker members), so the organization could survive an ongoing \u201cwar\u201d with two rival organizations, \u201cLa Familia\u201d and the \u201cLatin Kings.\u201d Frankie Velasquez (nickname, \u201cFrank Dog\u201d), who was a founding member of Los Solidos, and a chief enforcer, testified about the defendant as president: \u201cHe\u2019s the man. He\u2019s the one who calls all the shots.\u201d Velasquez also testified that, \u201cno missions or nothing should be done unless we get [the defendant\u2019s] consent.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">On or about May 27, 1994, the defendant met, at the apartment of Jessica Nieves, with members of Los Solidos, including Leyton Burgos (nickname, \u201cShaggy\u201d); an enforcer, Erasmos Santos Vega (nickname, \u201cBootie\u201d), a soldier; and Wilffedo Rosario (nickname, \u201cFroggy\u201d), another soldier. The defendant and the others agreed that a mission should be performed. Burgos \u201cwant[ed] five people hit.\u201d The defendant responded that he \u201cwant[ed] to start on Main Street\u201d in Springfield. That site was rejected, when Vega told the others that Main Street was \u201ctoo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>hot, cops were all over the place.\u201d The defendant, and the other members of Los Solidos, then turned their attention to Locust Street in Springfield as a site for the mission. Vega suggested that this area might also be unsuitable because \u201cthere were too many kids out there.\u201d The defendant rejected Vega\u2019s suggestion, stating, \u201cFuck the kids.\u201d The defendant went on to indicate that Los Solidos had \u201ca break on [the victim],\u201d the \u201cgodmother\u201d of La Familia, and \u201cwe\u2019re going to make an example of her.\u201d The defendant directed the others with the following command: \u201cI don\u2019t care if you get her [the victim] or not. Whoever is there, I better see it on the 11 o\u2019clock news.\u201d Nieves heard the defendant indicate \u201c[t]hat [Los Solidos] had a mission on Locust Street and [the victim] deserved to die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The mission then proceeded on to completion. To use in the killing, Vega stole an automobile (which was disposed of after the murder by being abandoned and burned) from a shopping mall in Holyoke, and a handgun or handguns were obtained. On the night of May 28, 1994, Rosado, joined at this time by another member of Los Solidos, Jose Carrasquillo (nickname, \u201cGaldie\u201d), proceeded in the stolen automobile to Locust Street. As Rosado drove the automobile slowly down Locust Street, Carrasquillo, the front seat passenger, fired five or six shots from a handgun at a group of people (known, or perceived to be, associated with La Familia) who were talking in front of 190 Locust Street. Sylvia Ramirez, one of the assembled group, was hit and killed by a gunshot wound to the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Velasquez heard shortly after the murder that he was wanted for the murder of Sylvia Ramirez. Velasquez met with the defendant and told him that he (Velasquez) was going to turn himself in to the police, and that he needed money to hire a lawyer. The defendant informed Velasquez that he knew Velasquez had not committed the murder because he (the defendant) had directed \u201cF. and G.\u201d to do it. The defendant explained to Velasquez that \u201cF. and G.\u201d were, respectively, \u201cFroggy\u201d and \u201cGaldie.\u201d These nicknames referred to Rosado (identified in the evidence as driving the stolen automobile during the shooting), and Carrasquillo (identified in the evidence as the passenger in the vehicle who fired the shots that killed Sylvia Ramirez).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">1. This summary of the evidence, and other facts the jury were permissibly warranted in finding, demonstrates that, examined under the appropriate standard <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>La-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>timore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 [1979]), the Commonwealth\u2019s proof established the defendant\u2019s guilt on the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge correctly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">2. The indictment charging the defendant as an accessory before the fact was framed under G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His appellate counsel argues at some length that the defendant should have been indicted and tried under G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because a principal felon, Carrasquillo, had been found not guilty of murder in the first degree prior to the defendant\u2019s trial. In support of this argument, the defendant relies on the provision in \u00a7 3, which states that an accessory before the fact \u201cmay be indicted and convicted of the substantive felony, whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>principal felon has or has not been convicted.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s trial counsel made no contention about the validity of the indictment, and he made no objection to the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on the elements of the crime charged.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s argument, reduced to essentials, appears to be that the defendant was indicted and tried under the wrong statute (G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 2, as distinguished from \u00a7 3) and, as a consequence, he is entitled to have his conviction reversed, have a new indictment returned, and a retrial possibly held under a new indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">General Laws c. 274, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3, are complementary statutes that seek to punish a defendant who \u201caids in the commission of a felony, or is accessory thereto before the fact by counselling, hiring or otherwise procuring such felony to be committed.\u201d The legislative background of the statutes, and their interrelationship, was discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Ortiz, 424 Mass. 853, 856-858 (1997). Section 2 defines the core offense, and \u00a7 3 states when and how an accessory before the fact may be tried. As we concluded in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Ortiz, <em>supra </em>at 858, the \u201cpractical effect of [G. L. c. 274, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3] is to hold the criminal actor who participates in a felony liable as a principal without regard to whether the felony is completed or committed by another. See 1 C. Torc\u00eda, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 35, at 202-203 (15th ed. 1993) (\u2018The person who aids, abets, commands, counsels, or otherwise encourages another to commit a crime is still regarded as a party to the underlying crime as at common law, even though the labels principal in the first degree, principal in the second degree, and accessory before the fact are no longer used, and even though it usually does not matter whether the aider and abettor is or is not present at the scene of the crime\u2019).\u201d (Footnote omitted). The defendant was thus tried and convicted by the jury in all respects as a principal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>without regard to his presence at the scene of the murder which was not a fact necessary to his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">There is no significance in the fact that the Commonwealth proceeded against the defendant as an accessory under \u00a7 2 of G. L. c. 274, instead of directly on the substantive felony under \u00a7 3 of the statute. The defendant has shown no prejudice following from the manner in which he was charged and tried. It is settled law, as to principals in a crime, that the acquittal of one, and the conviction of the other, after separate tri\u00e1is, is no ground for objection by the defendant convicted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valentin, </em>420 Mass. 263, 275 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>408 Mass. 724, 729-730 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>378 Mass. 165, 173-174 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Podlaski, </em>377 Mass. 339, 349-350 (1979). Indeed, the defendant\u2019s conviction under G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 2, is entirely consistent with one of the policy reasons for the modem mle that someone in the position of the defendant should be held liable as a principal under a statute punishing an accessory.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that he was improperly charged and tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">3. As the testimony of Velasquez indicates, he was an important prosecution witness in proving that the defendant had directed the killing. During the direct examination of Velasquez, the prosecutor carefully avoided any reference to prior bad acts by Los Solidos members that might be attributed to the defendant. As might be expected, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel engaged in extensive cross-examination of the witness. The cross-examination, among other goals, sought to establish that Velasquez was testifying for the prosecution because he sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>retribution against the defendant and the members of Los Soli-dos for setting him up to face the murder charge and not obtaining a lawyer for him. Defense counsel pointed out that Velasquez had delayed going to the police (the murder occurred in May, 1994, and Velasquez made contact with the police in February, 1995), and challenged him with the proposition \u201cthat when you went to speak to the police your motive, your reason for doing it is because you believed that members of the Los Solidos and specifically, [the defendant], set you up for the murder of [the victim]?\u201d In attempting to fend off the proposition, Velasquez, during his cross-examination, stated to the defendant\u2019s trial counsel that he \u201cdidn\u2019t go to the police. . . until the day my car got shot up, sir,\u201d and acknowledged that he was \u201cfearful of Los Solidos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Based on this part of the cross-examination, the prosecutor sought and obtained the judge\u2019s permission (over the objection of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel) to present evidence in redirect examination of prior bad acts of Los Solidos members directed at Velasquez in order to establish what the Commonwealth contended was the witness\u2019s true motive in cooperating with the police. The prosecutor then brought out that Velasquez had been threatened by Los Solidos members who \u201cwere going to beat me up,\u201d and that in February, 1995, before he went to the police, Velasquez was in an automobile with his daughter and his former girl friend, when another vehicle followed his, and \u201cwhen I pulled in my driveway they shot up my car.\u201d So, Velasquez testified, it was this shooting incident that finally motivated him to go to the police and give evidence about the murder. The judge carefully instructed the jury before the testimony was admitted that \u201cit may only be considered by you for [the] very limited purpose regarding this witnesses] state of mind and his motive for proceeding in a particular way, the issue having been raised on cross-examination.\u201d This instruction was repeated by the judge to the jury during her final charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The defendant argues that he should have a new trial because this testimony weakened his case significantly by tending to show that the Los Solidos organization was capable of organized violence. We consider the issue to have been adequately preserved for appellate review by the objections made by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel. While bad act evidence is not admissible to prove that a defendant has a propensity for criminal conduct, such evidence can be admitted for other relevant proba-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>live purposes, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martino, </em>412 Mass. 267, 280 (1992), and cases cited, after the judge balances its probative value against any prejudicial effect it may have. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, 425 </em>Mass. 349, 354 (1997). The admission of the evidence generally is \u201ca matter on which the opinion of the trial judge will be accepted on review except for palpable error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 463 (1981). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martino, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The judge did not err in admitting the evidence. Velasquez\u2019s motive was directly put in issue by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, and the cross-examination actually disclosed some of the bad act evidence in advance of the prosecutor\u2019s request to explore the subject on redirect examination. At the end of the cross-examination, the Commonwealth had a \u201cserious need to rehabilitate its primary witness,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>423 Mass. 180, 187 (1996), and the judge rightly decided that the probative value of the evidence outweighed the possibility of prejudice, especially because the jury would receive focused cautionary instructions on the proper consideration of the testimony. It should be kept in mind as well that, at the point in the trial when Velasquez testified, the jury had heard evidence about the nature of Los Solidos\u2019s activities and the jury reasonably could infer that members who failed the organization might be dealt with harshly. The fact that the bad acts testified to by Velasquez were not directly attributed to the defendant is of no significance. In the context of the evidence which warranted the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant was the directing force behind Los Solidos\u2019 missions, a basis was established for the jury to connect the bad acts to the defendant. We conclude that the issue provides no reason for a new trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">4. The defense raised the issue of alibi. His trial counsel called six witnesses who testified, in substance, that, on May 27, 1994, when the murder was planned, the defendant was at his grandmother\u2019s house, and that, on May 28, 1994, when the murder was committed, he was at a family christening. A videotape of the christening showed the defendant at the recep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>tion. The defendant gave pretrial statements to the police which were generally supportive of his alibi. During questioning by the police, however, he contradicted his alibi by stating that he had been in Nieves\u2019s apartment on May 27 when the meeting was held. It is now argued that his statements to the police could be considered as evidence of consciousness of guilt, and that the failure of his trial counsel to request an instruction on consciousness of guilt created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">There is no merit to the argument. The lack of an instruction on the subject did not prejudice the defendant\u2019s case. His trial counsel may very well have made a strategic decision not to call the jury\u2019s attention to the inconsistencies in the defendant\u2019s statements, and to concentrate instead on undermining the credibility of the prosecution witnesses, especially Velasquez, and to raise the issue of alibi through the defense case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>419 Mass. 426, 435-436 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">5. There is no reason to grant the defendant relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. The evidence of his guilt is substantial, and the murder was a senseless act committed in furtherance of the code of unlawful behavior governing Los Solidos.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\"> This is the governing structure the jury could have found from the testimony of Los Solidos members who were witnesses for the Commonwealth. In addition to a president, Los Solidos also had a vice-president, a \u201cwarlord,\u201d a treasurer, and one or more \u201cchief enforcers,\u201d \u201cenforcers,\u201d and \u201csoldiers.\u201d The warlord \u201cgets an order from the president and he carries it out\u201d by \u201cha[ving] others do it.\u201d The warlord also procures the weapon or weapons necessary to complete an order. The chief enforcer and enforcers \u201cdiscipline the brothers if they disrespect.\u201d Soldiers perform other duties, such as stealing automobiles for use in executing orders. The treasurer collected periodic dues from the members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\"> General Laws c. 274, \u00a7 2, reads: \u201cWhoever aids in the commission of a felony, or is accessory thereto before the fact by counselling, hiring or otherwise procuring such felony to be committed, shall be punished in the manner provided for the punishment of the principal felon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The indictment against the defendant reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">\u201cOn or about May 28, 1994, at SPRINGFIELD in the COUNTY of HAMPDEN; JOSE CARRASQUILLO and/or WILFREDO ROSADO, JR., acting individually or in concert with each other, did knowingly and intentionally assault and beat Sylvia Ramirez with intent to murder her, and by such assault and beating did kill and murder the said Sylvia Ramirez.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">\u201cAND, THE GRAND JURY FURTHER PRESENTS THAT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">\u201cMIGUEL MOURE of SPRINGFIELD in the COUNTY of HAMP-DEN, defendant herein, before the said murder was committed, did incite, procure, aid, counsel, hire or command the said JOSE CAR-RASQUILLO and/or WILFREDO ROSADO, JR., acting individually or in concert with each other, to do and commit the said murder.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b340-12\"> General Laws c. 274, \u00a7 3, reads: \u201cWhoever counsels, hires or otherwise procures a felony to be committed may be indicted and convicted as an accessory before the fact, either with the principal felon or after his conviction; or may be indicted and convicted of the substantive felony, whether the principal felon has or has not been convicted, or is or is not amenable to justice; and in the last mentioned case may be punished in the same manner as if convicted of being an accessory before the fact. An accessory to a felony before the fact may be indicted, tried and punished in the same county where the principal felon might be indicted and tried, although the counselling, hiring or procuring the commission of such felony was committed within or without the commonwealth or on the high seas.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b341-6\"> The Commonwealth\u2019s brief indicates, however, that Rosado, the other principal felon named in the indictment, \u201chas yet to be tried [but] has testified under oath that he directly participated in the murder of Sylvia Ramirez.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\"> The defendant\u2019s appellate counsel makes no argument in his brief that the jury instructions on the crime charged are erroneous. The instructions were in accordance with the manner in which the crime was charged in the indictment. Appellate counsel raised a point about the jury instructions at oral argument contending that they did not adequately inform the jury that the defendant, to be convicted as an accomplice to murder in the first degree, had to premeditate the killing along with the other principals. The instructions created no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice in light of the evidence that warranted the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant had planned and ordered the murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\"> This reason is explained in a criminal law treatise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">\u201cOne of the greatest social menaces of the present day is the one who would be termed an accessory before the fact by the common law but in lay language is referred to as the \u2018brains\u2019 of a crime ring.

Perkins &amp; R.N.

We have considered the testimony in question and conclude that it does not support the defendant\u2019s argument that, when considered with the evidence given by Velasquez, a new trial must be ordered. The other evidence simply repeated the possibility that members of Los Solidos might retaliate against someone who provided information to the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
