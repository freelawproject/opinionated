The plaintiff contends that the obligations are distinct so that, on default of the limited partnership\u2019s obligations under the notes and the foreclosure of the related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>mortgage, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with the notice required by G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 17B, did not preclude commencement of an action against the individual defendants as guarantors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A panel of the Appeals Court divided on the issue, with two Justices concluding that, because the defendants\u2019 guaranties \u201csubstantively do no more than duplicate [their] already existing liability\u201d as makers of the notes, whether the plaintiff brought an action on the notes or the guaranties, the plaintiff was compelled to comply with the statutory notice provisions. <em>JER SKW Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 243, 249 (1998). We conclude that the defendants\u2019 obligations pursuant to the guaranties were separate and distinct from their obligations under the notes, and thus the guaranties are enforceable without regard to \u00a7 17B.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The pertinent facts are as follows. In September, 1991, the defendants, in their capacity as general partners of the limited partnership, executed and delivered to Shawmut Bank, N.A., two promissory notes (in the amount of nearly two million dollars) secured by a mortgage on certain commercial property in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Westfield. Each of the defendants, in his individual capacity, executed contemporaneously with the promissory notes a guaranty reaffirming his obligation to pay all of the limited partnership\u2019s debts pursuant to guaranties each had executed in April, 1988. By the terms of those documents, the defendants jointly and severally \u201cunconditionally guarantee[d]\u201d to Shaw-mut \u201cfull and prompt payment at maturity of all present and future obligations\u201d of the general partners of the limited partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The plaintiff purchased from Shawmut the notes, guaranties, and all related mortgage documents. After the limited partnership defaulted on its obligations under the notes and mortgage, the plaintiff<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> commenced an action in the Superior Court against the defendants as guarantors of the limited partnership\u2019s obligations, for the \u201cfull amount of the mortgage due.\u201d Prior to filing its complaint, the plaintiff twice demanded that the defendants pay amounts that might be due under the notes, but the defendants failed to make payment. State Street Bank and Trust Company thereafter sold the Westfield property at a foreclosure sale. A judge in the Superior Court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered a judgment dismissing the complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The Appeals Court, relying principally on <em>Seronick </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 367, 371 (1988), agreed with the judge\u2019s determination that the defendants\u2019 liability as individual guarantors \u201cmerely duplicates\u201d their liability as makers of the note, and thus the defendants\u2019 guaranties are \u201csurplusage.\u201d <em>JER SKW Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Gold, supra </em>at 246-248. The court based its result on the fact that, although the defendants\u2019 guaranties \u201ccould potentially enlarge the scope of [their] liability by exposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>them to liability for any future advances made to the limited partnership as well as for the amounts due on the notes,\u201d because \u201cno other advances were in fact made to the limited partnership^] [t]he defendants\u2019 actual liability remains identical with respect to the notes and the guaranties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247. In such circumstances, the court wrote, \u201csuit may only be brought subject to the statutory notice requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249. The dissent in the Appeals Court relied on the unconditional nature of the guaranties and the plain language of \u00a7 17B, to conclude that the statute \u201cdoes not impose the obligation of notice\u201d in circumstances \u201cwhere the lender and the borrower separately agree that the borrower will be liable, in any event, for any unpaid balances then or thereafter due the lender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253 (Gillerman, J., dissenting). For the reasons more fully elucidated by the dissent, see <em>id. </em>at 251-253, we conclude that judgment for the plaintiff should be entered on its motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">General Laws c. 244, \u00a7 17B, \u201cwas designed for the protection of mortgagors and those liable with them or through them on mortgage obligations.\u201d <em>Senior Corp. </em>v. <em>Perine, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 967, 967 (1983), quoting <em>Palumbo </em>v. <em>Audette, </em>323 Mass. 559, 560 (1949). As the dissenting Justice in the Appeals Court explained, the provision \u201cprecludes an action for a deficiency on an <em>\u2018obligation secured by mortgage of real </em>estate\u2019 unless the required notice is sent to the person to be charged for the deficiency\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>JER SKW Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Gold, supra </em>at 251 (Gillerman, J., dissenting). The statutory notice provision requires that the notice \u201cstate the mortgagee\u2019s intention to foreclose the mortgage on property which \u2018secure[s] <em>a note </em>(or other obligation) <em>signed by you, for the whole, or part, of which you may be liable to me in case of a deficiency </em>in the proceeds of the foreclosure sale\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>It has been said that \u201c[tjhere is no statutory obligation on the part of a foreclosing mortgagee to notify guarantors because the liability of a guarantor does not flow from an \u2018obligation secured by a mortgage of real estate\u2019 but is independent of that obligation.\u201d <em>Seronick </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 367, 372 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Some States have enacted \u201canti-deficiency\u201d laws which operate to prohibit or limit deficiency judgments following foreclosure, and courts in those jurisdictions generally do not permit deficiency judgments against guarantors who were also makers. See, e.g., <em>Union Bank </em>v. <em>Dorn, </em>254 Cal. App. 2d 157, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>159 (1967); <em>Valinda Bldrs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Bissner, </em>230 Cal. App. 2d 106, 111 (1964). See also <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>977 F.2d 18, 25 n.10 (1st Cir. 1992), and cases cited. Massachusetts has no such law, and we are not persuaded by the defendants\u2019 attempts to broaden the scope of \u00a7 17B to include such a policy. Section 17B is unambiguous: it does not provide a guarantor with the same protections afforded those primarily liable on a note, even if the guarantor was also the primary obligor of the instrument.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In addition, the defendants\u2019 guaranties, unlike those at issue in <em>Seronick </em>v. <em>Levy, supra; Valinda Bldrs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Bissner, supra; </em>and <em>Riddle </em>v. <em>Lushing, </em>203 Cal. App. 2d 831, 836 (1962), clearly are broader than the notes. They expose the defendants as guarantors to liability for all existing and future obligations of the limited partnership, which by implication includes the notes, although the guaranties make no specific reference to them. Whether the defendants\u2019 liability was in fact enlarged is irrelevant. \u201cThe [g]uarant[ies] [do] not refer to the repayment of any specific liability in any specific time period, but rather [were] clearly meant to secure any liability running from [the defendants] to [the plaintiff]. Stated another way, the obligation undertaken under the [g]uarant[ies] is not bounded by the term[s] of the [notes].\u201d <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Singh, supra </em>at 25.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">As the dissenting Justice in the Appeals Court explained, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>each guaranty executed by the defendants \u201c \u2018unconditionally guarantee[d]\u2019 ... the full and prompt payment at maturity of all present and future obligations[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] of the general partners of the limited partnership. Upon any default of the general partners, the liability of the guarantors \u2018shall be effective immediately, without demand, presentment, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived . . . and without further steps to be taken or further conditions to be performed by Holder or anyone.\u2019 \u201d <em>JER SKW Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Gold, supra </em>at 252 (Gillerman, J., dissenting). The dissent continued, \u201cSuch was the unconditional obligation of the defendants and [there is] no reason why they should be relieved of that obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agree. The defendants\u2019 guaranties were absolute and unconditional, entitling the plaintiff to require the defendants to fulfil the obligations they undertook thereunder, notwithstanding that the plaintiff may have failed to comply with the notice provisions in \u00a7 17B. See generally P.A. Alces, Suretyship and Guaranty \u00a7 1.02[l][a], at 1-3 (1997) (\u201cThe creditor that takes an absolute, unconditional guaranty will be able to require that the guarantor perform, notwithstanding the existence of the primary obligor\u2019s defense to performance of the primary obligor\u2019s contract with the creditor\u201d). There is simply no justification for abrogating this rule in this case, where the defendants, seemingly experienced business persons, were engaging in a sophisticated commercial transaction involving large sums of money. The defendants\u2019 further reliance on various provisions of G. L. c. 244 and c. 106 does not convince us otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Furthermore, nothing in the guaranties, reaffirmed at the time the notes were executed, indicates that the defendants intended to restrict their breadth. \u201c[By] executing the [g]uarant[ies] in addition to the partnership obligation, and by thereafter reaffirming [them] in conjunction with the [execution of the notes], the [defendants] incurred liability in two separate and distinct capacities.\u201d <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Singh, supra </em>at 22. Accordingly, we conclude that \u201c[t]his action is based on a separate personal obligation on the part of the defendants] under the guarantees] .... [The defendants\u2019] obligations [did not] arise from the mortgage. They stem from the contracts] of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>guaranty, the independence of which is apparent from [their] provisions.....\u201d <em>Senior Corp. </em>v. <em>Perine, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 967, 967 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint is vacated. Judgment is to enter determining the defendants liable on their guaranties, and there are to be further proceedings in the Superior Court to determine the amount of damages. The order denying the motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-6\"> General Laws c. 244, \u00a7 17B, reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">\u201cNo action for a deficiency shall be brought ... by the holder of a mortgage note or other obligation secured by mortgage of real estate after a foreclosure sale by him . . . unless a notice in writing of the mortgagee\u2019s intention to foreclose the mortgage has been mailed, postage prepaid, by registered mail with return receipt requested, to the defendant sought to be charged with the deficiency . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The provisions of \u00a7 17B may not be waived, and any agreement to waive them is void. G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 17C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\"> The Appeals Court affirmed the Superior Court judge\u2019s denial of the defendant Jonah Jacob\u2019s cross appeal. Jacob argued that the judge erred in denying his motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s appeal because the plaintiff\u2019s failure timely to pay the requisite docket fee in the Appeals Court constituted inexcusable neglect. The Appeals Court determined that \u201cany error on the part of the appellant was the result of excusable neglect. See <em>Mailer </em>v. <em>Mailer, </em>387 Mass. 401, 405 (1982).\u201d <em>JER SKW Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 243, 251 (1998). We agree with this determination. Another court deciding the issue may have come to a different conclusion, but the matter involves a high measure of discretion, and we are not inclined to set aside the exercise of discretion made by the two courts that have refused to dismiss the appeal. See <em>Karen Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lizotte, </em>396 Mass. 143, 145-146 (1985) (\u201cexcusable neglect\u201d seemingly given fairly loose interpretation); <em>Giacobbe </em>v. <em>First Coolidge Corp., </em>367 Mass. 309, 315-316, 317 (1975) (rules of appellate procedure contain many deadlines, but also provide lower courts broad discretionary authority to permit prosecution of appeals despite noncompliance with timetable).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b546-7\"> SKW Real Estate Limited Partnership (SKW) had assigned its interest in the mortgage to State Street Bank and Trust Company (State Street) in April, 1994, and thus State Street filed the complaint in the Superior Court. Pursuant to a motion by State Street, SKW was substituted as the plaintiff before argument was heard on State Street\u2019s motion for summary judgment because SKW remained the holder of the promissory notes and the guaranties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\"> The judge did not rule on a motion for reconsideration in which the plaintiff asserted that notice had been sent to the defendants regarding its intent to seek a deficiency judgment. In the motion, the plaintiff submitted evidence to show that notice of the foreclosure sale had been sent to each of the three defendants by certified mail, and to defendant Jacob\u2019s attorney, all return receipt requested. The record indicates a receipt from Jacob\u2019s attorney, but none from Jacob. The notices sent to defendants Gold and Oshana were returned \u201cunclaimed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\"> The defendants\u2019 argument is not advanced by reliance on the Appeals Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Seronick </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 367, 371 (1988), where the Appeals Court relied on the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ligran, Inc. </em>v. <em>Medlawtel, Inc., </em>86 N.J. 583, 589 (1981), to conclude that, \u201cwhen a maker also signs a note as guarantor, the guaranty is surplusage.\u201d In <em>Ligran, Inc., </em>the court looked to New Jersey\u2019s version of the Uniform Commercial Code, which parallels G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-416 (4) (1996 ed.), and provided, \u201cNo words of guaranty added to the signature of a sole maker or acceptor affect his liability on the instrument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589, citing N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 12A:3-416(4). The New Jersey court construed the statute to mean that \u201ca sole maker cannot reduce his liability by adding words of guaranty to his signature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We do not have a similar situation here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b548-8\"> While the court in <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>977 F.2d 18, 25 (1st Cir. 1992), relied on both the fact that the guaranty, unlike the note, obligated the guarantors to deliver additional collateral as well as that the obligation under the guaranty was not bounded by the term of the note, we view it sufficient under the court\u2019s reasoning that, because the guaranties at issue here were plainly intended to be broader than the note, the guaranty is broader in the sense envisioned by that court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b549-6\"> The guaranties defined \u201cobligations\u201d to mean \u201call loans, indebtedness, notes, liabilities . . . and amounts . . . owing by [the general partners] . . . at any time . . . now existing or hereafter contracted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
