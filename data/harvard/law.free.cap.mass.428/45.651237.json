The defendant claims that the trial judge erred when he (1) refused to permit the defendant to videotape his <em>Blaisdell </em>interview <em>(Blaisdell </em>v. Commonwealth, 372 Mass. 753 [1977]); (2) refused to conduct a more probing voir dire on the issue of prospective jurors\u2019 prejudices against the insanity defense<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; and (3) denied the defendant\u2019s request for a missing witness instruction. The defendant also seeks relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, on his convictions of murder in the first degree. The defendant also asserts that the judge abused his discretion in determining that a new trial was not warranted. We affirm the convictions and the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. We decline to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We set forth the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, reserving certain details for discussion in conjunction with specific issues raised. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nichypor, </em>419 Mass. 209, 210 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sale-mme, </em>395 Mass. 594, 595 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">On the evening of December 14, 1992, the defendant used a high-powered rifle to shoot and kill two people and wound four others on the campus of Simon\u2019s Rock College in Great Bar-rington.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">On the morning of the shootings, a package for the defendant containing a gun stock, five thirty-round ammunition clips, and 200 rounds of ammunition arrived at the college. The defendant had ordered the equipment by telephone from a company in North Carolina three days earlier. A college staff member, concerned by the return address label that identified the package\u2019s sender as a gun dealer, brought the package to the dean of students. When questioned about the package\u2019s contents by the dean, the defendant showed the dean only the gun stock, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>an empty ammunition can, and the clips. The defendant told the dean that the package contained Christmas presents for himself and his father, to be used at home in Montana. The defendant assured the dean that he had no weapon on campus. During the meeting with the dean, the defendant appeared \u201ccalm\u201d and his conversation was \u201cstraightforward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">On the afternoon of the shootings, the defendant took a taxicab to Pittsfield. The defendant carried a guitar case with him and told the taxi driver that he was going to purchase tennis racquets for his father for Christmas. At a sporting goods store in Pittsfield, the defendant purchased a semi-automatic assault rifle. The defendant had previously called the store to inquire whether he could purchase the rifle. The defendant returned to the campus and took a final examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">After the examination, the defendant told a friend that he had purchased a gun and showed the friend the gun and some of the equipment for it. The night before, the defendant had told the same friend that he \u201cwas planning to get a gun and bring it to campus and shoot people.\u201d Several nights earlier, the defendant had told the friend that he was copying the Book of Revelations rather than studying for examinations \u201cso people would think [I] was crazy when [I] shot people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">While in jail after his arrest, the defendant talked about the killings with other inmates and told them that he was excited that he was getting attention from the news media, and that he hoped to be on television or have a movie made about what happened. The defendant also discussed the insanity plea and asked the inmates \u201cif there was any way to fool . . . the shrink.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">At trial, the defendant admitted the shootings but denied criminal responsibility, claiming that he was mentally ill. Five experts testified for the defendant. Two experts testified for the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">2. Blaisdell <em>interview. </em>The defendant assigns error to the judge\u2019s denial of his motion requesting that the <em>Blaisdell </em>examinations be videotaped. See <em>Blaisdell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra at 161. </em>The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to assistance of counsel did not include the right to record a court-ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>psychiatric examination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge also determined that, because the defendant\u2019s interviews with his own psychiatric experts had not been recorded, recording only the Commonwealth\u2019s examination would be \u201cunfair\u201d to the Commonwealth. The judge, exercising his discretion, concluded that the defendant\u2019s rights could be adequately protected by a thorough written report prepared by the Commonwealth\u2019s examining doctors. The defendant contends that a written report is not a sufficient substitute for videotaping because a written report is necessarily not a verbatim account of the interview and is susceptible to the biases of the reporter. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u201cA defendant has no constitutional right to . . . [videotape] record[]\u201d a <em>Blaisdell </em>interview. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>426 Mass. 105, 111 n.4 (1997), cert, denied, 119 S. Ct. 61 (1998). \u201c[I]t is within the judge\u2019s discretion to require an electronic recording of the <em>Blaisdell </em>interview.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113. \u201c[W]e think that wide-ranging cross-examination, including inquiry as to why an accurate record was not made of a psychiatric interview, is the appropriate antidote to potential overreaching, bias, or mischaracterization of evidence by [the Commonwealth\u2019s experts].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s experts was a \u201cwithering attack both on . . . [the] technique and on the reliability of . . . [the] opinions.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There was no error and no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">3. <em>Voir dire. </em>Prior to trial the defendant brought a motion regarding jury selection, requesting both an individual voir dire and the use of an additional questionnaire containing specific questions regarding potential jurors\u2019 personal experiences with mental health professionals and beliefs about the insanity defense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In support of his motion, the defendant offered a public opinion survey he solicited that purported to show that a majority of potential jurors in this case were suspicious of the insanity defense, and almost one-third said that they would not fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>low the judge\u2019s instructions regarding the insanity defense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for an individual voir dire and denied his motion for use of the questionnaire. The defendant claims that the judge erred in not conducting a more probing voir dire of prospective jurors on the issue of their bias toward the insanity defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">This case was tried in 1994. At that time we \u201c[did] not require as a matter of law that questions be directed at discovering bias against the defense of lack of criminal responsibility \u2018in every case involving testimony by psychiatrists and the defense of insanity.\u2019. . . Nevertheless[, we required that] if the defendant show[ed] that there [was] a \u2018substantial risk that the jury would be influenced by extraneous issues,\u2019 ... the judge should ask questions aimed at discovering those factors\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prendergast, </em>385 Mass. 625, 628-629 (1982). \u201cThe judge has broad discretion as to the questions to be asked, and need not put the specific questions proposed by the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>383 Mass. 637, 641 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Here, the judge inquired specifically and individually of prospective jurors on the issue of the insanity defense. He asked each prospective juror, \u201cOne of the issues in this case may be the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time the crimes were allegedly committed. In that regard, there may be testimony from psychiatrists and psychologists and other mental health professionals. Do you have any feelings or opinions that would prevent you from considering such testimony in a fair and impartial manner? ... Do you have any feelings or opinions that would prevent you from returning a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity if you felt such a verdict was warranted by the evidence? ... Is there any other reason you know of why you could not serve as a fair, objective and impartial juror in this case?\u201d There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that the judge must ask open-ended questions such as those suggested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>by the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>388 Mass. 358, 368 (1983). There was no error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">4. <em>Missing witness </em>instruction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Doctors Wesley Profit and Peter Cohen together evaluated the defendant for the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Both signed the written report of their evaluation concluding that the defendant was not mentally ill. The Commonwealth, however, called only Dr. Profit as a witness. At the charge conference, the defendant requested a \u201cmissing witness\u201d instruction, arguing that the Commonwealth failed to call Dr. Cohen although he was available, because his opinion of the defendant\u2019s mental state was more equivocal than Dr. Profit\u2019s. The defendant\u2019s counsel also told the judge that the defendant could not call Dr. Cohen himself because his testimony would still be harmful to the defendant. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s request and, on appeal, the defendant claims error. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u201cWhether an inference can be drawn from the failure to call witnesses necessarily depends . . . upon the posture of the particular case and the state of the evidence. . . . Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>inference permitted to be drawn with respect to a missing witness \u2018can have a seriously adverse effect on the noncalling party \u2014 suggesting, as it does, that the party has wilfully attempted to withhold or conceal significant evidence \u2014 it should be invited only in clear cases, and with caution.\u2019 . . . When it appears that the witness may be as favorable to one party as the other, no inference is warranted. . . . Further, if the circumstances, considered by ordinary logic and experience, suggest a plausible reason for nonproduction of the witness, the jury should not be advised of the inference. . . . In the last analysis, the trial judge has the discretion to refuse to give the instruction, . . . and, conversely, a party who wishes the instruction cannot require it of right.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>411 Mass. 279, 282-283 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">This is not a case where a party has wilfully attempted to withhold or conceal significant evidence by refusing to call an available witness. Both Dr. Profit and Dr. Cohen signed the report. The Commonwealth was free to use either expert to bring the evaluation in evidence. Nothing in the record shows that Dr. Cohen disavowed the report or disagreed with its material conclusion that the defendant was not mentally ill at the time of the shootings. The Commonwealth plausibly argues that Dr. Cohen\u2019s testimony would have been merely cumulative of Dr. Profit\u2019s testimony. A party need not offer witnesses if that witness\u2019s testimony is cumulative. Any other practice would make trials too lengthy and unwieldy. The defendant concedes that the reason that he did not call Dr. Cohen himself was that his testimony would have been harmful to the defendant. The judge did not abuse his discretion or err in refusing to give a missing witness instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">5. <em>Motion for a new trial. </em>The defendant moved for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. The defendant asserted that he had recently discovered that Dr. Profit was homosexual and under investigation for allegedly having a sexual relationship with a young boy. The defendant argued that these facts may have caused Dr. Profit to be biased against the defendant because of the strong antihomosexual feelings expressed by the defendant, or in order to curry favor with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">As evidence of Dr. Profit\u2019s alleged bias the defendant pointed to (1) the fact that Dr. Profit was the director of forensic services at Bridgewater State Hospital and therefore controlled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>who conducted the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility evaluation; (2) expert opinion that it was unethical for Dr. Profit to conduct an evaluation of the defendant whom he knew to harbor strong antihomosexual feelings (or at least that Dr. Profit should have revealed his sexual orientation and the ongoing investigation into his conduct); (3) several errors<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> made by Dr. Profit; (4) the fact that Dr. Cohen\u2019s more equivocal view of the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility was omitted from the evaluation report signed by Dr. Profit and Dr. Cohen<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>; and (5) the fact that Dr. Profit\u2019s opinion concerning the defendant\u2019s mental condition differed from the opinions of the defense\u2019s experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion without a hearing. The judge determined that the new evidence only went to the impeachment of Dr. Profit. He determined that it was unlikely that the defendant would have chosen to impeach Dr. Profit with his homosexuality and the investigation. In concluding that the defendant was unlikely to have used the new evidence to impeach Dr. Profit, the judge stated, \u201cDr. Profit is African American (a fact which was obviously known to the jury by virtue of his appearance before them), and the defendant was alleged to have made a number of racist statements, in addition to his homophobic statements. Accordingly, it was open to defense counsel at trial to argue that Dr. Profit harbored a bias against the defendant because of the defendant\u2019s alleged bigotry against members of his (Dr. Profit\u2019s) race. The fact that she declined to do so indicates to me that she did not feel such a tactic would be effective, and I seriously doubt whether she would have run the risk of offending the jury by attacking Dr. Profit with evidence of his homosexuality, had she known about it at the time of trial.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The judge also noted that Dr. Profit\u2019s testimony was not the only evidence that undermined the defendant\u2019s claim of lack of criminal responsibility. There was \u201cwell-reasoned\u201d expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>testimony from Dr. Michael Annunziata<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that the defendant was sane at the time of the shootings, as well as evidence from lay witnesses that the defendant made plans before the shooting to feign mental illness. Furthermore, during the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Profit, the jury were informed of Dr. Cohen\u2019s view that the defendant\u2019s thinking \u201ctook an extremely unusual and religious turn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The judge also relied on an affidavit from Dr. Cohen executed more than a year after Dr. Cohen left his position at Bridgewa-ter State Hospital. In the affidavit, Dr. Cohen averred that he had no reservation, either at the time of the defendant\u2019s evaluation or since, about the propriety of Dr. Profit\u2019s participation in the evaluation. Dr. Cohen also stated that he ultimately concluded that the defendant was criminally responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The judge concluded that \u201c[o]n the basis of the evidence that I heard at trial, I am convinced that this newly discovered evidence does not cast any doubt upon the justice of the defendant\u2019s convictions, and that it probably would not have been a real factor in the jury\u2019s deliberations. Simply put, there is no substantial risk that the jury would have reached a different conclusion had'the evidence been admitted at trial.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">\u201cIt is well established that \u2018[njewly discovered evidence that tends merely to impeach the credibility of a witness will not ordinarily be the basis of a new trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>416 Mass. 41, 47 (1993), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 581 (1982). \u201cA defendant seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence must establish . . . that the evidence . . . casts real doubt on the justice of the conviction. . . . [T]he judge must find there is a substantial risk that the jury would have reached a different conclusion had the evidence been admitted at trial.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 305-306 (1986). \u201c[T]he judge\u2019s disposition of the motion will not be reversed unless it is manifestly unjust, ... or unless the trial was infected with prejudicial constitutional error\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>408 Mass. 117, 125 (1990). \u201cIn reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>the grant or denial of a motion for a new trial, we will grant special deference to the views of a motion judge who was also the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>413 Mass. 770, 773 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The problem with the defendant\u2019s argument is that he assumes that Dr. Profit was the Commonwealth\u2019s only witness on criminal responsibility. However, the Commonwealth presented ample other evidence from which the jury could conclude that the defendant was not mentally ill at the time of the shootings. There also was substantial evidence from lay witnesses showing that the defendant planned to feign mental illness in order to avoid criminal responsibility for the shootings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, the record does not support the defendant\u2019s assertion that Dr. Profit was the sole underpinning of the Commonwealth\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The judge was within his discretion in crediting Dr. Cohen\u2019s affidavit. The affidavit was executed more than a year after Dr. Cohen left his position at Bridgewater, thus there is little chance that it was the product of improper pressure on Dr. Cohen. Further, the errors made by Dr. Profit, as well as Dr. Cohen\u2019s observation about the defendant\u2019s thinking, were brought to the jury\u2019s attention by the defendant\u2019s cross-examination. We are confident that there is no substantial likelihood that the jury would have reached a different conclusion had the alleged bias of Dr. Profit been admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">6. <em>Review pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>The defendant asks that we order a new trial based on his \u201cbackground and the utter senselessness surrounding his having run amok, which can only be explained as the incredibly unfortunate result of mental illness . . . [and] since the record generates a \u2018profound doubt\u2019 as to the defendant\u2019s scienter on December 14, 1992.\u201d \u201cThe duty imposed on us by the statute does not \u2018convert this court into a second jury, which must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of a defendant by reading the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>reported evidence, without the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lunde, </em>390 Mass. 42, 50 (1983), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>357 Mass. 168, 181 (1970). \u201cThe issue of criminal responsibility is for the jury, not this court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lunde, supra. </em>We conclude that justice does not require entry of a lesser degree of guilt or a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The defendant requested that the judge ask the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">\u201c26.
