V. Buttrey and L. L. Treanor, D/B/A Tennessee Trailblazers are referred to as \u201cAppellees,\u201d John C. Hammer, C. L. Pentecost and Hammond Fowler, Commissioners, composing the Tennessee Public Service Commission as \u201c Commission, \u201d and the Greyhound Corporation \u2022 as \u201cAppellants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">\u2022 The facts in this matter are not in dispute. Appellees in March 1960 at the request of the principal transported high school students from Murfreesboro, Tennessee to Nashville, Tennessee to attend a basketball tournament at Vanderbilt, and return.</p>\n<p id=\"A1U\">Appellants filed a protest with the Commission setting out they were certificated by the Commission to carry passengers over certain designated routes and to render charter service from points originating on their routes. Appellees were likewise certificated by the Commission over certain routes with the same charter provision. The Murfreesboro, Tennessee route is certificated to Appellants and not to Appellees, and Appellees in rendering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>charter service originating from Murfreesboro were in excess of their authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">In their answer to this protest Appellees set out they were solicited by the principal of the high school for this service and in rendering such service they are exempt from the regulations of the Commission under authority of Section 65-1503 (g), T.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">From the hearing before the Commission there developed the only question at issue, which may be stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">\u201cIs a carrier duly certificated by the Commission to transport passengers, when making a casual trip upon solicitation of the party to be served exempt from the jurisdiction of the Commission under Section 65-1503(g), T.C.A.?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The Commission on this question held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">\u201cUpon consideration of the entire matter and construing 65-1503(g). T.C.A., in pari materia with the other sections of the Regulatory Act, and especially Chapter 15, this Commission is of the opinion that such service when rendered by a certificated carrier is not excluded from regulation by this Commission under 65-1503(g). T.C.A.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The Commission then ordered the Appellees to cease and desist from rendering any charter service which does not originate on their certificated routes or within the vicinity immediately adjacent thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The Appellees filed petition for certiorari and super-sedeas in the Chancery Court for Davidson County to review the action of the Commission. To this action Appellants filed a demurrer on two grounds as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>\u201c1. There is no equity on the face of the bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">\u201c2. Section 65-1503 (g) of the Tennessee Code Annotated does not exclude such service as that admittedly rendered by the petitioner from the regulatory jurisdiction of the Tennessee Public Service Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">This cause was heard by the Chancellor on motion to dispose of the demurrer, and he held since Section 65-1503(g) contains no qualifications whatsoever with respect to who furnishes the service, nor to the type of equipment used, that the service furnished by Appellees herein complained of falls directly within the provisions of this exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The decree entered overrules the demurrer and reverse's the judgment of the Commission. From this decree a discretionary appeal has been prayed and granted to this Court assigning this action of the Chancellor as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The decision in this matter requires the construction of Section 65-1503, T.C.A., which is a part of the \u201cMotor Carriers Act\u201d enacted as Chapter 119, Public Acts of 1933, now carried as Code Sections 65-1501 to 65-1525, (inclusive). By this act the legislature gave the Commission rather broad authority in regulating motor carriers in the transportation of passengers or property for hire over the highways of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Section 65-1503 is the exemption section of these statutes, and lists eight exemptions, (a) through (h). This statute in reference to the motor vehicles exempted uses different words, which are words of limitation. In (a), (c), (d) and (e) the words are vehicles \u201cused exclusively\u201d in rendering certain types of service. In (f) it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>is the words \u201coperated for the sole purpose.\u201d In (h) it is the owner, lessee of bailee, \u201clegally and regularly\u201d engaged in a certain business. In (b) there are no similar words of limitations. In (g), the exemption at issue in this cause, the statute limits the\u2019 exemption to a carrier making \u201ccasual trips * * * solicited by the party served. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">It is not disputed for Appellees to come within the exemption under (g) the request for the service will have to be made by the party to be served, that is Appellees could not solicit and come within this exemption. Then the question arises, what is the meaning of the word \u201ccasual\u201d as used in this statute. The word \u201ccasual\u201d by generally accepted dictionaries means among other things, \u201coccurring or performed without regularity, \u201d \u201c occasional, \u201d \u201c accidental. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">In determining the meaning of a word used in a statute the Court should consider it in connection with the subject and other words used with it. <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. v. Carroll </em>County, 12 Tenn.App. 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Considering the word \u201ccasual\u201d in connection with the other words used with it.; the general subject matter of the statute; and the facts of this case; then the question arises, does the language of a statute requiring a trip made by a carrier in order to fall within this exemption, be made occasionally or without regularity, upon request of the party to be served, apply to a carrier certificated by the Commission to carry passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The Appellees are certificated by the Commission to carry passengers, in other words the carrying of passengers is a part of their regular business.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">To adopt the position of Appellees would be to say in substance; that a carrier duly certificated by the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>mission to carry passengers over certain routes could make an occasional charter trip, over any route, exempt from the jurisdiction of the Commission on the basis; \u201cthey called us \u2014 we did not call them.\u201d We think this would be an unusual, if not absurd conclusion. In construing a statute the rule is, that Courts will not adopt a construction which would effectuate an absurd result. <em>West v. State, </em>140 Tenn. 358, 204 S.W. 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In the construction of a statute the prime purpose is to ascertain and give effect to the legislative intent, and in so doing the statute is taken as a whole and viewed in the light of its general purpose. <em>Woodroof v. City of Nashville, </em>183 Tenn. 483, 192 S.W.2d 1013; <em>McGill &amp; Daugherty v. Kefauver, </em>175 Tenn. 667, 137 S.W.2d 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In Section 65-1501 the Legislature has set out the purpose of this legislation. It is declared this legislation is for the sole purpose of promoting and conserving the interest and convenience of the public by conferring upon the Commission the power and authority, and making it the duty of said Commission to supervise and reg\u00fa-late the transportation of persons and property by motor vehicle on the public highways of this state for four reasons specified in this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The legislature by Section 65-1525 has directed Chapter 15 be given a liberal construction in favor of the authority of the Commission to the end that they may govern and control operations of motor carriers in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Construing this section in para materia with other sections of Chapter 15, Title 65, we are of the opinion that carriers duly certificated by the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>sion to carry passengers are not exempted from the jurisdiction of the Commission, whereby they can make casual trips, upon solicitation of the party served under Section 65-1503 (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\">The judgment of the Chancellor is reversed and the judgment of the Commission affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
