This was nine months after the accident and about one month after petitioner was released from orthopedic treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">This physician testified that the petitioner was still under his care, and would probably require treatment for some three months after date of trial. Doctor Davis\u2019 symptomatic finding included pain, swelling in the right foot and ankle, pain in the muscles of the leg and back.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The petitioner, at the time of his injury, was a laboring man, 51 years of age and was employed as a turning lathe operator by Gluck Bros. Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">This physician testified that this toe injury had affected other parts of his body and that, in his opinion, the petitioner is 50% permanently, partially disabled. The defendant company saw fit not to introduce any proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">It should be emphasized that the petitioner is a day laborer, and the Court can see especially from the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>mony of Doctor Davis, that petitioner was so injured that he is materially affected in his work. See <em>Thornton v. R.C.A. Service </em>Co., 188 Tenn. 644, 221 S.W.2d 954; <em>Matthews v. Hardaway Contracting Co., </em>179 Tenn. 98, 163 S.W.2d 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We, therefore, hold that there was an abundance of material evidence to support the finding of the trial judge and all assignments of error must be overruled and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b192-6\">Burnett, Felts, White and Dyer, Justices, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
