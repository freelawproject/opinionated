Defendant\u2019s only contention on appeal is that this sentence is harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice. Not only did defendant receive the most lenient sentence possible (Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [d]; [4] [b]), but he pleaded guilty knowing that he would receive the sentence ultimately imposed by County Court. In addition, defendant derived a benefit from pleading guilty as he was able to plead to a class D felony instead of a class B felony, which carried with it a more lenient sentence <em>(compare, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [b], <em>with </em>Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [3] [d]). Under the circumstances, it cannot be said that the court abused its discretion in imposing sentence <em>(see, People v Pardoe, </em>147 AD2d 820; <em>People v Neira, </em>130 AD2d 518, <em>lv denied </em>70 NY2d 715).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Casey, J. P., Mikoll, Yesawich Jr., Crew III and Harvey, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
