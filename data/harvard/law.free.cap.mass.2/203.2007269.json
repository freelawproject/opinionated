S. </em>bought all, then sold the two first <em>by deed </em>\u2014 and the jury found there was no other way to the third <em>but </em>over the other two parcels; and it was resolved that <em>J. S. </em>had a way of necessity, notwith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>standing his grant; and he might take a convenient way withoat consent of the other, and the law would settle the question of sufficiency or conveniency. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-5\">So where the ancestor died seised of a mill and land adjoining, which descended to two sisters \u2014 partition was made; one has the rr /II and the other the land. She who has the mill shall have a way over the land reserved to her as a new way, although it was extinguished by the unity of possession of the ancestor. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-6\">The same law extends to other rights of necessity, as a gutter passing through adjoining tenements. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-7\">It must be <em>a right of necessity, </em>(as in the case at bar,) and not <em>merely of convenience. </em>And it would be a good plea \u201c that the plaintiff had another way.\u201d <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-8\"><em>Putnam </em>also referred to the following authorities, <em>viz., Lutw. 1448.\u2014Popham, 167.\u2014Palmer, </em>446. \u2014 6 <em>Mod. </em>3, 4.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-9\">\n<em>Little,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjR\">on the other side, contended that, by the extent of the execution, all the estate of <em>Pernam </em>in the premises extended upon was transferred to the creditor on the execution, and this without the reservation of any such easement or encumbrance as [ * 205 ] is now claimed by the plaintiff. ' It was an injustice * to the creditor, who might not know the particular situation of the land, as the debtor certainly did. If the debtor intended to set up this claim, he should have made it known to the appraisers, who would have made a deduction from the estimated value of the land, on account of this encumbrance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-10\">But the statute <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark> directing the method for laying out highways has made abundant provision for the plaintiff by empowering the selectmen of the town to lay out a way for his use, for which the defendant will receive a suitable recompense. This provision of the statute is nugatory, if the party has this right at common law. The intention of the legislature, that the owner of the soil should have satisfaction for the easement over his land, will be entirely frustrated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-11\">A way of necessity is nothing else but a way <em>by grant. </em>It derives its origin from a grant. <footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark> In this case, there is no pretence of a grant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-12\"><em>Andrews, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AScl\">If a judgment creditor succeeds to all the debtor\u2019s title, the grantee equally succeeds to that of the grantor; so that the authority from 2 <em>Sid. </em>applies equally to the case at bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>But our case is stronger: there, the way was necessary for the cultivation or occupation of land only; this is the only means the plaintiff has of getting out of his dwelling-house.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-5\">As to the statute provisions which have been read, it is a sufficient answer that, upon the defendant\u2019s position, immediately upon thq execution\u2019s being extended, <em>Pernam, </em>was shut up in his house and, unless he had this right of way, he could not go, even to make an application to the selectmen, without committing a trespass. We contend that this statute does not take away any rights existing at common law. Probably the intention was to provide for persons who are desirous of a more convenient way than they may already possess, and are willing to make a compensation for it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-6\">Upon reading the whole of the note in <em>Saunders, </em>the authority seems, to say the least of it, as favorable to the plaintiff as to the defendant.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\"> <em>Clark </em>vs. <em>Cogge, Cro.

It is agreed that he had no way by which he could have communication with the world, unless over this land, or by trespassing on others. The question, on this state of the case, is, whether the law gives him a way as a way of necessity. I am of opinion that it does. The reason of the thing is plain, and the cases cited are clearly in point. If, when a man voluntarily, for valuable consideration, grants land; having other land in the rear, he be entitled to thisJ way of necessity, although he might have secured it by reservation in his grant.\u2014 surely, when his land is taken from him <em>without </em>his consent, by force of law, he is not less entitled to such a privilege ; more especially when it is considered that the judgment creditor may elect <em>where </em>to take his land in satisfaction of his execution. He might have taken the land in the rear with the house, or he might have left a passage-way for the debtor, and had more land set off to him in lieu of that so left. He therefore must be considered as having chosen to take the whole front of the debtor\u2019s land, knowing at the time that he shut him from all communication with the private or public ways in the town. Under these circumstances, he certainly ought not to be privileged beyond a man who has made a fair purchase, dealing, upon equal 'terms, with a grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The only objection made on the part of the defendant arises from the provisions of the statute by which the plaintiff might have procured a way to be laid out by the selectmen. But I cannot consider this statute as divesting a common-law right, unless it were specially so declared by the words of the statute. I am satisfied that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>plaintiff has been legally entitled to a way of necessity from the time the execution was extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Sewall and Sedgwick, justices, concurred. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\n<em>Defendant defaulted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b196-7\"> <em>Taylor </em>vs. Townsend, 8 <em>Mass.
