Upon not guilty pleaded, he was tried before <em>Parker, </em>J., and convicted. The note produced on the trial appeared to be endorsed by <em>Flanders, </em>and, because the endorsement was not alleged in the indictment, <em>G. Blake, </em>of counsel for the defendant, objected to its going in evidence. His objection being overruled by the judge, he moves at this time for a new trial on the same ground.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b358-7\">\n<em>The Solicitor-General, Davis,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdL\">said, the reason that the endorsement was not set forth was that the government officers | * 398 ] *did not know it to be forged.
