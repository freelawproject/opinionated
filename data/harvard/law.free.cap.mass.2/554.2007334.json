Lit. 20. </em>1 <em>Cro. </em>525. <em>Vide </em>Readings on the Statute of <em>Wills, 3 </em>Inst.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-10\">Under the devise in the will of <em>James King, Deborah, </em>the daughter, took either an absolute unconditional fee, or an estate for life, or an estate in tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-11\">If she had a fee, it must have arisen from the devise being an executory devise. As, on the principles of executory devises, the fee must descend to the heir, to be defeated on a certain condition being performed, or must be vested by the devise in a devisee, to be defeated on a subsequent event, we may inquire where the fee of this estate was on the death of the devisor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-12\">There was an estate for life first carved out for <em>Rachel, </em>the widow of the devisor; then the residue is given to <em>Deborah, </em>[ * 556 ] the * daughter, and her heirs forever. This would have been a fee simple, were it not for a restrictive clause \u2014 \u201c but if my daughter should happen to die before she come of age, <em>or </em>have lawful heir of her body begotten,\u201d then it is devised over to the wife and sister, and to their heirs forever. The intention of the.testator is obvious here. Before the daughter came of age she could not convey; and, if she had a child, he intended that she should not convey, but that it should in all events go to her child. Had she died under age, and without issue, the estate would have been tak\u00e9n by her mother and aunt, under the will, as purchasers, and not by inheritance. <em>Deborah, </em>the daughter, had therefore a fee tail in the estate, with a remainder vested in her mother and aunt, expectant on her dying without an heir of her body; but should she have issue, that issue would succeed, by inheritance, to the estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Unless this was an executory devise, it was an estate tail. The nature of executory devises is explained in <em>Scatterwood </em>vs. <em>Edge, </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>229. It is commonly rested on a term for years, the' fee remaining in the heir until the condition of the devise is executed. Thus A devises for a term of years to B, and the residue to C, provided h.e shall then be alive, shall go to <em>London, </em>marry such a woman, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-5\">Lord <em>Coke </em>tells us, 1 <em>Inst. </em>20, that an estate tail is a cut or restrained fee. If this estate was ever vested in <em>Deborah, </em>the daughter, as an absolute, unrestrained fee, it was done presently by the will, or on some subsequent event. If she had any estate at' all by the will, on the death of the devisor, it was a restrained fee. The mother had the freehold; the daughter only a remainder, expectant on the death of the mother, but vested on the death of the devisor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-6\">The devise is express that, if she should die before she was of age, or had an heir of her body, the estate should go to her mother and aunt. Here was a restraint on the fee \u2014 for, if she died without lawful heir of her body, the estate was devised over. The expression is, \u201cif she die before she come of age, <em>or </em>have heir of her body.\u201d The word <em>heir </em>is not synonymous with the word <em>child. </em>No man living has heirs. If she had never * so [ * 557 ] many children, they were not heirs whilst she lived. Therefore the testator intended that, if the remainder to the mother and aunt should be defeated, this should be effected by the estate\u2019s descending to the heirs of the daughter in a lineal descent, counting from her as the purchaser. This is clearly a restrained fee in her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-8\">Had she died before she came of age, leaving issue, her heirs would have taken the estate. Had she died after she came of age, the same effect, and no other, would have been produced. Had she survived her mother and aunt, and died without leaving issue, the next heir of her mother and aunt would have taken the remainder as heirs to them, they having had the remainder contingent by purchase under the devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-9\">The testator could not intend that, if his daughter died before she came of age, and left issue, such issue should not inherit. The word <em>or </em>must therefore have a conjunctive meaning, and be read as <em>and. </em>If she had an heir of her body, that is, if she died leaving a child, the remainder in the mother and aunt was subverted ; and that child could not come in by purchase, because he was not <em>in esse </em>when the devise took effect. He must therefore come in a\u00b0 heir to his mother, and could take no more from her than she ban to leave him, <em>viz., a restrained fee.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The devisor\u2019s intention is obvious, that the estate should not go to the next of kin by the civil law, but to the heir by the common law. Nay, further, it was so restrained, that it could not go to the collateral heirs of the daughter, or ascend to her mother, as her representative. This was, then, if a fee at all, a restrained <em>fee; </em>and the highest estate she could possibly have was an estate tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-5\">In <em>Wood </em>vs. <em>Ingersoll, Cro. Jac. </em>260, \u2014a devise to three brothers, and if either died without <em>issue, </em>the other to be his heir, \u2014this was adjudged an estate tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-6\">This is like the case of <em>Noyes </em>vs. <em>Noyes, </em>in <em>Middlesex, </em>1796, \u2014a devise to three sons, and if either of them died without [ * 558 ] issue, * the others to be his heirs. One died, leaving his wife <em>enceinte. </em>The child was born alive, and died. The mother claimed as next of kin, on the doctrine of executory devises, and urged the case of <em>Pells </em>vs. <em>Brown, Cro. Jac. </em>590, but the court decided it to be an estate tail, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> This was a much stronger case than the one now in argument. The three candles were all burning at the same time, and the event must happen, at the farthest, within two lives. But the mode of expression, \u201c <em>if either die without issue, then the other to be his heir,\u201d </em>clearly showed the intent of the testator, that the estate, on the casualty which actually happened, should not go out of his family. It is quite as obvious, in the case under consideration, that the intention of the testator was to have the estate descend to the heirs of the daughter under restraints incompatible with a fee simple in the daughter. <em>Vide Badger </em>vs. <em>Lloyd, </em>1 Lord <em>Raym. </em>523, <em>Nottingham </em>vs. <em>Jennings, </em>1 Lord <em>Raym. </em>568, <em>Aumble </em>vs. <em>Jones, </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>238. In this last case it was adjudged as a fee because the restrictive words, <em>heirs of her body, </em>were omitted. But they are strongly used in the case at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-7\">In <em>Goodright </em>vs. <em>Cornish, </em>1 Lord <em>Raym. </em>3, a devise to <em>John, </em>his son, for 50 years, remainder to the heirs male of his body, Was adjudged to be a contingent remainder, and as such was void, for want of a freehold to rest it upon. But in our case there is a freehold to support the remainder. <em>Vide Moore </em>vs. <em>Parker, </em>1 Lord <em>Raym. </em>37. \u2014 <em>Luddington </em>vs. <em>Kime, ibid. </em>206. \u2014 <em>Goodright </em>vs. <em>Pullyn &amp; Al. </em>2 Lord <em>Raym. </em>1437.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-8\">The case of <em>Pells </em>vs. <em>Brown, Cro. Jac. </em>590, differs from this at bar. There was money to pay, by way of condition ; here there is none. If the devisee died without issue, <em>living W., </em>then <em>W. </em>was to have the estate; but in our case it could make no difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>whether <em>Deborah, </em>the daughter, died before or after her mother and aunt. If she died without lawful heir of her body, the estate went to them, if they \u00abwere living, and, if they were dead, to their heirs ; because they died seised of a contingent remainder, expectant on the death of <em>Deborah </em>without heirs of her body.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-5\">* The case of <em>Webb </em>vs. <em>Hearing, Cro. Jac. </em>415, is [ *559 ] strongly in point against the demandant. <em>Vide, </em>also, <em>Soulle </em>vs. <em>Gerrard, Cro. Eliz. </em>525. \u2014 <em>Comb. </em>252, <em>Reeve </em>vs. <em>Long. </em>\u2014 3 <em>Keb. </em>29, <em>Goodright, </em>ex dim. <em>Larmer, </em>vs. <em>Searle &amp; Ux. </em>2 <em>Wils. </em>29. \u2014 <em>Driver </em>vs. <em>Strandring, </em>2 <em>Wils. </em>88.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-7\">The estates known in our law, <em>viz., </em>terms for years, freehold, fee tail general and special, and fee simple, may be variously modified by conditions and contingencies, but still their natures are not changed. The statute <em>De Donis </em>prevents the creating such a contingency as will revive the old common-law fee simple <em>conditional estates.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-8\">In the case now before us, the whole estate of <em>James King </em>was disposed of by his will, and none of it descended to his heir. The wife had the freehold ; the daughter had all the rest and residue. This must have been a fee tail or a fee simple. No less estate could be rested, on a freehold. She took presently on the death of the devisor; and there was no contingency, on which her right vested. The mother and aunt took an estate in remainder, contingent on the death of the daughter without an heir of her body. This could not be an estate accruing on an executory devise, because it depended on too remote a contingency for such a gift. If <em>Deborah, </em>the daughter, died ever so early, yet if she left issue, the mother and aunt could not take the estate, whilst that issue, or the issue of that issue, lived. If the mother and aunt had died before the daughter, and she had afterwards died, without leaving issue, the estate, would not have gone to her next of kin, but to the legal heirs of the mother and aunt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-9\">There is therefore no pretence for saying that these candles were, m any sense, burning at the same time, which is an essential principle in an executory devise. And nothing could have probably happened which could have brought the event within a reasonable term of time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-10\">There are in <em>Leonard, </em>and some other books, cases where estates, being devised on condition of paying money, have been construed to be executory devises. But these cases do not apply to the one now before the Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b501-11\"><em>*J. Davis, </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of counsel for the demandant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Athh\">con- [ *560 ] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>tended that the daughter of <em>J. King, </em>under the devise above recited, took not an estate tail, as was held by the counsel for the defendants, but an estate in fee simple, defeasible upon a contingency, and subject to a conditional limitation to her mother and aunt; that the contingency, on which the estate was limited over to the mother and aunt, was conformable to the restrictions prescribed by the law for the substitution of a <em>fee upon afee; </em>and that the limitation over .to the mother and aunt was not by way of remainder, as it must be if the daughter took an estate tail, but that it was good as an <em>executory devise. </em>It is a rule of law, that words which show an intent that the devisee shall have a greater estate than for life, and do not limit an estate tail, make a fee. 3 <em>Com. Dig. </em>422, <em>tit. Devise.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-5\">The first words in the devise to the daughter, <em>\u201c unto my daughter and her heirs forever,\u201d </em>clearly carry a fee. It is agreed, however, that these words may be restrained or controlled by subsequent words, so as to make that a devise <em>in tail, </em>which otherwise would pass <em>a fee. </em>Thus, if the devise had been to the daughter and her heirs forever, and if she <em>die without issue, </em>to the mother, &amp;c., it is conceded that it would have been an estate tail in the daughter, with remainder to the mother, &amp;c. Such a limitation, being after <em>an indefinite failure of issue, </em>cannot operate by way of executory devise ; because the contingency is too remote, and might tend to a perpetuity, an executory devise not being liable to be prevented or destroyed by any alteration in the estate out of which, or after which, it is limited. 2 <em>Fearne, </em>51. \u2014 <em>Eq. Abr. </em>188. But if the dying without issue, or other contingency annexed to the estate of a devisee, may, by the terms of its creation, happen within the compass of a life or lives in being, and 21 years after, the limitation over is good by way of executory devise. <em>Pells </em>vs. <em>Brown, Cro.

Tracts, </em>518.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-6-pl-split\">The rules and principles contained in the authorities now cited apply strongly to the devise in question. Having regard to the distinction by which the cases above cited were ruled, it remains to inquire whether, in the will of <em>James King, </em>the limitation over to the mother and aunt was dependent on a general and indefinite failure of issue of the daughter ; or whether it was on a failure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>issue within the limits and the period required, by law, in the limitation of an estate by executory devise. On the determination of this question, it is apprehended, the decision of the main question will depend, <em>viz., </em>whether the daughter liad a fee simple or a fee tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-5\">The words are, \u201c <em>in case my daughter should happen to die before she come of age, or have lawful heir of her body, </em>then,\u201d &amp;,c. How are these words to be understood? If a strict grammatical construction be adhered to, it is conceived, the estate would go to the mother and aunt, upon the daughter\u2019s having <em>lawful </em>heir of her body. This is clearly not the meaning of the testator. Both parties will agree, therefore, that it shall be read as if the word <em>before </em>was repeated after the word <em>or. </em>It is conceived, also, that the word <em>or </em>must be construed conjunctively. Otherwise, if the daughter had issue, and <em>died before she attained the age of </em>21 <em>years, </em>the estate must have gone from the child to the mother and aunt. This certainly could not have been the intention of the testator. It is contended therefore that the devise, rightly construed, would read thus, \u201c unto my daughter and her heirs forever; but in case my daughter should happen to die before she come to age, <em>and before </em>she have lawful issue of her body begotten, then,\u201d &amp;e.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-6\">It is conceded indeed by the Attorney-General, in his argument for the defendants, that <em>or </em>should be read as <em>and, </em>to avoid the ab surd supposition that the testator could intend to disinherit a child, who might be born to his daughter, in case of her * dying before 21 years of age. To support such a [ * 662 ] reading, there are also many authorities. <em>Barker </em>vs. <em>Suretrees, </em>above cited, is in point. \u2014 See, also, <em>Read </em>vs. <em>Snell, </em>2 <em>Atkins, </em>642.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-8\">If this be the true construction of the devise, then the contingency is clearly within the limits above required; for it must have been determined on her arrival at the age of 21. If she had died after 21, without issue or never having had issue, the mother and aunt could not have claimed the estate ; because, to entitle them, (supposing <em>or </em>to be understood conjunctively,) she must have died without issue and before 21 years of age. If this construction be the correct one, this was then a good executory devise, upon the authority of <em>Collinson </em>vs. <em>Wright, Barker </em>vs. <em>Suretrees, </em>1 <em>Eq. Abr. </em>188, &amp;c. And the fee simple is complete on having issue, or attaining the age of 21 \u2014both of which happened in the present case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-9\">2. But if we admit that <em>or </em>shall not be understood conjunctively, but strictly as it is expressed, it is material to inquire what is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>import of the expression, <em>\u201cif she die before she have lawful heir of her body begotten.'\u201d </em>It is humbly presumed that the meaning cannot be <em>a general and indefinite failure of issue; </em>or, as <em>Hargrave </em>expresses it, <em>\u201c a failure of issue whensoever it may happen, be the time of the event ever so remote; </em>\u201d but is equivalent to saying, \u201c <em>if she die without having had, issue.\u201d </em>This is a contingency, therefore, which must be determined at the <em>time of her death. </em>It is not more indefinite or extensive than the words <em>\u201cdying without leaving issue at the time of his death,\u201d </em>or <em>\u201c without leaving issue behind him; </em>\u201d which are contingencies within the legal limits of executory devises, as appears by the case of <em>Porter </em>vs. <em>Bradley, </em>and several other cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-5\">3. Taking the whole devise together, the testator may be understood to mean a dying without issue, <em>living his wife. </em>This was collected, in <em>Porter </em>and <em>Bradley's </em>case, from - the general tenor of the will, and was not so expressed. It is so in several other cases, -t may be inferred that the testator meant, in the present devise, a dying without issue, <em>living his wife, </em>from his express provision that, notwithstanding the devise of a portion to his sister, his [ * 503 ] wife should enjoy the whole during her life. * This provision tends to prove that he did not, by the expression, contemplate or look forward to a general or indefinite failure of issue. If this idea be correct, then the devise is similar tc that in the case of <em>Pells </em>vs. <em>Brown, </em>and is good as an executory devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-6\">It appears, then, that \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-7\">1. The first part of the devise to the daughter is a devise in fee simple.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-8\">2. <em>Or </em>should be construed as <em>and; </em>in which case the contin gency would be determined on the daughter\u2019s arriving at the age of 21 years, or having issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-9\">3. If not so construed, the devise can at most import a dying <em>without having had issue, </em>which must be determined at her death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-10\">4.

Mass., </em>May T. 1833.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">In the case last referred to, there was a devise to A for her life, and at nor death to her second son, B, and to his lawfully begotten children, in fee simple forever, \u2014 but in case he should die without children lawfully begotten, to the oldest son of A, (C,) and to his lawfully begotten children, in fee simple forever. At the time of making the will, B had no children. Held, that he took a fee tail, with remainder to C, on an indefinite failure of issue of B. After stating and commenting upon the various points made in the cause, and the facts and authorities bearing upon them, the learned judge sums up the reasons of his decision in the following words . \u2014 \u201c In the present case there is an evident necessity of construing the words \u201cchildren,\" &amp;c., to mean issue or heirs of the body, and so words of limitation, and not of purchase, and that the estate of <em>James </em>is a fee tail, and not a fee simple. \u2014 First, because the children were not <em>in esse </em>at the time of making the will, and therefore could not take an immediate estate. Secondly, because, otherwise, if children were born and died in the lifetime of <em>James, </em>leaving issue, they would be excluded, whereas the words \u201cfee simple \u201d show that an interest was intended to the issue. Thirdly, because, if children, in the devise, were to be construed to mean, not the whole class of issue, but strictly children of <em>James, descriptions personarum </em>living at his death, then the devise over would be defeated if <em>James </em>should die leaving children, who should afterwards die without issue, which plainly could not have been intended. Fourthly, because, if the devise over be, as in my judgment it is, upon an indefinite failure of issue, then as an ex-ecutory devise it is too remote and void, but as a remainder after a fee tail it is good. And I would add that it is a clear rule of law, that every limitation is to be construed to take effect by way of remainder, if it may, and not by way of executory devise, unless it be unavoidable, to carry the intention into effect. My judgment is, that the words and the intent of the testatrix manifestly require'the estate of <em>James </em>to be a fee tail, with a remainder to <em>George.\u201d</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
