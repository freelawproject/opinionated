The jury returned a verdict for the plain tiff, subject to the opinion of the Court on this question, whether the father, as natural guardian, has a right to lease the independent estate of the minor, for years, without being appointed by the judge of probate, and giving bonds ; the minor being under the age of fourteen years, the lease being for seven years, and to continue till the minor should arrive to the age of eighteen years. After the minor arrived at the age of fourteen years, she made choice of a guardian, who was duly appointed, and by whom she brings this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-11\">At this term, to which the cause had been referred for argument, there was no appearance for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-12\"><em>T.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZe\">The question is, whether the father, as natural guardian of an infant, has authority to make a lease of the infant's land. Having conferred together, and examined the * authorities which have been cited at the bar, we are [ * 56 j unanimously of opinion that he has no such authority, and especially considering the provisions of our statute respecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>guardians, which require them to give bonds, &amp;c. In the Court of Chancery, bond is required of a natural guardian, when a legacy given to his child is ordered to be paid over to him by the executors of the will. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> <em>Strickland </em>vs. <em>Hudson, Mason &amp; Ux. </em>In that case the lord chancellor said, \u201c The master of the rolls, who had had longer experience than himself, would never allow a child\u2019s legacy to be paid to the father or mother, upon any security whatever, by reason of the strife and dispute it might occasion in the family.\u2019'</p>\n<p id=\"AS1\">The lease, in this case, being considered void, the judgment of the Court is, that the plaintiff recover her seisin and possession of the land demanded.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b58-5\"> 3 <em>Rep. in Chancery.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b58-6\"><em> </em>Vide <em>Snook </em>vs. Sutton, 5 <em>Hals. </em>133.\u2014 <em>Truss </em>vs. <em>Old, 6 Randolph, R. </em>556. \u2014 <em>Ross </em>vs. <em>Gill &amp; Ux. </em>1 <em>Wash. </em>87 <em>\u2014Jackson </em>vs. <em>Combs, </em>7 <em>Cowen, </em>36. \u2014 <em>Vandoren </em>vs. <em>Everitt, 2 South. </em>460.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">By the law of <em>England, </em>a guardian in saccage is considered not only as having an authority to lease the infant\u2019s lands, but as having himself an interest therein; as <em>quasi dominus pro </em>tempore; so that he may make leases in his own name, which may be confirmed or avoided by the ward upon his coming of age. \u2014 <em>Shopland </em>vs. <em>Ryoler, Cro.
