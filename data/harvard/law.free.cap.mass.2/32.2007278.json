Asa Nichols &amp; Al., and Oliver W. Champney, <em>versus </em>Same.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b37-9\">An endorser of a promissory note, after a verdict obtained against him by the endorsee, and before judgment, cannot be sued as the trustee of the endorsee under the statute of February 28, 1795.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-10\">The question in these actions was, whether <em>Tuckerman </em>could be held as the trustee of <em>Healy, </em>by force of the statute of this com monwealth, passed February 28, 1795, entitled, <em>\u201cAn Act to enable creditors to receive their just demands out of the goods, effects, and credits, of their debtors, when the same cannot be attached by the ordinary process of law.\u201d </em>The facts appear, in <em>Tuckerman\u2019s </em>answer to the usual interrogatory, as follows: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-11\">The said <em>Tuckerman </em>makes answer that, on the 5th day of January, A. D. 1797, <em>Amasa Penniman </em>made his note of hand of that date, whereby he promised the said <em>Tuckerman </em>to pay him, <em>or order, </em>1075 dollars, in sixty days after date, with interest after; which note said <em>Tuckerman </em>endorsed to <em>William Healy, </em>and the said <em>Healy </em>endorsed the same to <em>John Haskins. </em>That, on the 1st day of August, 1801, said <em>Healy </em>sued said <em>Tuckerman, </em>in which suit said <em>Healy </em>set forth, in his declaration, that he had paid said <em>Haskins </em>(who was the last endorsee) the amount of said note. That action was tried at the Supreme Judicial Court at <em>Boston, </em>March term, 1804, and a verdict was obtained against said <em>Tuckerman </em>for 1528 dollars and 29 cents. That, before the said verdict was obtained against him, <em>viz., </em>on the 13th day of December, 1803, the said <em>Tuckerman </em>was summoned as the trustee of the said <em>Healy, </em>at suit of <em>Asa Nichols ; </em>and also before the said verdict was obtained aforesaid, <em>viz., </em>on the 11th day of January, 1804, the said <em>Tucker-man </em>was summoned as trustee of said <em>Healy, </em>at the suit of <em>Oliver W. Champney. </em>That, after the said verdict was obtained as afore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>said, and before judgment was rendered thereon, <em>viz., </em>on the 15th day of March, 1804, the said <em>Tuckerman </em>was summoned, as the trustee of the said <em>Healy, </em>at the suit of <em>James Eunson. </em>The said action of <em>Healy </em>vs. <em>Tuckerman </em>has been continued from term to term, and no judgment has yet been rendered on the said [ * 33 ] * verdict, by reason of the said <em>Tuckerman\u2019s </em>being so summoned, as aforesaid. Upon the foregoing statement of facts, the said <em>Tuckerman </em>submits himself,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-5\"><em>Selfridge </em>and <em>Phillips, </em>of counsel for <em>Nichols </em>and <em>Champney,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae6\">would have argued that <em>Tuckerman </em>should be adjudged the trustee of <em>Healy </em>in those actions. But the Court inclined to hear an argument on behalf of <em>Eunson, </em>and suggested that it would be,in season, after the difficulties on their minds in his case were removed, to attend to the question as it related to the other plaintiffs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-6\"><em>W. Sullivan </em>contended, in behalf of <em>Eunson, </em>that <em>Tuckerman,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoq\">on the answers he had given, was not the trustee of <em>Healy </em>in <em>the </em>suits of <em>Nichols 8f Ad. </em>and <em>Champney, </em>but that he <em>was </em>trustee of <em>Healy </em>in <em>Eunson\u2019s </em>suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-7\">He stated, in support of his positions, the analogy between the proceedings under our trustee law, and the process of foreign attachment, by the custom of <em>London, </em>and some other places; and cited 1 <em>Com. Dig. </em>title <em>Attachment, Letter </em>A, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> that the practice under the first trustee act <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> was to attach money due on bond, note, or account, as well as goods, (notwithstanding the expressions in the act be \u201c trusted or deposited,\u201d) to the same effect as attachments are made under the before-mentioned custom ; that the first section of the law passed February, 1795, is so comprehensive in its terms as to render every species of personal property liable to attachment, when \u201c deposited or intrusted \u201d in the hands of others. The practice under this law, as well as under the former one, has been to construe these words as meaning any legal or equitable accountability for money, or any personal property, and not a mere custody. By any other construction the remedial effects of this act might be entirely defeated, and property might easily be placed beyond the reach of creditors ; such construction of the law is supported by the eleventh section, giving a right against the executors and administrators of trustees, dying pending the process. [ * 34 ] * If these grounds are tenable, <em>Tuckerman </em>must be trustee upon the answer he has given, unless his relation-snip to <em>Healy can be </em>brought within the twelfth <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> section of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>statute. He became debtor to <em>Healy </em>because he had endorsed a negotiable security. When <em>Nichols &amp;r AL, </em>and <em>Champney, </em>made their attachments, his answer would have been that he was party in <em>such a </em>security; that whether he was or was not liable to pay money in consequence of being such party depended on legal decision ; that he did not consider himself liable, and consequently not trustee. When <em>Eunson </em>attached, this decision had been had; the note had ceased\" to be negotiable; it was on the files of this Court as the basis of a verdict in which all parties acquiesced. The respondent does not complain, in his answer, that the verdict was wrong; he expresses no intention to arrest judgment, review, or alter, in any respect, the state of the case. He says that j\u2019udgment had been delayed merely on account of these attachments; implying that otherwise he should have paid the money to <em>Healy. </em>This is then a fund in <em>Tuckerman\u2019s </em>hands, which will undoubtedly go to <em>Healy, </em>unless it can be otherwise applied under this attachment. If a j\u2019udgment in <em>Healy\u2019s </em>action vs. <em>Tuckerman </em>be necessary to perfect <em>Eunson\u2019s </em>right, the Court have power over this, and may order the judgment to be entered, as of the term when the verdict was returned. \u2022 It is presumed the justice of the case would warrant the exercise of this power.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b39-5\"><em>Eunson </em>relics,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3U\">in support of his claim, that, by the words \u201c goods, effects, and credits,\u201d every species of personal property is intended ; that by \u201cintrusted and deposited \u201d any possession or accountability is intended ; and that, after verdict, <em>Tuckerman </em>had in his hands a fund belonging to <em>Healy </em>which was not within the twelfth section of the statute respecting negotiable securities.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b38-10\"> 1 <em>Rol. </em>551, c. 50, <em>Com.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGf\">The question arising out of the facts stated by <em>Tuckerman </em>in his answer, and which has been argued at the bar, *is whether a person, who has endorsed a neg\u00f3- [ *35 ] tiable promissory note, can be held, in virtue of such endorsement, as the trustee of the endorsee ? The words of the statute are plain and comprehensive. But it has been argued that the verdict, which <em>Healy </em>has obtained in an action brought by him against <em>Tuckerman </em>on the note, has changed the relation of these parties, and has given to <em>Eunson\u2019s </em>attachment, which was made after the verdict, a preference to those made in the other cases before the verdict. But the Court think otherwise ; and are unanimously agreed that, from the strong language of the statute, they cannot adjudge <em>Tuckerman </em>to be the trustee of <em>Healy, </em>in <em>Eunson\u2019s </em>action, upon the facts stated. The same language applies with less iloubt to the two other cases. We aive no opinion what would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>have been the effect, if a judgment had been rendered upon the verdict prior to the making of the attachment. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\n<em>Trustee discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b40-6\"><em> Prescott </em>vs. <em>Parker, </em>4 <em>Mass.
