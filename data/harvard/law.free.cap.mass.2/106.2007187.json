Cushman <em>versus </em>Oliver Loker.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b103-12\">A, holding B\u2019s note, delivers it to C to collect; C, for a valuable consideration, sells it to D, who receives from B the money due; C afterwards gives A his own note for the amount A\u2019s acceptance of C\u2019s note is a confirmation of the transaction.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AA6\">In an action by A against D for the money received by him of B, C is a competent witness.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-13\">This was an action of <em>assumpsit </em>for money had and received, which was tried before <em>Sewatt, </em>J., at an adjourned session in December last, when a verdict was rendered for the defendant. It appeared in evidence, on the part of the plaintiff, that he' had a note against one <em>Willington, </em>on which there was due to the plaintiff, from <em>W., </em>the sum of 89 dollars \u2014 cents; that the plaintiff delivered said note to one <em>Clement Smith, </em>to collect the sum due thereon for his, the plaintiff\u2019s, use. The note, not appearing to be endorsed by the plaintiff, came into the hands of <em>Loker, </em>the defendant, who pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>sented the same to <em>W., </em>received the amount due thereon, and delivered it up to <em>W., </em>to be cancelled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\">The defendant then offered <em>Smith, </em>as a witness, to prove that the note was sold by him to <em>Loker </em>for a valuable consideration, and that he, <em>Smith, </em>afterwards gave his note to <em>Cushman </em>in satisfaction therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-6\">The plaintiff objected to <em>Smith\u2019s </em>being admitted as a witness, on the ground that he was interested to procure <em>Loker\u2019s </em>discharge from this demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-7\">The objection being overruled by the Court, <em>Smith </em>testified that he sold the note to <em>Loker, </em>and received payment in cattle; [ * 107 ] * that he told <em>Loker </em>it was put into his hands to collect, but did not tell him for whom he was to collect it; that immediately after so selling the note, and oefore he saw <em>Cushman, </em>he became insolvent, and had remained so ever since. After <em>Cushman </em>had become acquainted with these facts, he received from <em>Smith </em>his note for the amount of <em>W.\u2019s </em>note, and for the trouble <em>Cushman </em>had had in endeavoring to obtain satisfaction from <em>W. </em>This last note had never been paid, nor any part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-8\">The judge directed the jury that, if they believed <em>Smith\u2019s </em>testimony, the giving of said note by him to <em>Cushman, </em>as aforesaid, did, in his opinion, discharge <em>Loker </em>from the liability he was under by law to refund to the plaintiff the money received by him of <em>W., </em>as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-9\">To this direction of the judge, and the admission of <em>Smith </em>as a witness, the plaintiff filed his exceptions. And now <em>Leavitt, </em>in support of the exceptions, contended, first, that <em>Smith </em>was not a competent witness, because, if the plaintiff succeeds in this suit, he <em>(Smith) </em>will be liable to the action of <em>Loker </em>for the value paid by him to <em>Smith </em>for the note, and perhaps for other special damages. The vendor of a personal chattel with warranty is not a competent witness to support the right of the vendee. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> There was an implied warranty, on the part of <em>Smith, </em>that he had a right to sell the note to <em>Loker; </em>for the law always implies that the seller of a personal chattel warrants that the commodity he sells is his own, or that he has a right to sell it; and this implied warranty in all cases extends to the title of the thing sold, though not always to the quality and soundness of it. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-10\"><em>Secondly. </em>The direction <em>of </em>the judge as to the effect of the note given by <em>Smith </em>to <em>Cushman </em>was wrong.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-11\">Where a simple contract debt is due, the giving a note therefor by the debtor himself is no extinguishment or alteration of the debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>till payment. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> In such case, the giving of a bond by a third person is no extinguishment of the debt. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> And if the creditor, in such case, receive the note of a third person in * payment, yet if the note turns out to be of no value, [ * 108 ] it is no payment, and he may resort to his original demand. <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> From these authorities it is inferred that the mere giving the note, by <em>Smith, </em>did not exonerate <em>Loker </em>from his responsibility. <em>Loker </em>can have'no advantage of this, until the note is paid, it is, at most, nothing more than an accord, which, without satisfaction, is no bar.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-5\">\n<em>Taylor,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALy\">on the other side. The plaintiff\u2019s claim rests on the ground that his agent had exceeded his authority in selling a note intrusted to him for collection only. But the giving the note by <em>Smith </em>to <em>Cushman, </em>and the acceptance of it by the latter, were a full confirmation of the transaction. That <em>Smith </em>was a very competent witness, he cited <em>Benjamin </em>vs. <em>Porteous. </em><footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark> Every broker is to be received as a witness relative to his own transactions, as between buyer and seller.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b104-12\"> <em>Bushby </em>vs. <em>Greenslate, </em>1 <em>Str. </em>445.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"AjK\"> 3 <em>Black.

But after full notice of the transaction, and after <em>Smith\u2019s </em>failure, he considered him as his debtor for the amount of <em>W\u2019s. </em>note, and also charged him with the expenses he had been at in endeavoring to obtain satisfaction from <em>W., </em>and took <em>Smith\u2019s </em>note for the payment.
