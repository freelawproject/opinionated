Because it is not alleged, in the indictment, that the said supposed conspiracy was entered into for the purpose of procuring an indictment, or any other legal process, criminal or civil, against any person. <em>2. </em>Because it is not alleged that any charge or accusation, in the form of any legal process, was made in pursuance of said supposed conspiracy. 3. Because it is alleged, in the indictment, that the goods therein mentioned were, by the said <em>Tibbetts, </em>deposited under the floor of <em>one Rollings\u2019s dwelling-house, or barn, </em>without specifying which.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-6\"><em>Wilde, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7p\">as to the first two points, read from 1 <em>Hawkins\u2019s </em>Pleas of the Crown, c. <em>12, </em>sect. 1, &amp;c., to show that it is a necessary ingredient, in a conspiracy of the kind charged in this indictment, that there should be at least an intent falsely to <em>indict. </em>As to the third point, he cited <em>2 Hawkins, </em>c. <em>25, </em>sect. 58, 83, that an indictment charging a man disjunctively is void. And no indictment can be good without expressly showing some place wherein the offence was committed. The charge in this case is as uncertainly laid as if it had been alleged in the town of A, or the town of B. This is one of the overt acts charged to prove the existence of a conspiracy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-7\">* <em>The Solicitor-General</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AF7\">contended that the conspiracy [ * 537 ] is the gist of the offence, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> and that is charged, in this indictment, in technical form; so also is one overt act, <em>viz., </em>the accusation in the hearing of divers citizens. The particular mode of expression, in the indictment, which gave occasion for the third cause of arresting the judgment, suggested by the defendant, arose from the circumstance of <em>Rollings\u2019s </em>dwelling in the same building with his cattle, and the <em>Solicitor-General </em>was in doubt which of the tenants should give name to the tenement. But this may be rejected as surplusage, and there will be left abundantly enough to support a judgment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-8\"><em>Wilde, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3P\">observed that, admitting that a naked conspiracy is an indictable offence, still, when an overt act is changed, it ought to be well and sufficiently alleged; since, if it is not a distinct offence, it will be considered by the Court as calling for a more severe sentence, just as much as if it were a distinct and separate crime charged in the indictment.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b481-10\"> <em>Commonwealth </em>vs. <em>Judd M. </em>ante, 329, and the authorities there cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b481-9\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Arn\"><em>Nathaniel Tibbetts </em>having been found guilty, a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>is made to arrest the judgment; and these exceptions are taken to the indictment. <em>First. </em>That it is not alleged that the supposed conspiracy was entered into for the purpose of procuring any indictment, or any process, civil or criminal, against any person; and, secondly, that it is not alleged that any process was sued out in pursuance of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">We are of opinion that these exceptions are insufficient. A conspiracy to charge any person with a crime, and, in pursuance of the conspiracy, falsely to affirm that he is guilty, is an indictable offence, without procuring any legal process. The cases of <em>The Queen </em>vs. <em>Best, </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> <em>Rex </em>vs. <em>Kinnersley &amp; Al., </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> and <em>Rex </em>vs. <em>Rispal, </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> are in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The third exception is, that it is alleged in the indictment that the goods therein mentioned were, in pursuance of the conspiracy, deposited under <em>Rollings\u2019s </em>dwelling-house, <em>or barn, </em>without specifying which.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">[*538 ] *If this allegation were essential in the indictment, and a constituent part of the offence charged, the uncertainty of it might require further deliberation. But we are of opinion that the conspiracy is the gist of the offence charged, and that the placing of the goods is mere matter of aggravation. If the jury had found the defendant not guilty of depositing the goods any where, but had found him guilty of the conspiracy, this would have been a sufficient finding on which to render judgment against, him. The uncertainty of the place of deposit must be' considered as immaterial. To this point, besides the cases before cited, we add, <em>Rex </em>vs. <em>Spragg &amp; Al., </em><footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> <em>Rex </em>vs. <em>Kimberley &amp; North, </em><footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark> and <em>Rex </em>vs. <em>Robinson. </em><footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">After considering the several exceptions, we are satisfied that the indictment is sufficient, and that <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APY\">\n<em>Judgment ought not to be arrested.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b482-10\"> Lord <em>Raym. </em>1169. \u2014 6 <em>Mod. </em>185, S.
