It appeared, by a statement of facts agreed in the case, that the plaintiff was born Jan. 10, 1802; that on the 28th of June, 1803, the said <em>Paul </em>and <em>Deborah </em>intermarried, and cohabited until Sept. 1, 1804, during which time the plaintiff lived with them. On the last-mentioned day the said <em>Deborah </em>left her husband\u2019s house, and carried the plaintiff with her, always allowing the said <em>Paul </em>to be his putative father. In February, 1805, a decree of divorce was had, dissolving the bonds of matrimony between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-7\">If, upon this state of facts, the Court should be of opinion that 'the defendant had legal right to detain the said <em>Charles </em>in her custody, it was agreed that the plaintiff should become nonsuit, otherwise the defendant was to be defaulted, and judgment in either case to be entered accordingly.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-8\"><em>S. Strong, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE3\">contended that, by the marriage of these parties, the guardianship of this infant passed, with other chattel interests in possession, to the husband, and that, after the divorce, they all remained with him, except only such part as may have been awarded to the wife as alimony. The husband having, by the marriage, become entitled to the guardianship of the child during infancy, the divorce had not destroyed his right. There is no difference between the case of the present plaintiff, and that of legitimate children, who always remain in the custody of the father after a divorce. So also do children of the wife by a former husband. <em>Strong </em>observed that, at a former argument of this cause, he had produced some authorities in support of his positions, but the hearing having come on at this time unexpectedly, he had not his minutes in Court, and his recollection did not enable him to refer to them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-9\">[ * 110 ] <em>* Bliss, </em>who was to have argued for the defendant, was stopped by the Court.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b106-11-pl-split\">Sewall, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1U\">The rights of the putative father are not brought into question by this process. The case, as it stands on the record, gives occasion to the single inquiry only, whether this infant shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>oe in the care and custody of his mother, or set loose in the world without restraint or protection. On such a question I cannot hesitate in my opinion that the plaintiff should become nonsuit.</p>\n<author id=\"b107-5\">Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ada\">So.far as respects these parties, the question is, singly, whether a mother has a right to the custody of her natural child. I have no conception that an infant, in the arms of its mother, can be considered as \u201c imprisoned, confined, or held in duress,\u201d within the intention of the framers of the statute which prescribes this writ. The marriage of the natural parents gave to the husband, in a certain degree, a right to the custody of the child. But the divorce, which dissolved the marriage, annulled that right, and the child remained with the mother in .the same manner, and under the same right, as before the marriage.</p>\n<author id=\"b107-6\">Parsons, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADe\">As the putative father has undertaken the pros ecution of this action, I am disposed to consider his claims to the custody of the plaintiff as if they were regularly before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">In legal contemplation, a bastard is generally considered as the relative of no one. But, to provide for his support and education, the mother has a right to the custody and control of him, and is bound to maintain him, <em>as his natural guardian. </em>In a moral view, he is considered as the child of his mother so far, that their intermarriage is unlawful, and any sexual intercourse between them would be incestuous. And the stat. 4 and 5 <em>Ph. &amp; M. </em>c. 8, against carrying off and marrying maidens not sixteen years of age, has, for the protection of the child, been considered as extending to a not ural daughter, in fact under the care of the putative father. The natural guardianship of the mother devolves on her husband on the marriage, in the same manner as an executorship or a guardianship derived from * the authority of the Probate [*111 ] Court; and the husband\u2019s power, depending on the marriage, ceases on its dissolution. It is not like the right to the wife\u2019s chattels, which by the marriage are vested in the husband, and survive to him. Whether a putative father, from whose actual custody and care his natural daughter has been unlawfully taken by a stranger, can maintain a writ <em>de homine rephgiando </em>to regain his custody, is a question different from the present. Perhaps he is within the reason of the case of <em>Rex </em>vs. <em>Cornforth &amp; Al., </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> but it is unnecessary now to determine this question. As to the right of the present plaintiff, I concur with my brethren. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b107-9\"> 2 Stra. 1162.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b107-10\"> <em>Somerset </em>vs. <em>Dighton, </em>12 <em>Mass.
