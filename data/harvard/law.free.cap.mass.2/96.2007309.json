The trustee further stated, that he had understood by common report, and that it was spoken of as a matter of general notoriety in the place where both the parties live, that the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>notes had been assigned to a third person for a valuable consideration before he, the trustee, was summoned in this action.
