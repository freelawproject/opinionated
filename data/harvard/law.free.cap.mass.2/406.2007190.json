The declaration contained three counts. The first alleges that the plaintiff is a constable of the town of <em>Boston, </em>and that the defendant, <em>\u201c </em>contriving and maliciously intending to hurt, injure, and degrade, the plaintiff in his aforesaid good name, character, and reputation, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>in his said office, and to cause it to be believed that he had acted unjustly, deceitfully, and dishonorably, in his said office, and to subject him to the pains and penalties by the laws of this commonwealtn provided against those who commit any kind of cheating, deceit, or fraud,\u2014did, in the presence of divers good citizens, in a certain discourse of and concerning the plaintiff, in his said office, falsely and maliciously speak and publish these false, scandalous, and defamatory words of and concerning the plaintiff, so being a constable of the town as aforesaid, <em>viz., he </em>(meaning the plaintiff) <em>is a swindler, </em>(meaning thereby that the plaintiff, under color of his office, had conspired with others for the purpose of deceiving, cheating, and defrauding, and had acted unjustly, deceitfully, and dishonestly, in his said office.\u201d) The second count lays the same words as spoken of the plaintiff, without reference to [ * 407 ] his office. * The third count alleges that the defendant, \u201c with the malicious intention and contrivance aforesaid, and for the several purposes aforesaid, did falsely and maliciously, openly and publicly, charge the plaintiff with swindling, in the presence and hearing of the good citizens aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-5\">After trial before <em>Parlcer, </em>J., at the last November term, and a verdict for the plaintiff, the defendant moved in arrest of judgment, for that the words laid in the declaration are not actionable.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-6\"><em>Heard, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7\">contended that, from all the authorities, it was not actionable to call a man <em>a cheat </em>unless he is a trader, and the words are spoken of him in relation to his trade. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> <em>Swindler </em>is a word lately come into use, and is synonymous with <em>cheat. </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> This can have no relation to the defendant\u2019s office of constable. It is never applied to any one but a trader or dealer. As a constable, his whole duty is to execute and return such precepts as are delivered to him. But if the first two counts are sufficient, it will be impossible to support the third, which contains a naked charge of <em>swindling, </em>without any reference to his office, and the damages being given on the whole declaration, if one of the counts is bad, judgment cannot be rendered. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-7\">\n<em>Everett,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2c\">on the other side, insisted that none of the cases' cited by the opposite counsel militated with the general principle, that words are actionable which expose a man to legal punishment. Formerly it was held that no words were actionable but such as, if true, would endanger the person\u2019s life ; but later authorities are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>otherwise, and at this day any words which endanger a man in law are actionable. .The principles of law remain fixed, although new words are introduced into the common language of the coun try, or ancient words change their signification. Thus, heretofore, <em>lenave </em>was merely a diminutive term, tantamount to <em>lad </em>or <em>boy, </em>but now it is used as a term of harsh reproach. <em>Villain </em>formerly meant no more than one employed in rustic labors, but it is now a word of strong opprobrium.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-5\">* A swindler is defined by the best lexicographer, [ * 408 j <em>\u201c </em>one who cheats under pretence of trade ; \u201d \u201c one who gets or procures money under false pretences.\u201d We have a statute which provides that persons convicted of any gross frauds or cheats may, at the discretion of this Court, be sentenced to seven years\u2019 confinement to hard labor. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> To call a man a cheat is, then, actionable, as it exposes him to a prosecution, the issue of which may be so severe.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-6\">And this charge of cheating may well apply to the improper exercise of the constable\u2019s office. Part of the duty of that office is to attach the goods of debtors, upon mesne process, and to sell them at auction upon execution. He may, in performing these services, be guilty of many cheats and fraudulent practices ; as, for instance, entering false prices of the articles he sells, by which either the debtor, the creditor, or the purchaser, might be cheated</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\"> <em>Ludwell </em>vs. <em>Hole, </em>2 Lord <em>Ray. </em>1417. \u2014 <em>Savage </em>vs. <em>Robury, </em>5 <em>Mod, </em>398.\u20142 <em>Salk. </em>694, S.

The words \u201c swindler, swindling,\u201d &amp;c., have been very lately adopted into the <em>English </em>language, and are as yet of indefinite meaning; and it is sufficient to determine the question before the Court that they do not, with certainty, import an indictable offence. These terms were imported into this country from <em>England, </em>and into that from <em>Germany. </em>In their passage hither, when first used in the <em>English </em>language, and before they became naturalized here, they obtained a meaning, and what that meaning was, we learn from the report of the case' of <em>Savile </em>vs. <em>Jardine, </em>by which it appears that the word <em>\u201cswindler </em>means no more than <em>cheat; cheat </em>has always been holden \u201cnot to be actionable, and <em>swindler </em>means no more.\u201d We may safely, I think, consider that as the meaning of the word; and if so, this case is brought within the authority of several of the cases which have been cited, and which have always been considered as good law. Whatever, then, might have been our judgment, if the first two counts only had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>been in the declaration, we are all satisfied that for the insufficiency of the third, the judgment must be arrested. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\n<em>Judgment arrested.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b368-6\"><em> </em>Vide <em>Harding vs. Brooks, 5 Pick. </em>244.\u2014 <em>Turner </em>vs. <em>Horton, Willes, </em>438.\u2014] <em>Saund. </em>246.\u20142 <em>Saund. </em>307, <em>a; </em>notes, 5th ed.\u2014 <em>Chaddock </em>vs. <em>Briggs, </em>13 <em>Mass Rep. </em>248.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
