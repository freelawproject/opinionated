Cony.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b469-10\">Tne receiving a negotiable promissory note by an officer, for fees not due, will not support an indictment for extortion.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-11\">The indictment charges that the defendant, being a deputy sheriff of this county, with force and arms, by color of his office, did wilfully and corruptly demand and receive of one <em>Joseph Clif ford, </em>for the service of a certain execution against the said <em>Clifford, </em>and wherein one <em>Theophilus Hamblin </em>was the creditor, a greater fee for the service of the said execution than by law was provided, <em>viz., </em>9 dollars and 17 cents, when in fact there was due to him no more than 1 dollar and 2 cents, \u2014against the form of the statute, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-12\">Upon not guilty pleaded, the jury found the defendant guilty. The verdict was taken subject to the opinion of the Court upon the report of Judge <em>Sewall, </em>before whom the cause was tried, respecting certain matters of law arising therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-13\">The principal question arising in the cause was, whether a negotiable promissory note given by the judgment debtor to the officer for his fees, payment of which was not proved, would support this indictment, which charged him with extortiously receiving money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-14\">It was contended by <em>the defendant\u2019s counsel </em>that, the note being a void promise, as made without any consideration, or for an illegal one, it was not a payment of money so as to support a charge for extortion. It was attempted also to show some variance between the sums charged by the indictment to have been received, and the sum which appeared, by the report of the judge, to have been actually secured by the promissory note ; and it was contended that</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>by such variance the defendant might be exposed to another indictment for the same offence, to which this conviction would not be pleadable in bar. But this objection was not much relied on.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b470-5\">\n<em>The Solicitor-General</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxgC\">observed that this practice of taking negotiable notes for illegal fees was growing very frequent in this part of the state, and was becoming very oppressive. It was therefore extremely desirable that, by the animadversion of the Court, it should, if possible, be checked.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b470-11\"><em>Wilde </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AIF\">* <em>By the Court.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ARQC\">It is our opinion, after considera tian, that the evidence does not support the indictment. The defendant is charged with extortiously receiving 9 dollars and 17 cents; but the receipt of a negotiable note, by which that sum is promised to be paid, is not. the receipt of money. The statute on which the indictment is drawn, commonly called the Fee Bill, provides for the payment of certain fees for the services therein de scribed, and prohibits the wilful and corrupt taking of greater fees, under the penalty of 30 dollars. If the indictment had conformed to the evidence, we should have doubted whether the statute would have been pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">To constitute extortion at common law, there must be the receipt of money, or of some other thing of value. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> This note, when made, was <em>ipso facto </em>void, the consideration of it being illegal, and it was consequently of no value.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">If this statute should be revised, it would deserve consideration whether it would not be proper to extend the penalty of extortion to the unlawful receiving any promise or security for the payment of fees not allowed, agreeably to the provision of 27 <em>Eliz. </em>c. 6, and further, to make such promise or security, like a usurious contract, absolutely void, so that the party injured might be protected against even an innocent endorsee. <footnotemark><em>(a</em>)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">\n<em>Let the verdict be set aside, and a new trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b470-12\"> <em>Co.
