Neither of the notes described in the indictment is within the description given by this section, as it is alleged that the defendant well knew that no such banks existed as are named in the indictment. Therefore, if the indictment had concluded against the statute, it could not have been maintained; and it would be doing violence to all the rules of construing penal statutes, to extend the provisions of the 7th section to the notes described in this indictment. The allegations amount only to an intention to cheat, which at common law is not indictable, and the indictment does not conclude against any statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\n<em>The defendant was discharged,.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
