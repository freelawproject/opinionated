Upon his appearing in Court, it was perceived that he was under age, and the Court expressed doubts of his capacity to take upon him the obligations of citizenship.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-11\">\n<em>Thatcher.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKHP\">All the statutes respecting this subject of naturalization make use of the words \u201c all free white persons,\u201d and of no others. This expression certainly includes minors, and there is nothing in any of the statutes that excludes them. The statute of April, 1802, prescribes two methods by which a minor * may have the benefits of naturalization; and when a [ * 420 ] statute makes a grant of a right of privilege, it virtually annuls all such disabilities as would prevent the operation of the grant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b377-12\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A4p\">By <em>\u201c </em>person,\u201d in these statutes, must be understood a person capable of contracting the obligation of allegiance. It would be a dangerous precedent. Our whole authority to admit aliens to the rights of citizenship being derived from the statutes of the <em>United States, </em>we must find it there, or we cannot exercise it. To enable an infant to annul his obligations of allegiance to his native sovereign, and enter into new ones to the <em>United States, </em>the provision ought to be express. But we find no such provision. The petitioner can take nothing by his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\"><em>The Chief Justice </em>suggested that, if a petition was offered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>parent or legal guardian of a minor, it might present the subject to the Court in a different view. \"</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\"><em>Note. </em>\u2014 After this decision, <em>Thatcher </em>sued out a letter of guai dianship for this minor, and presented a petition for his naturalization, which was- granted by <em>Sedgwick, </em>J., then sitting alone in Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
