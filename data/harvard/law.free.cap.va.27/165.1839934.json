The <em>Culpeper Agricultural fy Manufacturing Society </em>brought an action of debt against <em>William H. Digges </em>and <em>Whiting Digges, </em>who were the obligors in a note under seal, executed to the \u201c President and Managers of the Culpeper Agricultural and Manufacturing Society.\u201d The Declaration avers that the said note was executed to the. <em>Plaintiffs, </em>by the name and style of \u201cThe President and Managers of,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-10\">The Writ was executed and appearance bail given The Defendants appeared, without having, given special bail, and pleaded, that the Plaintiffs were an unehartered Bank, and therefore an illegal company; to which plea the Plaintiffs replied generally, and issue was joined. The Defendants afterwards demurred, and the Plaintiffs joined in demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u00d3n the demurrer, the Court gave Judgment for the Defendants, and the Plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pAzt\"><em>Harri. o x, </em>for the Appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXh\">objected, <em>first, </em>to the Defendants' being pcim tted to appear and plead, without having given special-hail. <em>Secondly, </em>that the error in the style of the Corporation in the bond, is not such an one as to debar the Plaintiffs from suing in their proper corporate name. For this, he cited 10 <em>Co. Rep. </em>125; 11 Co. <em>Rep. </em>19, 20, 21; 2 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>5, <em>tit. \u201cCorporation;\u201d College of Physicians v. Dr. Salmon, </em>Ld. Raym 680; <em>Sidney College </em>v. -, 1 <em>Wils. </em>184; <em>Dutch East India Company </em>v. <em>Henriquez, </em>Ld. Raym. 612; <em>Mayor, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Blamire, </em>8 East, 492.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-8\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the Appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALG\">contended, that the variance here was material. 2 <em>Com. Dig. </em>298, <em>tit. \u201cCapacity.\u201d B. </em>5. The addition of a name is material. <em>Croydon Hosptal </em>v. <em>Farley, </em>6 Taunt, Rep. 467. As to the Defendants\u2019 being allowed to plead without bail, the objection was waived by the plea and issue, and the bail, both common and special, were discharged. If the Plaintiff objected to this proceeding, he ought to have objected at the time; and <em>if </em>his objection was overruled, he ought to have excepted.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b135-9\"><em>March </em>4.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A-T\">Judge Gkeen</author>\n<p id=\"AFo\">delivered his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">The objection now taken by the Appellants, that the Appellees were improperly permitted to appear, plead and demur, without giving special bail, was waived by the Appellants\u2019 taking issue on the plea, and joining in the demurrer, without making this objeclion in terms; and the appearance bail was thereby discharged, as was decided in <em>Grays </em>v. <em>Hines, 4 </em>Munf. 437. The appearance of the Defendants, and pleading without giving special bail, super-ceded the issue joined upon the plea put in by the bail for their appearance, and rendered it null. In strictness, perhaps, it ought to have been set aside; but, the omission to do so, is no error to the injury of the Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">The Declaration alleges, that the Plaintiffs were incorporpted by the name of \u201cThe Culpeper Agricultural and Manufacturing Society;\u201d and avers that the Defendants executed their obligation to <em>them, </em>by the name <em>of </em>\u201cThe President and Managers of the Culpeper Agricultural and Manufacturing Society;\u201d and upon a demurrer to this Declaration, the question is, whether such an averment can be made, against the terms of the obligation as described in the Declaration? if it can, then, instead of demurring, the Defendants should have pleaded, that certain persons by name, were \u201cThe President and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Managers of the Society,\u201d and that the bond was made and delivered to those persons individually, and traversed this averment in the Declaration. For, by demurring, they admit the averment to be {rue, if it is competent to the Plaintiffs to make it. This averment might, I think, be well made. Although a Corporation cannot sue but in its true name, contracts may be made by and with it, by a mistaken name, if the mistake be only <em>in syllubis el </em>verbis, and not <em>in sensu el 're ipsa, </em>as is said by the Court in the case of <em>The Mayor and Burgesses of Lynn Regis, </em>10 Co. 125; and such a mistake may be averred in pleading, or shown in evidence, upon the general issue. <em>Ibid, </em>and <em>Gilb. Hist. C. B. </em>179, <em>Cap, </em>17, cited 6 <em>Vin. Abr. </em>320 If some words are added to or omitted in, the true name of a Corporation, this is not a fatal variance, if there be enough to distinguish the Corporation from all others and to show, that the Corporation claiming, or against which a claim is asserted, was intended; of which many examples are given in the case cited from <em>Coke\u2019s Reports.</em></p>\n<p id=\"pAt70\">If, in case, bond had been given to <em>(\u2018dl. </em>B., President, and <em>C. D., </em>Managers of the Culpeper Agricultural and Manufacturing Bank Society,\u201d or to the \u201cPresident and Managers of the Culpeper Agricultural and Manufacturing <em>Bank,\u201d </em>I should have thought that it could not have been averred or shown <em>by </em>proofs, that it was in truth given to tiie \u201cCulpeper Agricultural and Manufacturing-Society;\u201d for, this would be in opposition to the legal import of the Deed itself. In the first case, the legal effect of the Deed would be, to create an obligation to the individuals named, and the addition of \u201cPresident and Managers\u201d would be only a superfluous description of the particular individuals meant, or at most an indication that the obligation was made to them, for the benefit of the Corporation; and in the other, the name of the Corporation in the bond, would be different in sense, from the true name of the Corporation claiming it as made to them. But in this case, the naming of the \u201cPresident and Managers, without using their proper names, does not, in any degree, contradict the averment that the bond was made to the Corporation; but, is entirely ..consistent with it, since it clearly indicates that the bond was given to them and the other Corporators, not in their individual, but in their corporate,characters.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">I think the Judgment should be reversed, the demurrer overruled, and the cause remanded for a trial of the issue in fact joined between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The other Judges concurred, and the Judgment reversed, &amp;o.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
