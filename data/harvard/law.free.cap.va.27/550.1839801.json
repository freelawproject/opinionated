Gwatkin.</em></parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aa2q\">November 1828.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AQUN\">A suit instituted in one name, will not justify a Declaration and Judgment in another; therefore, when a Plaintiff' has two baptismal names, and a mistake is made in the second or middle name, it is a misnomer, and is a fatal error, not only on a plea in abatement, but on a Judgment by default,</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-12\"><em>Mary </em>G. <em>Gwatkin </em>sued out a Writ of <em>Capias ad Respondendum, </em>in debt, against <em>Amos Hoff </em>and <em>Charles Ming, </em>from the Office of the Superior Court of Law for Prince William County. It was returned \u201cNo inhabitant,\u201d as to <em>Hoff, </em>and the suit abated as to him.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>It was executed on <em>Ming, </em>who gave <em>Jesse Green </em>as his appearance bail. The Bail-Bond was copied into the Record, by which the Plaintiff was called <em>Mary </em>G. <em>Gwatkin.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\">The Declaration was in the name of <em>Mary </em>S. <em>Gwatkin, </em>and the Judgment, which was an office Judgment, not'set aside, was rendered in behalf of the Plaintiff, without naming her. The Bill penal, which was filed with the Declaration, had also the -S'., and not the <em>G., </em>in the middle name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-6\"><em>One </em>of the Defendants being taken in Execution, a Writ of Error was awarded by this Court, without requiring security except for the costs, under the Act of Assembly, passed at the Session of 1824-5, <em>ch. </em>21, <em>p. </em>20.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-7\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the Plaintiff in Error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-8\"><em>No Counsel </em>for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"b427-9\"><em>November </em>1.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A50\">Judge Cabell</author>\n<p id=\"AIyC\">delivered the opinion of the Court,</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Many objections were made to the Judgment, but it is unnecessary to notice more than one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">The Judgment was by default for want of appearance, and consequently the Writ and Bail-Bond are parts of the Record. <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Pollock </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 423; <em>Quarles </em>v. <em>Buford, </em>Munf. 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">The Writ is in the name of <em>Mary </em>G. <em>Gioallcin, </em>as Plaintiff, and the Bail-Bond states the suit as being in the same name. But, the Declaration and Judgment are in the name of <em>Mary </em>S. <em>Gwatkin. </em>The baptismal name, <em>Mary </em>G., in the Writ and Bail-Bond, is essentially different from the baptismal name, <em>Mary </em>S., -in the Declaration and Judgment. A suit instituted in one name, will not justify a Declaration and Judgment in another. On this ground, without noticing any other, the Court is of opinion to reverse the Judgment, and to \u2019set aside all the proceedings subsequent to the Writ and Bail-Bond.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
