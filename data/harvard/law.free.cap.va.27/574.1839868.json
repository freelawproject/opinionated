The Writ was executed on <em>Wills, </em>and returned \u201cNot found,\u201d as to the other Defendant. An <em>Alias </em>was, in the following September, issued against <em>Hamlin, </em>returnable to the November Rules, and returned executed. The Plaintiff filed his Declaration against both Defendants at the September Rules, which sets forth the Bond, of which the condition is that the Guardian, <em>Wills, </em>shall deliver to <em>Mary W. iMnier, </em>the Ward, on her attaining to lawful age, all the estate due to (lie said orphan, and to account, &amp;c. The breaches assigned, are the neglect and refusal to deliver over the estate, and the non-payment <em>to the </em>Ward of the sum of $373, with interest from the 1st March, 1819, found due from the Guardian. A common order was entered against the Defendant, <em>Wills, </em>at the September Rules,- which was confirmed at the October Rules, and a Writ of Enquiry then awarded; and at the October Term, the Court not being held, the cause was continued as to him. At the November Rules, the common order was entered against the other Defendant, <em>Hamlin, </em>which was confirmed, and the Writ of .Enquiry awarded at the December Rules. At the next Term of the Court, which was in May, <em>1S24, </em>an entry was made on the Record, that \u201cthis suit abates by the death of the Defendant.\u201d [Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number><em>it </em>must liave been on the docket against two Defendants, 3'et it ivas Abated only as to one, without naming which one.] At the October Term, 1824, the entry is, Hint \u201cthis-suit, which stands for revival, is continued till the next Court.\u201d .At the May Term, 1S25, the Plaintiff, at the instance, of the relator, sued out a <em>Scire Facias </em>to revive, against <em>Viuant Quinichett, </em>Administrator of <em>John Hamlin, </em>deceased; and that not being executed, an <em>\u00bfIllas Scire Facias </em>was sued out against the same person, at the rules in August, 1835, returnable to September; and that being returned executed, a Judgment by default was entered against the Administrator, with a Writ of Enquiry of damages. At the October Term, 1825, the cause was continued. At the May Term, 182G, iho Defendant (who is described as Administrator of <em>Lohn Hamlin, </em>deceased, who was coobligor with <em>William Wills, </em>deceased,) pleaded <em>e( </em>Conditions performed,\u201d on which issue being joined, a trial was had, and a Verdict and Judgment rendered in behalf of the Plaintiff for the debt in the Declaration mentioned, to bo discharged by the payment of \u00a7287, xvith interest from the 1st October, 1S29. There was a Bill of Exceptions taken to two opinions of the Court given during the trial. It stated, that the Plaintiff introduced <em>Robert Lanier </em>as a witness to prove that he, as the Administrator of his mother, had paid to <em>William Wills </em>in his life-time, as Guardian of the beneficiary Plaintiff) the sum of about $300, at different times in the years 18OS-\u20199 and \u201910, it being the amount to which she was entitled from t.he said decedent\u2019s estate:1 that he took the said <em>Wills's </em>receipts for the sums so paid: that on the evening before the witness gave evidence, he was requested by the Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel to bring the said receipts, but not recollecting where he had put them, and thinking it probable he could not find them, he had made no examination for them; whereupon, the Defendant objected to the said evidence, and required the production of the said receipts, but the Court over-ruled the objection, and admitted the tcsli\u2022mony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-4\">The Defendant afterwards proved that in 1819, a settlement had taken place between the said <em>Mary TV. Lanier, </em>then of full age, and her said Guardian, in which the latter was found indebted to her in the sum of $373, for the payment whereof, he executed his bond to her payable on demand, with interest from the date; that she took the said Bond, and had received two partial payments, which were credited on the same, but that a balanee xvas still due on the said Bond, to recover the amount of which, this action was brought; whereupon, the Defendant moved the Court to instruct the Jury, that the settlement of the Guardi an ship accounts between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Ward, after she was of age, and her Guardian, and the execution Of the Bond by tire latter to the former, together with her accepting Ihc said Bond, and receiving partial payments thereon, discharged the Testator of the Defendant from his liability as surety of the Guardian for the sum for which the said Bond was taken; although there was no evidence to prove, that the said Bond was accepted by the said <em>Mary T-V. Lanier, </em>as full payment or satisfaction of the claim against her said Guardian; which instruction the Court refused to give, and the Defendant excepted. The case came here by a <em>Supersedeas </em>to the Judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-5\"><em>May, </em>for the Plaintiff in Error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-6\"><em>Spooner, </em>for the Defendant in Error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"b446-7\"><em>November </em>17.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AXg\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"AOqa\">delivered his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The Record exhibits a case, in which it appears that there were several in the all of which I think are cured, no advantage having been taken of them in the pleadings. The suit was instituted by <em>Thomas Atkinson, </em>as surviving Justice of Dinwiddie County, at the relation of <em>Mary TV. Lanier, </em>against her Guardian, <em>William Wills, </em>and his surety, <em>John Hamlin, </em>on the Guardian\u2019s Bond, taken to the Justices of Dinwiddie County, in the usual form. The Writ was returned'executed on <em>Wills, </em>and <em>Hamlin </em>not found. At the subsequent Rules, an <em>Alias </em>was sued out against <em>Hamlin, </em>and returned executed; and thereupon a Declaration was filed against both on the Guardian\u2019s Bond, of which profer\u00ed is made, and breaches of the condition assigned, which are set out in the Declaration. Afterwards, a conditional order is entered against <em>Wills, </em>and is subsequently confirmed against him, he having been arrested, and not appearing. At a subsequent rule-day, and after a continuance of the cause as <em>to Wills, </em>by Law, there being no Court held in the month of October, 1823, a conditional Judgment is entered against <em>Hamlin, </em>also, and at another day at Rules confirmed against him, and a Writ of Enquiry awarded, as in the case of <em>Wills. </em>At a subsequent Term, the suit is entered abated by the death of the Defendant, without saying which. At the next Term the cause is continued for revival until the next Term. Then dropping the suit against <em>Wills, </em>as it would seem from the after-proceedings, at the next Term a Writ of <em>Sci. Ha. </em>is sued out against the Defendant, as Administrator of <em>Hamlin, </em>reciting that action to have been against him as co-obligor of <em>Wills, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the Guardian: the <em>Sci. Fa. </em>is returned, a came too late to hand to execute,\u201d and the suit is again continued, without noticing what suit, but it must be presumed the suit on the <em>Sci. Fa., </em>until the next and then an <em>Mias Scire Facias'is </em>sued and executed, as appears by the return of it, and) the Defendant failing to appear at Rules and plead, an Office-Judgment is entered against him, and a Writ of Enquiry awarded. At another Term the suit is continued till the next Term,\u201cwhen the Defendant <em>by his </em>Attorney, pleaded to the Declaration,'^ conditions performed,\u201d <em>to which </em>the Plaintiff replied generally, and it was ordered that me Judgment in the Office be set aside, whereupon came a Jury, who found a general verdict for the Plaintiff, Tor the debt in the Declaration, to be discharged by the payment of <em>$367, </em>with interest, and Judgment was entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">The <em>Scire Facias </em>sued out against the Defendant, was in the nature of an action against him, which may be released by that name, <em>(Lift. </em>505; <em>Co. Litt. </em>290;) and might have been demurred to-Having failed to demur, or to plead any variance between it and the proceedings on which it issued, <em>(Paradise\u2019s Adm\u2019rs. v. Cole &amp; Henderson, </em>6 Munf. 218,) it must now be \u00fa\u00f1derstood that <em>Wills </em>died first, and that the action survived against <em>Hamlin, </em>the intestate of the Defendant, and upon his death, (after the death of <em>Wills, </em>the <em>principal,) was properly revived by </em>the <em>Scire Facias </em>against the Defendant, as Administrator of <em>Hamlin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The errors insisted on in the Bill of Exceptions, are of a different character. The first, is to the admission of tile testimony of <em>Robert Lanier, </em>who gave evidence that he,' as the Administrator of his mo-, ther, had paid to <em>William Wills, </em>the Guardian of <em>Mary Lanier, </em>the sum of about @300, at different times in the years 1808-\u20199 and \u201910, it being the amount to which she was entitled from the decedent\u2019s estate; that he took the said <em>Wills\u2019s </em>receipts for the sums so paid; that on the evening before the witness gave evidence, he vvas requested by the Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel to bring the said receipts, but not recollecting where he put them, and thinking it probable he could not find them, he had made no examination for them. Not, now deciding whether, if the witness had spoken positively, and with certainty as to the dates and amount of the payments made, his evidence, if believed by the Jury, would have been equivalent to the receipts themselves, as being of equal degree, the Court is of opinion, that as he could not so speak, his testimony ought not to have been received in the absence of the receipts, unless it had appeared that they were lost, or out of the power of the Plaintiff, which is negatived by the statement of the witness, that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>was requested by the Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel to bring them, &amp;c. It was error, therefore, to permit this evidence to go to the Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The second objection is to the Court\u2019s r\u00e9fusingto instruct the Jury, that the acceptance by <em>Mary </em>Lanier, the Ward, after she had attained full age, of a Bond from the Guardian individually, for the sum of <em>$ </em>373, the balance due on a settlement, and on which partial payments had been made, was a discharge of the security on the Guardian\u2019s Bond. A Bond to perform that for which the party was before bound by another Bond, is no discharge of the latter, for accord, it is said, does not mend the matter; 1 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>43; but, if it could have been available in this ease, it ought to have been pleaded. 2 <em>Starkie, </em>p. 26 and 27. It was not matter of evidence on the plea of conditions performed in bar of the specialty on which the suit was brought, though it was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the amount due by the Guardian, liable to b\u00bb - \u00a1lied by evidence on the part of the security. If it could .\u00bfen pleaded, the proof should have been full, that it was given and received in full satisfaction, as to which there was no evidence. There was no error, therefore, in refusing the instruction asked for by the Defendant. But, for the error in permitting parol evidence to go to the Jury m the absence of the receipts, the Judgment is to be reversed, the cause remanded for further proceedings, the verdict to be set aside, and a new trial awarded, on which the parol evidence is not to be admitted in the absence of the receipts, unless it shall appear that they are lost, or out of the power of the Plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The other Judges, all being present, concurred.,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
