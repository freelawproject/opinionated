The transaction on the part of <em>Sherrard, </em>who was not present, was negotiated by <em>Charles Blue, </em>his Clerk in the store. The Court of Examination was of opinion that the prisoner -was guilty, and remanded him to Jail to undergo a trial, for the offence with which he stood charged, before the next Superior Court of Law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-5\">At the next Superior Court of Law, the Grand Jury found an Indictment against him containing three counts. The first count charges, (hat he \u201cfeloniously did faiscly make, forge and counterfeit, and did feloniously cause and procure to be falsely made, forged and counterfeited, and feloniously did act and assist in the false making, forging and counterfeiting a certain false writing,\u201d &amp;c. describing and setting forth <em>in hsec verba </em>the single bill before-mentioned, and averring it to have been done \u201cto the prejudice of the right, and with intent to injure and defraud the said <em>William Duling.\u2019\u2019'\u2019 </em>The second count charges, that he \u201cfeloniously did utter and publish and employ as true for his own benefit, a certain other false, forged and counterfeited writing,\u201d describing again the same single bill, and setting it forth according to its tenor and effect, and charging the intent to have been \u201cto injure and defraud the said <em>William Duling,\u201d </em>and averring that the prisoner knew it to be \u201cfalse, forged, and counterfeited.\u201d The third count is tho same as the second, except that the intent is alleged therein to have been \u201cto injure and defraud <em>William Sherrard.\u201d </em>It is not stated upon the face of this count, as it is iq the two preceding, that it was found upon the <em>oath </em>of the Grand Jury,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-6\">The prisoner, upon, his arraingmcqt, and before pleading, moved, the Court to quash each count in the Indictment, because \u201cthere is no substantial offence charged, and because the offence charged in the Indictment is variant from the charge for which the prisoner was sent on to be tried by the Examining Court.\u201d The motion to quash was over-ruled. The prisoner then pleaded not guilty, and was put on his trial by a Jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-7\">Upon the trial, the Attorney for the Commonwealth offered in evidence a single bill, corresponding with the one set forth in the Indictment. Tiie prisoner objected to its going in evidence to the Jury. The Court over-ruled his objection, and the prisoner filed a Bill of Exceptions to the opinion of the Court, which states, .that on the trial of this Indictment, <em>Charles Blue, </em>a witness in behalf of the Commonwealth, produced a single bill, set forth in the Indictment, and testified, \u201c'that on the 13th day of March, 1828, he ivas in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>employment of <em>William Sherrard, </em>of Hampshire County, in the capacity of clerk in the store of the said <em>Sherrard, </em>who was a merchant; that the prisoner on that day took up sundry goods in the store of said <em>Sherrard, </em>in payment of which, he 'assigned said paper-writing to <em>William Sherrard; </em>that about half an hour after making the assignment, the witness discovered that the paper-writing was dated m the year 1828; upon which, he stated that circumstance to the prisoner, who remarked to the witness that it had been so dated by <em>William Diding </em>by mistake; and therefore, he, the nrisoner, (the said paper-writing being handed to him for that purpose by the witness,) with the assent of the witness, with the pen-knife of the witness, erased the figure 8, and made in lieu thereof, with pen and ink, the figure 7, so as to change the .date from 1828 to 1827;\u201d and then returned the single bill to the witness. Upon this evidence the prisoner contended, that the instrument had not been properly described in the Indictment, and being variant from the single bill therein set forth, should be therefore excluded from the Jury, which the Court refused.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-4\"><em>Samuels, </em>for the petitioner,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A14f\">argued in writing to the following effect:</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-5\">1. That the motion to quash each count, ought to have been sustained. As to the first count, there was a variance between it and the record of the Examining Court. By the Indictment, the prisoner is charged with three distinct offences: 1st, the forging and counterfeiting; 2d, the causing and procuring the single bill to be falsely forged and counterfeited; and Sd, the acting and assisting in the false forging and counterfeiting the said instrument. But, he was only examined for one of these offences; namely, the forgery. He contended, that the fact of <em>forgery </em>does n\u00f3t <em>'ex vi termini </em>include the other two facts: that, the Legislature thought it did not so include them, or they would not have proyided separately for the other two offences: that the fact of forgery may exist in the absence of the other two classes of facts, which shows, that it dpe\u00e1 not include them. He concluded, that as the prisoner was indicted for a greater number of offences than he had been examined for, the Superior Court had no jurisdiction of these latter offences, and that therefore the first count ought to be quashed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-6\">2. That the first count was defective in itself, in not setting forth the person or persons who the prisoner caused and procured to forge the instrument; and those with whom he willingly acted and assisted in the forgery. The persons ought to have been designated, to enable the prisoner to prepare'for his defence, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>plead the Judgments in bar of other prosecutions for the same of-fences.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-4\">3. He contended that the first count confounded principal and accessorial guilt. If the procurers or aiders are <em>present, </em>they are principals in the second degree, but if <em>absent, </em>they are accessories, and must be indicted specifically as such, as is agreed by the General Court, in <em>Rasnick </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth, </em>2 Virg. Ca. 356. Here the count does not aver cither the presence, or the absence of the prisoner at the procuring or aiding the forgery to be done, and it is therefore entirely uncertain whether the prisoner is charged as principal or accessory. For this want of certainty, the count ought to have been quashed. lie drew the distinction between this case and <em>Rasnick\u2019s. </em>There the prisoner did not demur to the count, nor move to quash it, before plea, but it was on a motion to arrest the Judgment, and the General Court seems to have proceeded on <em>the </em>ground that <em>\u201c after verdict </em>on such Indictment, the count must be understood as charging the procurers and aiders as principals in the second degree.\u201d But in this ease there was a motion to quash before plea, and the case is to be considered as on demurrer. If it is supposed that the degrees of guilt arc to be ascertained by the evidence, such supposition not to avail. The Indictment itself ought lo set out the offences charged as criminal, and they should be so charged as to leave nothing to intendment. Whatever the evidence may be, the vice inherent in this count, that it does not inform the prisoner whether he is charged as principal or accessory, ought to overthrow it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-6\">4. He objected to the second and third counts. In the Examining Court he was charged with passing- the instrument. He might have <em>passed </em>it without being guilty of any crime, for he may not have known that it was counterfeit. But the second and third counts go further, and charge that he passed it, knowing it to be false, forged and counterfeited. He is therefore indicted for an offence for which he had not been examined, and both counts ought to have been quashed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-7\">5. The third count is defective in another particular. It commences thus: <em>\u201c </em>And the Jurors aforesaid, do further present,\u201d omitting the words, \u201c upon their oath aforesaid,\u201d and so it is nota valid Presentment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-8\">6. The single bill ought not to have gone in evidence to the July. From the Bill of Exceptions, it appears, that the single bill, when it was passed to <em>Blue, </em>the clerk, bore date the 28th December, 1828, a day then yet to come: that after the bill had been passed, and the goods received by the and the clos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>\u00e93, it was discovered that the bill was dated on that day; this fact was communicated by <em>Blue </em>to the prisoner, and by the consent of <em>Blue, </em>and in his presence, the prisoner erased the figure S, and inserted 7 in lieu thereof: by this erasure neither <em>Blue </em>nor <em>Sherrard </em>was defrauded. When the single bill was first passed to <em>Blue, </em>it bore date the day before mentioned. It is charged in the Indictment to have been dated on the 28th December, 1827, and is therefore diffei\u2019ent from the bill as originally passed, and consummated. If the bill was forged by <em>Huffman, </em>it was so done before it was al- \u25a0 tered, and thepaper described in the Indictment is in fact different from the paper as <em>it was </em>when passed <em>to Blue..</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b533-4\"><em>Field, </em>J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMN\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">[After mailing the statement prefixed to this report, he pro-seeded.] '</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In his petition for a Writ of Error, the prisoner contends, that the Superior Court of Law should have quashed each count in the Indictment for the reasons there assigned; and should have quashed the third count for the additional reason of its not appearing upon its face to have been upon the oath of the Grand Jury. He also contends, that the single bill should have been excluded from the Jury, for the reason assigned in the Bill of Exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The Court has attentively and maturely examined and considered the transcript of the Record in this case, and the written argument of Counsel in the Country, filed in support of.the petition,, and is of opinion that there is no error in-, the Record. It is an established general rule, that where an Indictment, as this does, charges an of-fence in the words- of the Statute creating, the offence, the Indictment as to the description of the fact is good. In <em>Archbold\u2019s Criminal Pleading, </em>p. 188, and in <em>Chitty\u2019s Grim. Law, </em>vol. 3, p: 1,043, may be found the form of an Indictment upon the English Statute of Forgery of 52 <em>Geo. 3, </em>ch. 138, which our Statute on the same subject resembles. It charges,, that the prisoner eifeloniously did falsely malte, forge and counterfeit, and did cause, and procure to bo falsely made, forged.and counterfeited, and. did willingly act and assist in the false malting, forging, and counterfeiting, &amp;c. <em>-,\u201d </em>with which, form, the Indictment in this case corresponds.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The only seeming difficulty upon- this point;, arose from the Act of Assembly in relation to Courts of Examination, which secures to the prisoner the right of being examined, upon a-charge of felony, by a Court of Examination, composed of. five or more of the Justices of the County Court, before he shall be indicted and tried for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>alleged crime in the Superior Court of Law. The first count <em>of </em>the</p>\n<p id=\"pA2D4\">Indictment in this case, charges <em>inter alia, </em>that the prisoner caused, and procured the forgery to be Committed. In the Court of Examination, he was charged with having forged, counterfeited, and passed,\u201d the single bill in question, which the prisoner contends, does not embrace the <em>accessorial offence </em>of causing and procuring a forgery to be committed by an'other person. If it were conceded that the charge which was made against the prisoner before the Court of Examination, and upon which he was examined, is not sufficiently comprehensive to embrace a case of accessorial guilt, properly so called, as where one man, being himself absent at the time, causes and procures another to make a forged writing, which at Common Law would constitute the absent procurer an accessory before the fact, still there would be no weight in this objection. The \u201ccausing and procuring,\u201d charged in the Indictment, contemplates a causing and procuring the forgery to be committed by some other person in the presence of the prisoner, which would render him a principal felon in the second degree, and consequently proof of accessorial guilt could not have been received upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In looking into the Record of a trial before a Court of Examination, to see for what offence a prisoner has been examined, the Court should regard the. substance of the offence, and not the manner in which it may have been perpetrated; nor should the offence be required to be described there with technical precision. The offence charged against the prisoner, and whieh was examined into by the Court of Examination, was <em>forgery. </em>Whether that offence was committed by the prisoner alone with his own hands; whether he caused and procured it to be done by another, or acted and assisted in the commission of the fact, were incidental enquiries. And whatever may have been the proof relative to the main charge of forgery, it was the duty of the Examining Court, if they thought the prisoner ought not.to be from further to send him on ^01' Rather trial in the Superior Court of Law, without undertaking to discriminate as to the grado of the offence, or to designate the .mode in which it had been committed. Upon these principles, the Court of Examination acted in this case; and it was competent for the Prosecuting Attorney to prefer against the prisoner such an Indictment as has been found.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai6\">f' As to the objection taken to the third count, of its not appearing on the face of it to have been found upon the <em>oath </em>of the Grand Jury, that difficulty is obviated by the fact of the Grand Jury\u2019s having Seen actually Sworn in open Court, before the Indictment Was found, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>as appears from the transcript of the Record tiled with the petition <em>% </em>and therefore, .the whole Indictment must necessarily have been found upon the oath of the Grand Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The only remaining objection to be considered, is that which arises from the Bill of Exceptions. If the single bill therein mentioned, were in its original form a forged writing, it did not cease to be so, by the alteration in the date of the year, as mentioned in the Bill of Exceptions. And if it were in cither shape a forged writing, as it corresponded in tenor and effect with the single bill described and set <em>forth in </em>each count of the Indictment, there was no cause shown for excluding <em>it from the </em>Jury. -The Writ <em>of </em>Error is refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
