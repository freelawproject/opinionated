Alexander, </em>and his son-in-law, <em>John Brown, </em>as his sureties, executed his bond for a considerable debt, to one <em>Donaldson, </em>and also a mortgage on a tract of land of abeut 1800 acres, to indemnify his sureties in the bond. In 1795, he sold 314 acres of the lafid to one Wilson, and conveyed to\u2019him, with general warranty and covenants against all incumbrances, and for a good title, and further assurances. <em>Wilson, </em>it is alleged, paid the purchase money to <em>Donaldson </em>by the order of <em>Alexander, </em>in part payment of the debt due him by <em>Alexander; </em>in consequence of which, the sureties released their <em>lien </em>on the land sold to <em>Wilson. </em>The bill charges that <em>John Alexander, </em>in surveying the 314 acres sold to <em>Wilson, </em>fraudulently carried the surveyor to a corner, so as to include 139 acres of land, which did not belong to him. In 1800, <em>Wilson </em>sold to one <em>Ramsay, </em>with general warranty and covenants against all incum brances by him. When this conveyance was made, one <em>Greenup </em>Was in possession of 139 acres, (wrongfully included in the survey as it is alleged,) claiming a fee-simple title in it; and in the same year,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>Ramsay </em>brought an action of ejectment for the rccoveiy of the poN session; and in 1804 he sold to A <em>uld, </em>the Plaintiff. In 1807, he con* veyed to A <em>uld, </em>with special warranty against himself, and all persons claiming under him; after which, Judgment was rendered against him <em>in </em>the action of ejectment.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The bill of <em>Auld </em>is against <em>Wilson, Ramsay, </em>and the heirs of <em>John Alexander, </em>claiming to have assigned to him so much of the 1800 acres out of which the land was sold to <em>Wilson, </em>as will compensate him in value, for the 139 acres, lost by <em>Greenup's </em>title; or, to have the remainder ol the 1800 acres sold under the Deed of Mortgage to <em>A lexander's </em>sureties in the bond of <em>Donaldson, </em>which, it appears, had been before released by the sureties; and for general belief, See.</p>\n<p id=\"pALR\">The mortgage, is net exhibited; though its existence is admitted\u00bb Nor does it appear, that it has been regularly recorded, being only proved by one witness. It seems that all the residue of the 1S00 acres of land, was convoyed by <em>John Alexander </em>to his children in consideration does not appear; except that <em>Cliarles B Alexander, </em>one of the sons, says, that the portion conveyed to him, war in consideration principad/ of <em>money </em>paid by him <em>tor his </em>ffb'r\u00a1\u2019,y,pd that he purchased <em>Richard B. Alexander's </em>part. None of 'Jvi other !\\ ira of <em>John \u00bfAlexander </em>hold any part of the</p>\n<p id=\"ABp\">land, v.hich he ai.. ,-;/ thro held; the residue of his real estate having been sold in bis life time to other persons. Nor are any of the Deeds from him to hi:-, o.ms impeached by the bill. There is, therefore, no ground on \u00a1he pleading's, on which the Plaintiff is entitled to relief, unless he is entitled to a <em>specific lien </em>on the land in the possession of <em>Charles B Alexander, </em>paramount to his title. Iiis claim to have satisfaction for the loss of the 139 acres held by <em>Green-up, </em>by an assignment to him of a portion of the 1800 acres of equal value, has no foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Tliero <em>is </em>no case, in which a Court of Equity can assign to a creditor a Specific portion of his debtor\u2019s property, in satisfaction of his demand. His claim to he substituted for Wi <em>Ison </em>and to have hi:! rights, by which to get a <em>lien </em>on the land of <em>Alexander, </em>paramount to tiie title of <em>Charles B. Alexander, </em>one of his sons, is not better founded. <em>Wilson </em>himself, had no claim to the <em>lien </em>given for the benefit of <em>Alexander's </em>sureties, for the debt to <em>Donaldson. </em>If he did pay the purchase money to- indemnify them, (which- is not satisfactorily proved,) ho did not pay it for the sureties. The money was due by himself; and though paid for <em>Alexander, </em>it was not <em>paid </em>for his sureties. Hut, if it had been so paid, there is no ground on, which Auld, the Plaintiff, could be substituted for him; He had n\u00ab* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>. 'claim to indemnity from <em>Ramsay, </em>from whom he purchased, nor -\u00abpon <em>Wilson. </em>Not upon <em>Ramsay, </em>because his warranty was special, and never broken; nor upon <em>Wilson, </em>for whatever claim <em>Ram'say </em>might have upon him, none was assigned io <em>Auld. Wilson\u2019s </em>covenant were with <em>Ramsay </em>and his assigns.of the land, and could Only pass to an assignee of the land, as incident to it. That being -in the adverse possession of <em>Greenup </em>when the conveyance was made to <em>Auld, </em>no title nor interest in the 139 acres to him; and though <em>Ramsay </em>might be estopped by his Deed to say \u2022that no title passed from him, yet others,\u201enot claiming under him, are not estopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b85-16\"> Judge Carr did not sit in this cause, having decided it as Chancellor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
