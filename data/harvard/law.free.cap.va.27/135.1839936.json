The Lets arc these: On the 4th of January, 1804, the Defendant <em>Dunkly </em>executed a Deed of Gift, conveying <em>Jenny, </em>a slave, to the female Plaintiff, then an infant of tender years. The Deed has this clause: \u201cI have delivered the above named negro to the said <em>N. W. Sawyers, </em>which t am to keep Lhe said negro, and raise it for the above named <em>N. PV. Sawyers, </em>until the said <em>Nancy </em>is thirteen years old.\u201d There were two subscribing witnesses to the Deed; by one of whom it was proved in the County Court of Halifax in June, 1804; but, no further proof being made, <em>it </em>was never recorded. The execution of the Deed was proved at the trial by a subscribing witness. Before the execution of the Deed, but on the same the slave was delivered to <em>N. PF. Sawyers; </em>and immediately after the Deed was executed, she was taken back into the possession of the Defendant, upon the terms mentioned in the Deed; the said slave and the said <em>Nancy </em>being both at that time under <em>one year old. </em>The Defendant had (excepting the aforesaid delivery and taking back) remained in possession of the slave, from her birth; nor had the donee ever lived vvifh him. On this state of facts, the Court <em>(on </em>the motion of the-Defendant) instructed the Jury, \u201cthat the said Deed did not pass such an estate, as to enable the Plaintiffs to recover in this action: that to make the gift of a slave valid, such gift must be evidenced by Will or Deed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>p/bvect By two witnesses, or acknowledged\u2019and recorded within eight months, or the slave must be delivered,.to, and remain in, the possession of, the donee, or some third person claiming under such donee, so that the possession of the donor must be entirely broken up.\u201d Upon this instruction, the Jury fouqd a verdict for the Defendant; and this Court awarded a <em>Supersedeas. </em>We are to enquire whether the instruction of the Court be correct. That question depends oh the construction given to the 51st section of our Act concerning slaves, &amp;c., 1 <em>Rev. Code, 433: </em>\u201cNo gift of any slave shall <em>he </em>good, or sufficient to pass any estate in such slave, &amp;c. unless the same he made by Will duly proved and recorded, or by Deed in Writing, to be proved by two witnesses at <em>the least, or </em>acknowledged by the donor, and recorded according to Law. This section shall be construed to extend only to gifts of slaves, whereof the donors have, notwithstanding such gifts, remained in the possession, and not to gifts of such slaves, as have at any time come into the actual possession of, and have remained with, the donee, or some person claiming under, such donee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\">It was contended for the Plaintiffs, that this was a gift <em>in futuro; </em>and that to such gifts, the Act does not apply. The Deed says, _ however, that \u201cI, <em>Moses Dunkly, </em>for the consideration of <em>1 </em>love, &amp;c., <em>have given </em>and <em>granted, </em>and by these presents <em>do freely give </em>and <em>grant, </em>unto <em>Nancy Sawyers </em>and her lawful heirs, &amp;c., one negro girl named <em>Jenny,\u201d </em>&amp;c. These seem clearly to me, to be the words of a <em>present, </em>and not of a <em>future </em>gift; and if this Deed had been proved, or acknowledged, and recorded according to Law, there would have been an end of the question. No future act of <em>Dunkly </em>could have affected the title of the female Plaintiff. The Deed adds, <em>\u201cI </em>am to keep the said negro and raise it for the said <em>Nancy, </em>till she is thirteen.\u201d But, these words relate to the <em>possession </em>merely, and do not postpone the vesting of the <em>right. </em>This, then, being a gift <em>in prsesenti, </em>it is riot material to consider <em>whether </em>a-gift <em>in futuro </em>be within the operation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">It was contended, in the <em>second </em>placo, that taking this as a gift <em>in prsesenti, </em>still it was good, because the possession of the slave being delivered to the donee, and resumed by the donor, <em>for the purposes, and upon the terms, of the Deed, </em>the subsequent possession of the donor was the possession of one claiming under the donee; and so, that the Act ivas substantially complied with, which requires, that the slave, \u201cshall have come into the actual possession of, and have remained with, the donee, or some person claiming under such do-nee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">I confess that rav first impressions were strongly in favor of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>conclusion; but, subsequent reflection and investigation have compelled me to change them. There are but two classes of gifts of slaves which the Law tolerates. 1. A gift evidenced by Will or Deed, properly proved and recorded. 2. A gift evidenced by possession <em>passing from the donor to the donee, and remaining with him, </em>or <em>one claiming under him. </em>To place this matter in the clearest light, we must look back to the old Laws on this subject. The Act of 1757, 7 <em>Hen. Stat. at Large, </em>118, entitled \u201cAn Act foi preventing fraudulent gifts of slaves,\u201d after stating in the Preamble, \u201cWhereas many frauds have been committed, by means of secret gifts made of slaves, by parents and others, whereby creditors and purchasers have been frequently involved in expensive Law suits, and often deprived of their just debts and purchases,\u201d enacts, that no gift of slaves shall pass ony estate, unless by Will or Deed, duly recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">In 1758, 7 <em>Hen. Stat, at Large, </em>237, there is a Law with exactly the same title, and with enactments almost exactly like the last,. The only material difference respects <em>the continued possession of the donor. </em>Thus, \u201cwhereas many frauds have been committed by means of secret gifts, made, <em>or jtretended to have been made, </em>by parents and others, <em>(who have notivithstanding remained in possession of such slaves, as visible owners thereof,) </em>whereby creditors,\u201d &amp;c. just as in the former. Here, we see what was meant <em>by possession remaining </em>with the donor.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">These Acts remained in force unaltered, till October, 1787, 12 <em>Hen. Stat, at Large, </em>505, when an Act passed to \u201c explain and asnend the Acts for preventing fraudulent gifts of slaves.\u201d The Preamble is uncommonly long and particular in its recitals. It first recites substantially the whole of the Acts of 1757-8; and then states, that \u201c whereas, in the general construction of these Acts, it has been understood, that they were not intended to interfere between donor find donee, further than to prevent deceptions and frauds, and that the enacting parts of the said Acts extended only to secret gifts of slaves, <em>and whereof the donor retained possession; and not to gifts ivhere the possession had been in the donee; </em>and many parents and others have, since the said recited Acts, made gifts of slaves to their children and others, without Deed in writing, <em>and such donees have continued in possession of the slaves so given, under a delivery at the lime of making, or after such gifts, by which the donees have been considered as the owners of such slaves, and have obtained credit </em>and from a late arising on the said recited Acts, it was determined that all gifts of slaves, since t.hc said Acts, are void, unless made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Writing, or confirmed by Will, as in the said Act is directed; which late adjudication, by disquieting and disturbing <em>possessions, </em>will tend to produce infinite disputes and litigation, and contrary to the intent of the donors, to deprive children of the provisions made for them by their deceased parents, injure husbands who have married women, <em>possessed of slaves under such gifts, </em>defraud creditors and purchasers under such donees, and multiply the mischiefs the said Acts wei\u2019e intended to remedy; for prevention whereof, Be 11 Enacted, that the said recited Acts for preventing fraudulent gifts of slaves, shall, from and after the passing of this Act, be construed to extend only to gifts of slaves, <em>whereof the donors have, </em>notwithstanding such <em>gifts, remained in possession; </em>and not to gifts of such slaves, as have at any time <em>come into the actual possession of, and remained with, the donee, or some person claiming under such donee. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">I have quoted the Preamble and enacting clause <em>of </em>this Act, thus specially, because they seem to me to show more clearly than any \u2022 argument, what the Legislature meant. 1. We have stated the mischief intended to be remedied. <em>\u201c </em>Gifts,' made or pretended, of slaves, by parents, &amp;c. who have, notwithstanding, <em>remained in possession of such slaves, </em>as <em>visible owners. </em>\u201d To remedy this evil the Acts of 1757-8 were passed. When the Courts came to act upon these Laws, they pronounced all gifts of slaves void, unless by Deed or Will, although possession had been delivered at the time of the gift, and remained ever after with the donee. The Preamble declares, this construction wrong; that the Laws only intended to a~ void gifts of slaves, where there was no Deed or Will, and the <em>donor had retained possession; </em>and did not extend to gifts, where <em>the possession had been in the donee. </em>The Preamble then points out the mischiefs which the adjudication tended to produce; and every case it puts, shows that the possession of the donee was meant to be an <em>actual, abiding, permanent </em>possession; one wholly incompatible with a continuing possession of the donor*. This, then, is my conclusion. A gift of slaves may be by Will or Deed, properly proved and recorded. In this case, no matter where the possession is, the solemnity of the instrument, and the record, give notice to the World. A gift of slaves may also be without Will or Deed. But then there must be something to' give fair notice to the World, of the change of ownership; and for this, nothing less will answer than that possession (the <em>indicium </em>of title) shall pass from the donor to the donee, and remain with the donee, nr some person claiming under him.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Does the gift before us, belong to either of those classes? It is by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Deed properly executed and attested, but never recorded; and the Act declares, that no gift of a slave shall pass <em>any </em>estate in suejh slave, unless by Will or Deed in writing, to be proved by tvyo witnesses at least, or acknowledged and recorded, <em>according to Law, </em>This gift, then, by a Deed never recorded, passes no estate in the slave. The <em>Deed </em>at least is wholly inoperative; and, if the gift be valid, it must bo on the only other ground known to the Law; <em>possession.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">On the day of executing the Deed, the donor delivered to <em>the </em>do-nee (not then one year oicl) the slave <em>Jenny; </em>and upon the execution of the Deed, immediately resumed possession, to hold for the do-nee; and has held the slave ever since. Is ihis such an <em>actual </em>and <em>abiding </em>possession in the donee, or one claiming under her, as will satisfy the Law? I am obliged to say, that 1 think not. The very mischief which the law intended to prevent, was \u201cthe donor\u2019s remaining in possession of the slave as the visible owner,\u201d notwithstanding the gift. Is not this case within ' \u2022 &gt;t mischief? A man, at his own house, makes a mere formal i \u25a0 rry of the slave, for a moment, to an infant o\u00ed a few monk: i . Ten resumes it, and holds it ever after.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">But, it is said, he resumes and IroT \u25a0 . A child; and that his possession is hers. What is the ovide . <em>: \u2022 </em>A A witness proves it, and the sealed paper declare:. \u2022 k \u25a0 A; this the evidence the to <em>u </em>. <em>\u25a0.. </em>; - World, that, the possession remains with the do::-... \"\u2022 - r-cter is changed? No! Such evidence can only be fur\u00bb-\u25a0 ! ! <em>i </em>, to be prosed by two witnesses at least, or acknow-' \u25a0 ^ A- donor, and recorded according to Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">It was said in the argument, supp \u201e <em>, </em>of a slave is made to an infant, possession is deli vertv ' . / a third person, (the father, for instance,) to hold /i \u2022\u2022 \u2022 {\u00bb <em>not this </em>be a valid gifi? I answer, yes, undoukA'-;, ; f. :\u201e .k- case, the reason andpolicyof the Law arc satisfied on ef the donor is broken up. lie is no longer the <em>v/siMj. </em>ows <em>n </em>ica-ger re\u2019ains that <em>indicium </em>of title, calculated to deceive the Che possession passes substantially to the donee, and ronAMj AH the father as a trustee for him. The object of this Act being \\&gt; prevent frauitulent gifts of slaves, and thereby to protect croT.c.i; and purchasers, it would seem reasonable <em>to have </em>placed unrecorded Oeods of gift of slaves, on the samo ground, on which the Kh-uro of Frauds places those Deeds which it declares fraudulent and void, as to creditors and purchasers; but which it still pronounces valid between the parties. This, however, was matter of Legislative discretion. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Law is not so written; for, it declares that the Deed shall pass <em>no estate </em>in slaves, unless executed and recorded according to Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">I think the instruction of the Court was right, and that the Judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Tim other Judges concurred, and the Judgment was affirmed,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b117-14\">Judges Cabell, and Gules, absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
