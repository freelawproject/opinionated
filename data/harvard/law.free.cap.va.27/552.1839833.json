Smith, </em>exhibited his Bill to the Chancellor of the Richmond District, setting forth, that in <em>the year 1814, </em>he purchased of a certain <em>William Lamb, </em>a lot of land in the City of Richmond, forty-three foet one way, and one hundred and thirty feet the other, for which ho agreed to give seven hundred dollars: that on the lot thus purchased, there stood a small house, of which, with the lot it\u201esslf, the Plaintiff was immediately put in possession, and that he has paid the whole amount of the purchase money: that being satisfied with the soundness of <em>Lamb's </em>title, and that ho could obtain a title whenever he should demand <em>it, he </em>never did demand it at all, hu\u00ed that some time in the year 1810, the said <em>Lamb </em>and his wife, conveyed to the Plaintiff a totally different piece of land, having no building on it, and worth scarcely one-tenth part of the land actually sold: that the Deed was lodged in the Office, and duly .admitted to record, but was never presented to the Plaintiff, nor accepted by him, nor ever sanctioned by him in any other manner whatever: that there was no written contract between them; but the Complainant exhibits a diagram of the lot purchased, and of that conveyed, by which it appears that they are both ou'thc same square, but the lot conveyed' is at right angles with the lot sold, and the former includes only forty-three feet square (at the remote end,) of the latter, running on to a different street for quantity. Each lot, is however, forty-three feet one way, one hundred and thirty the other. He avers that he never contemplated a purchase of any but the lot on which the house stood, of which, he received possession from the Defendant himself: that he would not have given the same price for the other lot, nor wished to purchase it, as the Defendant well knew. He avers that he did not know of the Deed, until informed of it by the Clerk; he then took the Deed out of the Office, but relying on its correctness in every respect, did not immediately examine it. When he did examine it, he found, to his great surprise, that it was not only imperfect, but did not purport to convey to him the property he had purchased, but different property, which he would not have as a gratuity. Pie immediately communicated these facts to the Defendant, and demanded of him either a Deed for \u2022the lot actually sold, or the return of the purchase monev, both of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>which were refused. As the Deed was thus fraudulently forced upon him, under a total ignorance and mistake on his part, and he refused.to acquiesce in the fraud as soon as it was detected, he prays for relief.

If it be not, he alleges that he himself has been imposed on by <em>Boulton, </em>and that <em>Boulton\u2019s </em>heirs or devisees ought to be made parties to this suit, and compelled to execute the conveyance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-6\">A survey of both lots was ordered by the Court of Chancery. According to the plat returned, it'appears that the diagram, exhibited by the Plaintiff with his Bill, was substantially correct. Each lot was forty-three feet nine inches in front, running back one hundred and thirty-two feet. They fronted on different streets, and were at right angles to each other, the lot'conveyed only including forty-three feet nine inches of the lot sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-7\">Sundry depositions were taken in the cause; and the Court off Chancery, being satisfied that the proofs fully supported the allegations of the Plaintiff\u2019s Bill, decreed, that the Deed from the Defendant to the Plaintiff, be delivered to him to be cancelled, and that the Defendant pay the Plaintiff the sum of seven hundred dollars, with interest thereon from the Sth November, 1S19, till paid, and costs.

Here was a mutual mistake as to the very subject of the contract, and it is void, and should be rescinded, and the parties put <em>in statu- quo, </em>by the repayment of the money, the vendor having no title to the property really sold.
