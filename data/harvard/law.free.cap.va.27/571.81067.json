V answers, denying T\u2019s title or possession, and insisting the award was invalid, because the arbitrator was induced by T to receive evidence and decide the case in V\u2019s absence; and this is sustained by the arbitrator. Held:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b591-7\">1. The award is invalid; and T showing no other evidence of title, the injunction must be dissolved.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b591-9\">2. V, not claiming any relief in the case, but a dissolution of the injunction and dismissal of the bill, may rely upon the invalidity of the award by his answer; and it is unnecessary to file a cross-bill for the purpose of avoiding it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-11\">This was a hill in equity, filed by M. B. Tate in the circuit court of Smyth county, to enjoin and restrain Samuel Vance from cutting the timber on land which he claimed belonged to him. Plaintiff alleged that he purchased the land in 1872 from the McCreadys, who had been in peaceable possession of it for fifty years, and they sold to him, and put him in possession; and that he still holds possession. That, soon after his purchase, Samuel Vance claimed title to a part of this land, consisting of some eight or ten acres. Though plaintiff believed he had a good title to the-land, and was in possession of it, yet not desiring litigation, he and the said Vance agreed to submit the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>matter in dispute between them to the award of one Samuel Cole, and bound themselves to abide by his That under this submission the said Cole heard all the evidence submitted by them both, made a survey of their several lands, and after full hearing, decided that plaintiff was possessed of and had good title to the land in controversy: And he filed a copy of the award. He says the entire value almost of the lands consists of the timber standing upon it. That, since the making of said award, Vance had unlawfully entered upon the said land, and'is engaged in cutting and destroying the timber standing upon it. That, unless restrained, said Vance will inflict irreparable injury upon the plaintiff, as he will destroy the entire value of his estate in the said land; and that he is insolvent. He therefore prays for an injunction to restrain Vance, his servants and employees, from cutting any more timber from the land, and from removing any that he had cut; from any interference with the possession of the plaintiff; and for general relief. The injunction was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-6\">Vance answered the bill. He claimed that a tract of land which had been conveyed to his wife by her father, included this land, and was held under an older title than that under which the plaintiff claimed. That there being a conflict of boundary between the two tracts, he aud Joseph MeCready, in 1857, agreed upon a dividing line; and respondent had moved his fence on this line, and he had ever since been in possession of all the land on his side of this line, including the land in controversy. He denies that the plaintiff, and those under whom he claims, had title to or possession of the land. He says that soon after plaintiff purchased from the McCreadys, he set up a title to this land; and for the sake of peace, respondent agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>submit tbe matter to the award of Samuel Cole. Ho day was fixed for said Cole to hear the parties; but plaintiff, in the absence of respondent, went to said Cole, and, by misrepresenting the facts of the case, prevailed on him to render an award in the case. He denies that the award is valid, because it was procured upon <em>ex parte </em>statements, and was made and delivered in the absence of the respondent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-4\">The only witness examined was the arbitrator Cole. His testimony showed that evidence of the plaintiff was received, and the award made in the absence of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-5\">The cause came on to be heard on the 21st of December 1874, when the court dissolved the injunction, and dismissed the bill with costs. And thereupon, Tate applied to a judge of this court for an appeal; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b593-6\"><em>Gilmore, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b593-7\"><em>J. A. Campbell, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b593-8\">Staples, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AD7\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">The court is of opinion, that the award upon which complainant relied in the court below, being founded upon evidence received by the arbitrator in the absence and without the knowledge or consent of the defendant, is invalid, and furnishes no just claim to relief in a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">The court is further of opinion, that a cross-bill is not necessary to impeach said award; but the same may be done by answer. <em>u </em>The right to an injunction is not <em>ex debito jusiiiice; </em>but the application is addressed to the sound discretion of the chancellor, upon all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>circumstances of each particular case. A party seeking the exercise of this prohibitory power must come with clean hands and with a case sanctioned by the clearest principles of justice. The only foundation for the complainants claim to the interposition of the court is the award. If that be invalid by reason of the misconduct of the arbitrator, or the complainant, a court of equity will not interfere, but leave the party to such remedies as he has, if any, in a court of law. In such case it does not matter whether the objections to the award appear on the face of the bill, or by the answer, or by the evidence. In either case the result is a dismissal of the bill. If the defendant asks nothing beyond such dismissal, there is no good reason why he may not in his answer rely upon any matters which make it inequitable to grant the prayer of the bill. It is only when the defendant goes beyond this, and asks affirmative relief at the hands of the court, that a cross bill is indispensable. The case of <em>German </em>v. <em>Mastrin, </em>2 Paige R. 288, affords an illustration of this principle. It was there held, that the defendant might in his answer, set up an equitable title in himself against the demand of the plaintiff for partition; but if he desires affirmative relief by a decree for a conveyance of the legal title, then vested in the plaintiff, he must file a cross-bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">In this state, the courts have, in a number of cases, .given to the answer all the effects of a cross-bill; and the same course has been occasionally followed by the English courts. And according to the settled practice, a cross-bill is now dispensed with in cases where it was once uniformly required. The court will sometimes of its motion direct a cross-bill to be filed when it is of opinion it is demanded by the purposes of justice. There is no inflexible rule on the subject. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the court is satisfied that the whole merits of the case have been fully developed on bill and answer, no good can be effected by a cross-bill. And there can be no valid reason for putting the parties to the expense and delay of such a proceeding. And this is precisely the aspect of the case before us. The decision turns upon the testimony of the arbitrator. There is no controversy as to the facts stated by him. Neither party can therefore possibly be prejudiced by the failure to file a cross bill, nor can either derive the slightest advantage from having it in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The award being out of the case, and all the allegations of the bill in regard to the plaintiff\u2019s title being denied by the answer and unsustained by proofs, there was no case for the interference of a court of equity. The court is therefore of opinion, that the circuit -court did not err in dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Decree aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
