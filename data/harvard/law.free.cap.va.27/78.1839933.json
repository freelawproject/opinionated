Singleton </em>and <em>Enoch Glasscock, </em>alleging the following facts: That in 1820, the complainant <em>Batton </em>purchased of <em>John F. Singleton </em>a negro boy naxncd <em>Garrison, </em>of about 13 or 14 years of age, at the price of 440 dollars,-. , 340 dollars of which were paid by the complainant to the said Sing-s <em>let\u00f3n, </em>leaving 100 dollars still due: that <em>Singleton </em>shortly aftenvards delivered possession of the said slave to the complainant:' that some time after he held the said slave, and had the said 340 dollars, he found that <em>Glasscock </em>lield a conveyance by Bill of Sale ox\u2019 Deed of Trust from the said <em>Singleton, </em>bearing date a few 85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\u00bfays prior to the complainant\u2019s purehas\u00e9, conveyibg, or purporting to convey, the said negro boy, with one or more other negroes, which conveyance, as the complainant is informed, was in fact given to secure a debt, or supposed debt, of about 600 dollars, which <em>Singleton </em>owed to <em>Glasscock; </em>and <em>Singleton, </em>notwithstanding such conveyance, was suffered to retain the entire possession of the said negro boy, and to remain as the visible owner, without any notice or knowledge, on the part of the complainant, of the said conveyance: that the said <em>Glasscock, </em>(who resided in Loudoun County,) heard of the complainant\u2019s purchase, and about six months thereafter, came to Lewis County, to see the said <em>Singleton </em>on that subject, and came to some agreement or compromise with him, with the terms of which the complainant is not acquainted; although he is now informed, and charges, that <em>Glasscock </em>received property or security, or both by way of substitute, or in <em>lieu </em>of the said negro boy, and perhaps by way of satisfaction or security for his whole demand; that <em>Glass-cock </em>then received of the said <em>Singleton </em>two other negro slaves, and also a bill of exchange, or draft, or written order, on some person in Loudoun, or elsewhere, for about $300, which order was paid to <em>Glasscock, </em>or he made the order his own by retaining the same, without returning it to <em>Singleton, </em>or giving him any notice of the dishonor thereof: that <em>Glasscock, </em>while in Lewis County, publicly declared, and sent word to the complainant, that he had no claim to the said negro boy; because <em>Singleton </em>had settled his business otherwise, and to his satisfaction: that the complainant continued to hold and possess the said negro hoy, till the night of the 19th of November, 1821, when he was clandestinely taken from his possession by <em>Glasscoclt, </em>who had privately travelled to Lewis County, in which he lurked, till that night furnished an opportunity for the seizure, and the complainant has never since been able to regain him, or to ascertain what <em>Glasscock </em>has done with him. The bill prays for a Decree for the said slave with his profits, or, if that cannot be obtained, that the money paid by the complainant, with interest may be decreed, &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-5\">The answer of <em>Singleton </em>states, that it is true, that the complainant purchased the negro in question, and that the Defendant had previously given a <em>lien </em>on the same to <em>Glasscock, </em>and had paid the debt, by letting <em>Glasscock </em>have two other slaves, and giving him an order to a certain <em>W. Byrne </em>of Fauquier County for $440: that the said <em>Byrne </em>accepted the order, as the Defendant has heard, upon some terms agreed on between him and <em>Glasscock: </em>that <em>Glasscock </em>has never returned the said order, or called on the Defendant for payment thereof; but has, as the Defendant is advised, made the order his own, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>hy </em>detaining it: that the Defendant delivered the said boy to <em>Bat~ ion, </em>and that the latter lost his possession of the boy, without the previous knowledge or procurement of the Defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-3\"><em>Glctsscocle </em>answered, saying, that about the end of 1819, or beginning of 1820, <em>Singleion </em>being largely indebted to him, executed a Deed of Trust on three negroes, one of which was the boy in question: that the Deed was duly recorded: that the Defendant went to the County of Lewis, for the purpose of having the said negroes sold under the Deed of Trust, and <em>Singleton </em>proposed to sell the negroes to the Defendant, in preference to have them sold under the Deed of Trust: that this proposition was accepted, and the negroes were sold to this Defendant, in discharge of the debt; and a Bill of Sale was executed fiy <em>Singleton, </em>and the negroes delivered: that at the time of this transaction, <em>Singleton </em>had a large crop to manage, and at his earnest solicitation, the Defendant was prevailed upon to leave two of the negroes with <em>Single-ton, </em>one of whom was the boy <em>Garrison, </em>until about the succeeding Christmas, at which time <em>Singleton </em>undertook to return them; at the same time, the Defendant: pi\u2019omiscd <em>Singleton, </em>that if he paid him $600 at Christmas, he would let him have the negroes back again, and indulge him further for the balance of the purchase money: that at the time last mentioned, <em>Singleton </em>failed to send on the negroes, as he had promised, or to send the $600; in consequence of which, the Defendant, after taking legal advic-c, went out to Lewis County to take possession of his negroes: that upon arriving at the house of <em>Singleton, </em>he got one of the negroes'and received from <em>Singleton, </em>a letter directed to the complainant, directing him to deliver up the boy <em>Garrison, </em>staling that the <em>negro </em>was the property of fhcDefenddant; and that although he had sold the said negro to <em>Batton, </em>he had no right to do so: that the Defendant accordingly called upon <em>Batton </em>for the negro, who denied that: he liad the negro, and stated that he had sold him, and that he was then half way to New Orleans, which statement the Defendant did not believe: that the Defendant returned to <em>Singleton, </em>and informed him of the fact: that the Defendant then proposed to <em>Singleton </em>to give him an order on his Agent in Fauquier County, <em>William Byrne, </em>for $440, the amount he was to receive for the boy; with an understanding, that if he received the amount; of the order, the Defendant should not trouble himself further upon the subject; but, if he did not receive it, he should enforce his right to the boy: that <em>Singleton </em>accordingly gave the order hereto annexed; but, upon application to <em>Byrne, </em>there were no funds in his hands to meet the order: that <em>Byrne </em>offered a conditional acceptance depending on the event of a suit in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Chancery; which the Defendant refused to accept, but was conten\u00ed to receive the money if it came to the hands of <em>Byrne, </em>by the time contemplated, to avoid litigation: that the Defendant, some time afterwards, was informed that the negro was in the' possession of <em>Button, </em>and that he had deceived him by a false statement of his having been sold: that in consequence of the advice of Counsel, he repaired to the neighborhood of <em>Button, </em>and took the boy from the kitchen of <em>Nation, </em>&amp;e. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"pAEj\">The Chancellor decreed that the Defendant <em>Glasscock, </em>should deliver to the complainant the slave <em>Garrison, </em>and that the Defendant should render an account of the profits of the said slaver The Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-5\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-6\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b73-7\"><em>November </em>13.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AaM\">Judge Cqalter</author>\n<p id=\"Ae4\">delivered his opinion, in which the other Judges concurred.'<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The jurisdiction of a Court of Chancery, I think, can he maintained in this case, if on no other ground, on the one taken in the argument, that if the Plaintiff in Equity had sued at Law, he could have been successfully resisted by the mortgage, which was duly recorded. Even if the Bill of Sale had been produced there, it might-not have been a clear case at Law, that it was a release of the mortgage, so as, in that Court, to divest the legal title, and leave the Defendant simply on his title under the Bill of Sale. This, however, would be the consequence in a Court of Chancery, where <em>substance </em>is looked to, as decided in the case of <em>Clayborne </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>1 Wash. 177. There it was decided, that the mortgage, being recorded, was not fraudulent and void by reason that the possession remained \u2018with the mortgagor; but that the subsequent absolute Bill of Sale operated as a release of the mortgage, and became the title under which the bargainee held; and that a continued possession in the bargainor afterwards,- rendered that conveyance void. But the Defendant could have -kept that Bill of Sale in his pocket, so that a resort must have been had to a Court of Equity to extract i$and if, for this purthe Appellee had a right to come into Equity, I can see no reason why he should not claim relief also there; so as to have possession restored, and an account of hires and profits. Besides, he had a right to go into Equity, in order to enquire into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>compromiso between the Appellant and <em>Singleton </em>the bargainor, and 1 lie compensation received under thet agreement. Had the slave not been taken from the possession of the Appellee in the manner he was, the Appellant must have sued at Law; and had he recovered there under his mortgage, the Appellee surely could have enquired into these matters, in a Court of Equity. The manner of that possession, admit\u00ed ing that it was not a stealing, (as it has been denominated at the bar) and was not absolutely illegal, provided the party could have shown a better title, is nevertheless such a procedure, as floes not deserve the countenance of Courts of Justice, and cannot be insisted on, in Equity, as placing the party on higher ground than ho would have occupied, had it not taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">As to the merits, it seems to me, that on both points, they are equally clear for the Appelle. <em>Twyne\u2019s </em>Case, 3 Co. 80, where it was held that absolute conveyances of goods, not accompanied by possession, are fraudulent and void, \u201cfor that the donor continueth in possession, and useth them as his own\u00bb, and by reason thereof he tradeth and trafficketh with others, and defrauds and deceives them,\u201d followed up by the cases of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harbin; Hamilton </em>v. <em>Russel, </em>and by the case of <em>Clayborne </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>above noticed; <em>Fitzhugh </em>v. Anderson, 2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 289, and <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Deneale, 2 </em>Munf. 341, and other cases in this Court, clearly show, that the Bill of Sale to the Appellant was fraudulent and void as to the Appellee, \u25a0at the time he made his purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">But, it is argued, that the Appellee cannot avail himself of this, because <em>he </em>also permitted the property to remain with the seller, and that <em>his </em>purchase therefore was void.</p>\n<p id=\"pACqA\">In the first place, it does not appear to me, that this is proved. Delivery at the moment of the sale, is not necessary. The possession must remain, and if it did so, it was a matter very susceptible of proof. The Appellee was found in the Appellant, and although it does not appear when that possession wras acquired, yet, as this Court will not presume a fraud, there ought to have been proof of it by him, who seeks to avail himself of such fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">But, if it were otherwise, and if we must take it that it did so remain, still if he got possession before any one was deceived, and became a purchaser thereof, it is not void. I speak of subsequent purchasers, not of creditors. The Appellant is not such a purchaser; and I cannot perceive how this prior purchase, which was void as aforesaid at the time the Appellee purchased and paid his money, can be reinstated, so as to place him in the condition of a subsequent purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>seems, indeed, not to be contended for to this extent; but, it is said, that there is par delictum, and that there is equal Equity, and the Appellant, not only being prior in time, but being Defendant in Equity, must prevail. But, it seems to me, that this is not so as to either point. It is true, if there had been a subsequent purchaser to both, neither could have prevailed against him, if possession remained, as has been alleged. He would have advanced his money, and must have held the property; but, the Appellant was not so deceived, did not so advance his money. The Appelle, however, was so deceived by the conduct of the Appellant, and so there is no <em>par </em>delictum, and the Equity is not equal.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">As to the compromise and compensation received by the Appellant from <em>Singleton, </em>it is clearly proved by many witnesses, and it is admitted, that it would have put this case to <em>rest, </em>had it not been entered into, as is alleged, in consequence of a false suggestion by the Appellee, that the slave was not in his possession when demanded. This suggestion, true or false, eoidd only have operated on the Appellant, so as to prevent his <em>summary mode of redress, </em>afterwards resorted to. It could no more have a suit the pellee, or caused the appellant to resort for satisfaction to <em>Singleton, </em>than if he had simply refused to deliver him. But, how was the fact? The Appellant admits in his answer, that he did not believe this statement; and he also admits, that before he made the compromise, he had taken the advice of <em>Pinddl, </em>as to <em>this summary redress. </em>But he wished, probably, to avoid the scandal of such a transaction, and preferred trying to obtain satisfaction from <em>Singleton. </em>This he did, and procured an order for $440, bearing interest, the price which the Appellee gave for the slave. The price of the three negroes sold to this Appellant, being about $1,100, and the two he received, being about twenty years of age, and one about eighteen, whilst the one in dispute was about twelve, it is fair to presume that he considered he obtained more than he gave for him. Nor is it at all unlikely that he should so have expressed himself, when speaking of the transaction. The witnesses, who testify to this, are in no otherwise discredited, and ought not be disbelieved from the mere improbability of such a conversation, especially as many others prove his declarations, that he had made the compromise and was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">On every ground, therefore, the Decree must be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b73-9\"> The Phesidest, and Judge Ghees, absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
