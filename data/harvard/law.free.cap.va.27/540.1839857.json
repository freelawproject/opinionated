The names of the negroes were, <em>Phill, </em>a man, <em>Ford, </em>a boy, Henry, a boy, and a woman, <em>Dorcas, </em>and her child, <em>Sam. </em>And to the report was also appended a certificate of the Clerk of the Court, that the above allotment was exhibited in Court Dec ember 9th, 1805, and ordered to be recorded. To the introduction of which paper the Defendant objected, because the said order of Court, and the proceedings thereupon had, were without any suit for the .division of the estate of <em>Thomas Jones, </em>and because <em>Pleasant Rosser, </em>the second husband of Mrs. <em>Jones, </em>under whom the Defendant claims, was no party to the proceedings; but, the Court over-ruled .the objection,-and admitted the paper as evidence, the Plaintiff being at liberty to prove by other evidence, that the said <em>Pleasant Rosser </em>was a party in procuring the order of Court, and consenting \u2022to the division at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-7\">The Plaintiff further, introduced in evidence an Answer of (he Defendant, <em>Benjamin Hunter, </em>to a Bill in Equity, exhibited by one <em>iJofin Talbot, </em>against the said <em>Hunter, </em>and <em>Pleasant BOsser, </em>Defendants; in which Answer, the Defendant says, l&lt; That the Defendant, <em>Pleasant Rosser, </em>having intermarried with the widow of <em>Thomas </em>J <em>ones, </em>acquired in her right a number of slaves, and amongst others, the slave <em>Ford: </em>that he has been informed, and believes, that <em>Ford </em>was allotted, by the Commissioners appointed to divide the es-fate \u00b0f <em>Thomas Jones, </em>as a part of Mrs. <em>Rosser\u2019s </em>dower slaves in the estate of her first husband: that <em>some time </em>in the year \u25a01-812, <em>Pleasant Rosser </em>proffered to sell <em>Ford to </em>the Defendant telling him that he could readily procure from <em>Powhatan Jones </em>the only child, of his wife by her first husband, a release of any right or title which he might have at his mother\u2019s death; and the Defendant, having a short time before, had a conversation with <em>Powhatan </em>J <em>ones, </em>had reason to believe that <em>Rosser, </em>by releasing his title to some other slaves claimed by said <em>Jones, </em>would have it in his power to procure a release -from <em>Jones </em>to <em>Ford, </em>and consented to become the purchaser of <em>Ford, </em>provided his title was secured: <em>Rosser </em>thereupon proposed to execute a Deed of Trust upon <em>Daniel, </em>to SGeure the title of Ford; which being satisfactory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>the Defendant became the purchaser of <em>Ford </em>at his full value: that <em>Pleasant Rosser </em>has altogether failed to procure a release from <em>Powhatan Jones, </em>of <em>Ford, </em>and the Defendant, without knowing the situation of his title to <em>Ford, </em>yet as <em>Poiohatan </em>J <em>ones </em>claims title to him at the death of his mother, and as the Defendant has been informed, and believes that he was allotted, by Commissioners appointed to divide the estate of <em>Thomas </em>J <em>ones, </em>deceased, to Mrs. <em>Rosser </em>for life only, he conceives himself well entitled to claim the benefit, as he docs claim the benefit, of the provisions of the Deed of Trust, &amp;c.\u201d The whole Record, of which this Answer formed a part, was exhibited in Court The Defendant objected to its going in evidence, because the Plaintiff in this action was not a party in. that suit in Chancery; but, the Court over-ruled the objection, and admitted the answer to be read to the Jury, for the purpose of proving the declarations of the Defendant in regard to his knowledge of the title to the slave in controversy, aj^the time of his pur-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-4\">The Plaintiff further introduced of proving the declarations of <em>Pleasant Rosser, </em>under whonrtfe Defendant claims title to the slave in controversy..* \u00ed MWtl??l Ira tons after said <em>Rosser </em>had sold the slav\u00ae 'TTO,i)eKntMlF%'mected.

To these several opinions, the Defendant exempted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-7\">The second Bill of Exceptions states, that the Defendant\u2019s Counsel, in the course of his argument, laid it down to be law, that a parol gift of a slave, was void as to creditors, and subsequent purchasers for a valuable consideration, unless such gift come to the possession, and remain with the donee, and not with the donor; whereupon the Court stopped the Counsel, and said that was not the law in case of infants, and instructed the Jury that a parol gift of a slave bv <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>a parent to an infant child living with him, was good without any delivery of possession other than the declaration that the gift was then made, even against a subsequent purchaser for a valuable consideration, from such parent, if the purchaser, at the time of the purchase, know that such slave had been so given to the infant, although the parent should retain the possession of such slave, from the time of the gift until the sale. To this opinion the Defendant excepted. The third Bill of Exceptions states, that it having appeared in evidence that the slave in question never did belong to the Plaintiff\u2019s father, in his life-time, but was bought by the Plaintiff's mother, while a widow, who had taken a Bill of Sale for him and others, which is set out: (the Bill of Sale is executed by <em>lessee Jones </em>to <em>Judith Jones, </em>dated 14th February, 1798, and conveys five negroes, of whom <em>Ford </em>is one, for the consideration of \u00dc00/.): the Plaintiff Lhen offered proof to show that the purchase made ly his mother, was paid for with the money derived from his fathers estate, and paid by his, the Plaintiff\u2019s Guardian, after the division of the estate; and that at the time when the division was made, and his mother\u2019s dower of the estate of his father was allotted to her, she and her second husband, <em>P. Rosser, </em>were present, and rendered up the slaves which had been so purchased, as part of the estate of her deceased husband, and made no other account of the profits of the estate, from the death of her husband until the said division; and (hat the Plaintiff\u2019s Guardian being present, agiccd to accept, and did accept, the slaves as part of the Plaintiff's father\u2019s estate, instead of any other account of profits, and so placed them before the Commissioners, with the consent of the said <em>Rosser </em>and wife, and to be counted as part of said estate, of which dower was to be allotted: whereupon the Plaintiff contended that, by consent of both parties concerned, the said slaves became, the slaves of his father\u2019s estate, and that the one in question being part of those assigned as dower slaves became a for his mothers death, the property of <em>the </em>Plaintiff, this suit being instituted since her death. The Counsel for the DePu-buat contended, that if the slave never belonged to the Plaintiff\u2019s father, but was purchased by the mother, after her widowhood, the slave never could become the estate of the father, so as to be the subject of dower to the mother. But the Court instructed the Jury, that by consent of the parties interested,'a slave thus circumstanced might bo substituted, and pass as part of the dower slaves of a widow: snd if the Jury should be of opinion, from the evidence before them, that such consent was made by the parties interested at the time, and acted upon accordingly, the slave must pass to the Plaintiff, in like manner as if he had been the pronertv of his father in his life<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>tniie. To this opinion the Defendant excepted. Yerdictand Judgment were thereupon rendered for the Plaintiff, and the Defendant appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b423-4\">Johnson, for the Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b423-5\"><em>Wyndha?n Robertson, </em>for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"b423-6\"><em>October </em>31.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A6eZ\">Judge Coalter</author>\n<p id=\"Amg3\">delivered his opinion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Although this ease is rendered somewhat obscure, from the man* tier in which the points arising are stated in the various Bills of Exceptions, it seems to be substantially a case of this nature:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\"><em>Thomas Jones </em>departed this life intestate, leaving a widow and an only child, the present Plaintiff, who was an infant.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">The widow administered on the estate, and having received the estate, and also derived considerable profit therefrom, she, with the assent of the Guardian of the child, made a purchase of several slaves, with the monies of the estate, and amongst them, the slave in controversy. The widow afterwards intermarried with <em>Pleasant Rosser, </em>after which, an order of Court was made, (on whose motion is not stated in the Record,) appointing Commissioners to assign to the widow her share of the real and personal estate. <em>Rosser </em>and <em>Wife, </em>and the Guardian of the infant, attended at the division made by the Commissioners, where the husband and wife brought forward the slaves so purchased, as part of the estate of the intestate, and made no other account of the profits of the estate, and the Guardian of the infant agreed to accept the same as part of the father\u2019s estate, instead of any other account of profits; and thus, by the assent of all parties, they were treated and divided by the Commissioners as of the estate of the intestate. Five slaves were thus allotted to the widow, including <em>Ford, </em>the slave in controversy, and <em>Dorcas </em>and her son. <em>Sam; </em>which <em>Dorcas </em>was probably also one of the slaves so purchased, as one of that name is in the Bill of Sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">The division thus made, was returned to Court and recorded. After this, the Defendant purchased the slave <em>Ford </em>from <em>Rosser. </em>The manner of this transaction is detailed in an Answer of the Defendant to a Bill in Chancery exhibited against him and others, in relation to a slave named <em>Daniel, </em>by one <em>Talbot, </em>in which he states, that <em>Rosser, </em>having intermarried with the widow of <em>Thomas Jones, </em>acquired, in her right, a number of slaves, and amongst others, the slave <em>Ford, </em>and'that he is informed, and believes, that <em>Ford </em>was allotted by' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Comissioncrs appointed to divide the estate of <em>Thomas Jones, </em>as part of Mrs. <em>Rosser\u2019s </em>dower slaves: that <em>Rosser </em>proffered to sell <em>Ford </em>to him, telling him he could procure from the Plaintiff a release of any right he might have at his mother\u2019s death; and that having had a communication with the Plaintiff a short time before, from which he was led to believe that such release might be procured on certain terms, he became the purchaser, on <em>Rosser\u2019s </em>executing a Deed of Trust on the slave <em>Daniel, </em>to secure the <em>title of Ford: </em>that the Defendant therefore claims the benefit, of the Deed of Trust on <em>Daniel, </em>until the title to <em>Ford </em>is perfected, <em>Rosser </em>having failed to procure the, release, and the Plaintiff asserting his title to <em>Ford </em>after the-death of his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Thus it seems the matter rested, fill after the death of Mrs. <em>Rosser, </em>when the Plaintiff instituted this suit for the recovery of <em>Ford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The first Bill of Exceptions sets out the order of Court appointing Commissioners, and their report. These documents were objected to, because there had been no suit for the division of the estate, and because <em>Pleasant Rosser </em>was no party to the proceedings; but, the Court over-ruled the objections, and admitted thepaper as- evidence, the Plaintiff being at liberty\u2019- to prove by other evidence, that <em>Rosser </em>was a party in procuring the order of Court, and present at, and consenting to, the division. The same Bill of Exceptions sets out the. Answer o\u00ed the Defendant above noticed, which was offered by\u2019 the Plaintiff, and objected to by the Defendant, because the Plaintiff in this suit was no party tolhat suit; which fact, to save the expense of copying the whole Record, was admitted. This objection was over-ruled, and the Answer admitted to be read, in order to prove the declarations of the Defendant in regard to <em>his </em>knowledge of the title-to the slave at the time of his purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">It is furthermore sot out in this Bill of Exceptions, that the Plaintiff introduced a witness to prove the declarations of <em>Rosser, </em>under whom the Defendant claims title, hut the Defendant objected to any evidence of ibe declarations of <em>Rosser, </em>made after he had sold the slave in question. But. the Court allowed the Plaintiff to prove any declarations of <em>Rosser, </em>respecting the division of the estate of <em>Thomas Jones, </em>and which were calculated to show how, and upon what considerations it happened that the slave in question was held, and' regarded bv him and his wife, as part of the estate of <em>Jones, </em>though purchased- by the Administratrix, after the death of said Jones, or any declarations which admitted that said slave was purchased for the estate, and ivas paid for with the money of the estate; also, any declarations which went to an acknowledgment that, said <em>Rosser </em>was-present at the time of the allotment, set out, in the documents before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>referred to, no matter at what time these declarations were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">For the contents of the second Bill of Exceptions, see the state-' ment prefixed to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The third Bill of Exceptions sets out the testimony as to the purchase of the slave by the Widow and Administratrix, with the monies of the estate as first above staled, and the instruction of the Court, that by consent of the parties interested, a slave thus circumstaaccd might be substituted, and pass as part of the dower of a widow; and that if the Jury should be of opinion, from the evidence, that such consent was made by the parties at the time, and acted on accordingly, the slave must pass to the Plaintiff, in like manner as if he had been the of the Plaintiff\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The Jury being satisfied of the facts stated in this last Bill of Exceptions, and being no doubt also satisfied of the fact, that the Defendant had full notice of the Plaintiff\u2019s claim, and that ho had taken satisfactory security for the title when he made the purchase, there can be no doubt where the justice of this case lies. The only question is, whether any thing has been decided by the Court which shall make it necessary to reverse the Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The order of Court, and the report of the Commissioners, were properly admitted as evidence, especially when connected with the other facts, showing the assent, and presence of all parties at the time of the allotment. The Answer too, was properly admitted, to show that the Defendant was informed that the slave in dispute had been allotcd, and that the Plaintiff claimed him after the death of his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">And as to the declarations made by <em>Rosser, </em>after the sale to the Defendant, that such allotment had been made, and that the slave was held by him and his wife under it, as stated in the Bill of Exceptions, however that matter might have been but for the disclosures and circumstances stated in the Answer set out in the first Bill of Exceptions, yret as these declarations were in accordance with the notice the Defendant admits he received before his purchase, I cannot say they were improperly admitted to go to the Jury. They were mere repetitions of what the vendor had, in perfect fairness, made known to his vendee at the time of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">So, too, as to the facts set out in the third Bill of Exceptions, if they were believed by the Jury, they well warranted the conclusion they were instructed they might draw from them, to wit, that as the parties had agreed to consider the slaves, purchased with 0 the monies of the estate, as though they orignally belonged to it, and had treated them as such, instead of calling the Administratrix to account for the estate, it was an arrangement that bound her and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>husband, and was equally binding on those claiming under him, so as to vest the title in the Plaintiff, in like manner as if they had belonged to the intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The only remaining question, is that arising out of the second Bill of Exceptions, as to the parol gift of a slave by a parent to an infant child, residing with him. As an abstract point of Law, this I think was badly decided, and how such a question could arise in this case, in which nothing is said about a <em>gift of </em>a slave, is not perceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">liad an instruction been asked for on that point, it seems to me, it might well have been refused on that ground; and had the Court simply told the Jury, that however the Law might be on that point, as there was no case before them involving the question, it would he improper for them to consider it. I presume there would have been no doubt of the propriety of such direction. It would seem to me hard and unreasonable, therefore, that an erroneous opinion of a Court on a point, which, <em>decided either way, </em>would not affect the case before them, should have the effect of reversing a Judgment, clearly right, according to the merits of the case really before the Court and Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">As at present advised, I am not inclined to reverse the Judgment on this ground. If we did so, we could only direct that on a new trial, if the case should be made out as one of a <em>parol gift </em>of the slave in dispute, no such direction should be given. But as no such case had been insisted on, but the reverse, as expressly stated in the third Bill of Exceptions, it would surely be idle to send it back under the preposterous idea that the Plaintiff would make out such a case, and thereby clearly defeat his own claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Judges Cabell and Carr concurred that the Judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-11\"> Absent, the Presides! and Green.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
