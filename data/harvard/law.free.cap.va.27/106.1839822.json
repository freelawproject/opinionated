The Defendant pleaded, 1st, that -the writing aforesaid is not the Deed of the said <em>Gardner; </em>2d, payment; and 3d, fully administered. On these pleas, issue was joined. The Jury found a verdict, \u201c that the writing obligatory in the Declaration mentioned, is the Deed of the Defendant\u2019s intestate; that the debt in the Declaration mentioned hath not been paid, &amp;c-, and that <em>\u201cassets sufficient hath come to the h&amp;nds of the administrator to pay the same: that he hath not fully administered the said </em>assets.\u201d The Court gave Judgment for the amount of the penalty in the Declaration mentioned, &amp;c., to be discharged, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">A Bill of Exceptions was also tiled to the opinion of the Court, excluding <em>irons </em>the Jury, sundry papers containing, as alleged, the .hand-writing, and particularly the signatures of the attesting witness, <em>Benjamin Faulkner, </em>and of the obligor, <em>,dnlhony </em>Gardener, with the evidence of certain witnesses, that thex saw the said <em>Faulkner </em>and <em>Gardner </em>sign the said papers; for tine purpose of enabling the Jury to compare the said writing*, wh^n so proved to be authentic, with the signatures of the f-aid attesting witness and obligor in is \u00edourOu!, This evidence offered, after conflicting evidence had been giver- by the Plaintiff and Defendant, of the hand-valting of the subscribing witness and obligor. As this question, however,, is expressly waived <em>by </em>the Court, in their opinion- no furlhev notice need be take\u00bb of it</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-7\">The Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-8\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the Appellant</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Amu\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the Appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"b91-9\"><em>January </em>25.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A4k\">Judge Greek'.</author>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">The verdict in this case is clearly ins'ufluuenl. in respect to' thfc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>plea of fully administered. The verdict upon that plea should ascertain the amount of <em>assets </em>in the hands of the Defendant, at the commencement of the suit, and at the time of the plea pleaded, to enable the Court to pronounce the proper Judgment. If, at 1he infititution of the suit, there be outstanding debts of superior dignity, or unsatisfied Judgments, the Defendant must plead them specially, or he cannot avail himself of them upon the general plea of <em>plene udminisiravit, </em>unless he has actually paid them before pleading; in which case, those payments would be embraced in the terms of the plea and issue. So, if assests came to the Defendant\u2019s hands after the commencement of the suit, and before pleading, he would be chargeable in respect to them, in that suit: for, the plea must, allege that there were no assets in the hands of the Defendant to be administered, either at the lime of the commencement of the action, or at any time since; and the Judgment <em>when assets </em>refers to the time of the plea pleaded; so that, as to the assets received after that time, no inquiry can be made in that suit: and upon a <em>Scire Facias </em>upon a Judgment <em>when assets, </em>such assets can be subjected, although received pending the former suit after pleading; and payments made after the same time, to debts of equal or superior dignity to the Plaintiff\u2019s Judgment, would be available as a defence to the <em>Facias. </em>The verdict ought, therefore, to find, not only the amount of assets in the hands of the Defendants at the commencement of the suit, or that they wore sufficient to pay the Plaintiff's demand; but, also the amount in his hands at the time of pleading, or that they were sufficient to pay the Plaintiff\u2019s demand: since the Defendant might have received or duly disbursed assets, or b-.:h, received and disbursed, between the commencement of the aeJon and the time of pleading. If the Defendant is found to have i o ,,\u2018s hands, assets not sufficient to pay the Plaintiff\u2019s demand, -e of pleading, the Judgment would be for so much of the civ c 1 3 amount of assets in hand, <em>de bonis test a l oris; </em>and for the i - \u25a0 .... ,-f the debt, out of the assets of the \u00a1.\u00abstater, which came to tin \u2019 edant\u2019s hands since the plea pleaded, or might thereafter conn- b h.s hands. And as to the costs, the} would depend upon the fte,;, , c t appeared upon the record, whether the Defendant ivas in dofaun. or not. 2 <em>Chitt. Pl. </em>451; 1 <em>Saund. </em>336, <em>a., note </em>10; <em>Booth\u2019s ex\u2019r. </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>2 Wash. 301; <em>Rogers\u2019 adm\u2019r. </em>v. <em>Chandler's admx. </em>3 Munf. 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The verdict in this care finds, that assets sufficient to pa)' the Plaintiff\u2019s demand \u201chath come\u201d to the Defendant\u2019s hands, without saying <em>when. </em>It might kwe been between the institution o\u00ed' 1 he. suit, and the filing of the nka: in which ease, it might a\u00f1e^ the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>question of-costs, in some cases, if not ffi.jthis:- or after the plea pleaded, iri which case, they could not Have'been subjected in this suit, and would have been entirely out of the issue. Not does this part of the finding negative the allegation,\" that the Defendant had fully administered the assets which came to his hands; but, the verdict proceeds further to find, that the Defendant hath not fully administered, without ascertaining how much rerhmned unadministered, at the time of the plea pleaded. If a Judgment <em>tie bonis </em>testa<em>ioris </em>were entered on this verdict, such a would not, it is true, bind the Defendant in respect to the <em>cfuatiium </em>of assets, for which he was responsible, in a subsequent action suggesting a <em>devastavit; </em>but, would leave the question \"entirely open, as if the issue on that point had not been joined- in- this cause. But, th\u00e9 Defendant had a right to have that question tried, and finally decided, in this suit; a of which the Court eaniiot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">For these reasons, the Judgment must be -reversed <em>in toto, </em>th-e verdict set-aside, anda <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.. There is no example of a verdict being set aside as to one?issue,\u2019 Suidsuifered to stand as to others, ahd trying a cause by picee-tbe\u00e1l. &gt;i - \"</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The Court purposely avoids deciding the point raised by the Bill of Exceptions; that question being of great importance, and the Court not being full, and it may not occur upon the new trial, or may be presented in another or more distinct form.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">. The other Judges concurred, and the Judgment was reversed <em>in to to, </em>the ve\u00eddict set.aside, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b93-12\"> The Presides! and Judge Coameu, absent,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
