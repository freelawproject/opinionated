Every person has a natural right, <em>ex jure natures, </em>to support to his land from the adjacent and subjacent soil.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b97-9\">2. This natural right to support exists in respect of land only, and not in respect of buildings; but the former right remains though houses are built on the land.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b97-11\">3. But a right to support for buildings may be acquired; and when so acquired it is an easement.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b97-13\">4. An easement for support of a building is acquired by grant, which may be express, implied or presumed. And when acquired it gives the same right of support in respect of the buildings that there was <em>ex jure natures </em>in respect of the land.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b97-15\">5. The grant of such an easement will be presumed from twenty years enjoyment; and will be implied, in the absence of express stipulations,'\"in every case where the owner of adjoining houses or of houses and lands severs the property by sale. Rights of support in such cases are mutually granted and reserved between the original owner and first grantee, and the second grantee succeeds to the owner\u2019s reserved rights.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b97-17\">6. M owns two adjoining lots in R. He conveys one with a house on it to R and reserves in the deed the right to join the two end walls of the house free of costs. M retained the right, which passed with the land to those who derive title under him, to join his building to that conveyed to R, by an independent wall along side of it, or to make it a part of his building by joining only the end walls: and the privilege of joining R\u2019s building in the mode indicated in the reservation, did not extinguish or impair his implied reservation of support.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b97-19\">7. If S holding title to the second lot had a building upon it, which was supported by the land and building conveyed to R for twenty years or more with the knowledge of the owner thereof, prior to a fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>which destroyed both buildings, a grant of the easement of support will be presumed; and said easement was not lost or extinguished by the destruction of S\u2019s building, but adhered to the building S erected on its ruins; and any right of support which S derived from the reservation in the deed to R, express or implied, was not extinguished by the destruction of the old building, but survived and adhered to the new one.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b98-4\">8. The mere fact of contiguity of buildings imposes an obligation upon the owners, to usfe due care and skill in removing the one building, not to damage the other, even though no right to support has been acquired.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b98-5\">9. But if in such case S is entitled to the support of her building by the foundation wall and land of W, claiming under R, W cannot withdraw the support without being liable in damages for the injury which occurs to S thereby.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b98-6\">10. In such a case S is not bound to protect her building by providing other supports, in place of the supports which W is removing, though she may have had notice that W was removing the supports.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b98-7\">11. If the house of S was so badly constructed and its foundation and materials were so defective that the fall could not have been arrested by timely precautions when W was excavating upon his lot in order to build upon it, these facts would not constitute a bar to the action of S against W, so as to defeat it; but they would be proper to be considered by the jury upon the question of damages.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b98-8\">12. Though W contracted with an experienced and competent excavator, <em>If </em>of good standing in his business, to make the excavations upon his j own lot, and gave notice thereof to S in time to enable her to adopt \u00a1 precautions for the protection of her adjoining building, W is still liable for any damage that may have resulted to S\u2019s building in consequence of negligence or unskillfulness in the making of said excavation by reason of leaving insufficient support to S\u2019s premises.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b98-13\">13. If upon a trial instructions are given to the jury, to which no exception is taken, and after verdict a motion is made for a new trial, on the ground of misdirection as well as that the verdict is contrary to the evidence, it is the duty of the court of trial to consider the correctness of the .instructions, and if of opinion that they are not correct, and were calculated to mislead the jury, to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial; and the appellate court will supervise his actions in this respect.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>This was an action of trespass on the case in the \u2022Circuit court of the city of Richmond, brought in April 1872, by L. T. Stevenson against Charles Wallace, to recover damages for injury to the plaintiff\u2019s house by excavation by the defendant made on his adjoining lot. On the trial the judge gave several instructions to the jury, to which the plaintiff did not except; and there was a verdict and judgment for the \u2022defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">The instructions are as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">\u201c 1. The jury are instructed, that the plaintiff was not entitled to demand of the defendant the lateral support of his land for her adjoining building to any extent which deprived him of the right to excavate thereon for the purpose of building, or imposed upon him liability for damages consequent upon the prudent and careful exercise of that right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">\u201c2. But the jury are further instructed, that it was the duty of the defendant before proceeding to make his excavation and endanger the safety of the plain-tiif\u2019s building, to give her timely notice to enable her to adopt suitable precautions for the protection of her property; and that if he failed to do so, he was guilty of negligence, and is liable to the plaintiff for such damages as were consequent upon the excavation, and which the plaintiff could not after knowledge of the -danger avert by prompt and diligent action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-9\">\u201c3. If the jury believe from the evidence, that the building of the plaintiff was so badly constructed, and its foundation and materials so defective, that the fall could not have been averted by timely precautions when the excavation was made by the defendant, or that the plaintiff, or her agents, after they had knowledge of the necessity, could have then, by prompt and provident action, protected the building, and neg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>lected to do so, or that they prevented the defendant from doing so by refusing to allow him to build a. on that part of his wall occupied by the plaintiff, or by retaining illegal possession and oceupancy of a part of his rear wall, in either event the plaintiff' cannot recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-6\">\u201c4. The court instructs the jury, that if they believe from the evidence that the defendant contracted with an experienced and competent excavator, of good standing in his business, to make the excavations in the declaration mentioned upon the defendant\u2019s own lot, and gave notice thereof to the plaintiff in time to enable her to adopt precautions for the protection of her adjoining building, or if she had such knowledge in such time, the defendant is not liable for any damage which may have resulted to the plaintiff\u2019s premises in consequence of negligence or unskillfulness, if any, in the making of said excavation by reason of leaving insufficient support to the plaintiff\u2019s premises or otherwise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">At the same term the plaintiff moved the court to set aside the judgment and verdict and grant her a new trial, on the grounds that the verdict was contrary to the evidence, and that the court had misdirected the jury; and the court set aside the judgment; and not being advised of its judgment to be given on the motion to set aside the verdict, time was taken to consider thereof until the next term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-8\">At the next term of the court, the court overruled the motion for a new trial; and the plaintiff excepted; and the evidence being in some respects contradictory the court declined to certify the facts proved, but certified the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-9\">By deed bearing date the 1st of May 1817, Joseph Marx and wife conveyed to Thomas Richardson a lot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>on Thirteenth street, between Main and Cary streets, in the city of Richmond, with a brick tenement thereon; and Marx reserved to himself the right joining the two end walls of said tenement free cost. This is the lot owned by the defendant Wallace.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">By another deed, bearing date the 8th of July 1817, Joseph Marx and wife conveyed to Mary Stevenson a lot on Thirteenth street, adjoining the lot he had conveyed to Richardson; and further conveyed to her the privilege of joining the end walls of the brick tenement conveyed to Richardson free of cost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-8\">Buildings were standing on both these lots on the 3rd of April 1865, when they were consumed in the great fire of that day. In the year 1866 plaintiff\u2019s lot was leased to one Bauman, for the term of five years, who bound himself to erect a building thereon; and Bauman did erect the building, and at the end of his lease he rented the premises for six months; and during this period the plaintiff\u2019s building fell. It appeared in evidence, that in building, Bauman had built the main building upon a new foundation close against the foundation wall of the old building on the defendant\u2019s lot, which was standing thereon at the time Marx conveyed to Richardson, and had been burnt in 1865, but from the end of the house had occupied the wall of the defendant as a support for a kitchen in the rear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-9\">It was further shown in evidence that the defendant in the fall of 1872, proposing to build upon his lot, contracted with a mechanic in writing as follows: \u201cI propose to clean out the cellar on 13th street, which you spoke to me about to the depth of nine feet, below the offset on the wall adjoining, for one hun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>dred and forty-four dollars, and clean and hack the bricks for sixty cents per thousand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-10\">W.

The' excavation was completed some time in the month of January, 1872, to a depth of three feet below the old foundation, which was deeper than the foundation of plaintiff\u2019s house; that a margin of a foot at the top and a foot and a half at the bottom was left between plaintiff\u2019s building and the excavation. It did not appear that the defendant gave any notice to the plaintiff or her agents of his proposed excavation, and no apprehension of danger seems to have been entertained until February 12th, 1872, when the tenant of plaintiff called attention of her agent to the matter; but it did appear that at a sale of the property on December 14th, 1871, after the excavation was complete to the depth of two and a half feet below the old foundation, the defendant had called attention of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, who was then present, to the fact that the kitchen of plaintiff\u2019s lot was built upon his wall and interfered with his proposed build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>ing; and that some negotiation was had between them with regard to the removal of the kitchen, but that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel did not. agree to remove wall. After the 12th of February, 1872, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel communicated with the defendant the apprehensions entertained about the security of her house, and required him to take measures for its security. This he refused to do; and nothing was done \u25a0until March 16th 1872, when the plaintiff\u2019s agents were ordered by the chief of the police of the city of Eichmond, to whom the tenant had made complaint, to protect the building. And thereupon the plaintiff\u2019s agent employed an experienced bricklayer to proceed to underpin and protect the building, addressing the following letter to the defendant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-6\">\u201cEichmond, Ya., March 18, 1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-7\">Dear Sir:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-8\">We separated on Saturday with the understanding that I should inform you what action Mrs. Stevenson\u2019s agents should finally determine on in view of your refusal, then made known, to underpin or protect her house by building, except upon conditions with which she could not comply, as to allowing you to take down the old wall in the rear, &amp;c.

There was conflicting evidence before the jury as to the manner in which the work was performed\u2014some witnesses testifying that it was done in the most prudent and judicious manner, and others testifying to the contrary. There was also testimony tending to pirove that the building had been so much damaged by the excavation before the effort to protect it was made, that it was then beyond the hope of successful protection; and there was conflicting evidence as to whether by prompt and provident action, on the 12th of Eebruary, 1872, the building could have been saved. There was also evidence tending to show that the building had been originally constructed of very indifferent material, and carelessly and imprudently built upon an insufficient and insecure foundation. There was also evidence tending to prove that, but for. the excavation in defendant\u2019s lot, the building of plaintiff would have stood an indefinite length of time. There was also conflicting evidence as to the manner in which the excavation had been performed: some witnesses testifying that the excavation had been and others that it had not been skillfully and prudently made. There was evidence tending to show that in December 1871, the defendant had made all necessary arrangements to build upon his premises, and delayed in consequence of the refusal of the plaintiff to remove her kitchen from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Ms wall.

The defendant\u2019s lot, together with the brick dwelling-house thereon, was conveyed to Thomas Richardson, defendant\u2019s grantor, by Joseph Marx and wife, by deed bearing date on the 1st of May 1817, the grantor reserving the right to join the two end walls of said tenement. And the plaintiff\u2019s lot was conveyed to Mary Stevenson, from whom the plaintiff derives title, by the same grantor, by deed bearing date the 8th of July, in the same year, and is described as adjoining the tenement conveyed as aforesaid to defendant, beginning at the northeast corner thereof, and \u201crunning thence along the wall of said tenement, north 54 degrees west, 68 feet eight inches to Edward Hallam\u2019s line;\u201d also the privilege of joining the end walls of the brick tenement conveyed to Thomas Richardson as aforesaid, free of any cost, together with all and singular the buildings, ways, easements, hereditaments and appurtenances, &amp;c. There seems to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>been no building on the parcel of land reserved by the grantor, and which he soon afterwards conveyed to Mary Stevenson. But the language of his deed to the defendant clearly implies the reservation of a right to build on it, and to join the end walls of the building which he conveyed to the defendant. And the right so by him reserved, he conveyed by his deed to Mary Stevenson; and it is implied that the land was sold and conveyed to her for the purpose of building thereon. A building was erected thereon, but when or by whom it does not appear, which, together with the defendant\u2019s building, was destroyed by the memorable fire which occurred on the 3d of April 1865. The plaintiff afterwards, in 1866, caused another building-to be erected on the same site, laying the foundation wall of her main building jam against the old foundation wall of the defendant\u2019s building, and building one of the walls of her kitchen in the rear of her main building, on the old foundation wall of the defendant\u2019s building.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">In the latter part of the year 1871, the defendant intending to rebuild, caused the old foundation wall of his building, contiguous to which the foundation wall of the plaintiff\u2019s main building was laid, to be removed, and the excavation of his cellar to a depth of three feet below his old foundation, which was lower than the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s building, which the plaintiff alleges caused her main building to fall, and for which she seeks to recover damages of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">Every person has a natural right, <em>ex jure naturae, </em>to support to his land from the adjacent and subjacent soil. This natural right is incident to land, and the owner is as much entitled to it as he is to the land itself, without any grant by the servient owner, or any act of acquisition on his own part. It is a right there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>fore which the law annexes to the ownership of land, that he shall have sufficient support for his ground from the subjacent and adjacent soil. The right subjacent support, it is said, was first determined in <em>Humphries </em>v. Brogden, 12 Q. B. 739, 64 Eng. Com. Law R. 739, upon the ground that there were the same reasons for it that there were to maintain the right to lateral support which had been previously determined. Both rest upon the same foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">But this natural right to support exists in respect j of land only, and not in respect of buildings; but the I former right remains, though houses are built. <em>Brow</em>n v. Robins, 4 Hurl. &amp; Nor. R. 186, 28 L. J. Exch. 250; <em>Stroyan </em>v. Knowles, 6 Hurl. &amp; Nor. R. 454, 30 L. J. Exch. 102. But a right to support for buildings may <em>j </em>be acquired; and when so acquired it is an <em>easement\u2014J </em>which is defined to be \u201ca privilege without profit, which the owner of one tenement has a right to enjoy in respect of that tenement in or over the tenement of another person; by reason whereof the latter is obliged to suffer, or refrain from doing something on his own tenement for the advantage of the former.\u201d- Goddard on Easements, page 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">An easement for support may be acquired in different modes, but all are reducible to one by grant; which may be express, implied or presumed. When the owner of land acquires the easement of support, it would seem that his natural right of support in respect of the soil is enlarged, so as to embrace the buildings which he may erect on his land, and invests him with the same right of support in respect of his buildings that he has <em>ex jure naturae </em>in respect of the soil.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">If the plaintiff' has enjoyed the support of the land or buildings of the defendant for twenty years, to keep up his house, and both parties knew of that sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>port, the plaintiff had a right to it as an easement, and the defendant could not withdraw the support without liable in damages for any injury that accrues to the plaintiff thereby. <em>Hide </em>v. Thornborough, 61 Eng. Com. L. R. 250, 255, Parke B.; Goddard on Easements and cases cited, p. 31; <em>Humphries </em>v. <em>Brogden, </em>64 Eng. Com. L. R., page 739. In such case the grant is <em>presumed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The grant is implied, in the absence of express stipulations, in every case where the owner of adjoining houses, or of houses and land, severs the property by sale; Ser, in every such case, rights to support are granted by implication by the vendors and purchasers respectively, for the preservation of the buildings belonging to each other. Goddard on Easements, p. 154, and eases cited. Rights of support in such cases are mutually granted and reserved between original owner and first grantee; and the second grantee succeeds to owner\u2019s reserved rights. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>9 Welsh., Hurl. &amp; Gor. 218; <em>Gayford </em>v. <em>Nicholls, Idem </em>702.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">In the ease under judgment, the court is of opinion, that the defendant\u2019s grantor, Joseph Marx, when he conveyed a part and parcel of his land to the defendant, with the brick building thereon, reserved the right to build on the parcel which he retained; and the reservation of his right to support to such building when erected, by the land and building which he conveyed to the defendant, must be implied as an easement. And that said right of support, or easement, passed from him by his deed of conveyance to Mary Stevenson, and from her, with the title to the tenement, to its present owner in fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The court is also of opinion, that the original grantor, by his reservation in his deed to the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ant, of the right to join the end walls of the building he conveyed to him, retained the right, which passed with the land to those who derived title from to join his building to the defendant\u2019s by an independent wall alongside the defendant\u2019s building, or to make it a part of his building by joining only his end walls; and that the privilege of joining his building in the mode indicated by the reservation, did not extinguish or impair his implied reservation of support.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The court is also of opinion, that if it be shown that the plaintiff had a building on her lot which was supported by the land and the building of the defendant for twenty years or more, with the knowledge of the defendant, prior to the fire of April 8d, 1865, which destroyed both buildings, a grant of the easement of support will be presumed: and that said easement was not lost or extinguished by the destruction of her building, but adhered to the building which she caused to be erected on its ruins: and that any right of support which she may have derived from the reservation of the deed of conveyance of her grantor to the defendant, express or implied, was not extinguished by the destruction of the old building, but survived and adhered to the new.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\"With regard to the instructions given by the court to the jury, the court is of opinion, that the mere fact of the contiguity of buildings imposed an obligation on the owners, to use due care and skill in removing the one building, not to damage the other, even though no right of support has been acquired. Goddard on Easements, p. 33, citing <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Holme, </em>1 A. &amp; E. 493. But if the plaintiff was entitled to the support of her building, by the foundation wall and land of the defendant, the defendant could not withdraw the support without being liable in damages for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>injury which accrued to the plaintiff thereby. This doctrine has already been announced, and cases cited in support' of it. The first instruction therefore should have been given with the foregoing qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">With regard to the second instruction, so far as it implies that though the plaintiff was entitled to the easement of support to her building, it devolved upon her to protect her building, by providing herself other-supports, and that the defendant was not liable if the plaintiff had knowledge of the danger, and could have averted it by prompt action, the court is of opinion it is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">With regard to the third instruction, it .does not seem to have been settled, whether the defective construction of the plaintiff\u2019s building with defective materials, upon a defective foundation, which would increase its liabity to fall, should affect the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery, or relieve the defendant from liability in damages. It is argued on the one hand, that the plaintiff\u2019s building, although defective in its construction, would not have fallen or been impaired, but might have stood a great while, but for the act of the defendant in removing its supports. On the other hand it is contended, that it would be unreasonable and unjust to allow the dominant tenant to deprive the serVient of the privilege of improving his own property, and enjoying the benefit of it, by erecting a building upon her lot, so defective in its construction, or in materials, or in its foundation, that the servient tenant cannot with all due care and proper precaution improve his own property without incurring the liability of paying for his neighbor\u2019s. Eespectable courts and able judges have decided the question differently. One side must have erred, and neither perhaps have placed it upon the true ground. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>court is of opinion, that whilst the fact3 supposed should not constitute a <em>bar </em>to the plaintiff\u2019s reeovery, so as to defeat her action, they would he per to be considered by the jury upon the question of damages; and that so far as the instruction gives them an effect to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery, it is erroneous. The court is of opinion, that the remainder of the instruction is erroneous, the first clause of it because inconsistent with principles already enunciated; and the last clause, because if the plaintiff wrongfully erected her kitchen wall, upon the defendant\u2019s wall, in relation to which the court does \u2022not intend to indicate an opinion, it would be virtually to set off the defendant\u2019s aggression by the plaintiff\u2019s trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">With regard to the fourth and last instruction given by the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The material part of this instruction is, that if the defendant contracted with an experienced and competent excavator, of good standing in his business, to do the work, he is not liable in damages for any injury which the plaintiff sustained by his negligent and unskillful execution of it. The instruction is evidently designed to rest upon the distinction between execution of work by an independent contractor, and an agent or servant. Without attempting to 'draw the line of distinction, which is not always well defined, between the two descriptions of contract, it is sufficient to say, that the instruction is objectionable, in so far as it decides for the jury, that the contract was of the former description. Whether the work was done by\u2019 an independent and responsible contractor, or by an agent or servant, in either case it would be by contract. The instruction must be considered in connection with the evidence which was before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>jury, and which is certified by the court. That evidence tends to show that the work was not undertaken a contractor,- as contradistinguished from an agent, or servant, or laborer.</p>\n<p id=\"ApP\">There is a class of men whose business it is, to undertake the erection of buildings, or other works for reward. They do not generally propose to do the work in person. They are not always competent. They may be neither bricklayers, masons, nor carpenters, plumbers, nor painters, nor slaters; but they are contractors, and they employ bricklayers, carpenters, &amp;c., to do the work. Or one may be contractor for the brick work, and another for the carpenters\u2019 work, &amp;c., all of whom expect to employ agents and laborers to execute the work. They who undertake to have the work done are contractors, and they who do the work are their servants or agents. Perhaps there the distinction lies, between those who do the work and those who contract to have it done. The defendant might have let out the whole building, excavation, foundation, and superstructure, to a contractor, or he might have let the whole work of building, and reserved to himself the work of excavation and preparation for the foundation; and in that case it would have been just as necessary that he should have an experienced laborer to do the work of excavation as if he had let it to contract. It was no part of the main work which the defendant had in contemplation, the erection of a building on his premises: it was only a preparation for it. And as it was necessary to be done with caution and prudence, as it might endanger his neighbor\u2019s property\u2014and as it was a small job\u2014the work to be done was inconsiderable and inexpensive, but the defendant was interested in having-it done with great \u2022care, and would be therefore inclined to have it done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>under his own supervision; and we find him contracting directly with the laborer who did the work, and not with one who undertook it as a responsible contractor, to have it done under his own supervision, by his agents or servants. The jury might well be warranted in coming to the conclusion, that the defendant had employed the man who did the work, as his agent or servant to do it for a specified price, and not as a responsible contractor, to have it done through his agents or servants, under his direction and supervision. The fault of the instruction is that it excludes that conclusion, though the jury might think the evidence warrants it.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">But another objection fatal to the instruction is, that it ignores the plaintiff\u2019s easement of support, and holds that the defendant would not be liable in damages for any injury to the plaintiff\u2019s building, which was caused by the negligence or unskillfulness of the excavator in removing the supports; which involves the absurdity, that though the defendant was responsible for injury to the plaintiff's building by removing the supports (she being entitled to them), though every care and precaution were used to prevent injury, he would not be liable for the injury if the supports were negligently removed by the excavator whom he employed to remove them. The court is of opinion that this instruction is also erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">It cannot be doubted that it would have been competent for the Circuit court, if in reviewing the instructions which in general are given without much time for reflection or investigation pending the jury trial, it should have been satisfied that he had mistaken the law and misdirected the jury in matters which had a material and important bearing upon the issue, and had most probably influenced its verdict, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>upon that ground to have set aside the verdict and awarded a new trial, and that it would have been his so to have ruled. But if upon that review the court below should adhere to its first ruling, and hold that the instruction was rightly given, and refuse to set aside the verdict upon that ground, and the rulings of that court should by a bill of exceptions thereto be brought under the review of the appellate tribunal, if the appellate tribunal should be of opinion that the jury had been misdirected, and that its verdict had been probably influenced by the erroneous instruction to the prejudice of the exceptor, and that the court of trial had erred upon that ground in overruling the motion for a new trial, surely it would be competent for the appellate court to reverse the judgment for that cause, and to make such order as ought to have been made by the court below. This conclusion is fortified by the opinion of this court in <em>Bull\u2019s case, </em>14 Gratt. 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The court is therefore of opinion to reverse the judgment of the Circuit court with costs, and to remand the cause for further proceedings to be had therein in conformity with this opinion'.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The court has. expressed no opinion as to the demurrer to the declaration, nor is it necessary to do so now, as the general principles governing the case have been laid down.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">There is one defect running through all the counts, that whilst they allege that the common grantor in the conveyance he made to Mary Stevenson of the piece or parcel of his land which he did not convey to the defendant, conveyed the right to join the ends of the defendant\u2019s building, neither of them allege that he reserved to himself the said right or the right of support in his deed of conveyance to the defendant. There are also other defects in the declaration of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>more formal character, which the court will not decide are fatal to it upon demurrer; but as the cause will' be remanded for further proceedings, the plaintiff may have leave to amend her declaration if she desires it.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b115-4\">Staples, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3m\">concurred in the opinion of Judge <em>Anderson, </em>with the exception of that portion which holds that the owner of a building defectively constructed, with defective materials, and upon an insufficient foundation, is entitled to damages, resulting from an excavation upon the adjoining lot made in a skillful and proper manner. He was inclined to think that in such case the owner of the building was not entitled to any damage for an,injury resulting from the excavation.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
