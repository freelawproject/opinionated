Such a grant, under such a precautionary proceeding, is a perfect one, and vests in the grantee all th <em>a public right </em>to the stream, or so much thereof as is necessary to the . full enjoyment of the mill erected under the order.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b194-10\">After a mill has been established, and a dam erected <em>according to ham. </em>whereby the use of the water for grinding has been granted to the mill-owner, a subsequent Act of Assembly, which imposes on him the burthen of erecting locks through his dam, of keeping- the locks in repair, and of giving attendance at the-Jocks, go as to admit the passage of boats, and on his failure, vests in a Companj the power to abate the dam as a nuisance, without a full <em>indemnification </em>anr <em>equivalent </em>for the injury thus done to his <em>vested rights, </em>is contrary to the Constitution of the State, and void.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-11\">The Plaintiffs, <em>dsbury </em>Crenshaw, and <em>Thomas B. Crenshaw. </em>exhibited their Bill to the Judge of the Superior Court of Chancer).' for the Richmond District, praying for an Injunction against thc- <em>\u201c\u25a0 </em>Trustees of the Slate River Companj'',\u201d a Corporation of that name, created by an Act of the General Assembly, passed on the 29th January, 1819. They allege that they are the owners in fee simple of a valuable water-grist mill, in Buckingham county, built cn a water-course called Slate River; that the mill is supplied with water by a dam erected across the said river pursuant to Law, at a place where they (the Plaintiffs) are the fee simple owners o\u00ed the bed of the water-course, and of the lands on both'sides thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-12\">They trace back their title to the said land and bed of the river, to a patent issued on the 10th January, 1726, granting 1600 acre? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>of land </em>to <em>James Skelton, </em>including the land on which the mill and dam are situated, and the bed of the river. In October, 1727,-<em>Skelton </em>sold and convejred the said laud to <em>George Nicholas, </em>and from him it passed to his son <em>John Nicholas, </em>who obtained from the County Court of Buckingham, on the 13th Majg <em>1765, </em>an order authorising him to build and ei'ect a dam across the said river on the said land; and in pursuance thereof, the said <em>John Nicholas </em>did build a mill and erect a dam on the site now occupied by the dam of the Plaintiffs. <em>John Nicholas, </em>in 1795, devised the land on which the mill and dam were erected, to his son <em>Hubert </em>Nicholas, who in 1802, petitioned the County Court for leave to erect a water-grist mill on his own land on Slate River, where <em>John Nicholas </em>formerly liad a mill. A Writ of <em>Ad Quod Damnum </em>was awarded, and the Jury found among other things that <em>ordinary navigu tion </em>will not be obstructed, and on the 12th July, 1802, an nucon ditional order to build the mill ivas granted him. On the 21st Sep \u2022 tember, 1S02, he sold and conveyed to <em>Charles A. Scott, </em>who proceeded to erect the mill and dam at the site aforesaid at very great expense. <em>Scott </em>sold and conveyed in 1807, to <em>John </em>Cunningham, fi'om whom it passed to his daughter <em>Letit'u </em>Taylor, who, wiih her husband <em>Archibald Taylor, </em>conveyed on the 28th Juljq 1824, to the Plaintiffs. Thus, they allege, that the title to the land, with the bed of the water-course, and the undisturbed possession thereof has remained with the original paterltce, and those claiming under him, for a space of almost one hundred years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-5\">They allege that Slate River, within the bounds of <em>Skelton's </em>patent, is a small stream, many miles above tide-water and ship navigation, and was not, at the time of the grant; used for navigation of any sort.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-6\">They allege that on the 18th December, 1794, the Legislature passed an Act, for improving the navigation of Slate River, by which Trustees are appointed to raise money by subscription for that purpose; and that by the 4th section, owners of mills on the river are required to erect locks or slopes for the passage of battenus of four tons burthen, and of fish, at their own expense, and to keep them in good repair. [See <em>Sessions Acts of </em>1794, <em>ch. </em>48, <em>p. </em>29.] But that, as they are informed, no subscriptions were raised under that Act, and nothing was done for the improvement of the river; the scheme being found impracticable and was abandoned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-7\">That another Act passed 29th January, 1819, entitled \u201cAn Act for improving the navigation of Slate River,\u201d whereby a Joint Stock Company was incorporated by the name and style of \u201cThe Trustees of Slate River,\u201d <em>[See Sessions Acts qf </em>1818, <em>ch. </em>37.] for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>improving the navigation of the river \u201cfrom its junction with the \u00abTames Iiiver, to the highest practicable point of improvement:\u201d and the improvement required by Law is, that the river should be made \u201ccapable of being navigated in ordinary seasons, by vessels drawing one foot water.\u201d When the river is thus made navigable, it is declared to be a public highway, and the Company are entitled to tolls.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-3\">That by the 10th and 11th sections of the said Act, the owners of mills are required, within six months after the navigation shall have been completed to their several mills, to erect good and sufficient locks through their dams, or on canals around them, so as to procure a safe and easy passage for loaded boats; to keep them in repair, and to cause constant attendance to be given by some person who will enable the boats to have free passage through them; and on failure so to do, a fine of $20 is imposed on the offender for every moreover to party grieved for damages. And if the owners of the mills shall refuse or fail to erect the locks within eighteen months, the mill-dams are declared to be nuisances, and may be abated: and the Trustees are empowered to clear them away, and to charge the expense of doing so to the owners of the mills.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-4\">They allege, that their dam is situated about a mile and a quarter above the mouth of the river; that from the dam to the mouth, the stream has been used to transport the manufactuse of the mill ever since its erection by <em>Scolt, </em>long before the passage of this Act; that the dam is built at the foot of a succession of rapids, which never were navigable, and never could have been made so without great expense.; that the dam is seventeen feet high, and causes the water to flow back only about three quarters of a mile; that no part of the stream above the dam has ever been used for the purpose of navigation, as they have been informed, except on one occasion, when a single boat with two hogs heads of tobacco passed down in high water many years ago; that the obstructions to navigation above their mill are such, that they believe the Company could not be induced to encounter the expense of removing them, either for the public good, or their own emolument, if they were bound to bear the whole expense of the improvement; but, there having been constructed on the river five mills, the dams of which have been erected on the faith of the General Law in relation to mills, and their dams having made eddy water for about twelve miles, one-third of the distance over which the improvement is contemplated, the expense of improving the residue of the distance may be within the competency of the Company; that these. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Jams together, are believed to be between sixty-three and sixty-five feet in height, and to have covered with their ponds the most difficult part of the river to he improved; that if the Company can now charge the mill-owners with the expense of locks, while they will throw an immense burthen off their own shoulders, they will tax with an unjust and grievous burthen, those very individuals who have already done So much for the improvement of the river, and whose, mills are a great public benefit; that, notwithstanding these considerations, the Company are proceeding to impose on the Plaintiffs, and the other mill-owners, the whole burthen of making-locks at their dams, of keeping them in repair, and causing them to be attended to in the manner prescribed by the Act of Assembly\u00bb</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-5\">They state, that they had received a written notice from the Company, apprising them that the navigation has been completed for six months, from the mouth of the river up to their dam, and requiring them to proceed to the erection of the locks. They say that the navigation above is not yet improved so. as to be fit for use, and cannot be for a considerable time; so that if they are bound to make them at all, there can be no utility in making them at this time; yet, if the Act aforesaid, so far as it relates to the mill-owners, <em>be </em>Law, and if they (the Plaintiffs) are bound by it, they are now exposed to the danger of being prosecuted and harassed by the Company, or by any vexatious individuals who may choose to prosecute for the fines, and in the course of a few months, they will be exposed to the danger of having their dam, which is valuable to them and the public, regarded as a nuisance, and abated by the Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-6\">They charge, that the Act, so far as it requires the mill-owners to build and repair, and superintend the locks, is without authority and void; that they are advised they are not bound to build the locks; that no fine could be lawfully imposed on them for failure to do so, and that their dam could not be lawfully abated by the Company for such failure; but, they do not desire to engage in so inconvenient, perplexing and hazardous a controversy, as that which would arise at Law, in repeated efforts to fine them, or in an attempt to abate the nuisance; that such a controversy would be alike detrimental to^their interest, and that of the Company; and that while they are threatened with the penalties of the Law for not doing what they are advised they are not bound to do, they can neither enjoy their property in quiet, nor bring it to market with safety.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-7\">They therefore pray, that, as they are without remedy at Law, the Slate River Company may be made Defendants to their Bill; that themselves may bo quieted in the possession and enjoyment of their free from the claim of the to have the locks built <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>by them; and that the Company, their agents, and all others, may be mjoined from prosecuting them for fines and from abating and disturbing their dam.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-4\">This Bill of Injunction was exhibited on the 28th March, 1825. The Patent, Deeds, Acts of Assembly, and other Documents refer-led to, were annexed to the Bill. The Injunction was awarded on the next day. The Trustees of the Slate River Company filed their Answer on the 5th August of the same year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-5\">The Answer of the Defendants, the Slate River Company, is to the following effect:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-6\">They admit the emanation of a Grant to Skelton, the execution of the several Deeds, the transmission of the lands patented, and the. other documents referred to, so far as matters of fact are proved by those exhibits; but, they deny that the bed or stream of Slate Rivet was ever so disposed of, or granted to <em>Skelton, </em>or those claiming under him, as to preclude or impair the rights vested in the Slate River Company by Law, and the Statural rights which appertain to the people of Virginia to apply the stream for the purpose of navigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-7\">They say, that as early as 5th November, 1788, the Legislature passed a Law appointing Commissioners to examine the natural and artificial obstructions to Slate River, and to give their opinion whether it was practicable to make the stream navigable, and to re-poi\u2019t to the next Assembly. In December, 1790, they passed another Law reviving the former, appointing additional Commissioners, requiring any three to perform the duty assigned by the former Law, and to report. That on the 18th December, 1794, (at which lime neither the Plaintiffs, nor any one from whom they claim, had any mill-dam, or right to erect any mill-dam across Slate River,) the Legislature passed the Act referred to in the Bill. That by that Law it is asserted, that it had been represented to them, that the extension of the navigation of the Slate River would be of public utility, and it is probable this representation was made by the Commissioners. That before the year 1794, the mill-dam erected by <em>John. Nicholas </em>was down, and continued down so long that neither ho, nor any one claiming under him, could lawfully erect the dam anew, - without a new order from the County Court. Whatever then might be the legal effect of the order of 1765, yet the rights given thereby were lost to the builder of the dam, and those claiming under him; and before the order of July, 1S02, was made, the Legislature appropriated Slate River to the purposes of navigation, in exclusion of any rights which the Plaintiffs, or those under whom they claim\u00bb have, or may have had.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>They say, that the dam of the Plaintiffs is not erected at the same place on which the dam of <em>John Nicholas </em>Iras built; that Slate River, at the Plaintiffs\u2019 mills, and for many miles up, and to its junction with James Riyer, is a stream large enough to be used, and well suited to be improved for the purposes of navigation, to the great benefit of the public; that in its natural state, and as far back as during tiie War of the Revolution, it has boon used for transportation-, that after <em>the </em>dam of <em>John Nicholas </em>was down, the stream, for some distance above the Plaintiffs\u2019 mili, and even above the lands ever owned by <em>John Nicholas, </em>was used for transportation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-5\">They deny- that nothing was done under the Act of 1794, to improve the navigation of the river. They say, that the persons appointed by that Act, divided the river into sections, and alloted the sections to persons who did much work on it; that one section, as difficult as any other, was allotted to <em>Francis Harris? </em>who nearly put his section in order for navigation; that the scheme was never abandoned from the belief that it could not be carried into effect; that those concerned in the undertaking under the Act of 1794, determined that it might be made navigable at the very time when there was no dam across the stream near the prosent dam of the Plaintiffs. They believed, that the neighbours on the stream might make it navigable to <em>Kidd\u2019s </em>Falls; and from that point to some little distance below, they would have to employ a man, and spend some money to remove the rocks about the Falls, and obstructions in the str.eam.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-6\">They claim all the rights vested in them by the Act of 1819; and Insist, that the Complainants have no l-ight to ask an exemption from any burthens or duties imposed by-that Law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-7\">They say, that the Plaintiffs\u2019 mill is situated about one and a quarter, or two miles from the mouth of the river; that the dam is about seventeen feet liigh, and causes the water to flow back between three-quarters of a mile and one mile and a half.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-8\">They admit, that the river- between the mill of the Plaintiffs and <em>Kidd\u2019s </em>Falls, a distance of three or*four miles, abounds with rocks, and falls that would be expensive to remove; but, they deny that they would give over the undertaking in which they have engaged, if there was no mill-dam on the river. ' They believe the mill-dams arc\u2019an hindrance and an inconvenience to the works for improving the navigation. They admit, that the water in the mill is generally confined to the hanks of the stream. The ponds are deep, and much wider than other parts of the stream; and in the winter will retain Ihe ice much longer than the other parts of the stream, and 1 hereby obstruct navigation longer. \u00bb They say, that the mill-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>owners can manage to stop tlie water in its passage clown, so as to produce delay in navigation; but, if there were no dams on the river, except those belonging to the Company, placed where they might be used, as they were required, under the sole management of the Company, it would be in the poorer of the Company, by the use of their lock-dams and works, to obviate, in a great degree, the inconvenience arising from scarcity of water, drought, or ice. They admit, that tlie eddies formed by the mill-darns are about twelve miles, and the Company contemplate carrying the navigation to Buckingham Court-house, a distance of about forty miles; but, they deny that these eddies are beneficial to the Company in their work. They say, that if they were to erect locks at-their own expense in the mill-dams, they would spend more money than would be required to improve the stream from its natural state; and after they have encountered such expense, if the dams should be allowed by the mill-owners to go down, the locks of the Company would be destroyed, and they would be compelled to go to work on the bed of the stream. The locks erected in the dams of the millers, would require greater skill, and would be much more difficult to be kept in repair than the dams of the Company, erected just where the Company want them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-4\">They say,\" that from tlie time of the passage of the Law in IS 19, to' December, 1823, great efforts were made to raise the stock, and form the Company, which was well known to <em>Archibald </em>Taylor, the then owner of the Plaintiffs\u2019 mill, who subscribed for two shares of the stock, on the agreement that he might expend it in improving the navigation below his mill; that he placed a lock-dam between his mill and the mouth of the river, for the Company, which he used .in navigating the river to his mill, and the Plaintiffs also, since they purchased: that the Plaintiffs purchased from <em>Archibald Taylor, </em>after the Company had been formed; had spent a large sum of money in the work, and had succeeded in procuring a passage of Laws fo obtain a subscription on the part from the Fund for Internal Improvement: that the Plaintiffs have become purchasers with a full knowledge of all circumstances, and now demand to be freed from 3n obligation which they are bound by Law to bear: that the Defendants being apprised of the temper of the Plaintiffs, and of their disposition to impede the operations of the Company, gave them the notice of which they complain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\">They admit that the river had not been made navigable to the Plaintiffs\u2019 dam, from above, but they assert that it had been from below, and that the Company had done, nearly a fourth of the entire work, and but for the mill-dams, they believe the work might be completed by the Fall of 1825, They say, they <em>be-. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>licvo the work practicable, and when finished, will be of great public utility.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-4\">They deny, that the County Court has any power or authority to make an order (in favor of a petitioner for leave to erect a mill,) whereby the mill-owner shall have the right to appropriate to himself the privilege of excluding the people of the Commonwealth the right of navigating the streams of the Commonwealth: that it is the duty of the County Courts to remove obstructions to navigation, but they have no right to throw impediments to navigation, in the way of those who live on the upper part of the streams.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\">They contend, that although ships can never navigate Slate River, yet that the streams which are susceptible of navigation, are under the control of the Legislature, and that the owners of dams across them may be subjected to such terms as to the Legislature may seem just: that before and since the Revolution, to secure the passage of fish, and to improve navigation, the Legislature have required own \u25a0 ers of mill-dams to erect locks or slopes, in their dams: and that the privilege of navigating streams is a natural right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aap\">They do not admit the right of a Court of Equity, by any Decree, to stand in the way of a determination of a Court of Law, on any of the matters set forth in the Plaintiffs\u2019 Bill. They deny all fraud, and all disposition to oppress, or be oppressed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-7\">To this Answer a general replication was filed, and the parties pro-, ccedcd to take the Depositions of numerous witnesses. It is not deemed necessary to report any part of that evidence. So far as it was necessary to explain any point decided by the Court, the Judges have referred to the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-8\">In June, 1886, the <em>Chancellor </em>dissolved the Injunction, and the Plaintiffs appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-9\"><em>Leigh, </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>for the Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-10\"><em>S.

The Act directs, among other things, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the owners of mills on the river shall, within six months after navigation shall have been completed to their mills, erect good and sufficient locks through their dams or on canals, proper and convenient around them, so as to furnish a safe and expeditious passage for loaded boats, &amp;c, up and down (he river; and moreover, shall keep the said locks in good repair, and cause some person to give constant attendance at the same, whose duty it shall be to work and the locks at all times, when thereto required by any person wishing to pass through them with craft, giving them free passage without delay; and on failure so to do, the offender, for every offence, shall forfeit $20, and bo moreover liable to the party aggrieved for damages. And it is enacted, that, if any owner of a mill shall fail to build such lock within eighteen months as aforesaid; his dam is declared a nuisance, and shall he abated, thrown down and destroyed; and the Trustees are empowered and directed to clear it away at the cost of the owner. Proceeding under this Act, the Trustees have given notice to the Plaintiffs, owners of the <em>Virginia Mills, </em>a short distance above the mouth of Slate River, that navigation has been completed up to their mills for six months, and requiring them to proceed to the erection of the locks, agreeably to the requisition of the Act. Against this proceeding, the Plaintiffs protest, as oppressive and against. Law, as unconstitutional and void; and as fhey are liable to motions for the $20 fine, by every one who may choose to call on them for passage, and will very soon be liable to have their dam thrown down,'and irreparable injury done to their large and valuable mill establishment, they pray an Injunction, and a decision of the matter in Equiij\u2019. The Injunction was granted, unless the Defendants, on being served with the order, should shew f\u2019ause to the contrary, by the 10th day of the next Term. The timo for answer was afterwards enlarged. The Answer was filed, much evidence on both sides taken; and the Court, upon argument, discharged <em>the </em>order, upon a principle which, if correctly decided, puts an end to the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\">In the argument, several questions, deep, grave and important, were raised. Some of these, I shall pass over entirely, and touch others, so far only, as seems absolutely necessary to the decision of the case. I shall do this, not from a wish to avoid trouble, but because some of the questions are too large, and open too wide a range of enquiry, for the time I have had to bestow on them.</p>\n<p id=\"pAvm\">first objection taken by the Appellees, was, to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery. The testimony I have borne on this subject, has been such, I believe, as to shield me from the suspicion of inclining to that loose practice, which, acting upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>the particular case, without looking to any general rule, tends to destroy every thing like system, and to break down the barrier between Common Law and Equity. In her appropriate sphere* however, I would carefully support Equity; because I think the clue exercise of her legitimate powers, most salutary. Oue instance, clearly proper for the interposition of Equity,-is, where the damages of :i Jury would not compensate; the owner attaching some extraordinary value to the chattel sought. Such was the case of the <em>Pusey Horn, </em>1 Vern. <em>273; </em>the <em>patera </em>of the Duke of Somerset, 3 P. Wms. 389; the silver tobacco box, <em>Fells </em>v. <em>Read, 3 Ves. </em>70, &amp;c. Another acknowledged, and most useful ground of equitable aid,'ip, to prevent irreparable mischief by the dcstruclion-of property, while the rights of the parties are in litigation. The cases under this head are numerous, and may be found in any book of reference. Waste, breaking up of meadow, of a garden, &amp;c., are among them. In the case of <em>Nutbrown </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>10 Ves. 159, Lord Eneos ordered the stock, &amp;c. on a farm, seized by -the landlord under a distress for rent and bill of sale, to be specifically restored, considering that under the particular agreement it was not liable to that proceeding, lie says, \u201cUpon the particular circumstances also the Court would be justified in interposing, to prevent the destruction of the propertjq until the rights were ascertained, upon the principle of irreparable mischief. It is said, the Plaintiff might have damages. But, how ar\u00e9 damages to be estimated in such-a case? The directions to the Jury must be, to give, not the value of these chattels merely, but their value to <em>this man, </em>having this farm, enabling him to use them for cultivation,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">In the case before us, the Plaintiffs have mills, which have cost them upwards of $20,000; the dam itself, as Sir. <em>Scull </em>tells us,.cost more than $3,000. This establishment, we arc told, deals largely in wheat and the other products of the country; thereby making profit to itself, and affording to the citizens the convenience of a ready market for wheat, corn, and other articles. If the dam were destroyed by the Trustees, there would be the direct loss'of its cost, the damages resulting, and the inconvenience to the public from the sudden stoppage of such an establishment; and all this mischief, being actually suffered, the mill-owner would be left to sue a Corporation for damages. Is it not hotter to let this dam stand, and the mills go on, till the matter of right he decided? I think so, dearly: and that it is a case directly within the appropriate range of the preventive, and (if I may so say) the <em>jireservative </em>powers of a Court of Equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">It was next objected, that the Plaintiffs stand in the place of <em>Tap</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>lor, who </em>liad full notice of the Law, assented to it, and aided it\u00a7 progress; that he was therefore bound by it, and they equally so. Every freeholder may be said in some sort to assent to the Laws passed in a Legislature where he is represented; hut such assent, I apprehend, would not bind him, if a Law were passed conveying his property to another citizen. The assent, then, must be something more than merely standing by, and not protesting against the <em>La\\v. Taylor\u2019s </em>rights, whatever they were, were vested rights at the passage of the Law. He was the owner of the mills. Has he done any thing to divest those rights? If not, they still exist in the Plaintiffs, and they are legal rights, and must be so considered though brought into equity for their preservation. It is insisted, that the taking two shares of stock by <em>Taylor, </em>was such assent as bound him; hut I cannot think that was a surrender of his legal rights. He took them on the express understanding that he was to for them in locks into the river below his which were necessary for him, whether the river was cleared higher up, or not; which he had determined to make for his own use; and which, when he did make, he had very little idea, as he tells us, that the scheme would ever 6e carried into execution. The only equity this could raise against him, would be, that he stood by and saw the work going on, without objecting. But this, it seems to me, would not be a good objection; for, till his rights were called in question, till he received notice to make the locks, it was not necessary for him to take any active step. But -this objection, if applicable to <em>Taylor, </em>-is not brought home to the Plaintiffs, by any notice. Neither do I think, that the clause in the Law, exempting Taylor, his heirs and assigns, from paying toll on property carried <em>from </em>his mill down the river, has the effect of binding him to stand by this Law. There is no proof that he had any agency, or gave any assent to this clause. It may well be supposed to proceed from a sense of justice in the Legislature, <em>prompting </em>them to make the owners of the mill some small return for the many burthens the Law was imposing on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The next objection I shall notice, is, that the <em>Virginia Mills </em>were notlcgalty <em>established. </em>I am not sure that we can take this objection first in this Court, and in this collateral way; but the objection itself seems unfounded; The application to the Court was to build a mill, and that would seem to include every thing necessary, but especially a dam; for, if no dam had been intended, no leave of Court would have been necessary; and when we look at the Inquest, we cannot doubt for a moment, that a dam was in contemplation. The <em>Jury </em>are directed fo enquire into the damages which may ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>iuc iroin- overflowing the lairds aborc and below, and whether anj? mansion-house, garden-, &amp;c. will be overflowed; and that they report upon all these subjects. This would all be a farce, upon any other idea, than that cf a dam; especially on a site whore there is so much Tall- that a dam seventeen feet high does not throw the water a. mi! had;.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\">Put it is .-v.id, that (he Act of 1794, lock front the County Court all power to give leave for erecting mills on Slate Itiver, a public highway. certainly is no express prohibitien-io ihe County Court, to exorcise the power which was vested in then; by the General Law; aud the clause of the Act making the highway, is in these words: \u201cAnd be it further enacted, that <em>after ihe said river shall he made navigable for the passage of boats, agreeably to the p?ovisio?is of this Ad, the same shall be deemed and taken to be a public </em>highway. \u201d This clause, it will be seen, while it admits that the river was not <em>then navigable, </em>or a public highway, docs not go immediately and absolutely to change its character, but only enacts, that <em>after </em>it shall be made navigable, <em>under that Act, </em>it shall be a public highway. Now, v;e have it in evidence, that the whole scheme contemplated by iliat Act, failed. No subscriptions were raised; no money paid; no labor, to speak <em>of, </em>bestowed. In short, the whole project Was abandoned, and the Law a dead letter. The present Trustees are created under an Act passed twenty-five years after, having no reference to, or connection with, the former. I think, therefore, that no aid can be derived from this source, to impeach the power of the County Court tp grant leave to build the mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">We come now to the main question: Arc the Plaintiffs bound by the provisions of the Act of 1819? Must they either erect locks, and keep due attendance at them, or have their dam destroyed as a nuisance?</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The importance and delicacy of this question need not be enlarged on. It is forced upon us, and we must either meet it, or shrink from our duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In ascertaining the character of streams, and the power of the Sovereign over them, we must look to the Common Law, and the operation of our own legislation. The best and most authoritative Treatise on this subject, and that indeed from which all who have written since seem to have drawn, is Lord Hale\u2019s Tract <em>De Jure Maris, </em>&amp;e., published by <em>Hargrave </em>in his Law Tracts. He says, <em>pages </em>8, 9: \u201c There be some streams or rivers, that are 1 private, not only in propriety and ownership, but also in use, as .Utile streams or rivers that are. not a common passage for the King\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>people.\u201d Again: \u201cThere be other rivers, as well fresh as salt, that are of common or public use, for carriage of boats and lighters, and these, whether they7 are fresh or salt, whether they flow and re-flow, or not, a <em>ro. prima facie, public* juris, </em>common highways for man or goods, or both, from one inland town to another. Thus, (he observes,) 1he rivers of <em>TVey, </em>of <em>Severn, </em>of <em>Thames, </em>and divers others, as well above the bridges and ports, as below, and as well where they are become private property, as in what parts Ihey7 are of the King\u2019s property7, are public rivers, <em>juris publici, </em>and therefore all nuisances and impediments of passage of boats and vessels, though in the private soil of any person, may be punished by Indictment, and removed.\u201d Again, p. 5, he says: \u201cFresh rivers, of what land soever, do of Common right, belong to the owners of tire noil adjacent., so that the owners of one side, have of common right the propriety of the soil, and consequently the rig,}it of fishing <em>usque ad filum aquae; </em>and the owners of the other side, the right of soil or ownership and fishing unto the <em>filum aqum, </em>on their side; and if a man be owner of the land on both sides, in common presumption, he .is owner, of the whole river, and hath the right of fishing, according to the extent of his land in length. With this (he adds,) agrees -the common experience.\u201d These extracts mark with more precision than any thing I have met with in any other Common Law writer, what constitutes a public river, and the distinction between such as are public, and those which may become private property7. These distinctions are supported by the cases. Lord <em>Fitzwalter\u2019s </em>Case, 1 Mod. 105; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Murcot, </em>4 Burr. 2162; <em>The Royal Fishery </em>in the River <em>Banne, </em>Dav. Rep. 152, See, also, <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Mulligan, </em>3 Caines\u2019 Rep. 307; <em>Shaw v. Crawford, </em>&amp;c., 10 Johns. Rep. 236; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Platt, 17 </em>Johns. Rep. 195.</p>\n<p id=\"pA3h\">Common Law, then, we see that some rivers were public, some private; and of those considered private, that sbme were subject to the servitude of'the public interest, and in that sense common highways by water. The mark of distinction between those which are entirely private property, and tjbose which are sub-* ject to the public use and' enjoyment, consists id the fact, whether or not they can be used a for the</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3-pl-split\">Applying this Common Law criterion to the Slate Rivei', I have no doubt that it must be considered a private, innavigable stream; and that the patent to <em>Skelton </em>in 1726, conveying the land on both sides, and including the river in its bounds, gave him the property' in the bed of the stream; and that he had, to the extent of his land, \u00edljp o'-elusive of this would him no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>t&amp; obstruct the passage of fish; for, all the riparian owners have the same right to the enjoyment of the stream with all its advantages, and the natural run of the fish of passage is one of these. Whether the right to the banks and bed of the stream, derived from the patent of 1720, was an absolute and exclusive right, or a right held subject to the <em>jus publicum; </em>in ether words, whether the Legisla - ture could, at any subsequent period, have this river rendered navigable, and make it a public highway for boats and other craft, without a vioiaiion of the rights of <em>Skelton, </em>and those claiming under him, is one of those questions which I do not mean to discuss. \"The cause may be decided on other grounds. It will not be de1lied, I presume, that the Sovereign Power, (with us the Legisla~ ture,) in wh~ni resides this ~ grant it away. It is to be taken, tha make this grant, but for the public benefit. 0 ~tI ~ i must be. the judges. They have the power; the grant f~~~~ade will bind them and their successors. ~ ~ legisla~- tion shows, that mills have at all tines uecn cousiuere~ treat public conveniences and benclils, and as su ~ rotection, encouragement and proof of this~~~1 ~ be 263 cited; such as those regulating their tolls, t~i~ weights and mea- sures, that they shall grind the grist in du~ turn, &amp;c. Particular privileges, too, are given them. The miller is exempt (or was till lately) from militia duty. They have a right to condemn an acre af land for an abutment. They may overflow the lands of anoth- er. These privileges are forfeited, if a miller fails to keep up his mill for the ease and use of his customers. A mill not regularly established by Law, is forbidden to grind for loll. All these pro- visions, (and others probably might be shown,) prove that mills arc highly favoured; and this is wise legislation; for, we all know, that few things contribute more to the convenience, comfort and pros- perity of a country, than good mills well regulated. When a mill is to be established, application must be made to the Court of the County. They direct tho Sheriff to take a Jury, who are to view the lands, &amp;e.; and among other things, to enquire, \u201c Whether, and in what degree, fish of passage and <em>ordinary navigation </em>will be obstructed; whether, by any, and by what means, such obstruct lion may be prevented.\u201d What is <em>ordinary navigation? </em>Among the meanings assigned to tho word <em>ordinary </em>by <em>Sohnson, </em>I find the following: <em>established, regular, common, usual. </em>Ordinary navi- gation then, is <em>established </em>or <em>regular </em>navigation. If there be such, the Jury will report it, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>\u00abtraction; and leave will be given to build the mill, under \u00bfitch eoirditions as will preservo the existing navigation. If there be no ordinary navigation, there can be no obstruction. The Jury will s\u00a9 report; and the leave to build the mill will be without any condition as to navigation; and this grant, I hold, will he a perfect one, vesting in the applicant all the public right, or so much at least as is-necessary to the fulhenjoyment of the mill erected under the order under this fhc of both banks and the bed of this private, innavigable stream, in 1803, applied to the County Court of Buckingham, for leave to build a mill. An Inquest was held, a report made, that no navigation would be obstructed, &amp;e. Leave was given, and the mill built, which is now owned by the Plaintiffs. The evidence shows, that this mill has .proved a signal benefit to the country; and all the witnesses, who speak to that point, say, that (if they cannot have both,) they had much rather have the mill without navigation, than navigation without the mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">After this mill had thus been in successful operation for seventeen years, a Law is passed, raising a Company for the purpose of rendering the river navigable; directing these millers (and all others, of whom there are four,) to erect locks through their dame, and keep constant attendance, to give free and ready passage; and that on failure, their dams shall be destroyed as nuisances. The evidence shows, that to build such a lock at the mill of the Plaintiffs as would answer, will cost <em>% </em>7,000. The cost of keeping them in order, and of giving constant attendance, is not so easily estimated. It seems probable, also, that in some seasons, the water required for the locks will interfere materially with the grinding; and upon the whole, it seems doubtful whether it would not be better for the Plaintiffs to suffer their mill to go down, than to keep it up on the terms imposed by the Law. It is the decided opinion of the witnesses, that none of the other four millers on the stream above, could afford to keep up their mills on the terms of the Law. Here then, is a Law, imposing upon the citizen a burthen, which would render his property worthless, or destroying the property in ease lie refuses to comply. The question forces itself upon us: Can such a Law bind? That the <em>eminent domain </em>of the Sovereign Power, extends to the taking private property for public purposes, I am free to admit. But then, to render the exercise of this power lawful, a fair compensation must always be made to the individual, under some assessment established by Law. This is laid down by the writers on Natural Law, Civil Law, Common Law, and the Law of every civilized country. Thus Blackstone, <em>volume 1st, p. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>139, </em>speaking of the power of Hie Legislature.to take private property, says, \u201c not by absolutely stripping the subject of his property in an arbitrary manner; but by giving him a full indemnification: and equivalent for the injury thereby sustained! The public is now considered as an individual, treating with an individual for an exchange. All that the Legislature does, is to oblige the owner to alienate his possessions for a reasonable price; and even this is an exertion of power, which the Legislature indulges with caution, and which nothing but the Legislature can perform.\u201d Far be it from me to intimate, that the Legislature intended to violate this great principle. I am well assured that they had no such idea. They thought they were promoting the public good,, without trenching at all on private right.; and <em>they </em>may be right, and / wrong. Each of us acts under the highest sanction, and must walk by the light of our own understanding. Following this-guide, I must declare it as my solemn conviction, that whether we judge this Law by the principles of all Civilized Governments, by the Federal Constitution, or that of our own State, it is unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<author id=\"b209-5\">Judge Green.</author>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">I concur in what has been said, as to tlie preliminary questions in respect to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery in a case like this, and the equity alleged by the Appellees, against the person under whom the Appellant claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">After giving to this case, all the consideration demanded by the importance of the questions which it presents, I have been led to !he conclusion, after a careful examination of the legislation of England and from <em>diaria </em>downwards, and to all other sources of information accessible to me, that at the Common Law, as adopted heie, the public have a right <em>pri\u2022ma-facie, </em>notwithstanding the gi anting of the bed and banks to individuals, to the use of all water-courses, for the purposes of navigation, which can in any way be \u00abapplied to that purpose; leaving the full use of them to the riparian owners, in any way which may he beneficial to them, \"until they are appropriated by the public to that object, and even afterwards, to any extent, which shall not impair the beneficial enjoyment of the public right.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">It cannot however be denied, that the Sovereign Power of the State may effectually confer on individuals, by General Laws or Particular Grants, rights in opposition and paramount to this public right; and such, I think, have, by our General Laws, been vested in the owners of mills legally established, as that of the Appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>has been. This make it unnecessary to state the grounds of my opinion as to the existence of the public right; especially as my brethren decline the consideration of that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\">That the public right, if it existed, and whatever is its nature or extent, was intended to he surrendered in favor of mills legally established, to the extent of authorising the obstruction of the stream, and the use of the water necessary for working their mills; and that with a view to the promotion of another public interest, not inferior in value to that of navigation, is, I think, clearly proved by <em>the </em>whole course of opr legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Mills have always been treated as public establishments, subject to public control in various ways; and the building of them has been encouraged by condemning the property of others, for the use of one wishing to build, and allowing him to overflow the lands of others, upon making just compensation; privileges, which were forfeited, if the mill was not kept up for the use and ease of those who were customers to it. When the Legislature thus invited and encouraged individuals to vest their money in establishments so eminently useful to the public, it cannot be doubted that they intended to give them an indefeasible inheritance in the property so acquired, and all its incidents and apurtenances, as complete as in the soil granted to them by their patents. This inference is fortified by the consideration, that all the Acts of Assembly of a general nature, pro \u2022 hibiting or directing the removal of obstructions in water-courses, uniformly except mill dams legally established. With a view to ascertain the opinions from time to time entertained by our Legislature on this point, I have examined most of the very great number of Acls of Assembly, in relation to obstructions in particular streams, used for, or devoted by Law to, the purpose of navigation, and am satisfied that the opinion of the Legislature, whenever their attention has been particularly called to the question, has conformed to that which I have expressed; although in many cases, commencing with the Act for clearing Appomattox and Pamnnkey Rivers, passed in 1732, the owners of mills are required to make locks in their dams for the passage of boats, under the penalty of subjecting the dams to he abated as nuisances. Yet, there are many indications that such provisions were sometimes considered as unjust invasions of private property, and sometimes as of doubtful character. Thus, the first Act directing the abatement of dams, (that of 1745, for clearing James and Appomattox Rivers, then ordinarily navigated,) required that the owners of mills oti those rivers, should make convenient locks in their dams, for the passage of boats, within a limited time, under a penalty, and on failure therein, that the dams should. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>he </em>abated, <em>and the owners compensated, at the expense, of such counties as should be thereby benefit ted, </em>and <em>prohibited expressly the building of daiiis across either of those rivers in future; </em>Unis taking away, in respect to those rivers, the power vested in the County Courts by the General Laws, to give leave to build milis which required dams. It is probable, that the Courts did not so construe it, and continued to allow mills and dams to be by an Act of January 30, 1803, this prohibition is more explicitly enacted in terms. The Act of 17S7, incorporating the Appomattox Company, the owners to make and keep up locks for the purpose of boats, and to have them well attended, under pecuniary penalties; and upon failure, authorises the abatement and removal of the dams, at the expense of the owners. This is the precise prototype of the provision on the same subject of the Act of 1S19, under consideration, and of most of the other Acts directing the owners of dams to make locks, &amp;c. This provision in the Act of 1787, in respect to the dams on Appomattox River, was perfectly just, and violated no private right whatever; for, the Act of 1745, presented to the owners of mills the alternative, either to make locks, in their dams, or to submit to have them abated; in which case, <em>a full compensation was provided for them. </em>The own-e'rs of mills, then established, probably preferred the former alterna-. tive, or we should have seen a provision in some subsequent Act of Assembly, for making the compensation, which could not be made without a new Act. Thej' were, therefore, under an obligation by oampact, to keep up the locks which they had made, and as- to all mill-dams subsequently built, they were not legally established, being built in opposition to the express prohibition of the Act of 1745, and were actually public nuisances. It was, therefore, an <em>indulgence, </em>not an <em>injury, </em>to them, to allow the dams to remain, upon condition of their making locks, &amp;c. I am inclined to think, that the similar provisions found in subsequent Laws, were in a great degree founded on this example, upon the supposition that <em>it was founded, </em>not upon the particular circumstances existing in relation to that river, but upon an universal public right, preferable to those of mill-owners, I should indeed feel confident in this conjecture, but. for the fact, that a similar provision was made at the same Session, m respect to mill-dams on <em>Willis\u2019s Ilivcr, </em>with this difference only, that they were not to be abated at the expense of the owners. The Ads incorporating the James River and Potomac Companies, after aulhorising the condemnation of lands for the use of the Company, and without saying any thing about mills, declare that it is not intended by those Acts to interfere \"-\u00a1th private property, but for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>purpose of improving and perfecting the navigation; and prohibit the use of the water by the Company, for any purpose but that of navigation, reserving to the owners the-convenience of erecting mills, forges, and other water-works.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The Act. of 1794, relating to the Slate River, saves the rights of mill-owners, without intending to impair or confirm them; and the Act incorporating the Rappahannock Company provides a compensation to mill-owners, for the privilege of making locks in their dams,</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00cd shall notice only one other of these Acts, relating to particular water-courses. An Act of 1810, declared Middle Island Creek to be. a public highway, for an extent of near seventy miles, and directed that the owners of all mills already established, or that should thereafter be established thereon, should make slopes in their dams of prescribed dimensions, for the passage of boats and fish; and that, on failure thereof, the dams should be abated as public nuisances. At f ho next Session, on the representation of <em>William </em>M\u2019Coy, the own- \u00a1or of a mill and dam on that creek, built before the passing of that Act, another Act was passed, which declared, that the former Act was \u201cequivalent to the abrogation of a vested right,\u201d in respect, to <em>M'Coy\u2019s </em>mill, and provided, that the county of Ohio should make a full compensation to him, for the injury which he might suffer by making such a slope in his dam, before it was made. This Act is the more striking, since it related to a stream, whose bed and banks were declared by the Act of J802, to belong to the public, for the. common use of all, and incapable of being granted to any individual, by any prior or subsequent patent.</p>\n<p id=\"pAieF\">The Legislative interference to prevent obstructions to the pass-ago of fish, proceeds upon a different principle. Such an obstruction violates no the of in fresh water streams, or within the bounds of any Patent, is not public and common to all, but confined to the riparian owners; each of whom is entitled to the natural run of fish of passage upwards, as he is to the natural flow of the water downwards; and at Common Law, rm assize of nuisance by the party injured, lay in such a case, as \u201cfor levying a goss to intercept the course of fish coming from the sea, <em>usque ad gurgitem mearn superiorem.\u201d Fitz. N. B, </em>184, <em>A. </em>Whilst the Legislature, therefore, might properly yield the public right of navigation to individuals for the-sake of securing the public convenience of mills, they could not. justly sacrifice to this object, the individual rights in respect to the natural run of fish; and therefore, have properly guarded against such obstructions to the passage of fish, by imposing it as a condition upon the leave to build a dam, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>dial the owner shall give a free passage to fish, and seem always to have considered it as a condition implied, even when it was not expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-2\">The next enquiry is, whether the Appellants\u2019 dam and mill have been legally established, or not? To the several objections made on this point bj- the Counsel for the Appellees, an answer has been given on the oilier side, which, if true, puts an end to any further enquiry. It is insisted, that the uninterrupted enjoyment of a water-course, by obstructing or diverting it in any particular maimer, for twenty years, as in this case, gives <em>per sc </em>a perfect right to continue the use in the same <em>way </em>forever, and against all the world. This is true in respect to individuals, as to whose rights such a possession and use are adverse, upon the presumption that <em>they </em>have surrendered their rights by compact, and by analogy to the Statute of Limitation of the right of entry; the only remedies for such a wrong, the assize of nuisance or <em>quod permit tat, </em>being in their nature <em>possessory </em>actions. No such can arise a unless the circumstances of the case be such as to amount to a prescription, (if there can he a prescription here,) especially against a public right not in actual use and enjoyment, so that no person has an Interest in opposing the encroachment upon it. As to the public right of navigation not in use, there can be no adversary possession; since, as we have seen, the riparian owner is permitted to make any use of the stream for his individual purposes, which does not intei - fere with the public right in actual use. Nor can any analogy to the Statutes of Limitations, apply to any pubic right; since <em>they </em>do not run, in any case, against the Commonwealth. The question then is, whether the Appellants\u2019 mill has been established according to the provisions'of the Acts of Assembly upon this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\">The first objection taken to it is, that the Order of Court giving leave to build the mill, does not, in terms, give leave to build a dam. In all our Laws in relation to the building of mills, up to that of 17S5, the word <em>dam </em>is not to be found, except in the provision of the Act of 1705, prohibiting the building of a mill or <em>dam </em>within a mile below another mill on the same stream. On the contrary, the Acts of 1667, and 1705, do not even speak of leave to build a mill, but the leave to build the mill, as well as the dam, was left to be inferred from the condemnation of an acre of land, for the use of one wishing to build a mill. And, so as to the Acts of 1745 and 1748, which provide further for Compensating the owners of lands, \u201cwhich may he affected or laid under water by building <em>such mill.\u201d </em>The condemnation of the acre of land, or leave to build the mill, implied permission to build the dam, which was considered as a necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Incident; and the <em>woids mill </em>and <em>dam, </em>were used as synonj mous\u00a3 The Act of 1785, in speaking of leave to build a mill <em>and </em>dam.\u00bf only spoke in explicit terms, what was necessarily implied from the <em>terms of the </em>former Laws; and, 1 think, effected no change whatever in the Law. There never was a time, when any person wishing to build a mill, was u..der any obligation to aply to the Geurt, Unless a dam was In all cases of leave lo build a mill, or a mill and dam, the party has authority to build sucha dam as he <em>may </em>think necessary and convenient for working the mill, unless the height of the dam is limited by Order of the Court; subject, however, to a liability under the Act of 1785, to compensate any individual injured thereby, for any damage done to him, which wa$ not foreseen and estimated by the Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Tlie next objection is, that the Act of 1784, appointing Trustees for opening and improving the navigation of Slate Biver, devoted it specially to the purpose of navigation, and superseded the power of the County Court of Buckingham, under the General Laws, to grant leave to build any new mill on that river. That Act was permanent and in force, when the Court gave leave to build the AppeU Iants\u2019 mill. The river was to be oponed; and the navigation improved by means of subscriptions, which the Trustees were authorised to receive; and the Acc directed the owners of mills to make and keep up locks in their dams, and to have them properly attended, if not otherwise directed by the Trustees, under a heavy penalty; and upon failing therein, that the dams should be considered-as nuisances, and liable to be abated as such. It imposed penalties upon persons who should fell trees, or fix any bridges, or stop, or place an;/ obstruction therein. It concluded, however, with these words; c\u2018;;avu,g lo the owners of mills, their legal rights, which are notinteod'-d hereby <em>to he </em>impaired or confirmed.\u201d Under this Act, no subscriptions were received; or, if any, they were paid by contributions of labor. Some impediments were removed by labor furnished by the neighboring inhabitants, in a part of the river of four or five miles or more i;. extent; but the most important impediments, i!k great falls just above the site of the Appellants\u2019 dam, were not louehed. Tills project of improving the navigation of the fiver was abandoned by the Trustees; and six or eight years after, when leave was given to build the Appellants\u2019 mill,nooi&gt;c in that district of country seems to have had any idea of ever making any further attempt towards its improvement. It never was in fact navigated except by one loaded, and one empty boat, by way of cxpei iment, and upon a swell of the river; and it was, i.i no sense, <em>ordinarily </em>navigated I do not think that this <em>A el </em>impaired Ihe power of the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>t\u00f3 give leave to build new mills on Slate River, or made any special, reservation of the public right of navigation, in respect to\u2019this particular river. Although it directs the owners of mills to make locks, &lt;&amp;c., it expressly reserves their legal rights, referring the question as to the extent of those rights, to the Judicial Tribunals of the country; and the prohibition of other obstructions, was nothing more than enforcing, as to this particular river, by additional penalties, the general <em>provision </em>of the Act of 1785, in relation <em>to </em>ail <em>streams. </em>The General Laws gave power to the Courts to give leave to build mills, even when the dams might obstruct ordinary navigation; imposing such terms as the Courts <em>might </em>think <em>expedient </em>for preventing such obstruction. And <em>a </em>fortiori, this power could not be superseded by a contemplated future navigation. The most that can be said is, that in such case, the Court, if they were apprised of the fact, and in the exereise of the discretion given them by Law, (to give or refuse leave in all cases where the mansion-house, offices, curtilage or garden, of any proprietor will not be everilowed, or the health of the neighbourhood annoyed by the stagnation of the waters.) should have imposed conditions which would have operated as a re - servation of the publie right of future navigation; as theji would no 'doubt have done, if any such future navigation had been known to be in contemplation; or, if any one of the Trustees, or any other, had appeared and claimed such a reservation. If, in that respect, they had erred, the error might have been corrected by appeal. Their judgment in the exercise of a legitimate, and (in this particu \u25a0 lar) unlimited power, is final.</p>\n<p id=\"pAjt\">Lastly, it is insisted, that a provision of the General Mill Law of 1785, which was in force when leivi c was given to build this mill, operated as a reservation of the public right of future navigation, in preference to the rights of the mill-owners. That provision is in these words: \u201cThe Inquest of the said Jurors, nevertheless, or Opinion of the Court, shall not bar ant' prosecution or action, which any person would have had in Law, had this Act never <em>been </em>made, other than for such injuries as were actually foreseen and estimated by the Jury.\u201d The Legislature, at the Revisal of 1819,chang-ed the phraseology <em>of </em>this section, by enacting, that \u201cno Inquest taken by virtue of this Act, or no Opinion or Judgment of the Court thereupon, shall bar anji public prosecution or private action, which could have been maintained, if this Act had <em>never </em>been made, other than prosecutions and actions for such injuries as were actually foreseen and estimated on such Inquest.\u201d This seems to be legislative exposition of the before-mentioned provisions of-the Act of 1785, bather than a new enactment; it seems at first sight rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>more comprehensive in it.s terms. Considering it in that light, I do not think it makes any reservation of the public right to appropriate the water and channel of <em>the </em>stream, to the purposes of navigation, in preference of the private right to maintain the dam, and to the use of tile water for working a mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">It may be admitted, that this provision was intended to guard in general, against any unexpected injury, either to individuals, or to the public; whether it be such as any of those, in rsspcct to which the Jury are particularly chai\u2019ged to make enquiry, or any others. As if, for instance, the building of the dam should drown a mill belanging to another, or'destroy a ford which was in, and a part of, a public highway; in the one case a private, in the other a public nuisance. Yet it could not be construed to extend to a future use of the stream, for the purposes of navigation; since the subject of navigation being specially in the mind of the Legislature, and a provision having been made for the security of existing and ordinary navigation, whilst nothing is said in respect to future navigation, the necessary inference is, that the public rights in respect to the latter, were intended to be surrendered to <em>the </em>interests of individuals, for the sake of the great public interest in the establishment of mills; <em>expression facit cessare taciturn. </em>And this seems to have been the opinion of the Legislature of 1815, indicated by the provision, that m future, every grant of leave to build a mill, should be subject to the condition, that the public should have a preferable right to thu use of the water, for the purposes of navigation, and a right to make and keep a lock in the dam, (not to prostrate it,) without compensation to the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The Act of 1819, incorporating the Trustees of Slate River, requires that the owners of mills shall make and keej&gt; up locks in their\u00bb dams, and -have them properly attended, at their own expense, forever, upon pain of pecuniary penalties, lobe repeated <em>in infini turn? </em>and of their dams being considered as public nuisances, and abated by the Company at the expense of the owners. It manifestly impairs their rights, both in respect to. the keeping up of their dams, and the use of the water for working their mills, in preference of <em>the </em>public right to use the channel and water of the stream, for the purposes of navigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The last enquiry, therefore, presented by this cause, is, whether the Court has a legal authority to declare so much of the Act of 181.9, as impairs the private rights of the Appellants without compensation, to be void, as being in violation of the Constitution, of our own State, or that of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">A very liberal construction has been given to the clause of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Constitu\u00ed ion'of the United States, which prohibits any State to pass any Law- impairing the obligation of contracts. It has, however, never been extended to the protection of private rights, acquired under the operation of the General Laws of the State, and without any consideration given, beyond the general purposes of promoting individual interests directly, and the interests of the community incidentally. Nor do I think it can- b'e justly extended to the protection of rights so acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">The Legislature of the State is declared by our Constitution io be a complete Legislature, and consequently lias all the powers of Sovereignty, except so far as they are limited by the Constitutions of Virginia and the United States. Our Bill of Rights is a part of our Constitution; and the general principles thereby declared are Fundamental LaWs, except so far as they are modified by the Constitution itself. They limit the powers of the Legislature, and prohibit the passing any Law <em>violating those </em>principles. The first Article of this declares: \u201cThat all men are by nature free and independant, and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of soeiety, they cannot by any compact deprive or divest their posterity, <em>namely, </em>the <em>enjoyment </em>of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and. <em>possessing property, </em>and pursuing and <em>obtaining haqjpiness </em>and safety. \u201d To deprive a citizen of any property already legally acquired, without a fair compensation, deprives him <em>quoad hoc, </em>of the means of <em>possessing property, </em>and of the only means, so far as the Government is concerned, besides <em>the </em>security of his person, of <em>obtaining happiness. Liberty </em>itself consists essentially, as well in the security of private property, as of the persons of individuals ; and this security of private property is one of the primary objects of Civil Government, which our ancestors, in framing our Constitution, intended to secure to themselves and their posterity, effectually, and for ever.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The Legislature, in passing the Act of 1819, did not intend to invade private rights, but proceeded, no doubt, upon the belief that the rights of the owners of mills generally, were subordinate to the public right of navigation, and particularly in respect to the Slate River; a question, on which there may well be a difference of opinion. The Constitution, however, declares, that the Legislative and Judicial Departments, shall be distinct and separate; so that, neither shall exercise the powers properly belonging to the other. The questions, whether the rights of the owners of mills, or of the public, for the purposes of navigation, are preferred by Law generally, or in any particular case, are emphatically Judicial in their nature, depending on the effect and construction of former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Laws; and, il\u2019 upon a full and careful consideration, we conscientiously differ in opinion in any particular case from the Legislature, wc arc bound by the highest obligations of duty to ourselves and our country, to pursue our own judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">I think the order of the <em>Chancellor </em>should be reversed, the Injunction re-instated, and the cause remanded to be further proceeded in, in order to a fund Decree.</p>\n<author id=\"b218-7\">Judge Coax.ter.</author>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Many topics of great magnitude and interest, as well to the Commonwealth, as individuals, have been presented by the argument in this caso, many of them requiring deep research and reflection.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Horno down, as this Court, is, by the great-mass of business on the docket, and considering that three-fmirlhs, or more, of our time is occupied in the mere <em>drudgery </em>of sifting out and ascertaining matters of 'fact, and in examining matters of account, without the aid of a Jury, or Master Commissioner to assist us, I think, in most cases, and especially in such as that before us?, we ought to confine ourselves to the fewest points of enquiry on which the case can be safely decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">The controversy arises under the Act of Assembly, passed the 29th of January, 1819, <em>(Sessions Acts of </em>1818, <em>ch. </em>27,) for improving the navigation of Slate River. <em>By </em>that Act, a Company is incorporated to improve the navigation of that river; and for that, certain are them. At the of this Act, it was well known, as the fact was, that several mills had been erected on that river, and were then in use; and the 10th section of the Act provides, that the owners of these mills, and every of them, shall, within six months after the navigation shall have, been completed to the said mills, erect good and sufficient locks, and keep them in good repair, &amp;c., and cause constant attendance to he given to them, &amp;c., under a penalty of $20 for every failure, &amp;c. And the lltli section provides, that if any owner of a mill shall refuse or fail to build such locks within eighteen months, then the dam is declared a nuisance, and may be abated and thrown down at the expense of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">It appears that the Company, instead of beginning below, and improving the navigation to the first mill, which is that of the Appellant, and which would have cost but, a small sum, and then calling ou him to build the locks, and on failure, proceeding to prostrate the dam, so as to bring up this question, so important to themselves, and the owners of the mills, for decision, before much expense was incurred; nroccedcd to expend considerable sums, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>amount <em>o\u00ed some four </em>or <em>Gve </em>thousand dollars, in improving the upper parts.of the river. This was an unfortunate course, should if be decided that the owners of mills are not obliged to build lochs; for m that case, this money must be lost, unless die Company can be permitted, and will incur the expense of erecting the \u00edoc\u00edjs them - selves; and shall be entitled to water enough to work them.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The facts proved by the evidence in this record, present a ease of a very peculiar character, <em>as it regards the public interest, </em>apart from the rights and interests of the individuals who arc before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">It appears from the testimony of about seventeen witnesses, the greater part of whom reside on, or near (he river, and who are from fifty to seventy years of age, that this river passes through a bold and hilly country, and has many rapids and falls in it, some of considerable, others of minor extent and magnitude, which hitherto formed, what had been considered insuperable obstructions to its navigation: that, some fifty years ago and upwards, efforts had been made to remove some of these obstructions, but in vain: that after this, and in consequence of an Act of Assemby, passed about the year 1794, further efforts were made by voluntary associations of labor, &amp;c.: but the tiling was finally considered, on ail hands, as impracticable, and was abandoned. From that time, until since the Act of 1819, no further efforts had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">It also appears, that one <em>Nicholas, </em>the then proprietor of the site on which the Appellants\u2019 mill stands, had a mili at, that place, as early as the year 17G5, which was in operation during the Revolt!lution, and perhaps for some time after; but, that it had gone down. In July, 1802, <em>Robert Nicholas, </em>his sou arid devisee, obtained an Order of Court to build a mill at the same place; and having, in September of that year, conveyed to <em>Charles A. Scott, </em>he proceeded to build the dam and mill, at an expense of nearly $20,000;' and in 1807, sold it to <em>Cunitingh&amp;rx </em>for the sum last mentioned, under whose heir at Law the Appellants claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">In the mean time, also, and before the Act of\u2019 1819, four other mills hqve been erected, at what expense does not appear; but, considering the height of their dams, and the public utility which seems to be ascribed to them by the witnesses, It is not presumable that they can be worth less in the aggregate, than from $20,000 to $35,000. All these witnesses agree, that these mills are* of much greater utility to the public, than the navigation of the river; and that if one or the other must give way, the mills ought to stand. They give.the most conclusive reasons for this opinion; and, what is remarkable, neither the opinion, nor the reasons for it. are contradicfc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>cd by </em>a single witness on 1 he'other side. They all concur <em>too, </em>in the opinion, that the owners of neither of them, unless indeed, by possibility, the Appdl.i &gt;i, would be justified, if they were able, to advance the money in building the locks required by the Act. The estimate of Mr. <em>Randolph Harrison, </em>the former Superintendent of the James River Improvements, as I understand him, would make the costs of the locks necessary to be erected at the Appellants\u2019 mill, about $7,000. If this, or any thing like it be correct, when we consider the risque, the necessary repairs, the expense of a lock-keeper, and the interest of the money, it cannot be supposed that he would be so imprudent as to encounter this expense; and the more especially, if the use of the locks should deprive his mill of the necessary supply of water during the Autumn, a season of the year so important to millers. The inevitable result, as seems to be anticipated by these witnesses, is, that for a navigation, by no means good, all these mills, and all this private property, must be sacrificed, and the country left to -suffer for the want of bread, besides being deprived of a market, a very good one too as they state, for their grain and various other articles; which is now found at those mills. It seems too; that the ponds of these mills, being, of course, made at the most considerable falls, cover perhaps nearly, if not altogether, one half of the whole fall of the river; although they cover, comparatively, but a small proportion of its bed. The witnesses, in speaking of those falls, describe most of them as rapid, abounding in large rocks, wdrich \u25a0 would have to be blasted; and many of them, and amongst the number Mr. <em>Randolph Harrison, </em>think, as I understand them, that the style of improvement adopted on the other parts of the river, will not answer for these places; and especially, that covered <em>by </em>the Appellants\u2019 mill, and the one immediately above it.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The height of the Appellants\u2019 dam is about eighteen feel; that of the mill next above it, about thirteen feet; and there are contiguous rapids to them of about eleven or twelve feet; making a total fall, as well as I understand the testimony, of about forty-two feet in about three miles. If, then, these dams are prostrated, and the other kind of improvement will not answer the purposes of navigation, the very dams now standing, must be again resorted to, or the work, to all useful purposes, given up.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">But again. I collect from the evidence, that the aggregate height of all the dams is ahove fifty-eight feet; and that of the sluice, dams, built by the Company, about fifty-seven feet. Thus, if those dams stand, and the locks are made and kept up by the owners, with lock-keepers,, &amp;c* the owners of mills will, at their expense, ove'r<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Come unc-half, and much the most difficult half, of the obstructions to the navigation, and keep it up forever, for the benefit of the Company! '</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Nevertheless, and however unjust to the individuals, or injurious to the public, it may bo; and however ruthless the procedure on the part of this body politic towards those individuals; if it was <em>competent </em>for the Legislature to pass the Act of <em>1819, </em>it i\u00e1 <em>competent </em>for them alone to retract their Act, and put a stop to the mischief, by <em>compensating the Company </em>for their expenses, and re-instating both the public and private interests where they were before the Act of 1819; unless indeed, the Company should elect to make locks, and use them whenever there shall be Water enough, both for them and the mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The question, then, between these parties, arises On conflicting Acts of the Legislature, under which, both parties have acquired rights; the various Acts concerning mills, on the one hand, and the Act of 1819, above referred to, on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">I will not, in this case, consider, or give any opinion, which may bear on the question, how far a mill dam, authorised to be built across a stream on which there has been <em>ordinary navigation </em>of some Mud or other, and where the Inquest has found that no such navigation is obstructed, or the Court has been careless in imposing <em>proper </em>conditions, shall be subject <em>to the </em>resumption, at any time, by the public, of her right to the navigation. Nor will I pass any as to the effect of the Act of in to its tive operation on individual rights; being satisfied, that it can in no affect the rights, whatever they may be, which were previously acquired by the Appellant. Nor will I at all be understood, as having formed any opinion- on the question, how far the owner of the bed of a stream having no <em>ordinary navigation </em>on it, but which may hereafter be used for the purposes of naviga tion, either as a feeder of a canal, or by dams erected across it, shall be deprived, without compensation, of a fall and- site for Waterworks on his land, on the ground, that before he shall have actual<em>ly </em>occupied <em>it, </em>as such, the public has occupied it, or is about to occupy it, as aforesaid, for navigation, whether such occupation is claimed by the public under the Act of IS 15, or independently of it; the owner of this land having acquired His Patent previous to the Act of 1815. All these, and many others, are questions of deep interest, not arising in this case, and not necessary, in my humble opinion, to be decided at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">This case simply presents the question, whether the owner of a mill can be thus disturbed, he erected the mill under an Or-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>tier of Court, duly granted in the year 1802, to him who holds under a Patent of a very early date, granting the land, not bounded by the stream of water, but running across it, so as to convey it, <em>water and </em>all, so far as such a Patent can convey the public right to the water, of a stream too, on which there never was any <em>ordinary </em>navigation, and on which, particularly at this place, <em>extraordinary </em>navigation cannot exist, without the aid of dams of <em>some kind, </em>and perhaps of the <em>very kind </em>of that now erected, and in which the claim of the public to this <em>extraordinary </em>navigation has been asserted, long after the mill was so erected.</p>\n<p id=\"pAMA\">wishing, in this case, as I have before stated, to discuss or decide on the j^jblic right to have used this mill-site for purposes of navigation, in <em>exclusion </em>of the owner of the land, had this <em>actual </em>claim on the part of the public been consistent with the application of the owner for an Order to ei-ect his mill, I may at present, and without prejudice to that question, take it for grant-an assertion of that public right, if made at that time, would have postponed the individual right; at least, so far as the necessaiy use of the <em>water itself </em>for the purposes of navigation, leaving it to the individual to elect whether he would use the residue of the water, <em>not so necessary to navigation, </em>for his own purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Be this as it may, the Legislature had an undoubted right to abridge or modify this public right, if it existed, either by Special Acts, in each particular case, or by some general provision and regulation.; especially with a view to promote the <em>public interest </em>in any other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In looking, then, to the course of legislation in regard to mills, we find them, at all times, treated of as improvements beneficial to the public. Their tolls are regulated; millers exempted from other public services, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and the public right to the water is only noticed, so far as regards the <em>passage of </em>fish, and <em>ordinary navigation. </em>The right to condemn the lands of others, is granted, which could only be on the ground of public utility, no right existing, by our institutions, to condemn the private property of one man to the use of another, merely on the ground that he will make a better use of it</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The Appellant\u2019s right to the use of this water, in exclusion of the <em>extraordinary navigation </em>authorised by the Act of 1819, if it did not exist lender his Patent, is undoubtedly secured to him under those Acts; and even if there was any irregularity in the form of the Order of Court granting the leave to erect the mill and dam, that Orcfer has never been revised by a regular proceeding, and could not, I apprehend, be now reversed here. But I see no. substantial objection to it. If his rights, thiys acquired, aye to b'e in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>vacfcd for public purposes, it can only be done on the principle of making him compensation. The use of the pond, merely for navigation, I am not prepared to say ought not to be occupied by the public, although the Company are saved the expense of erecting the dam, which creates that pond. Perhaps, this question cannot be said to arise in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">IIow far the erection of a lock in the dam by the Company, may injure the owner of the mill, by rendering his dam less secure, is a question also, which does not seem to be in issue; nor indeed, the. right of the Company to use any water for their locks, which may poduce an injury to the mill. But as to the latter, it may not be impertinent to say, that the principles on which I decide this case, goto secure the mill-owner against any such injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">I think, therefore, that the Decree must be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b223-6\">Judge Cabell.</author>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The question as to the nature and extent of the public rights to the use of water-courses, for the purposes of navigation, is one of the greatest importance to the community. But I do not deem it at all necessary to be decided in this ease; and therefore I shall give no opinion upon it. Whatever those rights may he, it is competent to the Legislature to relinquish them to individuals, in any mode, and for any purpose, that they may think proper. I concur in the opinion expressed by the other Judges, that whatever rights may have belonged to the public, in relation to the navigation o,f Slate River, at the site of the Appellant\u2019s mill-dam, were relinquished by the Order of Buckingham Court, establishing that mill. And that the rights acquired under that Order, by the owners of the mill, cannot be invaded, even for public purposes, without just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">I concur in reversing the Decree of the <em>Chancellor, </em>and re-instating the Injunction,</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b201-14\">Tt'C PHEsiitEXT absent,.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
