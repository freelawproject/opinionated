Tapscotf, </em>devisees of <em>Martin Shearman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">They answer, expressing their assent to a revival, and their wish for a decision. Issues were made up to try the capacity of <em>Fleet, </em>and the fairness of the Deed and Will.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The Jury found that <em>Fleet </em>was not of sufficient capacity to <em>dispose </em>oThis property, by Deed or Will, and that both these papers were obtained by fraud. This verdict being returned into the Court of Chancery, without objection, that Court pronounced the Deed and Will null and void, and ordered that they be surrendered, to be can-celled. It was further ordered, that such of the Defendants as had 5n the lauda or slaves, in the papers mentioned, should surrender the same <em>to </em>the Plaintiffs, and such Defendants as claim as distributees of <em>Fleet. </em>The Court further ordered, that <em>E. G. Shearman, </em>administrator with the Will annexed of <em>Marlin </em>Shearman, do render before a Commissioner an account of the administration of the said <em>Shearman </em>on the estate of <em>Fleet, </em>comprising in such account, to (he debit, of the said <em>Maritn, </em>the hire of slaves, and all the personal estate (except the slaves which may be surrendered under this decree) that the said <em>Martin </em>derived or claimed title to, under the said Deed or Will: that he also render an account of the rents and profits of all the lands and real estate, claimed or held under the said papers, accruing in the life of the said. <em>Marlin: </em>that he also render an account of his administration on the estate of the said <em>Martin; </em>also an account of the hires and profits of such of the slaves claimed under the said papers, as may have come to his hands; and if any of them have been sold by .him, an account of the value and price received therefor, and when and how disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">In pursuance of this order, the Commissioner made a V.ery voluminous report; of which it seems only necessary to notice here, that part which stated the account of <em>Martin Shearman </em>as executor of <em>Fleet, </em>up to th&lt;j, death of the said <em>Martin. </em>The balance against the said executor is slated to be $5,714 01 cent, with interest, &amp;c. The Commissioner also stated the account of <em>E. G. Shearman, </em>as administrator of <em>Martin Shearman, </em>making a balance against the said administrator of $12, 712 41 cents. The last balance is made by excluding from the credits of the administrator, all sums disbursed by him, in payment of the proper debts of <em>Martin Shearman, </em>and especially the sum of $4,151 27 cents, paid by the said administrator, on an execution issued against him on a stay-bond executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>by <em>Martin Shearman. </em>The exclusion is on the ground that th~ debt due from <em>Martin Shearman </em>to <em>Fleet\u2019s </em>estate, being due from him as executor, takes precedence of all his proper debts.</p>\n<p id=\"pAxZ\">It is proper to mention, that before this report was acted upon, the Plaintiffs filed a supplemental bill, making <em>Armstrong </em>a Defendant, upon the ground that after the Deed and Will of <em>Fleet </em>were set aside, he had been appointed by the County Court of Lancaster, adminstrator of <em>Fleet, </em>and, as such, ought tti be a party to the suit. The administrator answered, consenting to adopt, and be bound by all the proceedings which had been taken in the case; claiming his rights as administrator, and offering to abide the Decree of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The cause coming on to be heard (as the Decree expresses it) <em>\u201coa </em>the papers formerly read, an exhibit showing that <em>Martin Shear-man, </em>the testator of the Defendant <em>Ezekiel G. Shearman, </em>administrator, &amp;c. <em>of Martin Shearman, ivho </em>qualified as executor of <em>John Fleet, </em>do pay the administrator of the said <em>Fleet, </em>#5,714, &amp;c. A sum is also decreed against <em>Ezekiel G. Shearman </em>individually, lor the amount of rents and profits of the' land and hires of the the slaves received by him after the death of <em>Martin Shearman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">From this Decree, the appeal is taken by <em>Ezekiel G. Shearman </em>alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">In the record which has come up to this Court, there is no such paper as the exhibit (so particularly noticed by the Chancellor in his Decree,) <em>showing that Martin Shearman duly qualified as executor of Fleet. </em>There can be no rational doubt, that this omission is the error of the Clerk of the Chancery Court; nor can we doubt, that a <em>Certiorari </em>would supply the defect. For, if the identical paper which was before the Chancellor should be lost, it could be easily supplied; as it Was but a copy from the records of Lancaster Court. It is equally clear to me, that we ought not to proceed in the cause without a <em>Certiorari, </em>unless upon the ground that the exhibit is unnecessary to a decision, or the admission, (which I understood the Counsel for the Appellants to make) that the exhibit be considered as before us, if it could be brought up by <em>Certiorari. </em>My own opinion is, that we do not need the exhibit to establish the fact, that <em>Martin Shearman </em>qualified as executor of <em>Fleet. </em>It is a settled principle, that nothing need be proved, which is admitted by the parties; and this fact is, I think, clearly so admitted. After annulling the Deed and Will, the Court of Chancery ordered, <em>Martin Shearman\u2019s </em>administrator <em>to </em>render an account of the said <em>Martin\u2019s </em>administration on the estate of <em>Fleet. </em>_ If this order was not made, on the admission of the parties that <em>M. Shearman </em>was executor of <em>Fleet, </em>it certainly could not have been <em>acted upon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>by the Commissioner, without either an admission of that fact, orar, exception taken to fhc report, because-iif. <em>Shearman </em>was never executor of <em>Fleet. In </em>the Commissioner\u2019s report, we see a Jong account headed thus: \u201cDr. the estate of <em>John Fleet, </em>dee\u2019d, in account with <em>M. Shearman, his executor.\u201d </em>This account is extended from the death of <em>Fleet </em>to the death of <em>M. Shearman; </em>a space of thirteen years. The executor is regularly charged with the property which came to his hands, and credited by his disbursements from year to year, together with his commissions, &amp;c-; the whole showing the usual course of administration of an estate. To all this, there is no exception that <em>M. Shearman </em>was not executor; but on the contrary, an express admission of the fact by <em>E. G. Shearman; </em>1st, in page 3, of the report, where the Comissioner states, \u201cthat <em>M. Shearman </em>is debited, in his executorial account, with the hires of <em>Fleet\u2019s </em>slaves, <em>from the consent of the Plaintiffs and the </em>defendant E. G. Shearman, except as to the hires of <em>'Daniel, Harry </em>and <em>Lucy,\u201d </em>&amp;c. 2d. The fact is admitted by <em>E. G. Shearman </em>in page SI, where he claims (by a special statement made at his request) credits for <em>M. Shearman, </em>as executor of <em>Fleet, </em>to the amount of @633 83 cents. I desire no better evidence than this, to establish the fact (as between .those parties) that <em>M. Shearman </em>qualified and acted as executor of <em>Fleet.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AMQq\">Taking this, then, for granted, I shall proceed <em>to </em>consider the objeetions stated in the argument, to the decree of the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">1. It is objected, that the bill docs not charge <em>M. Shearman </em>as executor of <em>Fleet: </em>that he does not answer as executor: that the revival against h'is administrator gave him no notice, that the claim was made of him as representing an executor, and was therefore, a debt of the first dignity; and that having no such notice, at any preceding stage, the Chancellor ought not to have suffered the exhibit which showed that <em>M. Shearman </em>qualified as executor of <em>Fleet, </em>to have boon introduced at the hearing; and erred in founding his decree upon that document.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">With respect to the original bill, it must be recollected, that <em>M. Shearman </em>was the man charged with the fraud and imposition i\u00bb: obtaining the Deed and Will, and' withholding the property under\" them. If these charges were true, he was liable, however he-held the properly. But further, the Will is made a part of the bill. By the Will, <em>M. Shearman </em>is named as executor. The Will, too, as set out, shows that a <em>probate </em>of it had been taken, and this could only be by the executor, or (on his renouncing the executorship) by an administrator with the Will annexed* <em>Martin Shearman, in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>ais answer., claims both under the Deed arid Will: admits himself tn possession of the whole estate, real and personal, (a house excepted;) states no renunciation of the executorship by himself, or qualification by another; and therefore, must be understood to admit him'-SKlJLin possession as executor, especially when the fact was, that he had actually qualified as executor. Holding thus as executor, and being thus liable, the suit was, on his death, revived against his administrator with the Will annexed, in the same plight and condition. He stood bound as representing an executor; and it was his business to take notice of all the debts, which his testator owed in that chai*acter, because the Law declares he shall pay-them before per debt of the person he represents. Besides, the notice and responsibility, thus thrown on the administrator, <em>E. G. Shear-man, </em>by the Law, it is a fact apparent on the record, that the first, step taken by the Chancery Court, after the Deed and Will were pronounced void, was, to order <em>E. G. Shearman </em>to render before the Commissioner; an account of the executorship of <em>M. Shearman </em>on the estate of <em>Fleet. </em>This gave him notice in <em>fact, </em>as well as in <em>Laiv. </em>The same order\u2019, also, of the Court of Chancery, directed him to settle before the same Commissioner, ah account of his own administration on the estate of <em>Martin Shearman; </em>and in this settlement, the Commissioner refused to credit the administrator, by payments made towards the proper debts of <em>Martin Shearman, </em>because the debts which <em>M. Shearman </em>owed as executor of <em>Fleet, </em>was of higher dignity; and there is no exception to this refusal of the Commissioner, on the ground that the administrator had no notice that he was sued as the representative of <em>Fleet\u2019s </em>executor. In. the case, particularly, of a debt of nearly five thousand dollars, paid by <em>E. G. Shearman </em>on an execution against him, issued on a stay-bond, given by <em>M. Shearman </em>to <em>Dali, </em>and for which the Commissioner refused him a credit; so far from objecting that he had no notice by the suit of the Plaintiffs, that he was charged as representing- <em>Fleet\u2019s </em>executor, he puts his right to'that credit expressly on different ground; attempting to prove, that when <em>Dali\u2019s </em>execution was levied, the weather and his health were so bad, that'he could not possibly go to the Chancellor to injoin and stay the sale; which injunction must have rested on the ground, that the property was hound to pay the debt to <em>Fleet\u2019s </em>estate first; because the administrator was bound as representing <em>Fleet\u2019s </em>executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">The administrator, having thus, both in Law and in fact, received notice of the true character in which he was charged in this suit, could not be said to he surprised by th\u00e9 exhibition, at the hearing, of the document that <em>M. </em>Shearman-had duly qualified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>executor of <em>Fleet; </em>nor did the Chancellor (in 013'- opinion) err and acting upon that document.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The next objection is, that <em>Marlin Shea}'?na?i. held </em>nearly personal property, under the fraudulent \u00dceecLyand as to this, he cannot be liable as executor of <em>Fleet.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The first answer to this, is, that the fact is not so, \u20191 hgierfippearsto have been no delivery of the properly under the Deed; and A.<em>It. Shearman, </em>when directed to settle the executorship <em>of JtF Shearman </em>on the estate of <em>Fleet, </em>brings into the account all the slaves and other property contained in the Deed, and states them to be \u2018Mhe <em>slaves belonging to the estate of Fleet,\u201d </em>and <em>\u201c sundry </em>y;ro<em>perty that came to the hands of M. Shearman, executor of Fleet;\u201d </em>thus expressly acknowledging that <em>M. Shearman </em>held them, as executor under the Will. But, if <em>M. Shearman </em>had held under the&gt; fraudulent Deed, what .would have been the consequence? In <em>Chamberlayne </em>v. <em>Temple, </em>2 Rand. 384, and <em>Beall </em>v. <em>Silver, </em>2 Rand, 401, it is decided, that if a man make a fraudulent Deed, and die, the fraudulent donee will be liable as executor <em>dc son tori; </em>but here, afilie fraudulent <em>donee </em>was appointed executor by the Will, and qualified, he was a rightful executor, and would, I apprehend, <em>in that character, </em>he liable for what he held under the fraudulent Deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">But, it is denied that <em>M. Shearman </em>ever was a rightful executor, and insisted that the distributees could not file a bill against an ex, eeutor <em>de son tort, </em>but must have an administrator appointed, or the estate committed to the Sheriff. I consider it settled Law, that-every executor regularly appointed by a Court having jurisdiction of the matter, is a rightful executor, while his commission lasts; and though a subsequent Will should be afterwards produced, or the Will under which the executor was appointed, proved to.be a forgery; yet the acts done by the executor prior to such proof, will be.valid, and he will he chargeable as executor for any <em>assets, </em>which come to his hands. If authority were necessary in support \u25a0a position so plain, I would refer to the case of <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Dundas, </em>3 Term Rep. 125, where the very point is diseussed and decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">In our case, <em>M. Shearman </em>was regularly commissioned as executor, by Lancaster Court, in which the Will was proved. Until he was displaced, no administrator could be appointed; nor could he be displaced but by a suit impeaching the Will. This suit was, therefore, properly brought by the heirs and distributees. They pray that the Deed and Will may be set aside, the land divided, and the personal estate distributed. It is admitted, that this was right, so far <em>\u00e9s related to the </em>division of the land; but contended, that as to the distribution of the personalty, the bLU was. that it should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>merely Lave .sought to set aside the Will; and then have left it to the. administrator, (who should bo appointed. )..tt&gt; have recovered the\u2019assets. , By a reference to the case of <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 525, it will be seen, that upon a bill brought to set aside a Will, the County Court, after pronouncing the Will void, go on to direct a distribution. The Decree was reversed by the Courtof Chancery; but, this Court reversed this last, and affirmed the Decree of the County Court; thereby sanctioning the order of distribution. In our ease, it will be recollected, that after an administrator of <em>Fleet </em>was appointed, (which could only be done upon setting aside the Will,) that administrator was made a party to the suit.- Here, then, were convened before the Court, all the parties interested; all praying the Court to proceed, and make an end of the matter; and I cannot eon,ceivo a solid objection to their doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Taking the Defendant <em>E. G. Shearman </em>to be properly charged, and legally liable for the acts of <em>M. Shearman </em>as executor of Fleet, there can be no doubt, that under the express words of the Law, the debt incurred by <em>Martin Shearman, </em>as executor, is of the first dignity, and to bo paid by his administrator, before any proper debt of the said <em>Martin. </em>The Commissioner was therefore right, in reporting the full balance of $5,714, with interest, against the administrator; and the Court right in decreeing against him the-same sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">With respect to the sum decreed against <em>E. G. Shearman </em>indir vidually, for the rents of the land and hires of the slaves received by him, after the death of <em>M. Shearman, </em>there was no objection taken at the bar; and properly, because this part of the account seems to .have been admitted by <em>E. G. Shearman </em>before the Commissioner,</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Upon the whole, I am for affirming the Decree.</p>\n<author id=\"b55-7\">Judge Coalter.</author>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The only\" question in this case, arises out of the principle adopted. <em>by </em>the Commissioner in his report, whereby the Appellant is charged with lire greatest part of the demand of the Appellees, as a debt of the first dignity due from his testator, so as to exclude from his administration aecount, debts to a large amount, which he had paid, and by which a <em>devastavit </em>is thus established on him by the Commissioner, and the final Deeree in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">The original bill was filed in this case, by the Appellees, against <em>Martin Shearman, </em>the Appellant\u2019s testator, alleging that they were heirs at law and distributees of <em>John Fleet: </em>that <em>Fleet </em>was a man of unsound mind, incapable of making contracts ora Will; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>shortly before his death, the Defendanthad,by fraud, imposition and threats, obtained from him a Deed purporting to convey the <em>whole </em>of his property, for the consideration of $5,000-, none of which was-paid; and had, about two months before, in order to fortify his title, also procured him to sign a paper purporting to be a \"Will, when he was utterly incapable of making one, which he had procured to be recorded in Lancaster Court in January, 1801, in consequence of no person appearing to contest it; although, if the Deed had been valid, there could have been no necessity for recording it, because it would have passed only the <em>same properly. </em>This was not contested, they say, because many of the Plaintiffs then were, and some now are, infants, &amp;c. They ask a Decree for their propor - tions of the lands, slaves, and other personal estate; that the Defendant may render an account of the slaves and hires, and of the rents of the lands, which ea <em>me lo his possession on the death of the said Fleet; </em>and pay the same lo them, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\">The Deed purports to bear date on the 25th of April, 1800, and conveys, for the consideration of $5,000, a tract of land of six hundred acres, ten slaves, by name, also twenty head of cattle, four horses, and a variety of household furniture, hogs, sheep, &amp;c. This Deed was admitted to record in September, 1S00, on the acknowle r-.m of <em>Fleet </em>in Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The Will purports to bear date on the 17tli of February, 1800, giving all his estate both real and personal, to the said <em>Shearman, </em>and appointing him executor. This was simply proved <em>and admitted to record, </em>on the 19th -of January, 1S01. No one, at that time, however, appears to have qualified as executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The answer denies the fraud, and insists that <em>Fled </em>was of sound mind when he made both the Deed and Will. It admits that the consideration in the Deed was not the real one, which was, that he was to maintain the grantor, &amp;c. lie denies that the Will was made, as was alleged in the bill, to fortify his claim under the Deed; but that, after the Deed was made, it was discovered by <em>Fled </em>that there was a negro and some outstanding debts, which were not embraced by it; and it being the intention of the parties to the conlract that all his property was to be conveyed, the Will was executed to cure this omission. He says, that the recording of the Will was contested by some of the parties, and denies their right to come in to contest a Will three or four years more than seven (the time limited by Law) after it was recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"AqDf\">Nothing further was done in the case, until <em>Martin Shear-man\u2019s </em>death, which happened in 181-4, except to take depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>In 1815, a bill of revivor was filed by the Appellees, to make the present Appellant, who was administrator with (he Will annexed of <em>Mxriin Shea.r77ix7i, </em>a Defendant; and also to \u00fciake I he devisees of the land in question, Defendants. This hill merely states, that tiro Plaintiffs had theretofore filed their bill against <em>Mxrlin Shnrmwv, </em>for the purpose of setting aside a Deed and Will for a <em>fj-xcl offxnd </em>lying in Lancaster, made, as was said, by <em>John Fleet, </em>in favor of the said <em>Shearman, </em>on the ground that they had been obtained bv fraud, in which certain proceedings had been had, &amp;.c.: flint he had since died: that the Appellant was his administrator, and the others, devisees of the land. They are made Defendants; and the prayer is, that, the suit may be revived and stand in the same plight, &amp;e.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The Defendants answer, the one admitting that he was the administrator, and the others, the devisees; and agree to. a revival.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">After this, to wit, in May, 1817, an issue was directed to try the qu\u00e9stion of fraud, &amp;c.; which was found in favor of the Appellees, both as to the Deed and Will. The verdict was rendered on the 12th of April, 1820; and being certified to the Chancery Court, there was a Decree pronounced on the 27th of the same month, setting aside both Deed and Will, and directing various accounts, both as loth e real and personal estate, a surrender of slaves, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">It may he proper here to remark, that on the death of <em>Martin, Shearman, </em>the regular course would have been, to have had some one qualified as administrator of <em>Fleet, so </em>as to represent the personal estate. This was not done, however, and the bill of the revivor above noticed, seems <em>in its tci'ms, </em>to limit the case, as to the Plaintiffs, to the controversy so far as it regarded the real estate: and it seems to me, that <em>legitimately, </em>whatever to the have been intended, the controversy between the parties then before the Court, could only extend, so far as ultimate relief could be given, to the real estate. To be let in to the enjoyment of this, the heirs had a right to an enquiry into the alleged fraud, both as to the Deed and Will; for both must be set aside or nothing is gained.\"' When they had succeeded as to both, they could only-claim to be let into the enjoyment of the lands, and to have an account of the rents. All beyond this, could alone be claimed by the personal representative of <em>Fleet. </em>But no such representative was-then before the Court, and none such existed. . The Court, however, in the same Decree which vacated the Deed and Will, directs accounts, and amongst others, an account of the administration of <em>Martin Shearman, </em>on the estate of <em>Fleet, </em>directing the Commissioner to comprise in such account, to the <em>debit </em>of the said <em>Martin, </em>the price of slaves, and all the personal estate (except th\u00ae slaves that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>may be surrendered under tho Decree,) and that the said <em>Mart-fit claimed Hile io, by, or under the said papers; </em>thereby, as it seems to me, very properly recognizing only his <em>tille as purchaser or leg'afee, </em>no claim or possession, <em>as executor, </em>having been suggested in miy of the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Accounts were also directed of ihe rents and profits of the land, both in the life-time of 1 he said <em>Martin, </em>and since; reserving liberty to those claiming to be heirs or distributees of <em>Fled, </em>whether Plaintiils or Defendants, to interplead, &amp;c. with a view to <em>a. division </em>or <em>distribution </em>of them// and <em>personal </em>estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The Commissioner reported, and, in taking the accounts of the Appellant\u2019s administration, rejected his disbursements in payment of debts, so as to subject him, as aforesaid, for a <em>devastavit. </em>At the K-tmc time, and at the instance of the Appellant, he reported an account, according to his pretensions, allowing him those credits; and <em>in </em>this way, the point has boon presented to the Court. Jn order to fortify these his pretensions, I presume, Ire files several depositions to prove, that when a large execution of one <em>Fall, </em>which issued on what is called a executed <em>Martin Shearman, </em>as security for <em>Edmunds </em>the debtor, was levied, late in December-, 1858, the'weather was very inclement, and he confined <em>m </em>his house by indisposition, so that lie could not traVel <em>to </em>Richmond or Fredericksburg. Whether any resistance to the execution, which such a journey would have enabled him to make, or what kind of resistance was thought of, does not appear. The object of these depositions seems merely to be, fo prove that if he could, in any way, have made resistance, if was then out of his power to seek advice concerning it</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">It is periincnt to m3' view of this case, here to remark, that at. the time Ibis Decree was pronounced, there was not only a want of <em>a </em>personal representative of <em>Fleet\u2019s </em>estate, but there had been no allegation in the pleadings or proceedings in the cause, that <em>Martin Shearman </em>had ever qualified as executor of <em>Fleet. </em>The priginal hill seems to negative such idea,,by the allegation merely, that the Will had been <em>obtained and recorded, </em>for the purpose of fortifying the claim to the <em>whole property, </em>under the Deed; and is relied ou o.s a circumstance of fraud in regard to that. There is nothing in the bill, charging any thing beyoud a tortious intermeddling with the estate, on the pretence of a fraudulent Will. The bill of revivor seems also to negative any pretence to charge his administrator for his acts <em>as executor, </em>by confining the case <em>to the land, </em>as in Law it. was then confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">The Chancellor\u2019s Decree for account, it seems to me. therefore cap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>ohly </em>have gone on the ground, that as <em>Marlhi Shearman </em>v.is confessedly in possession of the <em>ivhole </em>estate, pretending to hold the greater part as purchaser, and the residue as legatee, and a.-; those papers were both declared void, his estate should be answerable for the whole property, under whichever of those papers he claimed title; but, that however fraudulent or improper that possession was, vela Court of Equity would allow him all just disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">It is true, that in the final Decree it is stated, that an exhibit was <em>then before the </em>Court, showing that he had qualified as excoutor; but at what time, does not appear;'nor do we know when this exhibit was filed. It is not now in the record. The copy of the Will, with, the certificate of the proof of it, shows that he did not qualify as executor when the Will was proved; and it is highly probable, that when the bill was filed, and probably not until long after, it was not known to the Plaintiffs that he ever had qualified, as executor, and that, therefore, he was not charged by them inthat-<em>character. </em>It is not improbable, however, that when about to take the accounts, search may have been, made as to the credits collected by him, and his qualification then discovered, and the document produced to the Commissioner, as has been suggested at the bar;who thereupon took the account in the manner aforesaid. Be this as it may, the report of the Commissioner, and this document, presented the question to the Chancellor on the final hearing, and he supported the Commissioner, i shall therefore consider the case, as if there was a document now in ihe record, proving that he did qualify as executor.</p>\n<p id=\"A_S\">There is also another circumstance belonging to the statement of the case. The report and account were returned in February 1821; and in May following, the Plaintiffs had leave to file a supplemental bill, for the purpose of making one <em>Armstrong, </em>who was agent for a number of them in prosecuting the suit, a Defendant; alleging, that siifee the last continuance, he had taken administration on the estate of <em>Fleet. </em>This was done after the accounts were taken, as aforesaid, and preparatory to a final Decree. The bill was in fiiet filed at the same term the final Decree was pronounced. It alleges that the Plaintiffs are advised, that it is necessary to make him ft Defendant, that a complete Decree may be made, binding the rights of all parties. They agree, that any part of the estate, necessary foils i-s be decreed to to their eventual rights'as distributees; and if none is necessary, but if ho is willing that an immediate distribution may be made, that the same may be'decreed, &amp;c. referring to the preceding proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">To- this bill, that Defendant answered <em>instant er. </em>He admits ilfb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Maiciv.t'nlK is. contains, and <em>udapts.all the proceedings in the </em>suit\u00ab. <em>agreeing to he bound thereby,and </em>agrees that distribution may be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">In this way, and at Hi is time, the personal representative of <em>Fleet </em>is ilaJiy brought into this cause. Up. to this time, then, there is not only an absence of any charge in the hills of proceedings, setting out a claim against the Defendant, <em>as representing an executor, </em>but there was no party to the suit that could <em>regularly </em>make any such ( laim, which could at all ailed the question under consideration. For, 'although <em>\u00f1larlin Shearman\u2019s </em>estate would be answerable for the rents of the land, and to which alone the Plain tills were then entitled, it is admitted on all hands, and so decreed, that the occupation of the land was not a,? <em>executor, </em>and consequently, that rents and profits would not be considered a debt of the first dignily, under ibe Act, but only payable when assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Although <em>Marlin Shearman, </em>then, may have committed a fraudulent spoliation on the rights and properties of these parties; yet, unless the Appellant has also been guilty of improper conduct, it \u2022dan o.nly be <em>strict Law </em>which will remunerate them therefor, ou.l of the estate of an innocent man.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">This statement of the case presents two questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">1. Was <em>Marlin Shearman </em>a qualified executor as to the personal estate <em>comptriscd in the Deed, </em>within the meaning of the Act of Assembly, 1 <em>Rev. Code, 389, </em>which declares, that executors or administrators of any person who shall have been chargeable with liie estate of a dead person, <em>committed </em>to their testator or intestate, by a Court of Record, shall pay so much as shall be due from their testator or intestate to the ward, idiot or lunatic, or to the legatees or persons entitled to distribution, before any proper debt of their testator or intestate?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\"><em>2. </em>If an account of thi:; part of the estate could have been claimed and charged on the estate of <em>Martin Shearman, </em>as a debt <em>of </em>the first dignity, so as to take precedence of olheiPproper debts of his, and to charge his administrator for a <em>devastat'd- </em>in paying such other proper debts, can such pretension be supported under the bill and proceedings above stated?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">Tlie Act of Assembly, I presume, must have intended one of two- or three things; either that an executor or administrator, of an executor, administrator or guardian, &amp;e. is bound to take notice of every ease in which his testator or intestate acted in such fiduciary character, and must likewise bo presumed to have knowledge of the state of the accounts, and whether any thing is due or not, and also of all claims which ma_v, by possibility, be asserted in consequence of such trust: or, that he shall only lie bound to take notice of su\"K <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>trusts as shall be <em>actually </em>made known to hub, together with the extent and nature of the claim, by suit or otherwise; or, if he is bound to notice the <em>trust itself </em>as one committed by a Court of Record, he is not bound to notice any claim, which may be asserted by the <em>cestui que trusts, </em>unless in cases where accounts have actually beeu settled by the Court, and made a matter of record, showing monies due; or, unless a <em>specific </em>claim has been made, by suit or otherwise, in such a way as to show that the claim is one within the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">It has been thought rather a hard case, that executors or adminis\u00bb trators shall be bound by, and obliged to take- notice of, all Judgments, wherever rendered within the State, though they are not only matters of record, but show precisely what is due, and enable the executor at once to defend himself against claims of inferior dignity. But where, so far from there being a Judgment to guide him, there is not even notice by suit or otherwise, <em>actually </em>given, either that there was such trust in relation to the matter claimed, or that there had been a breach of that trust in whole or in part, it would seem to me.an intolerable hardship, to make the executor or administrator answerable, as he would be to judgment creditors. If 3rou do this, you ought to extend to him the correlative benefit of pleading this <em>trusteeship, </em>and all <em>possible claims </em>arising under it, as a bar to all other actions, until such claims shall be <em>exhibted </em>and <em>adjusted. </em>All this would be monstrous, and was never intended by the Law. A trust of this kind may even be settled up by the Court, and the amount paid accordingly, but that account may afterwards be surcharged and set aside, and a much larger sum found due; but, before such claim is made known, the executor or administrator of the trustee may have paid his proper debts. It cannot be, that this is a <em>devastavit </em>under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">If <em>actual </em>notice of the <em>breach of trust, </em>then, is necessary to be given in some way or Other, this of course involves notice of the <em>trust itself, </em>and consequently, <em>implied </em>notice, of it is not necessary to be inferred,- in order to effect the purposes of the Law, as it is in case of Judgments; unless, indeed, it should be in the ease I have above put, of a settlement of accounts, showing a particular balance,, returned to Court and made a matter of record. As to this, I give no opinion. But it seems to me, that where the case depends on <em>actual notice </em>of the claim, the party cannot derive aid from any <em>implied notice in Law, </em>so as to charge another beyond the actual noti.ee given. The notice given ought to show the nature and extent of the-claim; and the party ought not to be permitted after-wards, by evidence or otherwise; to it so as to have a retro\u00bb. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>o'pcctive operation. The nature of the claim, as first announced, is that to which the attention of the executor or administrator is drawn <em>f </em>and he proceeds accordingly. The claim, for instance, as originally made, is, in substance, a charge of a trover and conversion by the testator or intestate, of the goods of the deceased. But, it turns out, afterwards, that lie held them as executor or administrator or guardian, and had not accounted for them. In, the mean time, his executor or administrator has paid debts, &amp;c. Is he bound to know contrary to the claim set up, that this isa trust fund, within the' Act? And can he defend himself against other creditors on this ground? It seems to me not.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\">In general, then, before an executor or administrator or guardian, &amp;c., can be subjected to a <em>devastavit </em>under the Act, he must have <em>actual notice </em>of the nature and extent of the claim, and that it is a charge which pertains to the fiduciary character of his testator or intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The fair way, <em>then, and the most, </em>it seems to me, that can be asked by the Appellees, is to examine this case precisely as if this suit had, for the first time, been instituted at the time the bill of revivor was filed: that the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>Fleet </em>had united with the heirs at law in the bill; and that it had been couched in the same language, making the <em>same charges, and no more, than </em>those contained in the original bill above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The question then recurs, is the personal estate <em>conveyed by the Deed, </em>and held and claimed by <em>Martin Shearman under </em>it, as a purchaser thereof for value, a portion of the estate of <em>Fleet, </em>com-<em>milled </em>to him by a Couit of Record, and which can be charged on his estate as a claim of the first dignity, under any bill that could have been filed in the cause? Would he have been bound by his oath, even if liis claim was under a <em>voluntary Deed, to make an </em>inventory and appraisement of these goods, <em>as of the goods of Fleet? </em>I presume not. No one could have claimed this of him. The Court would not estimate his risque by its value. If there was not chough besides for the payment of debts, \u00f3reditors could resort to this fund for that purpose; but, the Deed would only be void as to-them. <em>Actual fraiid, </em>as to them, would not be necessary. It would be enough'that the Deed was <em>voluntary. </em>They can go against the fund, whether the volunteer is executor or <em>not. The </em>executor or-administrator cannot sue the volunteer to set aside the voluntary Deed, in order to pay debts. .It is no part of <em>their duty, </em>because <em>it is no part of the estate committed to them; </em>and if it is not in this I. cannot see how it would be, if the executor or ad\u25a0fiiinistrator was himself the donee. If he makes an inventory of it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>8\u00e1( part of the estate, it must be subject to distribution, as well as to payment of debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">But this is not a case of creditors. It is a claim by an administrator and distributees, in which it is not enough to show the Deed <em>voluntary; actual fraud </em>in obtaining it, must be the ground of the claim. And though this ground of claim.goes to show, that as well as it regards creditors as distributees, no title passed: but that as to both, the goods are to be treated as the goods of <em>Fleet; </em>yet, I have not been able to perceive how this will vary the ease from that of a. mero voluntary Deed, above put. In some respects, it seems to me-to be a stronger case than that, in favor of the opinion I have advanced as to it. I can see no reason why, as to creditors, <em>actualfraud </em>shaii make it a part of the estate <em>committed </em>by the Court, if the voluntary consideration or <em>legal fraud </em>would not. But, it is the estate of the deceased, because he to whom the estate of the deceased is committed has fraudulently obtained a Deed, vesting the legal title to it in him, before the death of him to whose estate it is said to belong. Suppose, when <em>Martin Shearman </em>qualified, the Court had been told by the Appellees, <em>\u201c </em>This man holds the greater part of the estate of <em>Fleet </em>under a Deed obtained by fraud, and we intend to sue to set it aside, and now desire you to direct the appraisement of that property, and to take security for its amount.\u201d Could the Court have done either? It seems to me not. But would <em>Shear-man </em>be bound to render an inventory, and thereby accuse himself 'of the alleged fraud? Surely not. When, then, does it again become part of the estate of <em>Fleet? </em>Not until the moment when the Deed is vacated; and even if this had been done in the life-timevof <em>Martin Shearman, </em>and if there had been no Will also giving it to him, but he had been adminstrator, I would pause before I would \u25a0say, that his sureties should be responsible for it. But, in this case, and as to <em>these parties, </em>both Deed and Will must be set aside, or nothing is done; and had that taken place in the life-time of <em>Martin Shearman, </em>the very act which made this property again a portion of <em>Fleet\u2019s </em>estate, would have virtually annulled all his power over it as executor. But, this Decree was not in the life-time of <em>Martin Shearman. </em>When he died, the legal estate was in him; and his adminstrator was bound to give security to'its extent, to return an inventory of it, and to pay debts, &amp;e., accordingly. From this latter, he will be excused, however, as soon as these goods are recovered from him, by those having a paramount title. This has been done, and they have got possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">During his possession, then, and during his life, the legal title was iii <em>Martin Shearman, </em>not <em>as epeeptor, </em>but under the Deed. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>slate of tilings continues until the Decree. Up. to that time, <em>thef </em>are a part of <em>Martin Shearman\u2019s </em>estate, and liable for his debts. How then can it be said, that they wore <em>committed </em>to him by a Court of Record, as part of the estate of <em>Fleet?</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0P\">For these reasons, as at present advised, I think that no hill could have been framed, so as to bring this case within the Act of Assembly. The necessary charge, in this case, of <em>actual fraud </em>in getting the legal title from one who did not intend to convey it, or was. incapacitated to do so, is a charge which admits the legal title in him, hut which seeks to avoid it. It charges an act in the nature ofa <em>tort by </em>which an injury lias been done; and, when prosecuted against <em>Martin Shearman </em>alone, it is only charged as <em>&amp; personal </em>injury of this kind, as a fraud subjecting him to certain consequences; not as. a violation of his duty as an executor, in not returning an inventory, and rendering an account of this property. If apprehensions had been entertained that he would remove the slaves, and an in-' junction or sequestration had been asked, would it have been refused because the sureties in the executorial bond would be liable? I presume not; even if it had appeared in the bill, that he had qualified as executor. It is to the <em>consequences </em>arising from this fraud, then, that the estate of <em>Martin Shearman </em>is liable; and I have therefore been unable to perceive, how it could have been charged, as arising from his acts <em>as executor, </em>in relation to property committed to him, as such, by a Court of Record.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">But, if it could have been so charged, it has not been; and if the administrator ought to have notice of the claim, so as to justify him in withholding the assets from other creditors, it ought to he so given or charged, I presume, that he would not only have notice that the demand was claimed as one of the first dignity, but presented in such a shape, that he might plead its pendency, in bar of debts of inferior degree. But, the bill treats the case simply as one of the nature I have above described, simply as a <em>tortious </em>possession under a fraudulent Deed and Will. The hill, in fact, was against-<em>Martin Shearman </em>himself, filed in a case, in which, if he could have been charged <em>as </em>executor, in regard to this part of the estate, he was not so charged, and in which the party had aright to waive charging him as executor, had a right to exonerate his sureties, and to look to him <em>personally, </em>for the consequences of a <em>fraud </em>committed by him, <em>before he was executor, </em>and for which they could equally charge him, whether he had ever qualified as executor or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">If a doubt had existed, \u25a0whether the bill could have been filed in any other shape, the party had a not to risque the consequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ties of that doubt, of a demurrer to his bill, &amp;c. He had a right to go against <em>Martin Shearman </em>alone, in his <em>individual </em>character. If he did this from ignorance that he had qualified as executor, it is the same thing. That might have led to an amended bill, if indeed, it could have been amended. But, then, it could not have operated retrospectively, so as to make previous payments a <em>devastavit. </em>The hill was originally filed as a mere <em>individual </em>charge against <em>Martin Shearman. </em>No other part of the pleadings has changed the nature of that charge; nor is any thing to the contrary perceived in the case, until the Decree vacating the Deed and Will. But even this, as I have above stated, does not seem to me necessarily to involve that question. If it does, however, the payments which have been rejected by the Commissioner, were all before that Decree.'-</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">On the whole, though 1 am not without my doubts, I cannot vote-in support of this Decree subjecting this administrator to a <em>devastavit. </em>That, I believe, is the only point in contest. At all events, I do not perceive any other error.</p>\n<author id=\"b65-5\">The President. '</author>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">My first impression of this case was, that the objections urged by Counsel to the Decree might be obviated by a minute attention to the pleading and facts in the record; but on a full examination of them, I have come to a different conclusion. The proceedings, neither expressly nor by intendment, exhibit any claim against' <em>E. O. Shear-man </em>administrator of <em>Martin Shearman, </em>who was executor of <em>John. Fleet; </em>but charge him solely as administrator of <em>Martin Shearman. </em>The bill recites the Will of <em>Fleet, </em>but founds no claim on it, as its ob-. ject was to set it aside, as well as the Deed; and though it be admitted, that <em>E. G. Shearman </em>had notice of the probate, and must\"be presumed to know that <em>Martin Shearman, </em>his testator, was the rightful executor of <em>Fleel </em>until the probate was repealed, no claim, foundded on these facts, is exhibited against him in any of the pleadings. Nor do I think that his admissions (in the character of administrator of <em>Martin Shearman, </em>in which he is charged) on the adjust^ meat of the accounts directed by the Chancellor, can obviate that objection; as the credits claimed by him, for the payment of the proper debts of <em>Martin Shearman </em>as his administrator, including <em>Dali\u2019s </em>debt, were anterior in date to these admissions before the Commissioner. There is nothing in his admissions, therefore, to deprive him of the right to insist, that until suit was brought against ,him as the administrator of Mart?;? <em>Shearman </em>who was executor of E/eet, claiming the balance due by his testator to Fleet\u2019s estate by the personal representative of Fleet, he could not resist the claims of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>Marlin Shearman1 s </em>proper creditors, on the ground that that ba-.\u2018 lance, whatever it might be, was a debt of superior dignity to theirs. Such a pretence would delay, infinitely, the creditors o\u00ed every one who was executor or administrator, and lead to great frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">But, in another point of view, <em>E. G. Shearman, </em>ought to have been allowed the credits claimed by him as administrator of <em>Mart\u00edn Shearman. </em>The hill was bro\u00fcght to set aside the Deed and Will of <em>Fleet, </em>as fraudulent. It is admitted, that the Deed included all the property of <em>Fleet, </em>except an -inconsiderable part of it, which passed by the Will. Until the Deed and Will were set aside by the Chancellor, <em>Mart\u00edn Shearman </em>was in possession of the property included in them, according to their tenor and'effect. When he qualified as executor of <em>Fleet, </em>he could not be said to be in posses-session of the property included in the Deed, <em>as executor of Fleet, </em>hut <em>in his own </em>right, such as it was. As to that property, he could not have been required to give security by the Court of Probate, but as to the property in the Will only. That he might have been charged as <em>executor in his own wrong, </em>as regarded the property in the Deed, if he had lived until it was set aside, is admitted; but he died before that event: and his administrator can, I think, only be charged as, representing him as executor <em>de son tort, </em>as regards the property in the Deed. In relation <em>to </em>it, a debt due by <em>Martin Shearman to </em>the represen (a lives of <em>Fleet, </em>was a proper -debt of his own, and not of no higher dignity than any simple contract debt. If the bill and pleadings In the cause, therefore, had charged <em>E. G. Shearman, </em>as administrator of <em>Martin Shearman, </em>the rightful executor of <em>Vied, </em>the properly in the Deed could not have been charged to him in that character. As regarded the property in the Will, the proceedings have been very irregular. To have attained the object of <em>the </em>bill, <em>after the </em>death of <em>Martin Shearman, </em>the personal representative of <em>Fleet </em>ought, by supplemental bill, to have been made a party, and on his answer, coming in, an order to settle the accounts should have conformed to the different responsibilities of <em>E. G. Shearman, </em>charged in the supplemental bill. '</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In <em>every </em>point of view, therefore, <em>E. G. Shearman, </em>when he was accounting both for the property in the Deed and Will, ought 4o have been allowed a credit for the payment of the proper debts of <em>Martin Shearman, </em>either as his representative as executor <em>de son tort, </em>as to the property in the Deed; or as rightful executor of <em>Fleet </em>under the Will.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">J think the Decree, therefore, is erroneous in not allowing him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u00bfhose eredits; and so much ought to be reversed; and there is no substantial objection to the residue, it ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b49-14\"><em> </em>Judges Green and C\u00e1bese, absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
