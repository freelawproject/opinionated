The bill begins, \u201c <em>I </em>promise to pay,\u201d &amp;c. and concludes, <em>\u201c I </em>bind myself, my heirs,\u201d &amp;c.; without mentioning any name in the body of it. It is signed and sealed by both the Defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-11\">The Defendants demurred lo the Declaration, and filed a plea, on which issue w7as joined. At the trial, the Defendants filed a demurrer to the evidence; and the Jury found a verdict for the Plaintiff, subject to, the opinion of the Court on the demurrer to evidence. The Court gave Judgment that the demurrer to the Declaration was insufficient, &amp;c. and \u201c <em>therefore </em>it is considered by the Court, that the Plaintiff recover against the said Defendants,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-12\">From this Judgment, the Defendants appealed to the Superior Court of Cumberland, where the Judgment of the County Court was affirmed; and the Defendants appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-13\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the Appellants, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ-\">I. That the County Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Lave never disposed of the demurrer to evidence. They simply decide against the demurrer to the Declaration, and conclude, \u201c and therefore,\u201d &amp;c. <em>2. </em>The bond purports to be given by <em>one </em>person only, and is signed by <em>two.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-5\"><em>S. </em>Taylor, for the Appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A53\">said that the bond was, in effect, <em>johii and several. </em>As to its being in the singular number, the cases of <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>Peake\u2019s N. P. Rep. 130; <em>Clarke </em>v, <em>Blackstock, </em>Bayley on Bills, 37, are conclusive authorities. But, if it be <em>a joint </em>and not <em>a joint and several </em>obligation, it is not bad on u <em>general </em>demurrer. As to the other objection, the Court will intend that both demurrers were overruled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"b42-6\"><em>October </em>26.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A6d\">Judge Caisei.i,</author>\n<p id=\"Ai5\">delivered the opinion of the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Both the demurrers were argued before the County Court. That Court expressly pronounced Judgment on the demurrer to the Declaration; and the rendition of final Judgment in favor of the Plaintiff in the action, upon Ihe verdict of the Jury, necessarily involved o Judgment upon ihe demurrer to the evidence, to which the ver<em>tlicl had been made </em>subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The only question in the cause, is, as to the character of the bill penal, on which the suit was brought. No person is bound <em>in it by </em>name. The bill, in its terms, is in the singular number throughout; <em>\u201c </em>I bind myself, Sic.;\u2019\u2019 as if executed by one person only. But, it is signed and sealed by both of the Defendants. The question is, whether it be joint and several.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">A promissory note, executed in the self same terms, and signed by t\\vo persona, would unquestionably be considered the joint and several note of both <em>and of each of them. Bayley on Bills, 37. New edition. </em>The case of <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>Peake\u2019s Rep. 130; <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Blackstock, </em>Holt\u2019s Rep. 474, and 3 <em>Common Law Rep. </em>159.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">A particular form of expression which will make an unsealed contract joint and several, will not cease to make it so, merely because Heals are added to it. The effect of the seals is not to change the meaning of the parties, but merely to add to the solemnity and dignity of the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">The Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b42-12\">Absent, Judges Giiei.k, and Coalteii.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
