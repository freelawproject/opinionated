By his will, after a number of specific devises and legacies, he directs the residue of his estate, which includes lands, to be divided into four parts, which he gives to one of his sons and three daughters, one of whom is L the wife of W; and directs his. executors to sell the property. W, who then lived in C, removed, and lived in Tennessee in 1869 with his wife and seven children; and he was insolvent. In 1869 W came to C, and he and some of the other children entered into a bond with the executors to submit the matters of difference between them to arbitration, the award to be made a rule of court. W signed this bond for himself and his wife L, without authority from her. The arbitrators awarded to each of the residuary legatees $8,000, to be paid by the executors, the part of L to be paid to W; and that W and the other legatees should give bonds of indemnity. This award was entered as an order of the Circuit court of C, directing the executors to pay the $8,000 to W. Before the money was paid, creditors of W, whose debts were contracted before the death of G, instituted proceedings to subject this sum of $8,000, awarded to W, to pay their claims; and L then filed her bill against them, the executors and W, to have it settled on her.

White in Virginia, whose debts were contracted prior to the death of John Gouldin, instituted proceedings in the county and circuit courts of Caroline, against said White and the executors of said Gouldin, to have satisfaction of their debts out of the money directed by the award to be paid by the executors to William S. White; and in these proceedings there were orders by the court that the debts should be paid by T. W. and James F. Gouldin, the executors, when the money they owed became due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-6\">In November 1871 Mrs. Lavinia C. White, by her next friend L. B. C\u00f3nway, filed her bill in the circuit court of Caroline county, setting out the foregoing facts. She says, her husband has little or no means, and it is with great difficulty that he can support her and her children, and that not comfortably. That the \u2022said $8,000 and the interest thereon, directed to be paid by Thomas W. and James F. Gouldin to said White, arises from the land of her, father, which was \u25a0directed to be sold by his will, and which is-still in the possession of said Thomas W. and James F. Gouldin, his executors; and the fund has not been paid either to William S. White or the creditors who have sought to subject it, naming them; that said White has not reduced the said fund into his possession by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>unconditional decrees, judgments, assignments, or otherwise; nor has she, the plaintiff\u2019, personally united in or been bound by any such proceedings. And making Thomas W. and James F. Gouldin, as executors and in their own right, and the said creditors, naming them, parties defendants, she prays that the said Gouldins may be enjoined from paying any part of said fund to the said creditors; that it may be settled upon her for the support of herself and her children; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-9\">The creditors answered, insisting that Mrs. White was bound by the submission and award and the order of the court upon the award; and that the fund had been by these proceedings reduced into possession by the husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-10\">Several witnesses were examined, who proved the insolvent condition of White, and the number of the children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-11\">The cause was removed to the circuit court of Spotsylvania, and came on to be heard on the 25th of November 1872; when the court held that there had been a reduction into possession by William S. White of the estate sought to be settled on the plaintiff, by the award which was entered as a decree in the case, <em>ex parte </em>Gouldin, in Caroline circuit court on the 23d of September 1869. The injunction was therefore dissolved, and it was decreed, by the consent of William S. White, that after the payment of the debts to the creditors named, and any other debts of William S. White which might be made out of said funds, the balance of the fund should be paid to L. B. Conway, as trustee, for the sole and exclusive use and benefit of the said Lavinia C. White.

Gouldin the first choice of the three lots, and to his son Thomas W. Gouldin the second choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">He bequeaths to his granddaughter Josephine A. Broadus, for life, with remainder to her issue, if any, and in default of issue to his children and their legal representatives, the sum of three thousand dollars in bank stock and two servants.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">To his son Thomas W. Gouldin a specific legacy, including a number of servants.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">To his son James F. Gouldin a similar specific legacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">To the estate of his son Silas B. Gouldin, the interest of Silas B. Gouldin, Jr., which he bought of C. C. Jett, trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\">To his daughters, Martha J. .Broadus, Lavinia C. White and Bettie J. Conway, he makes severally specific legacies of slaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-17\">To his daughter Lavinia C. White he gives the money he lent her husband Wm. S. White, and his watch; to his daughter Bettie Conway one thousand dollars, to be added to what she has already received; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>and to his daughter Martha J. Broadus he lends the farm on which she resides, for her use and benefit during her life, and at her death to return to his heirs- or their legal representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">All the balance of his estate, not already disposed of, he directs shall be equally divided into four parts. After , the sale of the land, one part to go to the heirs of his son Silas B. Gkmldin, one part to his daughter Martha J. Broadus, one to Lavinia C. White, and one part to Bettie J. Conway.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">That portion of his estate included in the foregoing residuary clause, allotted to the heirs of his son Silas, he leaves in the hands of his executors, to be sold or not as they may think best for the children, and equally divided among them. And that portion allotted to his daughter Martha J; Broadus, as well as the farm on which she resides, he leaves also in the hands of his executors, in trust, for her use and benefit during her life, and at her death to return to his children, &amp;c. He directs his executors to sell the portion of his estate which is included in the residuary clause, as soon after the payment of his debts as they may think best for the benefit of the legatees interested. And he appoints his sons Thomas W. G-ouldin and James F. Gouldin his executors, and requires of them no security.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">William S. White removed, with his wife Lavinia and their seven children, to the state of Georgia, in 1863, where they remained until 1871, when they removed to the state of Tennessee, where they now reside. This is a suit by Mrs. Lavinia C. White, by bill in chancery, for a settlement on her and her children of the foregoing legacy. The bill alleges that her husband, William S. White, has little or no means, and can with great difficulty support her and her chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>dren, and that not comfortably. The evidence shows very clearly that he is insolvent. The issue is between her and creditors of her husband, who seek to subject her legacy to the payment of his debts. When these debts were contracted the property involved in this controversy was neither hers nor her husband\u2019s. It was the property of John Gouldin, who subsequently bequeathed it to his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">The wife had rights in this legacy independently of, and adversely to her husband. The theory of this branch of equity jurisprudence, is very clearly stated by Mr. Story (2 Stor. Eq. \u00a7 1405). \u201cBy marriage (he says) the husband clearly acquires an absolute property in all the personal estate of his wife capable of immediate and tangible possession. Butif it is such as cannot be reduced into possession except by an action at law, or by a suit in equity, he has only a qualified interest therein, such as will enable him to make it an absolute interest by reducing it into possession. If it is a <em>chose in action, </em>properly so-called, that is, a fight which may be asserted by an action at law, he will be entitled to it if he has actually reduced it into possession in his lifetime. (Mr. Story says a judgment is not sufficient; upon which we give no opinion.) But if it is a right which must be asserted in a court of equity, as where it is vested in trustees who have the legal property, he has still less interest. He cannot reach it without application to a court of equity, in which he cannot sue without joining her with him; although perhaps a court of law might permit him to do so, or at least to use her name without her consent. If the aid of a court of equity is asked by him in such case it will make him provide for her, unless she consents to give such equitable property to him.\u201d <em>Baldwin, </em>J., in <em>Yerby &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Lynch &amp; al. </em>8 Gratt. 439, 476, said, \u201cIt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>will be found that whenever the husband has not the unlimited disposition by assignment of <em>choses in action </em>of \u25a0 the wife, they are such as are not assignable at common law, as debts due her on bonds or otherwise, money in funds, legacies, trust funds, and other property recovei-able by action or suit.\u201d The propei\u2019ty in this case is a legacy, which is only recoverable by suit in equity; and in a suit for such purpose by the husband he must join the wife as plaintiff And if the husband had brought suit in this case to procure said legacy, or any portion of his wife\u2019s fortune, a settlement would have been decreed to the wife upon her request. In such ease it is of no consequence, whether the fortune accrues before or during a marriage, the equity of the wife will attach to it. (Stor. Eq. \u00a7 1408.) And the legacy having been made to her during the marriage, and after the debts sought to be enforced against it were contracted, she has a higher equity against the claims of her husband\u2019s creditors, because the debts could not have been contracted on the faith of the property now claimed by her. All who claim under the husband must take his interest subject to the same equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The wife was then, in this case, invested with a property by the will of her father, of which she could not be divested by her husband or bis creditors by any legal proceeding except by suit in equity, to which she was a party. The wife may not only assert her right to a settlement in a suit brought by the husband or his assignee to extinguish her right, by way of defence; but she may bring a separate and independent suit in her own name by her trustee, against the husband and his assignee, to prevent her property being subjected to the marital rightR of her husband, and to have it, or a part of it, settled upon her and her children. It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>at one time supposed that the wife could only assert her equity in a suit by the husband or his assignee to acquire her property absolutely, only upon the principle that he who asks equity must do equity. But it seems to be settled now, that the wife\u2019s equity constitutes a valuable consideration to support a post-nuptial settlement by her husband; and it is now firmly established that she may recover her property in a suit brought by her or her trustee for the purpose of asserting her claim to a settlement, and that a court of equity will decree to her the whole of it if only a reasonable settlement. <em>Poindexter &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Jeffries &amp; als., </em>15 Gratt. 363; Stor. Eq., \u00a7 1377 a; <em>Davis\u2019 widow </em>v. <em>Davis\u2019 creditors, </em>25 Gratt. 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">But it is contended by the appellees, that the right of the husband to the wife\u2019s legacy in this case has become absolute, and the wife\u2019s equity extinguished by the submission and award of arbitrator's, and the entering up said award <em>ex parte </em>as the decree of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">It does not appear that the appellant was a party to that submission. The deed of submission is signed and sealed by William S. White, and under his signature is written, \u201cFor self and Laviuia C. White.\u201d There is nothing to show that her signature is there either by her act or by her authority, \u201eor with her assent. Indeed it does not purport to have been signed by her. It only purports to have been signed and sealed by William S. White for himself and Lavinia C. White. She puts in issue the fact of execution by her bill, by the averment that she has not personally united in or been bound by any of those proceedings; and there is nothing in the record to show that she participated in them in any manner. At the time of these proceedings, from their inception to their ending, she was not present, but resided in a distant state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>and in all probability had no knowledge of what was going on. Her husband disclaims any authority from her to assent to the submission, or to confirm or sanction the award, and there is no proof of her knowledge or assent.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Is it competent for the husband, in the absence of his wife, and without her consent or knowledge, to enter into an agreement with the executors of her father and the legatees, to submit to arbitration her legacy, which he could only recover by suit, by suing jointly with her in equity, and in which suit he could not recover without making a settlement on her, and to agree that the award should be made the decree of court under a rule, thereby depriving the wife of her right to a settlement? It would be a fraud upon the rights of the wife. If she were notified of the proceeding, she might invoke the interposition of a court of equity to restrain the arbitrators from proceeding to-award the payment of her legacy to her husband, or her husband from receiving it, without making a reasonable settlement on her and her children. It does not appear that she was ever served with notice of the award or of the rule of court. The whole proceeding was <em>ex parte </em>as to her, and should not be allowed to deprive her of her right to a settlement. The award itself is but a chose in action, and doubtless was not intended by the arbitrators to settle aiid adjust- any questions involving the marital rights of the husband or wife; nor was the litigation of any such matters contemplated or designed by the parties in their deed of submission; nor was there in fact any such question canvassed' or passed upon by the arbitrators in making up their award. The only purpose was to ascertain the extent of the executors\u2019 liabilities, and the amount due to each legatee; and the direction that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>the executors should pay to William S. White the legacy due to his wife was given evidently without reference to any question as to the right of the wife to a settlement, and without intending to pass upon such right. The award has not been executed; the <em>ex parte </em>decree has not been performed; the subject matter remains in <em>statu quo. </em>What is there to preclude the wife from now filing her bill, and asking that the <em>ex parte </em>decree may be reformed, and that the amount awarded her should not be paid to her husband or his creditors, but that it be settled on her and her children; as she has done in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">. But does the award and the <em>ex parte </em>decree of the court, if valid, vest the plaintiff\u2019s legacy absolutely in her husband, and debar her of her right to proceed in equity for a settlement?</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u201chTo act or intention of the husband which stops short of an <em>actual </em>reduction-into possession, or of an entire extinguishment of the original right of action in the wife, in some of the modes indicated, can operate so as to destroy her right.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>J., in <em>Yerby &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Lynch &amp; al., </em>3 Gratt. 439, 495. In this case there has been no actual reduction of the wife\u2019s legacy by the husband into possession. The <em>residuum </em>consisted of lands, which the executors were required to sell as soon after payment of testator\u2019s debts as they may think best for the legatees interested. The bill alleges that said lands are still held by the executors unsold, and the legacies which are to be raised by the sale thereof have not been paid; tfiat the legacy to the plaintiff has not been paid. to her husband or to his creditor\u2019s, and that she is not precluded by reason of said award and <em>ex parte </em>decree, to which she was not a party, from obtaining a decree against the executors in this suit. She is willing to accept the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>in satisfaction of her legacy as ascertained by the said arbitrators; but asks that the same may be settled upon her for the support of herself and childi\u2019en, free from the control or appropriation of her husband, or any of his creditors. Admitting said award and <em>ex parte </em>decree to be binding as between her husband and the other parties to the same, it cannot be binding as between her and any of the parties thereto, she not having been a party to either. And the decree that the executors should execute their bonds to William S. White for the amount of his wife\u2019s legacy so ascertained, and execute a deed of trust upon certain lands as security for the same, upon receiving refunding bonds with security satisfactory to them, from the said William S. White, and deeds of release from the said William S. White and Lavinia 0., his wife, of all the interests and claims of said parties in and to the estate of John Gouldin, deceased; and moreover, releasing said Thomas W. and James F. Gouldin of all liability and obligation to them, over and beyond their obligation for the payment of moneys, as imposed and directed by said award, having never been perfonned; and the payment to W. S. White by the executors being conditioned upon the performance of said several acts by the said Wm. S. White, which he has not chosen to perform, and upon the execution of a joint deed of release by the said Wm. S. White and Lavinia O. White, which it was at least optional with her to perform or not, it seems to the court that said conditional award and decree not having been performed by the husband, and not obligatory upon the executors until performed by William S. White and Lavinia C., his wife, and being incapable of a coerced performance by the wife, they cannot be regarded as even constructively a reduction by the husband of the wife\u2019s legacy into his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>possession. Hor can said award and decree, under the circumstances and in connection with the facts, be regarded as a surrender or waiver by the wife, or ex-tinguishment of her equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Courts of equity will interpose to secure to the wife her equity to a settlement\u2014first, when the husband seeks aid or relief in a court of equity in regard to her property; secondly, when he makes an assignment of her equitable interest; and, thirdly, where she seeks, as plaintiff, relief in equity against her husband, or his assignees, in regard to her equitable interests. It is true, she may waive a settlement, and agree that the equitable fund shall be wholly and absolutely paid over to her husband. But it must very satisfactorily appear that such was her wish. In a pending proceeding her consent must he given before a settlement under the decree is completed, and her consent must be given in open court or under a commission. Such is the respect which the coui\u2019ts of equity have for the wife\u2019s equity. And in some cases a court of equity will not allow the wife to dispense with a settlement out of her property, as where she had been a ward of the court of chancery and married without its authority. 2 Story Eq. \u00a7\u00a7 1404 and 1418.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">As to the amount which should be settled upon the wife\u2014whether a part or the whole of her legacy, and, if only a part, what proportion\u2014depends upon what would be a reasonable settlement. The court is not prepared to say that the whole of the wife\u2019s legacy in this case ought not to be settled on her and her children. If it is not more than would afford them a reasonable support, being property given to her by her father, and upon the faith of which the debts in question could not have been contracted, and evidently not intended to go to her husband, for even the debt due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the testator by the husband he gives to her, it would not be an unreasonable settlement. But there ought to be an account, to ascertain what would be a reasonable allowance. The court is therefore of opinion, to reverse the decree with costs, and to remand the cause, to be proceeded with in conformity with the principles herein declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
