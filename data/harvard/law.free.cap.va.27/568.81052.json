Medley, the widow of Granville Medley, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>entitled to dower in the estate of her husband, which he took under the will of his father, Isaac Medley.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The provision of the will under which the question arises is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">\u201cI devise to my son, Granville O. Medley, my lands lying between Miry creek, Hewey creek and. the road leading from the Union meeting house to my mill, bounded as follows,\u201d &amp;c., &amp;c. \u201cI also give to my son, Granville, all the lands that I have devised to my wife during her life or widowhood, the possession whereof the said Granville is to be entitled to at the determination of the estate so devised to my wife by her death or marriage, -whichever shall first happen.\u201d \u201cIf my son, Granville, shall die without having had lawful issue of his body, the lands so devised to him are to be divided among those as hereinafter provided.\u201d And in the eleventh clause of his will, the said Isaac Medley devised as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">\u201cAll other lands belonging to me, not mentioned in this will, together with all my estate of every kind not otherwise disposed of, I direct to be sold, the proceeds of said sale and whatever may be due me, I appropriate to the payment of-my debts; and whatever surplus may remain, I give, to be equally divided among my four daughters above named. The Roanoke stock, above named, at the death of my wife, is to be considered as embraced in this clause, likewise the lands devised to my son, Granville, should he die without having had issue as aforesaid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Granville C. Medley died \u201c without having had lawful issue of his body,\u201d and his widow, Lucy Y. Medley, filed her bill in the circuit court of Halifax, praying that the will of Isaac Medley be construed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>the court, and that she be endowed of all the real-estate taken by the said Granville O. Medley, under the will of his father, the said Isaac Medley, deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">On the trial of this suit, the learned judge of the-circuit court of Halifax was of opinion that the said Lucy Y. Medley was entitled to dower in the real estate-aforesaid, and accordingly so decreed on the 9th day of September, 1872.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">\"Was Mrs. Lucy Y.
