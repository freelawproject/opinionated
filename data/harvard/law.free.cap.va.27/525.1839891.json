Code, </em>ch. 115.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">At the trial, the following articles of agreement appear to have been given in evidence: \u201cThis article witnesseth, that I, <em>Nancy Patterson, </em>let all my land, including the Sulphur Spring, to <em>Sterling Leve&amp;ey, </em>for the term of twenty-five years. The said <em>Sterling </em>is to make all the necessary buildings for the use of the Sulphur Spring: He is also to put the Spring i\u00f1 as Complete order as the nature of the place will admit of, altogether at his own expenseJ and the said <em>Nancy, </em>and the said <em>Sterling, </em>are to be equal shares in furnishing all the necessaries for the' accommodation of the Springs, such as bedding, provisions of all sorts, and spirits; the sugar camp is to be for the use of the Spring daring the partnership, and the said <em>Nancy, </em>and the said <em>Sterling, </em>are to be equal shares in all the profits arising from the use of said Spring, and farm also. If the said <em>Nancy </em>should think fit to dispose of her part before the partnership dissolves, the said <em>Sterling </em>is to have the refusal: or, should said <em>Sterling </em>think fit to dispose of his part, the said <em>Nancy </em>is to have the refusal; and the said <em>Sterling </em>is to leave all the improvements in repair at the expiration of the time; and to the true performance of the above, we do each qf us bind ourselves, our heirs, &amp;c. in the penal sum of one thousand pounds.

The Jury rendered a verdict in favor of the Plaintiff, and the Justices gave Judgment, that he recover the possession and costs, and awarded a Writ of Possession!.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"pAZ8\">The Judge of the Superior Court of Law for Greenbrier County, awarded a <em>Supersedeas to the </em>Judgment, of the Justices; and on the-trial of the <em>Supersedeas, </em>that Court, being of opinion that the Justices erred in refusing to permit the Defendants to give evidence of the understanding of the parlies as to the original article of partnership or agreement entered into between them, and how they used and occupied the premises, before the assignment to the-<em>Plaintiff,\"Bowyer; </em>and being also of opinion, that from the original articles, the parties were partners, and each had a right to enter on the premises, and neither had a right to exclude the other: and that therefore, the Plaintiff, <em>Bowyer, </em>could not have any better title under his assignment, and was not entitled to the entire possession of the whole premises, in exclusion of the other parties, reversed the-Judgment and awarded a Writ of Restitution to the Defendants, <em>Martin </em>and <em>Carraway, </em>to. restore to. them the possession of the said tenement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-7\">To the Judgment of the slid Superior Court, a <em>Supersedeas </em>was-awarded by the Court of Appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-8\"><em>Chapman Johnson, </em>for the Plaintiff in Error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-9\"><em>No Counsel </em>for the Defendants in Error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"b408-10\"><em>October </em>15.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"A3E\">The Court delivered its <em>opinion.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Judge Cabell.</author>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">It was not competent to the Superior Court, to give any Judgment on the merits of the case depending on the title of the parties, since the proceedings presented no such question to the Court. The verdict was a general one, and the only question, presented by the Record for the consideration of the Superior Court, was, whether the Court of the Justices improperly refused to give the instruction that was asked for, or gave an improper instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Where there is a latent ambiguity in a written instrument, it may be explained by parol testimony: or, where the terms used in a written agreement have not a definite legal signification the custom of the trade, or the acts of the parties, may be resorted to, for the construction of them. But, the agreement in this case, (if that which is copied into the Record be the one referred to in the Bill of Exceptions,) contains no ambiguity whatever, nor is there a word which has not a definite legal signification. It was therefore, right in the Court of the Justices, to refuse the instruction which was asked for, and the instruction which was given, was likewise correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The Judgment of the Superior Court is reversed, and that of, the Justices affirmed, with a direction to the Superior Court, to award a Writ of Re-restitution, if the Writ of Restitution awarded by that Court has been executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Judge Green and the President concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-11\"><em> </em>Absent, Judges Coaiteu and Caub..</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
