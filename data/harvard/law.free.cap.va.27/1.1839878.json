Qn the 21st of December* 1809,- <em>Brown, </em>by written agreement under seal, sold to <em>Street, </em>a tract of land, containing 57 acres, more or less, in the of Franklin, bounded by the lands of <em>Hancock, Rives, </em>and <em>Brooks, </em>with a grist mill thereunto belonging; for which <em>Street </em>was to pay a negro man called <em>Juba, </em>and $200, to be paid on the 1st of January, 18 \u00cd0; <em>Brown </em>being bound to make and maintain a right in fee simple to the land. The negro was delivered immediately; and on the day after the contract, (22d of December, 1809,) <em>Street </em>executed a penal bill for the $200, thus: \u201cl confess myself justly indebted to <em>T. Broion, </em>in the sum of $200, to be paid to the said <em>Broion, </em>&amp;c. on the 1st of January next. Yet the condition of the above is such* that the tsaid <em>Broion </em>is bound to make a right in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>foe simple, to a certain tract <em>of </em>land in the County <em>o\u00ed </em>J\u00edrani\u00bf}in, bounded by the lands of <em>Hancock, Rices, </em>and <em>Brooks; </em>ami should the said <em>Broion, </em>make and maintain the said right, the said <em>Street </em>is bound in the penal sum of $400; otherwise, the above obligation to be held void,\u201d &amp;o.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-5\">On this penal bill, <em>Brown, </em>in 1S12, brought an action of covenant, setting out the bill with it* condition, and averring that he bad conveyed in fen simple, the said land to the said Defendant, according to the form, tenor and effect, of the said covenant, and charging a breach in the non-payment of the <em>money.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b14-6\">The Defendant pleaded, that the Plaintiff ought not to have and maintain his action, because, by 'the covenant, he was bound to make him a title to the land before the payment of the $200; and he avers, that the Plaintiff has not made him a title in fee simple to the said tract of land, and this, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-7\">The. Plaintiff replies, that he ought not to be precluded, &amp;c. because he saith, that he <em>hath </em>made a right and title in fee simple to the Defendant, to the tract of <em>land in the covenant aforesaid, in the declaration mentioned, </em>and this he prays may be enquired of, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-8\">This is the sole issue joined in fho cause. The Jury find a general verdict for the Plaintiff for $331; thereby falsifying the plea,, and affirming that the Plaintiff had made a title to the Defendant, <em>to ihe tract of land, which, </em>by the covenant, he had bound himself to convey. Without having this fact expressly proved to them, ihc Jury could not have found for the Plaintiff; for, the covenant shewed, that this conveyance was a condition precedent to the payment of the $200, and the pleadings rested the whole caso upon that point, the Plaintiff taking the affirmative, that her had made the fee simple title. This judgment stands unimpeached. .No exception, no motion for a new trial, no appeal. -But a Bill of Injunction is tiled to stay the judgment, and in effect to re-try the issue in Equity; and this, without stating any surprise in the trial at Law, any <em>defect </em>of evidence, any fraud, or making any appeal to the conscience of the Defendant for a discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-9\">This brief statement is sufficient <em>to </em>shew. that. Equity has nothing <em>to do </em>with <em>the casef </em>i'shall not, therefore, trouble myself with tho evidence taken'on the Injunction, further than to say, that. 1 think iiiyT brother GbeeiPs view of it is a very correct one. . \u2022 \u25a0 \u25a0 .</p>\n<p id=\"b14-10\">The Decree oi the Chancellor nui.M be reversed, rnd that of the County Court affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b15-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Judge UilEEX.</author>\n<p id=\"b15-4\"><em>Street, </em>on the 21st December, 1809, purchased a mill and tract, of land adjoining, as containing 57 aerea;.-for which he was to pay a negro man who was immediately delivered to Brown, at the price of \u00bf5 500, and 200 on the first of Jammy, 1810. Articles of agree\u25a0nei.f, to this effect, were executed bv thi ji\u201er:;f&gt;s on the day the contract was made. The Jane! was ds'rr;\\.\u2018d a , vjunded by the lands o <em>(futuro Hives, </em>and <em>Brooks; </em>\u25a0\u25a0 , ! <em>Bv. </em>covenanted to make and maintain a right in fee simple te <em>i.:r </em>I.o. which was described as containing 57 aeren, <em>more or less. Street, </em>on the 22d of December, 150.9, gave to <em>Brown </em>an obligation to pajr the $200 on the 1st of January, them next, provided <em>Brown </em>should make and maintain to <em>Street </em>aright in fee simple to a certain tract of land, bounded by the lands of Hancock, <em>Hives, </em>and <em>Brooks, </em>(without naming any quantity,) to which <em>Brown </em>was already bound to make and maintain a title in fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">In April, 1S12, <em>Brown </em>instituted an action of covenant on this obligation against <em>Street, </em>and averred that he had conveyed the land according to tho agreement; and issue was taken upon this single point, and found for the Plaintiff; who thereupon had judgment for the $200 and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-7\">'I\u2019lie Defendant, <em>Street, </em>thereupon filed his bill to injoin the judgment at law, stating, that upon a survey, the land represented in tho contract as 57 acres, turned out to be only 40 or 41 acres; and that he claimed a proportionable abatement, which the said <em>Brown </em>refused to allow, pretending that he had conveyed to <em>Street </em>the full quantity which he had agreed to sell; and the Complainant, whilst he admits tho fact, that such a conveyance had been made, allege.1; * that it embraces 20 acres or more, which did not belong to the tract he purchased, but were a part of the lands of <em>William Brooks, </em>which lie never meant or wished :o purchase, and which is of inferior valu\u00f3.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-8\">Tho Defendant, by his answer, stated that he had sold 60 acres ol laud, instead of 57, as mentioned in the contract: that the boundaries were known and agreed upon by the parties; and that it was agreed, that if the agreed boundaries did not contain 60 acres, the deficiency was to be made up out of the adjoining land, which ho had purchased from <em>William Brooks; </em>and refers to the deed to him recorded, which included all the land conveyed to the Plaintiff, and that he had conveyed the 60 acres to the Plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-9\">It is hardly possible, from the pleadings and proofs in the cause, to ascertain clearly the circumstances of the transactions involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>this suit.' It seems, however, that <em>Benjamin Brooks, </em>the father oi\" <em>William Brooks, </em>held one acre of land, on which there was a mill; and that the title remained in <em>Hancock, </em>who held all the adjoining land. <em>B. Brooks </em>afterwards purchased of <em>Hancock </em>the land adjoining the mill, by metes and bounds, supposed to contain 57 acres. <em>B. Brooks </em>had the land surveyed, and represented to <em>Hancock </em>that it contained only 31 acres; whereupon, <em>Hancock </em>sold or laid off to him by metes and bounds, 20-acres of the adjoining land. The first sale now turns out by survey, to be 40 or 41 acres. AH these lands, including the acre upon which the mill stood, were afterwards conveyed by <em>Huncock to William Brooks, </em>at the reqnest of <em>Ji. Brooks; </em>so that <em>Brooks </em>held in the whole, in reality, 67 acres, in the mill tract. Afterwards, <em>W. Brooks </em>sold the mill with GO-acres of land to <em>Brown </em>(called 5? in the contract betwsen <em>Brown </em>and <em>Street;) </em>hut before any conveyance was made, <em>Brown </em>sold to <em>Street. </em>The witness, who wrote the agreement, says he understood the sale to be of the 60 acres purchased by <em>Brown, </em>of Brooks; and that it was supposed to be 60 acres that were sold by <em>Hancock </em>to <em>B. Brooks; </em>although, in the writing, he put it at 57 acres. The Plain.tiff contends that he only purch\u00e1sed the 40 acres, which was the first purchase by <em>Brooks </em>from <em>Hancock; </em>that he was not bound to take any beyond the lines of that purchase, out of <em>Brooks\u2019 </em>second purchase from <em>Hancock, </em>that being <em>Brooks\u2019 </em>land, which he did not wish or intend to purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-7\">The Defendant contends, that his purchase from <em>Brook's </em>was of sixty acres, out of all he got-from <em>Hancock, </em>(which <em>Brooks </em>admits:)' that his sale to <em>Street </em>was of the land he had purchased of <em>Brooks; </em>and that the second purchase of <em>Brooks </em>from <em>Hancock, </em>was no more <em>Brooks\u2019 </em>land when he sold to <em>Street, </em>than the mill and the first purchase, the legal tille to the whole still being in <em>Brooks; </em>and that <em>Brooks </em>has conveyed to him, and he to <em>Street, </em>according to their respective contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-8\">Tiie Defendant\u2019s representation seems to be true. The call to be bounded in part by <em>Brooks\u2019 </em>land, refers to the seven acres reserved by <em>Brooks </em>out of the 67 acres he held; which is all, so far as appears, that he held in thatneighbourhood. It is proved, that <em>Street, </em>after the centrad', said that he was to take the difference between the quantity hr the first purchase from <em>Hancock, </em>and the 60 acres out of the adjoining land, the second purchase from <em>Hancock. </em>This is proved by <em>Brooks,- Hancock, </em>and the two <em>Kemps. </em>The real dispute was w.ith <em>Brooks, </em>as to what particular part of his second purchase should he laid off for Brown, and <em>Street, </em>claiming under him.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Whatever might be the merits of this dispute, it seems to have \u25a0been settled by the giving of a deed, according to <em>Brooks\u2019 </em>server, by <em>Brown, </em>and its acceptance by <em>Street. </em>That deed is in the record. There is no witness to it, and it is recorded upon the acknowledgement of <em>Brown; </em>and I think th.c probability is, that it was made and recorded, without the consent of <em>Street. </em>However this may be, it can have no influence in the actual slate of the pleadings and proofs. <em>Street </em>docs not allege, or \u00a1.\u2022\u2022etend to prove, tins fact; and the issue tried in the suit af L..v, wiwh was found against <em>Street, </em>directly involved this question. If tit\u2019s deed had not been proved to have been accepted by <em>Street, </em>the Jury could not have found that <em>Brvion </em>had performed the condition precedent, by conveying according 1\u00abo his contract. It is true, if the contract was only to convey the first purchase from <em>Hancock, </em>by <em>Brooks, </em>this conveyance would have been, if accepted, a performance of the contract, although it conveyed other lands also, liut, in that case, it could not he right to allow <em>Street </em>a credit for the deficiency, whilst he held the title to the excess conveyed to him, as is the effect of &lt;ho Decree. But, in truth, the land conveyed, was according to the contract, so far as it includes a part of the two purchases from <em>Hancock. </em>The only description of the land, in the contract, is, 57 acres, more or less, si,\u00a1joining <em>Hancock\u2019s, Brooks\u2019, </em>and <em>Rives' </em>lands. It does not refer to any particular boundaries, nor to any general descript ion, as a particular purchase made by <em>Brown, </em>of any other; or <em>by Brooks, </em>of other. To identify the land sold, it was indispensably necessary to resort <em>to parol </em>evidence. It was a case of latent ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-4\">As to the question, how. the additional land was to he laid off, if <em>Sti'cet </em>intended to contest that, he should have refused to accept the conveyance; and his acceptance of the deed, preclud-js any enquiry into that subject; no fraud or mistake being alleged. The acknowledgment of a deficiency of 17 acres, has no effect. It was only an acknowledgment that 17 acres were convoyed,-over and above the quantity of the original purchase by <em>Brooks </em>from <em>Hancock.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">The land, (I moan the whole tract conveyed to <em>Street,) </em>was intrinsically of little value. One of the witnesses values it at $ 1 <em>per </em>acre; another, at $2; and the additional land is valued by a witness, at 70 <em>cents. </em>The difference between laying off the 17 or 20 acres, in the way <em>Brooks </em>insisted on, and in the way <em>Street </em>claimed, could not amount, in value, to more than $5 or $10. The real value of the purchase consisted in the mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-6\">Upon the whole, I think the Decree of the Chancery Court should he reversed, and that of the County Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Judge Cabell concurred, and a Decree entered accordingly.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b18-18\">The Pbestbext ami Judge <em>Co.tr.rr.p. </em>ab'serV.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
