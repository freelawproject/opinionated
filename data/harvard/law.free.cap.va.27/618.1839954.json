It does not show on its face how <em>Peter E. Bentley, </em>the grantor, derived his title.

One of the Executions was'in .behalf of <em>Elizabeth Ronald, </em>against <em>William Bentley\u2019s </em>goods and chattels, for #6,621 62, with interest from 30th January, 1811, till paid; another in behalf <em>\u00f3f John F.

All of the Executions bore date 8th. March, 1819, returnable to the first day of the next Term, and were levied by the Marshal on three slaves, the proceeds of the sales of which were applied first to the discharge of the Execution for costs, and the surplus divided and applied equally to the other two, on each of which was made the sum of #91 <em>'86. The Marshall does not return \u201c </em>nulla bona,\u201d <em>as to the residue of the money decreed to the Plaintiffs, nor does it appear from the Record that any other Execution was sued out under that Decree. </em>This suit was shortly afterwards brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-5\">So much for the Bill, and its exhibits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-6\">The Defendant <em>William A. Bentley, </em>answered, saying that in 1805 or \u201906, a verbal contract was made between his father and Himself, by which he was to purchase, and receive from his father, a tract of land, for which his father had paid a full and valuable consideration: that as some difficulty was expected in the relinquishment of dower by his father\u2019s wife, it was agreed that the Messrs. <em>Coches </em>should convey directly to the Defendant, and that the Defendant should convey six hundred acres to his brother <em>Peter-, </em>that several exchanges having been made between the Defendant and his \u25a0 brothers <em>Feter </em>and <em>Joseph, </em>he now retains about fifty acres of that six hundred acre traet, for which he has paid a valuable consideration to <em>Joseph. </em>He argues, that if no valuable considerati\u00f3n had passed, that blood alone, from a father in prosperous circumstances, to a son just commencing life, would be entitled to some respect, and that the creditors of W\"1 <em>Ham Bentley </em>could not disturb his title, so long as there was other property unprotected by such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>equity; but he avers that for the five hundred and seven acres which he holds, he bound himself to pay his father 1,000/., in annual instalments, beginning in 1808, and that he has paid that sum, the last in 1812. [He supports this allegation by the deposition of one <em>Armistead Martin, </em>who proves that he saw the <em>Defendant </em>pay his father 200/. in eaeh of the years 1808-9-10; and by the deposition of <em>John Peck, </em>who proves that he saw him pay his father 200/. in 1812, and that Wfilwm <em>Bentley </em>said thatit was the last instalment.] The Defendant further says, that since 1812, he has made sundry advances to his father, and to others for him, but has rarely retained the vouchers, knowing there would be no occasion <em>for </em>them between himself and his father: that he has recently paid 262/. 10 <em>4, </em>as a surety for his father, under an Execution issued by <em>Ellis 8r Allan. </em>[This allegation is supported by the deposition of the Deputy Sheriff. ] He concludes that he has thus paid a full and valuable consideration for the land, and prays that the Bill may be dismissed as to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-4\">The Defendant, <em>Henry E. Coleman, </em>answers, and says that he purchased <em>of Peter E. Bentley, a </em>tract <em>of land in </em>Halifax, containing five hundred and twenty-one acres, for @6,243, which he has long since paid for. At the time of the purchase he knew that the said tract was part of that convejmd by <em>WilFam A. Cocke </em>to W?7<em>Vam A. Bentley, </em>but he has no recollection that he knew the fact, that <em>William Bentley </em>had purchased and paid for the land, and desired <em>Cocke </em>to eonvey to <em>WiWam A. Bentley. </em>That <em>Peter E. Bentley </em>had been in possession of the land <em>for </em>several years, <em>and </em>the Defendant denies that at any time before the transaction was closed by 1he payment of the purchase money to the said <em>Peter, </em>he the Defendant had <em>any notice </em>whatever, that <em>William BenfAey </em>was indebted to the Plaintiffs, or others, or that he had procured the said land to be conveyed to the said <em>William A. Bentley, </em>for the purpose of defrauding the Plaintiffs, or any other creditor, or creditors. With respect to the Deed to him from <em>William Bentley </em>and <em>Wife, </em>in 1815, he says, that after he had paid to <em>Peter Bentley </em>about two-thirds of the purchase money, he was informed that the wife of Wiik\u2019am. <em>Bentley </em>would set up a claim of dower, and required a release of that interest, and the Deed was executed for that purpose alone. He relies for this protection, on his own equitable and legal title, obtained from <em>Peter E. Bentley, without notice </em>of the claim of the Plaintiffs, fortified by the Deed from <em>William Bentley </em>and <em>Wife, </em>made before the Plaintiffs obtained anv Judgment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Becree against the said <em>William Bentley, </em>which could have given them a <em>lien </em>on <em>any land </em>which the latter might have owned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-4\">. Several of the representatives of the sureties for the Administration of <em>William Ronald\u2019s </em>estate answered, but it is not necessary to notice those Answers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-5\">The deposition of <em>William A. Cocke </em>was taken. He proved th\u00e1t in 1796, or <em>\u201997, </em>he sold to <em>William Bentley </em>a tract of land-in Halifax of one thousand one hundred acres and more, for which the said <em>William Bentley </em>alone paid him, and he made the Deeds in 1805, <em>to William A. Bentley, </em>at the'request of his father. He denies that, at the time of the purchase, <em>William Bentley </em>declared he was purchasing for his son, and would not ask for a Deed till he came of age: the Deed was not to be made till the purchase money was secured, but it was made sooner. The whole money was, however, afterwards paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-6\">' <em>James Cocke </em>deposed, that about the year 1800, he exchanged his land, containing one hundred and' fifty four acres, at <em>Bibb\u2019s </em>ferry, in Halifax, valued at 1,000\u00a3, with <em>William Bentley, </em>for a tract of eight hundred acres, in Amelia, valued at <em>$7 </em>50 per acre; the deponent made the Deed in 1806, by request <em>o\u00ed William Bentley, </em>to his son <em>William A. Bentley, </em>for the purpose, as <em>Bentley </em>said, of sawing the expense of recording two Deeds. The deponent paid the difference <em>to William Bentley, </em>or to his orders, transmitted by his son <em>William A. Bentley.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-7\">-There were two other depositions taken by the Plaintiffs, to invalidate the evidence of <em>Armlstead Martin </em>and <em>John Peck, </em>the two witnesses adduced by <em>William A. Bently </em>to prove the payment of <em>\\,000l. </em>to his father in several years from 1808 to 1812.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-8\">The <em>Chancellor </em>pronounced an interlocutory Decree on the 24th June, 1S26; in which, after reciting the Decree rendered in 1810, in behalf of the present Plaintiffs, against <em>William Bentley </em>and others, and stating that Executions had issued, and that they had produced only a small part of the sums Decreed, he says, that \u201cIt also appears to the Court, that while the said <em>Vlliam Bentley </em>was indebted to his Wards, he, several conveyed, or caused to be conveyed to his sons, the whole, or nearly the whole, of his estate, real and personal, and after-wards took the oath of an insolvent debtor.\u201d He then specifies those Deeds, viz., the Deeds from <em>William A. Cocke </em>and <em>James Cocke, </em>to <em>William A. Bentley; </em>from <em>William A. </em>to <em>Peter E. Bentley; </em>the two Deeds from <em>William Bentley </em>to his son, <em>John W.; </em>and from the said <em>William Bentley </em>to his son, <em>Joseph. </em>He then proceeds: <em>\u201c </em>It also appears to the Court, that the said <em>Peter E. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>Bentley sold and </em>conveyed to the Defendant, <em>Henry E. Coleman, </em>five hundred and twenty acres, part of the said land in Halifax, purchased as aforesaid from the said <em>William A. Cocke. </em>This purchase and conveyance were made pending the suit in this Court, in which the Decree aforesaid was rendered; and on the face of the conveyance it appears, that the Defendant, <em>Coleman, </em>had notice of the manner in which the said <em>Peler E. Bentley </em>acquired his title to the lands aforesaid. The said <em>Coleman, </em>to confirm his title thus acquired, took a Deed of Release from the said <em>William Bentley </em>and <em>Wife </em>in October, 3815.\u201d The Decree then states, that it does not appear that the Deeds for the lands in Halifax had ever been recorded, and that it was admitted <em>\u201c </em>by the Defendant\u2019s Counsel, that the said Deeds were no otherwise recorded, than appears by the certificates of the Clerk, though he insisted, that as the legal title to the said land had never been in the said William <em>Bentley, </em>the recording of the said Deeds was not necessary to their validity. Upon the facts above stated, and upon the~proof in the cause, the Court is of opinion, that all the aforesaid Deeds to the sons of Wiiliam <em>Bentley, </em>were voluntary, fraudulent and void, as to the Plaintiffs, the creditors of said <em>William Bentley; </em>and that the whole of the property, real and personal, conveyed by them, is liable to be sold in satisfaction of the debts due to the Plaintiffs. The Court is also satisfied, that the Deed to the Defendant, <em>Coleman, </em>does not prevent the property thereby conveyed to him, from being subjected to the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim; but, as he is a purchaser for valuable consideration, the Court will not subject his property to sale, until it shall be ascertained whether the Plaintiffs\u2019 debt can bo satisfied from the other property within Ike reach of the Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-5\">The question arising on the Deed to the Trustees for indemnifying the sureties to the administration on <em>William Ronald?s </em>estate, are deferred till the final hearing; and in the mean time, the property so conveyed will be brought into mai'ket, and the proceeds held subject to the future order of the Court.

This objection, if Well founded, would lead to the dismission of the Bill as to the relief sought, in respect to all the lands mentioned in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">The objection is founded on the decision of this Court in <em>Eppes </em>v. <em>Randolph, 2 </em>Call, 125, and a recent decision of C. J. Makshaxl, to the same effect,- in which it was held, that a judgment creditor could not overreach in Equity a <em>bona fide </em>conveyance of his debt- or\u2019s land, made <em>after the Judgment, </em>and at a time when the <em>capapacity </em>to sue out an <em>Elegit </em>was <em>suspended </em>in consequence of no Execution having been sued out within ' the year-, and no election entered on the Record, or for any ether cause. These decisions proceeded upon the merits of the respective cases, and not upon the question of jurisdiction, and whether right or wrong, do not touch the case under consideration, either in respect to the question of jurisdiction, or upon its merits; for here all the Defendants were pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>chasers before the date of the Decrees, and are charged toiiave purchased fraudulently. And in all the cases upon the subject, in the English Court of Chancery, it seems to have been the uniform course to consider a Judgment, with a capacity to acquire the right to sue out an <em>Vlegil; </em>by /Shire <em>Facias </em>or otherwise, as such a lien as gave to the Court whenever other circumstances justified its interposition. And in no case has there ever been any enquiry whether the Judgment had been kept alive by taking out Execution within the year, or otherwise, or whether it had been actually revived or not, in the case of the death of either party, unless from some cause, (for instance the great lapse of time,) <em>it was </em>doubted whether the party could revive his capacity to sue out an <em>TfAegit, by </em>reviving his Judgment, as in the case of <em>Burroughs </em>v. <em>Elton, </em>11 Ves. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">However all this may be, I think it clear that at the time when this Bill was filed, the Plaintiffs had an existing capacity to sue out E/qg-ifs upon their Decrees, without any preliminary proceeding \u2022whatever. They had taken out Executions of <em>Fieri Facias, </em>which had been levied, and returned in part satisfied by the sale of the property taken, without any return of <em>Nihil </em>as to the residue. And in such a case, it is contended, that the Plaintiff could not take out an <em>Flcgit, </em>without first taking out a new Execution of <em>Fi. </em>Fa., and having it returned <em>Nihil, </em>upon the ground that upon the just construction of our Statute concerning Executions, it was required that a party electing to resort to one species of Execution, could not resort to one of another description, Until he had exhausted the effect of the first, by pursuing it to a return of <em>Nihil </em>or <em>Non est Inventus; </em>and, especially, that upon the literal terms of the Statute, an <em>Flegit </em>could not be taken out after a <em>Fi. Fa. </em>or <em>Ca. Sa. returned, </em>unless the return was <em>Nihil, or Non est Inventus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">This leads us to a particular examination of our Statute, the first <em>section of </em>which provides, that aJI <em>\u201cpersons who have, or </em>shall hereafter recover any debt, damages or costs, in any Court of Record, may <em>at their election </em>prosecute Writs of <em>Fieri Facias, Elegit, </em>and <em>Capias ad Satisfaciendum, </em>within the year, for taking the goods, lands and body of the debtor.\u201d It then prescribes the teste and return days, and the forms of those Executions, and of their returns, The third section provides, that <em>\u201c </em>when any Writ of Execution shall issue, and the party, at whose suit the same is issued, shall afterwards desire to take out another Writ of Execution at his own proper costs and charges, the Clerk may issue the same, if the first be not <em>returned and executed; </em>and where, upon a <em>Ca. Sa. </em>the Sheriff shall return, that the Defendant is <em>not found, </em>the Clerk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>may issue a <em>Vi. jFa,; </em>and if, upon a <em>Vi. Va. </em>he shall return that the party hath <em>no goods, </em>or that <em>only part of the debt is levied j </em>in such case it shall be lawful to issue a <em>Ca. Sa. </em>upon the same Judgment; and where part of a debt shall be levied upon an <em>Vtlegit, </em>a new Ele<em>git </em>shall issue for the residue; and, -where <em>Nihil </em>shall be returned upon any Writ of <em>V\u00a1\\egit, </em>a <em>Ca. Sa. </em>or <em>Vi. Vd- </em>may issue, and set <em>viceversa; </em>and where one Judgment is obtained against several Defendants, Execution thereon shall issue, as if it were against one Defendant, and not otherwise. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AoQ\">The fourth section, enacts the' provisions of 32 <em>Hen. </em>8, ch. 5, which provides, that <em>if </em>a <em>tenant by Elegit be </em>evicted, he may have <em>Scire Vacias </em>against the debtor, his heirs, executors and administrators, and have such Executions for the residue of his debt unpaid, as if no. Execution had theretofore issued,- enlarging- the provisions of the English Statute, in this, that whilst <em>that </em>only allowed a new <em>Elegit, our's </em>allows a new execution of any sort. The next three' sections enact the provisions of the 16th and 17th <em>Car. 2, </em>ch. 5, declaring, that an <em>Extent </em>shall not be avoided on account of the omission of any lands which were extendable. The eighth and ninth sections enacts the provisions of the 21st <em>Jas. </em>1, ch. 24, authorising a new Execution against the\u2019 lands and tenements, goods and chattels of a debtor dying in execution, except such lands\u2019 and tenements as have been <em>b'o na fide </em>sold for the payment of some other creditor, and the proceeds so applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The thirteenth seetion enacts the provision of 29th <em>Car. 2, </em>ch. 3, declaring, that goods shall be bound by a <em>Vi. Fa. </em>only from the time of the' delivery to the Sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The twenty-eighth section provides, that \u00e1 debtor in execution \u201cmay relieve' his body,- by surrendering goods to he Sold' as if taken under a <em>Fa., </em>provided that if they be not sufficient to pay the debt, orare subject to a lien, a new <em>Fi. Vd. tit Ca. Sa. </em>may issue'. These are all the provisions- which touch the question under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The' argument,- that a; party having, once made' an election to take one species of Execution, cannot afterwards' resort to another, till that elected- is- exhausted by a return of <em>Nihil </em>or <em>not found, </em>proceeds upon the idea, that such is the effect of the first section giving such election, or'the consequence of the particular provisions of the third section, according- to Which, in \u00bfVery case, (except one, in which a new species of Execution is allowed to be resorted to,) the former is- supposed to\u2019 be first returned <em>Nihil,- or not found; </em>and- so in the twenty-eighth section,- in which a <em>Vi. Fa. </em>or a <em>Ca. Sa.. </em>but not an- <em>Elegit, </em>is allowed after a debtor has been discharged upon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>the surrender of property, which proves insufficient to pay the debt incumb.ered. And the other suggestion, that the literal terms of the Statute allowing a Ca. <em>Sa. </em>or <em>Fi. Fa. </em>after an <em>Elegit </em>returned <em>Nihil, </em>and so <em>vice versa </em>forbids an <em>Elegit </em>after a Ca. <em>Sa. </em>or <em>Fi.^ Fa., </em>unless they be returned <em>Nihil </em>in the one case, and <em>not found </em>in the other, proceeds upon the idea, that our Statutes have abrogated the Common Law in respect to Executions, and contain in their own provisions all the Laws in force upon that subject, none of which propositions appear to me to be sustainable. And if not, then upon Common Law principles connected with the Statutes giving the <em>Elegit </em>the latter Execution might issue after a <em>Fi. Fa. </em>in part satisfied, although not returned\u2019 <em>Nihil, </em>as was decided in the case of <em>Berry v. Wheeler, </em>14 Car. 2; 1st Siderfin, 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The Statute of Westm. 2, 13 <em>Edw. </em>1, ch. 18, which gave the <em>Elegit, </em>is nearly in the language of ours: \u201cWhen debt is recovered Or acknowledged in the King\u2019s Court', or damages awarded, it shall be from henceforth <em>in the election of him </em>that <em>sueth for </em>such debt or damages, to have a Writ to the Sheriff <em>Fiera Facial </em>of the <em>lands, (Levari Facias) 2 Inst. </em>395, and goods <em>(Fi. Fa.) </em>2 <em>Inst. Ibid., </em>or that the Sheriff shall deliver to him all the chattels of the debtor, saving only his oxen and beasts of the plough, and the one-half of his land,\u201d &amp;c. At this time, the Writ of <em>Ca. Sa. </em>in the case of a private person, was only allowed in cases of trespass <em>vi et arnriis, </em>when the <em>Capias in Process </em>laid. It was afterwards extended to other cases, by allowing the <em>Capias ad Respondendum </em>to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The early constructions of the Statute of Westminister, proceeding <em>or. </em>the <em>maxim </em>that <em>iielecllo wines est exclvslo c\u00f1terlus.\u201d </em>determined,, that when the creditor had elected one species of Execution, be could never resort to any other, although that elected proved ineffectual. Thus, in 20 <em>Edw. </em>2, <em>Execution, 132, it </em>was held, that after a <em>Ca. Sa. </em>awarded, although it was returned <em>\u201cnot found,\u201d </em>no other Execution could afterwards issue; and so in 19th <em>H. </em>6th, it was held, that after an <em>Elegit </em>prayed and entered on the Record, the party could not resort to any orther Writ of Execution, because <em>he had made his election; </em>and in the early cases there are many instances of the like construction. But this rigorous, and to creditors, mischievous construction, gradually gave way to a more liberal spirit in the Courts of Justice, favoring the remedies of creditors, and in some instances, in which the contrary principle had become so fixed as to be beyond the power of the Courts, the Legislature interposed in their favor, as in the instances of the Statutes of <em>Hen. </em>8, <em>Jac. 1, </em>and <em>Ch. 2, </em>incorporated into ours. And when our Statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>of 1726, the prototype of the present, so far as the question under con\" sideration is concerned, was passed,this principle of construction was' almost wholly, and soon after was entirely repudiated, and the doctrine fully settled, that a creditor might take in-succession all sorts of Execution, as long as it appeared that his Judgment was not, and until it was fully satisfied, unless indeed some Execution had been levied, which had such a tendency to satisfy, as that there was no cri<em>terion by </em>which <em>to ascertain for </em>what sum a new Execution , should issue; as a <em>Ca. Sa. </em>executed, or lands extended under an ' <em>Ele git. \u25a0 Our </em>Statute of <em>1726, so </em>far from intending to abolish the Common Law and English Statutes in force here in respect to Ex\"ecutions, and to return to the strict doctrine of election, which had prevailed in ancient times, was, I think, designed to declare, that the Common Law and English Statutes, prior to the 4th of <em>James </em>1, were still in force here, and to be continued; and to adopt, not only the liberal constructions of the Courts-in favor of creditors, as far as they had then gone, but the Statutes in the same spirit which had been passed since our Colonization. .Accordingly, it recites that by the Common Law of England, and divers Acts of Parliament, <em>which are binding on the people of this Colony, </em>all creditors might, <em>at the\\r election, </em>within the year, prosecute Executions of <em>Fi. Fa., Ca. Sa. </em>and <em>Eicgit; </em>and professes only to prescribe the forms of those -Executions, and their returns, in order to produce uniformity in practice. And whilst it omits to enact the Statute of Westm. 2, which gave the Elegit, and that of 32 <em>Hen. 8, </em>giving remedy to \u25a0 tenants by Ele git evicted, as being already in force, it enacts <em>verbatim </em>the other English Statutes, now incorporated in our Statute, which passed subsequent to the 4th <em>James </em>1, which had no force here till so re-enactecl. And the preamble to the section which enacted those provisions, which are now in the third section of our present Act, declared that they were enacted for the purpose of \u201cremoving all scruples which may be entertained amongst Clerks concerning the issuing of Executions;\u201d and in giving directions concerning the issuing of Executions, the Act conformed to the most liberal decisions which had then taken place in favor of creditors. Thus, the first provision that the Plaintiff might have two Executions of different' kinds in the hands of the Sheriff, provided he had .only one executed, was contrary to the ancient principle of election, but in conformity to the then very recent decision (in 1725) of <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Hodson, </em>8 Mod. 302. So, as to the second provision, allowing a Fi. Fa. after a Ca. Sa. returned \u201c <em>Not found,\u201d </em>which was in conformity to the decision in <em>Hob. </em>57. So as to the third, allowing u'Ca. Sa. after a Fi. Fa. returned \u201cNihil,\u201d or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>part satisfied, which was according to <em>Carr v. Copping, </em>4, James, cited 11 <em>Vin. Abr. </em>38, <em>pl. </em>5. So in the fourth case, of an Elegit allowed after an Elegit in part satisfied; that agreed with the decision in the case of <em>Glasscock </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>14 and 15 Car.; 1 <em>Lev. 92. </em>And so also in the fifth case, of a Ca. Sa. or Fi. Fa. after an Elegit returned \u201cNihil;\u201d that was in conformity with the determination in <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Cope, </em>15 James 1; cited <em>Hob. </em>57; 11 <em>Vin. Abr. 42, Execution, (Y. a.) </em>And so in the sixth case, of an Elegit after a <em>Ca. Sa. </em>returned <em>\u201cNot found,\u201d </em>or a <em>Fi. Fa. </em>returned \u201cNihil;\u201d that agreed with the more ancient cases of 30 <em>Edio. </em>3, <em>24 </em>and others. And the last provision, directing Executions to issue against several, as if there were but one Defendant, pursued the decision in <em>Rosser </em>v. Welch <em>&amp; Kemmis, </em>Godb. 208; 11 <em>Jas. </em>1; 11 Vin. <em>Abr. Execution, (X. a.) pl. </em>19.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Considering, then, the general spirit and objects of this Statute, I cannot conceive that it was the intention of its framers to deprive creditors of remedies by Execution, which they would have had if the Statute had not <em>been made. </em>And <em>even if these Statutes were </em>considered as containing the whole Law of Executions, I should say that a right to take an Elegit after a Fi. Fa. in part satisfied, and not returned \u201cNihil\u201d as to the residue, would fall within the spirit, and be sactioncd by the equity of the Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">All the Defendants claiming lands directly under William Bentley, are volunteers, and the Deeds under which they claim, grossly fraudulent, and the Decree as to them correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The case is different as to the lands claimed by William A. Bentlev and Coleman, indirectly under him, in respect to which the facts are these: In 1796 or 1797, William Bentlev purchased of Wm. A: Cooke, upwards of eleven hundred acres of land, with an agreement that no Deed was to be made until he had given Bond and security for the purchase money. Wm. A. Bentley was then, and probably long after, an infant.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In August, 1805, Wm. A. Cocke, at <em>the instance of </em>Wm. Bentlev, conveyed this land to Wm. A. Bentley, who paid no valuable consideration for it to any one. Wm. Bentley had not then paid the whole purchase money, or secured it to <em>CocJee, </em>but after-wards paid it to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">In 1800, <em>James Cocke </em>and Wm. Bentlev exchanged lands, <em>Cocke </em>giving him one hundred and fifty-four acres adjoining the land sold by Wm. A. Cocke to Bentley, at the price of 1,0001., and <em>Bentley </em>giving <em>Cocke </em>about eight hundred acres in Amelia, at $S 7 50 per acre. A considerable part of the difference was paid by <em>James Cocke </em>to <em>JVilliam </em>A. <em>Bentley, </em>by order of his father, William <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Bentley. In December, 1806, <em>James Coche, </em>at the instance of <em>Wm. Bentley, </em>conv\u00e9yed the one hundred and fifty-four acres of land to <em>Wm. A. Bentley, </em>who paid no valuable consideration to any one for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In May, 1807, <em>Wm. </em>A. <em>Bentley </em>conveyed to his brother <em>Peter </em>E. <em>Bentley, </em>six hundred acres of thes\u00e9 two tracts of land, by a Deed reciting that their father had purchased the lands from the Messrs. <em>Coches, </em>who had conveyed them to him at the instance, and by the permission of Wm. <em>Bentley, </em>who particularly enjoined it upon him to convey <em>the six </em>hundred acres to <em>Peter </em>E. <em>Bentley, </em>and this is the prily consideration stated, and no other was given by <em>Peter </em>E. <em>Bentley </em>to any one.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In July, 1813, <em>Peter </em>E. <em>Bentley </em>conveyed 'five hundred and twenty acres of this land to <em>Coleman, </em>for the consideration of something more than $6,000, and in October, 1815, Wm <em>Bentley </em>and his wife, with a view to bar her claim to' dower, conveyed the same land to <em>Coleman </em>by a Deed reciting that <em>William Bentley, </em>had purchased the land of <em>Coche, </em>but had not procured any conveyance to himself, or in trust, and liad <em>given </em>it to <em>Peter E. Bentley </em>and <em>Wm. A. Bentley, </em>his sons, to the last of whom <em>Cocke </em>had conveyed the land at his request, who especially enjoined it on <em>William A. Bentley </em>to convey to <em>Peter E. Bentley, </em>all that part of the land which laid above the bridge road. At this time, <em>Coleman </em>had paid only about three-fourths of the purchase money to <em>Peter E. Bentley, </em>but afterwards paid the balance, before, as he says in his Answer, he had any notice of the fraud charged upon the <em>Bentleys, </em>by the Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">At the several periods when all these transactions took place, <em>William Bentley </em>was largely indebted as their Guardian to the female Appellees, who, in August, 1806, chose new Guardians, and in November, 1807, instituted the suit against William <em>Bentley </em>for the settlement of his accounts as their Guardian, in which they obtained the Decrees (in 1S19,) which are the foundation of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">In 1807, and early in 180S, <em>Bentley </em>conveyed the residue of his . estate, real and personal, without any valuable consideration to his other children, and in September, 1811, took the oath of an insolvent debtor. None of the Deeds, under which <em>Coleman </em>claims, from those of the <em>Coches </em>to <em>William A. Bentley, </em>inclusive, were duly recorded. This fact was not charged in the Bill, but being ' urged at the hearing, time was given to enquire into it, and the fact ' afterwards admitted to be so.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">If the legal title to these lands had even been in <em>William Bentley, </em>and were claimed under him by direct conveyances from him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>made under the circumstances accompanying the transfer of his equitable tittle to <em>William A. Bentley, </em>his <em>Deeds </em>would clearly be void for fraud, so far as <em>W\\Ulam A. Bentley </em>was concerned, and even in respect to <em>Coleman, </em>if he had notice of the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Some doubt seems at one time to have existed upon the question, w^ct-her\u2019 ^ a father or husband purchase lands in the name of his child or wife, or m his own name, causing in either case a conveyance to be made to the wife or child, the transaction could be impeached by a creditor of, or purchaser from, the husband or father, upon the ground of fraud, inasmuch as in such case there is no resulting trust for the husband or father, as in the case of a purchase by one, and a conveyance to a stranger.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In Lady <em>George\u2019s </em>Case, cited <em>Cro. Car. </em>550, as decided in the 10th of <em>Car. </em>a father having purchased in the name of his daughter, and afterwards soid to another, it was held in the King\u2019s Bench, that <em>unless there tuere some fraud discovered, </em>it was not within the 27th <em>Eliz. </em>though there be many badges of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">in <em>Back </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>Prec. Ch. 1; 2 Vern. 120, (1689,) a father purchased copyhold, which was conveyed to himself, and his wife and daughter, <em>and their heirs. </em>This was held to be an advancement for the wile and daughter, and <em>not a trust for the husband, </em>and that a mortgage by him should not bind the lands <em>in the lifetime of the wife and daughter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">In <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Sedley, </em>2 Vern. 490, (1704,) Wright, <em>Lord lieeper, inclined, </em>that a lease purchased bj\u2019\u2019 <em>A., </em>and conveyed to <em>B. </em>in trust for <em>A. </em>during his life, and afterwards for <em>C., </em>who lived with <em>A. </em>as his wife, and was so reputed, was not assets of <em>A., </em>nor liable after his death to his creditors; for when a man purchases, he may settle as he pleases, and thought that fraudulent conveyances are made so only by the several Statutes made for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">In <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>Sel. Ca. in Lord King\u2019s time, 78, (1729,) Lord King said, that he did not know that it had ever been determined, that if a man indebted, intending <em>to </em>provide for his children, has an estate originally conveyed to them, it should be subject to his debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">On these cases, which are all that I have met with tending to esfablish the proposition, that such a transaction cannot be impeached for fraud, I remark, that in Lady <em>George\u2019s </em>Case, and that of <em>Back </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>no fraud appears to have been established, and the declarations of Keeper Wright and Lord King in the other cases, were mere <em>dicta, </em>upon which <em>no </em>Judgment was founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">The case of <em>Stileman </em>v. <em>Ashdown, </em>as it can be collected from the ' Reports <em>of Alkyns, </em>vol. 2, p. 477, and <em>Ambler, </em>p. 13, appears to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>have been thus: The father purchased lands, which were conveyed, in 1700, jointly to himself and one of his sons, and their heirs, and other land, which, in 1708, was conveyed jointly to himself and another of his sons. The dates of these purchases are not noticed. They were probably cotenlporaneous with the conveyances. The father was also entitled to an equity of redemption of an estate mortgaged to one of his said sons. In 1721, a creditor of the father obtained a Judgment against him. The father continued in possession of these lands until his death in 1735, when his sons entered upon the estates respectively conveyed to them jointly with their father. The Executor of the creditor filed his Bill against the sons, for satisfaction out of the mortgaged and purchased estates. In 1742, Lord Hardwicke decreed, that the Plaintiff might redeem the mortgage; in which case the mortgaged premises should be sold, and the money paid for tlie redemption of the mortgage, refunded, and then the Judgment, and the posts at Law and in Equity, satisfied. And if the sales of the mortgaged premises should not bo sufficient to satisfy the whole of the Plaintiff\u2019s demands, that then a moiety of each of the estates, conveyed jointly to the father and his sons respectively, should be sold, and the balance d\u00fce to the Plaintiffs paid out of the proceeds rateably and proportionably, and the surplus paid to the sons respectively. But, if the sales of the whole property should not be sufficient to pay the whole of the Plaintiff\u2019s demands, the Court reserved the consideration of the rents and profits of the two moieties directed to be sold. Upon a re-hearing in 1743, upon the petition of the Plaintiff, who considered himself aggrieved in that, the Decree did not subject the whole of the purchased lands, and all their rents and profits to his demands, the Decree was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In this case the whole of the purchased lands conveyed jointly to the father and sons, was considered, so far as the creditor was concerned, as belonging to the father, but as between the father and the sons respectively, and as between the sons, as belonging to the latter, according to the conveyances. , A moiety was condemned to satisfy the Plaintiff\u2019s demand,, not because the father was entitled by the conveyances to a moiety, for in that case the right of survivor-ship in the sons, which they insisted on, would have been preferable to the lien of the Judgment on the father\u2019s moiety; (6 <em>Co. Rep. 19, </em>Lord <em>Abergaveny\u2019s </em>Case,) but because considering the father as entitled to the whole, so far as the creditor was concerned, yet only a moiety could be subjected in Equity, since no more could have been reached at Law, if it had been a legal estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Lord Hardwicke, as reported by <em>Jitkyns, </em>argued that although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>a purchase by a father, in the name of a child, in general imported; an intention to advance the child, and prevented the implication of a trust for the father, such as would arise in the case of a conveyance to a stranger, yet that a conveyance jointly to the father and child, was not calculated to effect the object of an advancement, and, left it doubtful whether it was so intended; a suggestion which contradicted the express decisions in point in <em>Scroope </em>v. <em>Scroope, </em>1 Ch. Ca. 27; 15 <em>Car. 2, </em>and <em>Back </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>before noticed, and the subsequent decision in <em>Dyer v. </em>Dyer, <em>noticed in 1 P. Wins, 112, Note; </em>and I am persuaded that Lord Hardwicke\u2019s Judgment did not proceed on that ground, for if, as between the father and children, respectively, there was a trust for the father, and therefore, and for that reason onlj\u2019-, the property liable for his debts, then for the same reason, the surplus of the sales, after satisfying the debt, would have been Decreed to be paid to the eldest son, as heir at law, and who was a party, whereas the Decree was precisely such as must be made in the case of all fraudulent conveyances, setting them aside so far as to let in the claims of creditors, and leaving them to have full effect as between the parties. And that this was the ground of the Judgment, appears by Lord Hardwicke\u2019s concluding observation: \u201cIt is not necessary that aman should be actually indebted at the time he enters into a voluntary settlement, to make it fraudulent, for if he does <em>it </em>with a view to his being indebted at a future time, it is equally so, and ought' to be Set aside.\u201d And <em>Sugden, </em>in his Treatise on the Law of v endors, (page 424,) justly considers this as the ground of the Judgment, \u201cthe settlement being considered as voluntary, and fraudulent against creditors.\u201d And after showing that the case of a joint conveyance to father and child cannot be distinguished from that of a conveyance to the child only, but that in both cases, as between the parties, it should be considered as an advancement, he adds, \u201cFraud is of.course an exception to every rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Thus we have against the <em>dicta </em>of Keeper Wright and Lord <em>Kino, </em>the express decision of Lord Hardwicke, in <em>Stileman </em>v. <em>Ashdown, </em>and the implied admission in Lady <em>George\u2019s </em>Case, that a purchase by a father, and a conveyance to a child, may be impeached for fraud, either by a creditor of, or'purchaser from, the father. And so in <em>Christ\u2019s Hospital </em>v. <em>Budgin </em>et ux. 2 Vern. 683, it was said,- that a purchase in the name of a wife or child after marriage, and voluntary, may, perhaps, be fraudulent as against creditors, in like manner as if the settlement was of property actually vested in the husband or father. And deplorable, indeed, would be the imbecility of the Law if it could hot reach such a case as that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>a t\u00ed d eiv \u25a0 eq\u00f1s i d or a t i o n. Here the father purchased in his ow'd riam\u00e9&gt; and\u00ed'no\u00ed in- the names of his childrep; he held- the property, in one' inst'anca,'-'\u00e1s his own ten years, and in the'other six, not drily apparently, .hj\u00ae as the real beneficial owner of d^i|['Property. He was then largShindebted, and any creditor &gt;vho&gt;?(|pipd then have -had a JudBnpnt against him, might have sulf||cted that property to the payment of his debts, either un'dlpbur Statute, making uses and trusts liable to the charg\u00e9s and debts of.-the <em>cestui qw trust? or </em>upon the original principles of a Court of Equity, which, following the Law, will, in general, give such relief against equitable estates of the <em>debtor, </em>as <em>might be </em>had at Law, if the estate was legal. The beneficial estate was settled in the father, and it was as much a fraud to give away to a-child this beneficial interest, to the prejudice of his creditors, as to, have conveyed away the legal title in like' manner, if h\u00e9 had it/ If such a transaction could not be held to fall within the Statute of Frauds, 1 should think it might be well reached by' the general principles of Equity, according to which the <em>Coches </em>were trustees for <em>William Bentley. &amp; </em>And although a conveyance by them to his son, with Wfilfam <em>Bentley\u2019s </em>assent, would-, as between the parties, extinguish the' trust, and the son would hold, the land exempt from it, yet. a Court of Equity might well hold, that by reason of the fraudulent intent of this transfer, the existing trust for <em>Willicpm Bentley </em>should not be thereby destroyed,- but should still subsist so far as creditors were concerned j upon the ground that persons acquiring a title by fraud are held to be trustees for the injured person, although they certainly did nob-intend to acquire the property in that character.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The Decree was, therefore, fight also' as respects the lauds held by <em>Ti lliam Ji. Bentley, </em>and has properly directed the whole, and not a moiety only of the lands held subject to satisfy the demand of the Appellees, to be sold, since there were several Decrees on the same day;- each of which would have taken a moiety of the lands, if they had been extendable at Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">' As to <em>Coleman, </em>I think he must be considered as' a <em>bona Jidei </em>purchaser, for valuable consideration, without notice of the fraud, and therefore protected against the operation of the Statute of Frauds by its proviso. And as to the lands held by him,- the only question is, -whether they are liable to the claims of <em>Bentley\u2019s </em>creditors on account of the Deeds under which he claims not duly recorded. Upon the fullest consideration,. I am of opinion that they are not. So far as <em>Colemari </em>is Concerned, we are to consider the case as if Wikiam <em>Jl. Bentley </em>had given to- his father an adequate valuable consideration for the transfer of his interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>lands purchased from the <em>Coches, </em>and that the transaction was tainted by no fraud. The equitable interest of the father was not transferred to the son by the execution of Deeds to him by the <em>Coches, </em>but by the previous authority given by him to them to execute those Deeds. And if such an authority had been given by letter, and the Deeds never made, a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser of the equitable interest from <em>William A. Bentley, </em>would have had a better right now to call upon the <em>Coches </em>for their conveyance of the legal title, than any creditor of <em>William Bentley </em>getting a Judgment against him after the transfer of his equitable right to his son. Such a transfer was valid without Deed, and was not necessarily to be recorded to make it available against bis creditors. The Deeds from the <em>Codecs </em>passed, not <em>Bentley\u2019s </em>equitable title, hut their naked legal title only, and if void so far as to leave that title still in them, yet those Deeds, together with the. other evidence in the cause, would be full proof that <em>William Bentley\u2019s </em>equitable right was transferred to his son, and in respect to <em>Coleman, </em>we must take it to have been dono (as before said) <em>bona fide, </em>and for valuable consideration: So, that if we held the Deeds to be void, it would not avail the Appellees any thing. The Decree as to <em>Coleman </em>should therefore be reversed, and the Bill dismissed, and in all other respects affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The President, and Judges Cabell, Coalter, and Carr concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
