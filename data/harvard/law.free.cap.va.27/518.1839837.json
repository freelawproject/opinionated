Tayloe, setting forth, that in the year 1816, he, the Plaintiff, and a certain <em>Daniel Couch, </em>entered into an agreement, whereby the Plaintiff became bound to convey to <em>Couch </em>sundry houses-and lots in the City of Richmond, for which he was to receive in exchange from <em>Couch, </em>a good title in fee-simple to a tract of land lying on the waters of Gold Mine Creek in Hanover, containing about eight hundred acres of land: that in consideration of the said exchange, the Plaintiff further agreed to pay to <em>Couch, </em>and to <em>Ellis \u00a3? DLllan, </em>at the rate of <em>$ </em>1,000 per annum, as rent for the said houses, from the 24th January, 1816, till the 1st May then next following. After executing Deeds in pursuance of the said agreement, <em>Couch </em>exhibited to the Plaintiff a lease, which he had previously made of part of the said land in Hanover, to a certain <em>John T. Swann, </em>by which the Plaintiff discovered to his great surprise, that the lesee, amongst other things, ivas authorized to cut and carry off from the said land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>a ffirge quantity of timber, for the purpose of erecting a barn. The Plaintiff expressed his surprise, that <em>Vouch </em>];nd never, previous to the find execution of the agreement, intimated to him the authority thus givcu to <em>Swann. </em>In reply, CpHc/fathniUcd that he line! not, but said that the timber thus cut might be rained, and settled between himself and the Plaintiff', at the same time with the rent which should become due from the Plaintiff as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-4\">The Plaintiff further stated, that <em>Couch </em>.mentioned at the same time, that <em>Swann </em>was bou&amp;d- <em>by </em>the Jesse to cultivate that portion of the land which had been rented to him in a farmer like manner, and expressly promised to .make good to the Plaintiff, on a settlement of the rent; all damage, should any ensue to the land, from improper or negligent cultivation; and the Plaintiff avers, that the fertility of the sod was greatly diminished by <em>Swann, </em>and the land much injured, both by the improper cultivation, and the destruction of its timber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-5\">He states, that <em>Couch </em>instituted a suit at. Law against him for the rent, and recovered Judgment for the whole amount, without allow i ing him any discount, or deduction for the injury done to the land, and the value of the timber cut thetefrom: that he could not at Law establish the facts herein stated, there being no witnesses then, or now known to him, who could be produced to prove them: that an Execution has issued against his effects, which will be unjustly sacrificed, unless prevented by a Court of Equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-6\">He therefore prays, that <em>Couch, </em>and <em>Ellis &amp; Allan, </em>(for whoso benefit the Judgment was rendered,) may be made Defendants; that <em>Couch </em>may more particularly be required to say, whether he did not promise and engage to allow the Plaintiff on a final settlement of the rent, the value of \"the timber cut, and all damage done to (ho land by <em>Swann: </em>that an account may be directed to be taken, before a Commissioner, or in some other proper way, of the value of the said timber, and damage to the land; and for an injunction to the Judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-7\">The Injunction was awarded by the <em>Chancellor, </em>on the 18th August, 18-20.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-8\"><em>Couch </em>answered, saying expressly, that at the time he entered into the contract with the Plaintiff, he made known the fact that the land had been leased to <em>Swann, </em>the particular terms of which <em>he believes zoere known to the Plaintiff. </em>He says, it is untrue that he ever admitted that he had not informed the Plaintiff of the terms of <em>Swann\u2019s </em>lease; and, as to the surprise of which the Plaintiff speaks, when . the lease to <em>Swann </em>was exhibited, the Defendant remarks, that there was no written lease between <em>Swann </em>and himself; it was a ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>bal agreement only, of which the Plaintiff was apprised before he etiHired into the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">He says, that by the terms of the lease to <em>Swann, </em>it was agreed that if he would cultivate a crop of tobacco, he might have liberty to cut from the land as many poles as would build a house sufficient to cure the- tobacco made, and erect it on his own land; there was no permission, to erect a barn, nor was one erected. He denies- that be ever did agree with <em>Webster to bo </em>liable, <em>or </em>responsible in any way, for the cultivation of the land by <em>Swann, </em>or any on-c else, or to make good any damage which might be done to the land, though he denies that any damage was done, or that the cultivation was improper as far as he knows or believes, lie admits, That after the money was due to him for the rent, and after repeated applications for it, he did offer the Plaintiff that if he would pay him What was-due, be might have the poles which had been cut from tho land valued, and the valuation allowed, but this he refused to do; ho avers that the offer was one he was not bound to make, but it was made to prevent dclaj', and to avoid a suit. The Judgment at I^aw was entirely for his own benefit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-7\"><em>Ellis fyiJlllan </em>answered, denying that they had any interest in the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-8\">The Court dissolved the Injunction, on the 15th January, 1821.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-9\">Afterwards, the Plaintiff filed the affidavits of <em>John Webster nod Samuel Gibbs, </em>taken on the 8th and 9th <em>June, </em>1821. The first witness, in answer to interrogatories put by the Plaintiff, stated that he was overseer for <em>Swann, </em>in 1816; that the land leased by <em>Swann </em>from <em>Go-uch, </em>was between two and three hundred acres; that it, was not cultivated ira a farmer-like manner; that it would have been worth 250 dolls, to put it in such- order, for he never saw land worse cultivated than it was; and that the timber cut off the land was worth 150 dolls., at least.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-10\">The second witness said, that he lived with <em>Edmund Webster, </em>at Gold Mine, in 1816: that in the course of the year <em>Couch </em>called on <em>Webster,, </em>to- know if he could pay him the money duo him for the rent of the house;.;: that <em>Webster </em>told <em>Couch </em>that if he would pay him for the waste of the timber that <em>Swann </em>had taken from the land, and the injury done the land by bad cultivation, he would pay him: <em>Couch </em>said, that he would have no objection to leave the difference in dispute to any of the neighbours; he could not do so at that time, but would have it done shortly: <em>Webster </em>told <em>Couch, </em>he was anxious to have it settled as soon as possible, as he had no wish to be involved in a law suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-11\">On the 15th June, 1821, after exhibiting these affidavits, tho <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>flaiiitiff moved the Court to re-instalc the Injunction, but the application was rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-4\">The Plaintiff then petitioned Judge CoaltJsh to re-instatc the Injunction, for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-5\">The affidavit of Webber, he alleges, establishes the Tact that timber to the amount of $150, was cut off the land leased lo <em>Swann, </em>and that by improper cultivation it has sustained an injury to the. amount of <em>$250 </em>more: that it is admitted by.the Defendant <em>Couth, </em>in his Answer, that by the terms of the contract with Swann, he was at liberty to cut timber on the land, and that (he Plaintiff charges that the terms of that contract were concealed from him by <em>Couch: </em>this is charged by the Bill, and the Answer in that respect is quite <em>evasive, </em>the respondent stating his belief that the terms of the contract were known the Plaintiff, but not owning the fact. In addition to which, he alleges, that there is no privity between the Plaintiff and <em>Swann, </em>which would entitle-him. to redress for the injury sustained by the land, his claim for which is on <em>Couch </em>alone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-6\">On the 21st June, 1821, Judge CoALTjEE.rc-ins.tatcd the Injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-7\">The affidavits of <em>Webber </em>and <em>Gibbs, </em>were-again taken by the Plaintiff, on due notice to the Defendants. There was no variance in the evidence of the first, except that in'\\thc last affidavit lie estimated the injury from had cultivation at $200, and the value of timber taken off, at $200 or $250. The second witness, Gibbs, deposed, that <em>Couch </em>.called on him to take notice that ho was willing to pay <em>Webster </em>for the timber cut off the land, and the damages sustained by bad cultivation, and it was to be left to disinterested neighbours to estimate the damage in both cases. He also expressed his opinion, that the land was much injured by the taking off the timber, it being a scarce article.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-8\">' The Court of Chancery, on the 25th February, 1822, gave the following opinion: <em>\u201c </em>On motion of the Defendants by Counsel, lo -discharge the order awarding an Injunction in this cause, made by a Judge of the Supreme Court of Appeals, on the 21st day of June \u25a0last, the Court being of opinion, that according to the plain letter of the Act, by which a Judge, or Judges of the Supreme Court of Appeals, may exercise <em>original </em>jurisdiction in granting an Injunction \u25a0upon the <em>original </em>Bill, if refused by a <em>Chancellor, </em>yet such Judge \u25a0or Judges, are not authorised in the opinion of this Court, by that Act, to grant another injunction in the same case, after a dissolution in a Superior Court of Chancery, although such Judge, or Judges may grant an appeal: such is the written Law; wherefore, the Court doth discharge the said order, as improyidently awarded.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>The Plaintiff obtained a <em>Supersedeas </em>to the said Decree, from Judge of this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-4\"><em>Hay, </em>for the Plaintiff in Error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the Defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"b406-6\"><em>October </em>15.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ATA\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"A5J\">delivered the opinion of the Court. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">It cannot, now bo doubted, after repeated decisions of <em>this Court, </em>that from the refusal of a <em>Chancellor </em>to re-instate an Injunction upon new proofs of the allegations of a Bill, an appeal lies to any one of the Judges of this Courl, and that the <em>Chancellor </em>erred in this case in dissolving the Injunction, on the ground that-the order made by one of the Judges of this Court, re-instating the Injunction, was <em>corum non judice. </em>But unless' the rules of pleading in Chancery are to be totally disregarded, lie was correct in dissolving the In'junction, though ordered by a Judge of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The Bill, although it, prays relief, is purely a Bill of Discovery, upon the express ground, that the Plaintiff was entirely ignorant of any testimony to prove its allegations, without the Answer of the Defendant <em>Couch, </em>with whom the contract, to be set-off against the Judgment at Law, is alleged to have been made. Ilis Answer makes no discovery, but on the contrary negatives all the material allegations in the Bill: but,, if it had not, upon the proofs in the Record, a Court of Equity would have afforded no relief. The ground for relief is unliquidated damages for a substantive injury, the remedy ftp- which was by a suit at Law, there being no impediment to it. It was not a matter of account, to be adjusted and set-off, either in the Court of Law in which the Judgment was rendered, or in a Court of Equity. The order dissolving (he injunction is there-fore affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Absent, Judge Ooarter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
