A Writ of <em>Habeas Corpus </em>was awarded, directed to the said Serjeant, returnable on the next day. In obedience to the Writ, the Serjeant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>produced the body of the petitioner, and made return, that he had taken the said <em>Jones </em>into his custody, by virtue of two Escape Warrants, issued by <em>J. Currin, </em>who is said and believed to be a Justice of the Peace for the County of Fluvanna, and he produced the Escape Warrants. The Warrants were dated in 1825. By one of them it appeared, that <em>David Jones </em>was charged in execution at the suit of <em>Timberlakc fy Magruder, </em>and other creditors named; and by the other, that he was charged in execution at the suit of <em>Thomas Boyd. </em>They were in the usual form, reciting the cause of the prisoner\u2019s commitment, and his and were directed to all Sheriffs, Serjeant's, &amp;e,, commanding them to seize and re-talce the and to commit him to The who issued the Warrants, signed his name <em>J. Currin, </em>without stating himself to be a Justice of the Peace for the County of Fluvanna.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEFK\">The creditors appeared by Counsel, as well as the debtor. The laiter gave in evidence that he was a farmer in Fluvanna, where he resided in 1825, and ever since, within one mile of the residence of the creditors: that he has never concealed himself, and that he has gone at large and been publicly seen at the Court-house, and other public places in Fluvanna, for the last three years, and that he was in the store of the creditors within a few months before his arrest, and that these Warrants have never been executed on him in his own County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-6\">The creditors, proved that the Jail of Fluvanna was consumed by fire in 1826, and has not since been re-built: and that <em>J. Currin </em>was in 1825, and is now a Justice of the Peace in the County of Fluvanna.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b524-7\"><em>Schmidt, </em>for the petitioner, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay-\">1. That it ought to appear from the Warrant itself, that it was issued by a Justice of the Peace of the County where the prisoner had been in custody. 1 <em>Rev. Co. </em>p. 548. That the Court cannot presume that he is a Justice. 4 <em>Burn\u2019s Justice, </em>p. 331. That as the Warrant is the authority for the arrest, it ought to be sufficient of itself to justify the arrest, without extraneous evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-8\">2. That as the Warrant issued in 1S25, and the petitioner was seen publicly in his Own County, it ought to be presumed that there had been an arrangement of the debt between the parties,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b524-9\"><em>Green, </em>for the creditors, relied:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATV\">1. On the fact fully proved, that <em>Currin </em>was, and is a Justice of the Peace for Fluvanna: and that according to the authority of <em>Burn, </em>it is not necessary that the Justice should state himself to be such.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>2. He insisted that the presumption of an arrangement of the debt, is repelled by the fact that the Jail of the County was burnt down.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b525-4\"><em>Stuurt, </em>J.</author>\n<p id=\"Anf\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The application of <em>David </em>J <em>ones </em>to be discharged from tho custody of the Serjeant, has been considered by the Court. The petitioner was taken on two Escape Warrants^issued by <em>James Currm, </em>on the 22d February, <em>1823. </em>It is objected, that it does not appear on the face of the Warrants, that Currin was a Magistrate. It has also been urged, that the length of time which has intervened, since the date.of the Warrants, has raised a presumption that the debt has been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">On the other hand, it has been proved, that <em>Currin </em>was in fact an acting Justice at the date of the Warrants, and that for some time past there has been no Jail in that County.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The Court is of opinion, that although Escape Warrants ought to he issued by Justices of the Peace, and, that regularly, it ought to appear on the face of the Warrants that they are such, yet in this instance, that defect has been supplied by proof of the fact. They are also of opinion, that the want of a Jail repels any presumption arising from the lapse of time. The petitioner is therefore remanded to the custody of the Serjeant of the Cijy. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Note.\u2014The petitioner afterwards applied to the <em>Coinri of Appeals </em>for a- Writ of Error to this Judgment, which that Court refused:.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
