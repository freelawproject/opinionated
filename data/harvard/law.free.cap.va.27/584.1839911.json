All of these four counts charged the assumpsit to be made by her before her lunacy. The fifth count was on an <em>insimul computassent </em>between the Defendant as committee of the lunatic, and the Plaintiff, in which the Defendant was charged to <em>be </em>found in arrears on account of the said lunatic in the sum claimed,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>and laid the as'Surftpsit'by the Defendant himself as committee.

The error in bringing this action was, in not distinguishing it from an action against the committee of a lunatic appointed under the Statute, in a case in which the lunatic is sent to the Hospital and is treated by the Statute as <em>civiliter mortuus, </em>and the committee as an Executor, and responsible in like manner. 1 <em>Rev. Co. </em>ch. <em>109, </em>\u00a7 6, p. <em>413. </em>A committee appointed by the Chancellor, as in this c\u00e1se, is a mere Commissioner of the Court, managing the person and estate of the lunatic, under the direction of the Chancellor, and having such allowances for the support of the lunatic as may be considered proper, accounting for the management of the estate as a receiver of the Court, removable in .its discretion, and is not liable to be sued on claims either against the lunatic or his estate, as in the case of a committee appointed under the Statute.
