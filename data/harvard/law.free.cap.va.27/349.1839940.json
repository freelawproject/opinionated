Riddick, William Summer, </em>and <em>.Fisher Dashiell, </em>Justices of the Peace of the Court of Nansemond County aforesaid, at the relation of <em>Samuel Carrol, </em>Administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>with the <em>Wi </em>11 annexed of <em>Vkilhs Coffield </em>deceased, against the above mentioned obligor, <em>Cowling, </em>to recover the sum of 31,169, found due from the said Executor to the estate of his Testator, by the Commissioners appointed to settle his accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-9\">The Declaration recited the bond as being made to the \u201c said obligees;\u201d that is, the persons before named as Justices of Nansemond County, and recited the condition as importing an obligation on the part of the Executor to make a just, and true account of his actings and doings, when required by the said Court of Nansemond County. It further averred, however, that although the obligation aforesaid does not show the names of the obligees, or persons to whelm the same was executed, 3ret the obligees aforesaid are those to whom, and in whose favour the said obligation was made and executed, as by the records and in the Clerk\u2019s Office of the said County of Nansemond, (besides other evidence) will manifestly appear.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-10\">The Defendant <em>Cowling, </em>craved oyer of the writing obligatory, and also of the condition thereof, and demurred to the Declaration, for the following causes: 1st. Because there areno obligees actually named in the penalty of the said writing obligatory: Sklly Because in the condition, the name of the Executor, as well as the name of the Court into which he would have been bound to exhibit an account of his Executorial transactions, are omitted to be inserted: 8dly. Because the condition omits to designate and point out who shall render an account of his actings and doings as Executor a? aforesaid when thereunto required. 4thly. Because there is a variance between the Bond and Declaration. There was a joinder in demurrer, and the County Court gave Judgment for the Defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-11\">The Plaintiff obtained a <em>Supersedeas, </em>and the Superior Court of Law reversed the Judgment of the County Court, and ordered ail the proceedings subsequent to the <em>Wvii </em>of Enquiry to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>set aside, and proceeding to give' such Judgment as the County Court ought to have given, overruled the demurrer, directed that the Defendant below should answer over, and remanded the cause to the County Court for further proceedings to be had therein, and gave Judgment for the Plaintiffs costs in the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-4\">To that Judgment, the Defendant obtained a <em>Supersedeas </em>from a Judge of this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-5\"><em>Chapman Johnson, </em>for the Plaintiff in Error, ivas stopped <em>by </em>the Court.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-6\"><em>Scott, </em>for the Defendant in Error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"b274-7\">\n<em>May 3.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A5A\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"A0L\">delivered his o.pinion, in which the other Judges concurred.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqYT\">Upon the preliminary question, whether the <em>Supersedeas </em>was properly awarded to the Judgment of the Superior Court, I think there can be no doubt; for, that reversing the Judgment of the County Court, and directing other pleadings in the cause, was interlocutory in its character, (though final there,) the Judgment of the County Court, being final as regards the jurisdiction of this Court, it imparted that character to the Judgment of the Superior Court, and an appeal will lay from it to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">On the merits, I think there is as little doubt. A Relator in a suit on an official bond, ought to set out in the pleadings, bis interest in, and claim to, relief upon it; which he has totally omitted in this case. On the demurrer to the Declaration, by oyer taken of the bond and condition, they became a part of it, and might be demurred to for any defect apparent on their face; and that is the ground of the special demurrer in this ease. The two first points relate to defects in the bond., and condition; as <em>first, </em>because there are no obligees named in the bond. <em>Sccond.li/, </em>because in the condition, the name of the Executor, and o\u00a1\u2019 the Court into which he was to return the account of his transactions, are blank. In fact, the bond is only a copy of the blank bond to be found in the Act, except that the names of the obligors are inserted in the penal part of it. It is materially defective. Parties ought to be held to a reasonable strictness, or great injustice may be done. There can bo no bond without an obligee; and it ought (o be made to the sitting Justices at the time it is executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>On all these grounds, not noticing some minor objections, I think \u25a0\u00a1hat the Judgment of the Superior Court ought to be reversed, and that of the County Court affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-10\"> Judge Coalteb, absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
