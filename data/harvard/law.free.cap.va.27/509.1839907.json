He obtained a Verdict and Judgment against the Defendant,.for #2,786 60 cents,-with interest from the 21st April, 1818. At that trial the Defendant offered in evidence, as a set-off, or discount against the Plaintiff\u2019s demand, an account raised against <em>Cutler, </em>by <em>John Hanserd 8y Co., </em>for the sum of <em>$ 795 </em>10, of which a small part was for goods furnished <em>Cutler </em>himself, in March, 1S16, but the chief part to <em>Theodericle Love, </em>in December, 1S16, and January, 1817, and the testimony of <em>Satmtcl Union, </em>who stated that, in December, 1816, the Plaintiff, <em>Cutler, </em>desired him to say to any other merchants that he would pay for an}*goods sold to <em>Theodericle Love, </em>if the same did not exceed #4000: that he made this communication to <em>Hanserd 8y Co., </em>among others: that in consequence of this communication, <em>Hanserd 8? Co, </em>delivered to said <em>Love, </em>most of the goods in the account mentioned, and some to the Plaintiff himself: that he has examined the books of <em>Hanserd 8? Co., </em>and that on them the goods are charged to <em>Culler, </em>and not <em>to Love: that </em>before the day of the commence-' ment of this suit at Law, that co-partnership was dissolved, and that all right, title and interest in the stock in trade, as well as in the debts and credits, and books and accounts, were assigned and transferred, for valuable consideration, to the Defendant, <em>John Hinton, </em>and to prove this, a Deed was also given in evidence; but the Court refused to allow Ihc account to go to the Jury as a set-off, because it was a debt due to a partnership, &amp;e. The Verdict and Judgment above mentioned, were the consequence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-8\"><em>John Hinton </em>then exhibited his Bill to the <em>Chancellor, </em>praying that the above-mentioned sum of #795 10, may be allowed to him as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>a discount, and that <em>Ctdler </em>may be injoined from enforcing so m\u00fcch of his Judgment by Execution: he states, that <em>Ctdler </em>obtained the credit with <em>Hanserd Co., </em>(the firm consisting of <em>Hanserd 8f Hinton, ) </em>for his son-in-law <em>Lovp, </em>some small part of the account being for himself; that the partnership is dissolved, of which public notice is given, and the partnership effects and debts assigned to himself. He states, moreover, that <em>Cutler </em>had taken a Deed from <em>Love, </em>for property in Petersburg, and that the real consideration of the Deed was, the responsibility which <em>Cutler </em>had encountered for <em>Love\u2019s </em>debts, and amongst others, this very debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-5\"><em>Ctdler, </em>by his Answer, denied that he ever made himself responsible to the complainant for goods purchased from him by <em>Love, </em>or that he ever authorised <em>Love </em>to obtain them on his credit: he denies that <em>Love </em>ever conveyed to him any property to pay the debt, and asserts that <em>Love </em>is still considerably indebted to him. He then gives a narrative ef <em>Love\u2019s </em>marriage with his daughter;, of his becoming in debt to him; of his indiscretions and extravagauce; of his promises to reform, and of his proposal to retire to the country, and keep ajsmall store. He states, that he made some advances to him, him credit at one or two stores, to obtain such as were immediately necessary, for which he, the Defendant, paid; that the Defendant promised <em>Love </em>that if he would reform, he would make him a semi-annual allowance for several years; that at <em>Love\u2019s </em>request, he repeated this promise in the presence of <em>Samuel Hinton, </em>that there might be a witness to the promise, and perhaps that it might improve <em>Love\u2019s </em>credit; that the promise would have been performed, if <em>Love </em>had complied with the condition, but he became more intemperate than ever, and the Defendant then withheld from him any further advances, that he might preserve for his wife and children those funds which, if given to him, would be squandered. The Defendant, not meaning to cast any imputation on <em>Samuel Hinton, </em>the witness, supposes he may have misunderstood the conversation, and says it is impossible he could have been so stupid as to authorise the witness to proclaim to the merchants of Petersburg, that he meant to pay some thousands of dollars, to just as many as <em>Love </em>could get credit with for that amount. As the conversation has been misunderstood, and may be'incorrectly represented in evidence, the Defendant considers himself compelled, in the just defence and protection of his estate, and of his family, tp insist on the benefit of <em>the Statute for the prevention of Frauds and Perjuries. </em>On this Answer, issue was joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-6\">The evidence given, is to the following eifect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-7\"><em>Samuel Hinton, </em>in an affidavit, says, that in December, 1816, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number><em>Cutler </em>requested him to inform <em>lian &lt;tcrd </em>4\u2019 &lt;.\"&lt;?-\u2022 or a03 other person, of whom <em>Love </em>might purchase goods, that lie would pay for <em>Love </em>four thousand dollars: that he gave <em>Hanserd </em>4' Co. this information: that goods were furnished <em>Love, </em>and charged t\u00e9 <em>Guile\",': </em>that a part of <em>Hanserd </em>4\u2019 Co\u2019s, account was for goods got by <em>Gutter: </em>and the witness expressed the opinion, that the goods delivered <em>Love </em>were sold from the information the witness gave to <em>-Hanserd </em>4' <em>Go., </em>and exclusively on the responsibility of <em>Cutler.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-5\"><em>Samuel Hinton </em>afterwards gave a deposition, taken by virtue of a commission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-6\">He says, that in December, 1816, <em>Cutler </em>called on him and requested him to tell <em>Hanserd </em>4\u2019 Co., and any other person of whom <em>Love </em>might wish to purchase goods, that he would pay for said <em>Love, </em>the sum of <em>% </em>4,000: that it was not in his power to advance the money at that time. In answer to interrogatories by the Plaintiff, he says, that he gave this information to <em>Hanserd </em>&lt;\u00a7- Co. a few moments after <em>Cutler </em>made the request, and before the goods were purchased: that, in his opinion, they would not have sold the goods, nor would <em>Love </em>have attempted to make the purchase, but on the faith of <em>Culler\u2019s </em>promise: that <em>Love </em>was not present, when <em>Culler </em>requested the witness to give the information: that the goods were charged to <em>Cutler </em>on their books: that %645 35, are charged to <em>Cutler, </em>for goods delivered to <em>Love; </em>and \u00a742 13, for goods delivered <em>Cutler: </em>that <em>TheoderieJe Love </em>is considered by the witness, as a man of truth, honor, and integrity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-7\"><em>Samuel Turner </em>deposed, that the mutual friends of <em>Love </em>and <em>Cutler, </em>suggested to the latter, in the fall and winter of 1816, when the habits of the former had undergone a change for the better, tho propriety of advancing funds to <em>Love </em>to enable him to commence a small mercantile business: that it was finally agreed between them, that <em>Cutler </em>would give to <em>Love </em>four thousand dollars, as a capital to commence with; to be paid by <em>Cutler </em>at different periods, and in the mean time he authorised and requested the witness, to inform any gentlcman from whom <em>Love </em>might wish to purchase goods, of the arrangement: that the witness did make the statement to <em>Colquhoun </em>4\u2019 Co., from whom <em>Love </em>bought goods: that, pending this arrangement, <em>Isove </em>exhibited a statement of his debts, amounting to \u00a7 5,000; the witness was a principal creditor, and <em>Cutler </em>only a creditor for two or three hundred: witness liad taken a Deed of Trust on <em>Ijove\u2019s </em>house and lot: and it was agreed between the parlies, that as <em>Love </em>was about to move, he should make a Deed for the lot to <em>Culler: </em>that the witness should be authorised to sell it, pay himself, and that the balance should be appropriated to the discharge of the before men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>tioned debts: that witness sold the lot, and after paying himself, there remained two negotiable notes of \u00a7 1,500 each, which <em>Cutler </em>demanded of him: lie refused to deliver them, but knowing that <em>Love </em>was indebted to <em>Jr.Sn Hinton, </em>the witness delivered them to him, in order the better to secure the completion of the contemplated arrangement of <em>Love, </em>say, the payment of his debts: the witness further said, in answer to interrogatories bjr the Plaintiff, that his impression was, at the time of the arrangement, that <em>Cutler </em>honestly intended to do his son-in-law a favor, but his conduct since, proves the reverse: that <em>Cutler </em>withholds <em>ivom.

The Court rejected-the set-off. The Defendant excepted, and a Verdict and Judgment were had against him for $2,786 60, with interest. The Defendant took no appeal, but filed his Bill for an Injunction, stating the facts of <em>Cutler\u2019s </em>obtaining a credit with the Plaintiff's house for his son-in-law, and a small part for himself; that the debts of the firm were transferred to the Plaintiff; that the Plaintiff held a sum of money claimed by <em>Cutler, </em>which he was ready to pay him, retaining the amount which <em>Cutler </em>owed him; that <em>Cutler </em>sued for the money, and the Law Court refused to allow the set-off, because it was a debt due to a firm, &amp;e., and praying the benefit of the set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The Answer of <em>Cutler </em>denies positively that he owes the account claimed of him; avers that he never undertook to pay the firm for goods taken up by his son-in-law, <em>Love, </em>or gave him a credit with them, and relics on the Statute of Frauds to protect him from any such charge. Several depositions were taken, and on hearing, the Court perpetuated the Injunction for the $795 10, and <em>Cutler </em>appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">On the argument, the Counsel for the Appellant rested principally on two points. 1st. That the account, if chargeable to <em>Cutler, </em>might have been set-off at Law, and so, that Equity had no jurisdiction: but 2dly. That it could be set-off, neither at Law nor in Equity, because the promise being collateral and verbal, was void under the Statute pf Frauds. We will consider this last point first, as it strikes at the root of the claim. Upon this branch of the Statute, prescribing the mode in which <em>(&lt; </em>th\u00e9 special promise to answer for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the debt, default, or miscarriage of another person,\u201d must be made, there is no difference of construction, that I have seen, between Courts of Law and Equity; indeed, it is a class of cases, which can very rarely come into Equity. The question generally is, whether the promise is for the debt of <em>another, </em>or not; in other words, (which, though not used by the Statute, have become technical terms,) whether the promise be <em>collateral, </em>or <em>original. </em>The cases are very numerous on the subject, and some of them contain very nice and subtle distinctions; but, the <em>principle, </em>which seems to be settled, is this, (as laid down by Buller, J. in <em>Matson </em>v. <em>Wharam, </em>2 Term Rep. 80, and by Judge Roane, in <em>Waggoner </em>v. <em>Gray\u2019s Administrators, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 603,) \u201cThat if the person, for whose use the goods are furnished, be liable at all, any other promise by a third person to pay that debt, must be in writing, otherwise it is void by the Statute of Frauds.\u201d Thus, in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Hayman, </em>1 Hen. Black. 120. The <em>Plaintiff </em>was a woollen draper in London: <em>B. </em>was his rider, to receive orders: the Defendant meeting with <em>B. </em>desired him <em>to </em>write to the Plaintiff, requesting him to supply the Defendant\u2019s son with whatever goods he might want, on his, the Defendant\u2019s credit; and at the same time said, <em>\u201c </em>Use my son well, charge him as low as possible, and I will be bound for the payment of the money, as far as 800Z. or l,000f.\u201d <em>B. </em>wrote to the Plaintiff, giving him the information. Soon <em>after, </em>the son received goods from the Plaintiff, to the amount of <em>8001. </em>which were delivered to him, in consequence of the father\u2019s order: The son was debited in the Plaintiff\u2019s books: he afterwards became a bankrupt, and this action was brought against the father. The Court were clearly of opinion, that this promise, not being in writing was void by the Statute of Frauds, as it appeared that credit was given to the son, as well as to the father. In <em>Buckmyr </em>v. <em>Darnall, </em>2 Lord Raymond, 1,085, the Plaintiff declared that the Defendant, in consideration that the Plaintiff, at his request, would let to hire, and deliver to one <em>J. E. </em>a gelding to <em>ride to </em>Reading, that the said <em>J. E. </em>would deliver the gelding to the Plaintiff. Held, that this was a collateral promise, because Detinue would lie against <em>J. E. </em>on the bailment. These cases, out of a vast multitude, serve to exemplify the general principle, that where the promisee has a double remedy, both against the promiser, and him in whose behalf the promise is made, such promise is collateral and must be in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Let us now see what was <em>Cutler\u2019s </em>promise. <em>Samuel Hinton </em>has given evidence three times. In his evidence before the Law Court, he says that <em>Culler </em>desired him to say to any other merchants that he would pav for any goods sold to Love, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\"the same did not exceed $4,000. In his affidavit, he says, \u201cIn December, 18J6, Doctor <em>Cutler </em>requested me to inform <em>John Hanserd fy Co.,, </em>or any other person or persons, of whom <em>Love, </em>his son-' in-law, might purchase goods, that he would pay for <em>Love, </em>$4,000.\u201d In his deposition, he says, that in December, 1816, <em>Cutler </em>called on him, and requested him to tell <em>Hanserd </em>&lt;\u00a7\u2019 <em>Co., </em>or any other person of whom <em>Love </em>might wish to purchase goods, that he <em>ivould pay for said Love </em>$ 4,000. Now, take either of these forms, and it seems to me, that this is a collateral undertaking: he promises to payybr <em>Love, to </em>any person that <em>Love might purchase, </em>or <em>wish </em>to <em>purchase </em>goods of. <em>Love, </em>then, was to <em>purchase </em>the goods, which of course, would render <em>him </em>liable for them, and <em>Cutler </em>was to pay the money for <em>Love, </em>not for himself. Unless I have confounded things strangely, this is clearly collateral. The next witness is <em>Turner. </em>He says that <em>Cutler </em>agreed to give <em>Love </em>$4,000, as a capital to commence with; which sum was to be paid by <em>Cutler, </em>at different periods; and in the mean time, he authorised and requested the deponent to inform any gentleman, of whom <em>Love </em>might wish to purchase goods, <em>\u201c of the arrangement.\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>Of what arrangement? Why, that he had agreed to <em>give Love </em>$ 4,000. This might induce the merchants to trust <em>Love, </em>but surely would be no promise, either original or collateral, made by <em>Cutler </em>to the merchants, to pay <em>them </em>money, \u00bfowe is the only other witness. I question very much whether he is admissible. He seems to stand nearly in the situation of <em>Slaughter, </em>in the case of <em>Waggoner </em>v. <em>Gray\u2019s Adm\u2019rs., </em>(before cited,) who was 'pronouneed by this Court to be inadmisible. I have not thought it worth while, however, to consider this point. Admitting his testimony, and that he puts the promise of <em>Cutler </em>in such a form as to make it an original one, yet the positive Answer of <em>Cutler, </em>directly responsive to the Bill, over-weighs it, oven if it were entitled to full credit. I consider, then, that the promise, as proved here, is collateral, and not being in writing, could raise no claim against <em>Cutler. </em>It may not be amiss to remark, that I have not overlooked the fact that the goods were charged by <em>Hanserd S\u00a1- </em>Co. to <em>Cutler, </em>and not <em>Love, </em>and that this is noticed in the cases as a fact tending to show to whom the credit was originally given: it seems to me, that such entries made in the books of merchants, are better evidence <em>against </em>than <em>for </em>them. Where they charge the goods to the person to whom they are furnished, it is strong to show that they considered themselves dealing with him, and (like the admissions of a party,) may be safely taken against them: but it would be of dangerous tendency to say, that by an entry made by themselves, in their own books, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>could change the complexion of their case, and make that an original, which would otherwise have been a collateral, promise. This Would be departing wholly from the general policy of the Law, and the particular policy of the Statute of Frauds, which is, in my opinion, a wise and salutary Law, and should be fairly and fully carried into execution by the Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">With respect to the question of set-off, it need hardly be considered; for, as to that part of the account claimed as <em>furnished to Love, </em>on the promise of <em>Cutler, </em>it was (if I am right,) no debt at all; and as to the part charged as furnished to <em>Cutler </em>himself, we think it no ground for coming into Equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">I think that the Decree should be reversed, the Injunction dissolved, and the Bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Judge Cabell, and the President, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-10\"> Absent, Ghees, and Coaeteb.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
