Cocke, </em>for 0166 67 each. He charges that <em>Cole, </em>aware that Judgment would be rendered against him, prepared to render it unavailing, by a succession of fraudulent conveyances, and that he still lives on a farm in genteel style, enjoying many luxuries as w\u00e9ll as comforts. The first of those conveyances was made in July, 1820, to <em>Benjamin Harrison </em>as Trustee, (whom he makes a 'Defendant,) to whom he convoyed personal property, consisting of twenty slaves, his stock of horses, mules, cattle, and hogs, his plantation utensils, household furniture, of which much was of an expensive character, and kitchen furniture, for the purpose of securing the payment of six or seven thousand dollars, for which the uncles of his wife, <em>Benjamm Coche, </em>and <em>Thomas Cocke, </em>were his sureties, or creditors: that'of these debts 03,385 were due for a tract of land then recently. purchased by <em>Cole </em>from <em>Byrnes\u2019s </em>Executors, which land was under no incumbrance, and would have constituted a more certain indemnity than personal estate, if fraud against creditors had not been intended: that 01,354 were due to <em>Benjamm Cocke'by </em>Bond of that date, and that the balance was due on delivery Bonds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>against any danger from which no indemnity ought to have been required, unless the debtor was suspected of the vilest fraud. The second .Deed was executed on the 13th October, 1820, by Cole and <em>Wfe, </em>by which they conveyed to <em>Benjamin Codee, </em>as Trustee, three tracts of land containing nine hundred acres, more or less, near Petersburg, on the extraordinary trust, the Trustee should at the end of one year, sell the land on a-credit of one, two, three, and four years, and out of the proceeds of such sale, should pay those of <em>Cole\u2019s </em>creditors who should, within thirty days, sign the Deed, and thus become parties thereto: but, heavers that no one creditor did sign it, and therefore it became of no effect The third Deed was executed by the said <em>William Cole </em>on the 29th December, 1820, by which he conveyed to <em>Thomas P. Coche, </em>his wife\u2019s brother, absolute]}-, all his interest in the lands and slaves before-mentioned, and all his wife\u2019s interest in the dower slaves held by her mother, for the paltry consideration of $500, which were paid in the three Eonds mentioned in the schedule aforesaid. He charges that this Deed was executed by <em>Cole, </em>with full knowledge that the Execution was in the hands of the Sheriff, and after he had promised to surrender himself on the 30th, and for the sole purpose of enabling him to take the insolvent oath. He offers to allow $5,000 instead of $500, for the lands and slaves so conveyed, and will consent that the Court shall Decree an immediate sale of them for cash: that all debts then legally chargeable on them under the Deeds aforesaid, shall first bo paid out of the proceeds of the sale, and that the $5,000 shall be allowed as a credit to <em>Cole </em>in part of the Plaintiff\u2019s Judgment. Pie calls on <em>Cole </em>to say, whether he will aeeept the offer: if not, he calls on <em>Cole, </em>and <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Benjamin Cocke, </em>who are made Defendants, to say whether they did not design by the first Deed to protect the property against his debt, and especially whether the personal property was included with any other view, and whether the said <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Benjamin </em>entertained any apprehension of loss, when they <em>professed to </em>take a Deed of indemnity: he requires also Cole, and <em>Benjamin Cock, to </em>state what debts were intended to be secured by the second Deed, and whether it was not intended to drive the Plaintiff into a compromise, or sale of his claim, upon terms which he had rejected: and he requires <em>Thomas P. Cocke, </em>who is also made a Defendant, to say what was the inducement to the execution of the last Deed, whether he did not promise to cancel it; whether he did really intend to force his brother-in-law to abide by so ruinous a sale, and whether it was not designed to defeat the Plaintiff\u2019s demand. Pie prays, that the Sheriff of Prince George County, in whom the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>vests-1*^ .operation of the Statute, and whom-he makes a Defendant, mil-yfCg-decreed to sell the property, or thatdt may be sold in some other-way, and that his Judgment debt may bqpaid. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-5\">, The Deeds are filed as exhibits, and theytyfre truly set out, except that the last Deed conveys to <em>Thomas F\u00a7, Codee, </em>all of <em>Cole\u2019s </em>interest in. the lands and negroes conveyed \"By the two Deeds of Trust, \u201c <em>after thepayment of the said debts/' </em>&amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-6\">The. Defendant <em>Cole, </em>m his Answer, admits the Judgment against him, but denfes that it is a just debt; says;-it was founded on an award, which he is endeavouring by a Bill in Equity against <em>M\u2019Rae, </em>to'Set aside. He <em>denies, </em>that there is any fraud in the conveyances, or any intention of fraud, either on his or on the of the other parties to those Deeds; he denies that he is living in comfort and luxury. He says, that the whole amount of the perty conveyed by the Deeds, will not more than $5Q0, if so much, over and above the debts they were intended to secure. He.denies, that the land he purchased of Byrnes\u2019sExecutors is unincumbered; on the contrary, he avers that.it is under an incumbrance to a former owner of it, although the Defendant did not know it when he .purchased, but that being so incumbered, <em>Thomas Cocke, </em>his surety, thought it prudent to take a Deed on slaves, and other personal property, as an indemnity. He admits the execution of the conveyances to <em>Thomas P. Cocke, </em>- for the consideration of @500; says, that he had only an equity of redemption in that property, and that the price agreed on is a full consideration for it. He denies, that there was any agreement betvveen himself and the said <em>Thomas P., </em>to have the interest restored, or re-conveyed, or released to the Defendant. He says, that the second Deed expresses truly on its -face the true intention of the parties. As to the offer .of the Plaintiff to give @5,000, he considers it an artful attempt to seduce the Defendants into an admission that the Deed was fraudulent, and therefore repels the offer with indignation. He hopes to be able to set aside the Judgment of the Plaintiff, but if he should fail in that, he expresses his willingness that ;the property may all be sold in any manner the Court may direct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-7\"><em>Thomas Cocke, </em>in his Answer, repels with indignation, the imputation of fraud against him. He says, when he consented to become <em>Cole\u2019s </em>surety for the purchase of <em>Byrnes\u2019s </em>land, he was not apprised of Cole\u2019s embarrasment: that he executed the Bond as surety, for <em>Cole, </em>to <em>Byrnes\u2019s </em>Executors, under a conviction that a mortgage of the land had been previously executed by <em>Cole, </em>as had been stipulated, and he knows not why the Executors failed to require a mortgage, and thereby undertook to augment the responsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>bilily of the sureties: that, when the Defendant obtained a lien on personal property from <em>Cole, </em>his inducement was, not only to secure himself against loss, in consequence of the depressed value of the land, but as a protection against other large sums for which he had been security for <em>Cole. </em>He says, that he has reason to believe, that the property conveyed by the said Deed'will be inadequate to discharge the debts intended to be secured by it, and that the reason why the property has not been sold to pay that debt, is, because the last Bond has recently fallen due, and that further proceedings on 1he part of <em>Byrnes\u2019s </em>representatives\u2019 have been injoined by the <em>Chancellor: </em>that the Defendant is perfectly willing that a sale be made of all of <em>Cole\u2019s </em>property, being assured that the <em>Chancellor </em>will save the Defendant harmless, and direct the purchase money due to <em>Byrnes\u2019s </em>Executors, to be paid out of the lands, if the personal subject should be inadequate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-4\"><em>Benjamin Codec </em>in his Answer denies fraud, and says, that he had a just claim against <em>Cole </em>for the amount stated in the Deed to <em>Harrison: </em>that the Defendant proposed to the Complainant to compromise his controversy with <em>Cole, </em>because he believed that the Plaintiff, in the exchange of lands, had obtained a very great advantage over <em>Cole: </em>that the Plaintiff rejected the proposal, whereupon the Defendant advised <em>Cole </em>to execute a Deed for the benefit of all his creditors, so that all might come in for a distributable share. He declares his willingness that a Decree should be pronounced, directing a sale of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-5\"><em>Thomas P. Cocke </em>in his Answer admits, that he became a purchaser of the <em>residue </em>of <em>Cole\u2019s </em>estate, for <em>$ </em>500: that, at the time of the purchase, it was believed not to be worth more after the payment of all <em>Cole\u2019s </em>debts, and the Defendant is still of that opinion. l\u00edo denies, that he contemplated any fraud in this transaction: that it was his wish to preserve for his sister and her children the remnant of the estate. Ife says, he does not know how it can be considered fraudulent, when he was not to be entitled to any part of the estate, <em>t-'ll all the debts were paid. </em>If he had intended to have covered <em>Cole\u2019s </em>estate, and protected it from the payment of his debts, he might have been justly charged with fraud, hut his interest was not to accrue till after the payment of the debts, and that the payment of <em>Cole\u2019s </em>debts was the inducement to the execution of the Deed. He expresses his willingness that a Decree should bo made, to sell <em>Cole\u2019s </em>whole estate to pay all of his debts, and the Defendant is willing to surrender all Ins interest under the Deed, after being paid the money already advanced by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>So much for the Bill and Answers in the suit of <em>M\u2019Rae </em>against <em>Cole </em>a'nd others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-4\">The Record -also contains the proceedings in a cross suit in Chancery, brought by <em>Cole </em>against <em>M\u2019Rae. </em>In that suit, <em>Cole </em>represents that'the debt on which <em>M\u2019Rae </em>had obtained a Judgement against him, arose out of a contract for an exchange of lands. He had purchased <em>M\u2019Rae\u2019s </em>lots in Petersburg, and land adjacent, of which the price was fixed, and had given in exchange several valuable tracts in Tennessee, of which the price was kept open.*.^ Pending the action at Haw, brought by <em>M\u2019Rae </em>against him, on the contract, the parties referred their dispute to arbitrators,, who decided that he should receive only <em>$2 </em>per acre for his Tennessee land, <em>Cole </em>claiming $ 4, The s\u00fam awarded, constituted the credit on <em>M\u2019Rae\u2019s </em>Judgment. The object of <em>Cole\u2019s </em>Bill was to set.aside the, award, and the Judgment consequent thereon. He objected to the award, not on account of the want of integrity or ability in the arbitrators, hut because they were misled and deceived by the testimony of the only witness who was examined before them, and'beqause great injustice had been done to him in ascertaining the value of the land, which he endeavoured to'support by proof. At the hearing\u201eon the Bill, Answers and. Depositions, Cole\u2019s Bill was dismissed by the <em>Chancellor, </em>and is supposed to have been finally disposed of. It is not necessary to-say more here as to that case, because it is not referred to in the Decree either. of the <em>Chancellor, </em>or of the Court of Appeals, in the suit which forms the subject, of this Report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-5\">During the progress of this suit, about March, 1824, <em>Cole </em>died., leaving a widow.

And although it is clear that the whole property conveyed by those Deeds, or so much thereof as may be necessary to pay all the debts aforesaid, must be sold for that purpose in the progress of this cause, yet the Court doubting whether it was proper to direct the real property in question to be sold for cash to be deposited in the Bank to the credit of the cause before these questions were decided, since that course had a tendency to sacrifice the property, by discouraging the creditors from bidding, as they probably would, if their right to satisfaction of their debts, and the order in which they were to be paid out of the property, were previously ascertained, awarded a <em>Svpei'sedeas </em>in respect to the land only, leaving the Decree as to the personal property t\u00f3 be executed, inasmuch as that was perishable, and liable to be wasted, and no such sacrifice was to be apprehended in respect thereto from the causes aforesaid, since it could be sold in detail. And the Court is now of opinion that the Decree, so far as it directed the lands, in the proceedings mentioned, to be sold, was premature, and therefore erroneous: and that the said lands should have been put into the hands of a receiver, to be by him .rented out until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number><em>the </em>rights of the parties, in respect to that subject, were determine ed-, having a due regard to the rights also of. the widow of Cole, if any she has.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The Decree was therefore reversed, so far as it conflicts with this opinion, and affirmed as to the residue, and -the cause remanded to be farther proceeded in accordingly.-</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Absent, the Paesieekt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
