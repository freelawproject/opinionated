Talbert, </em>when he purchased the woman <em>Jenny, </em>made her a promise that when she should have a child for every one of his, (he then having five) he would set her free. This promise, though no way binding, the old people, (and especial]}*' Sirs. <em>Talbert,) </em>seem to have been anxious to comply with, in <em>1792, 33. Talbert </em>made a Deed to his youngest son, <em>Charles, </em>then, and always after; living with him, conveying to him <em>Jenny </em>and her son <em>Moses. </em>This Deed was confessedly voluntary, made, as some of 1he witnesses say, to cover the property from an apprehended claim, afterwards compromised. No change of possession follow'd the Deed. It seems, that either at the time of this Deed, or soon after, some division of the other slaves of the father was made among the other children. Things remained in this way, \u25a0the father still in possession of the property, till 1803; when it was agreed among <em>B. Talbert </em>and his children, that the former division should he done away, and anew division take place. For this the children were called to their father\u2019s house, and all attended but one <em>(Thomas.) Jenny </em>had now six children; and it -was agreed, that the five children should have one each; and it was distinctly understood, that the former division was to be done away, and the Deeds (as the witness expresses it) to be forgotten and laid aside; and <em>Jenny </em>and her youngest son were to be set free. That Die Appellant <em>Charles, </em>assented to this arrangement, is fully proved; for, several witnesses state, that while the division waspending, one of the sons-in-law finding <em>Jenny </em>not included in the scheme, asked \u2018\u2018what is to be done with big <em>Jenny?\u201d </em>To which the Appellant answered, \u201cNever mind big <em>Jenny. </em>Our mother\u201d (who was then dead) \u201cwished her to be free, and she shall be free.\u201d Accordingly, <em>B. Talbert, </em>by Deed, emancipated <em>Jenny, </em>the day after the division; and some time after, he, by Deed, emancipated her son <em>JLorenso. </em>Doth these Deeds were recorded. <em>Jenny </em>had two other children afterwards. From the time of her emancipation in 1803, till 1813, <em>Jenny </em>acted in all respects as a free person, and kept her three youngest children with her. <em>33. Tulbert </em>died in 1S09. The Appellant never objected to die Deeds of emancipation; nor, that w&amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>hear of, ever made any claim to <em>Jenny </em>or her children, during the-life of his, father; nor after his death, till the year 1313, when he took possession of the three cluldreu, leaving <em>Jenny </em>at large. She sued at Law for the freedom of her children, and a verdict was found for the Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Two objections were taken for the'Appellant, on the argument-1. That Equity has no jurisd iotion of the cause. <em>2. </em>That the Judg - meat at Law is a bar, so far as it relates to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">As to the <em>first. </em>Though not fond of extending Equity jurisdiction, I think this is a case which it may fairly reach: at least, con \u25a0 currently with a Law Court. See <em>Dempsey </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>Gibn. 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The more serious question is, can it take cognizance after a trial at Law? And in commou cases, \u00cd should be dear that it could not, if the trial at Law was fair. But there is something peculiar in this case. I do not mean that this is a claim for freeedom. <em>That, </em>we all agree, must stand on precisely tire same ground with any question of property. <em>Nor </em>do I mean, that this is the case of a mother, who had herself been a slave, and was suing as next friend for <em>infants </em>who were held in slavery. This circumstance would prepare us to expect, that the cause of the paupers would not probably be presented to the Jury in its best shape; but that would furnish, of itself, no ground for a new trial of the question. The peculiar feature is this: The arrangement by which the five children of <em>Jenny </em>were divided among the children o\u00ed Talbert, the former convcj'ance done away, and <em>Jenny </em>and her last child freed, was a family matter entirely. The children called\u2019 together, and the business settled without writing, the only persons who could give evidence of this settlement, were the children: and they were strongly interested in keeping fair weather with their brother <em>Charles. </em>For, if the Deed of 1792, under which he succeeded, was good to hold the three youngest children of <em>Jenny, </em>it. was-equally so to hold the four born between 17.92, and 3 S03, and divided among the brothers and sisters of the Appellant. They might nell, therefore, be tempted to withhold their evidence, upon a compact expressed or understood, that if <em>Charles </em>might be permitted to re-rover the three youngest children, he-would suffer them to retain \u2022sheir portions; and so sensible does the Appellant seem of this, that-he told a witness, he had his brothers and sisters <em>feed; </em>for, if they said any thing against him, he would take away their negroes. And :.n the last examinations we find, that one of the principal witnesses, Mrs. <em>Elizabeth Scotl, </em>said, that as <em>Charles </em>had offended her, she would <em>now </em>let out the <em>whole </em>truih; from which it would seem, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>it had not before been let out. These considerations satisfy me, tha\u00e9 the case was not fully before the Jury, nor the evidence such as ii; now (appears; and that this proceeded, not from negligence in the paupers, but from causes beyond their control.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\">The case of <em>Isaac </em>v. Johnson, 5 Munf. 95, is much stronger than this. There, the pauper sued for his freedom at Common Law, had a verdict against him, and moved for a new trial, which was overruled, and Judgment entered. He was then sold. Afterwards, he petitioned, and had leave to institute another suit in the Corporation, of Lynchburg; which was removed to the Superior Court of Law. Pending this suit, being advised by Counsel that the former Judgment might be pleaded in bar against him, he filed a bill in the Superior Court of Chancery in Richmond, setting forth sundry grounds of relief, and praying that the former Judgment might be set aside, &amp;c. The Injunction was granted, and afterwards, on hearing of the bill, answer and exhibits, dismissed, with costs; and a non-suit was suffered in the action at Law, and afterwards another suit in Chan-eery brought by <em>Isaac </em>in the County Court of Campbell. In this suit a final Decree was pronounced by the County Court in <em>Isaac\u2019s </em>favor; which, on appeal, was reversed by the Court of Chancery, and 1 he bill dismissed; and on appeal to this Court, the Chancellor\u2019s Decree was reversed, and that of the County Court affirmed. <em>This </em>was going vastly beyond what is asked in this case, and further, I confess, than I could have gone. I do not think, then, that under these peculiar circumstances, the Judgment at Law is a bar; and that being removed, there is no difficulty; for, on the merits, the paupers are clearly entitled to their freedom. The first gift, and the Deed, ias the Chancellor says,) were clearly, by the mutual consent of the parties, destroyed by the second division, which might well be done, without Deed; this being personal property, and possession foliowi ng the new arrangement. That the Appellant assented to this new division, is proved both by positive evidence, and by his long in the freedom of and her children for ten years. The Decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b132-4\">Judge Green.</author>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The Appellant claims under a voluntary Deed, by which his father conveyed to him <em>Jenny </em>and one of her children in 1793. The slaves remained in the possession of the father until 1803, when <em>Jenny </em>had, in all, six children, one of whom was very young; and <em>Basil Talbert </em>had five children. It appears, that when <em>Basil Talbert </em>purchased Jenny, he promised her that whenever she had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>chilli for each of his children, she should be-emancipated, and Mrs. <em>Talbert </em>was anxious that this promise should he redeemed. After the deatli of Mrs. <em>Talbert, </em>it ivas agreed, that the Appellant and Mrs. <em>Scott, </em>(one of the children of 7?. <em>Talbert, </em>to whom a conveyance had been made in 1792, of one of <em>Jenny\u2019s </em>children) should give up their claims under those Deeds; and that the live oldest children of <em>Jenny </em>should be'assigned, one to each of <em>13. Talbert\u2019s </em>children; and that <em>Jenny </em>should bo set free, with hor last child, which was accordingly done; and from this time (1803) until 180 9, when <em>B. Tulbert </em>died, and until 1813, <em>Jenny </em>lived as a free woman in al! respects, and had two other children. In 1813, the Appellant seized the three <em>last </em>children of <em>Jenny </em>as slaves; and they being infants, <em>Jenny </em>sued for their freedom, but not for her own, the Appellant not having seized her. Upon a trial, the Jury found a verdict for the Defendant, and Judgment was according!}' given against, the Plaintiffs. This Judgment is relied on as a bar to the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim in this suit, or al least, as to the children of <em>Jenny, </em>and is, J. think, the only impediment to their right to freedom.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\">Tho transaction, at the last division of tho negroes, was, in effect, a restoration of the legal title to <em>Jenny </em>and her children, to <em>B. Talbert. </em>Such a title may pass, without Deed,, when the possession accompanies tho transfer of tho title, as it did in this case; <em>B. Talbert </em>never having parted with the possession. The Plaintiffs were, therefore, entitled to recover at Law; and in an ordinary ease, a Plaintiff so entitled could have no remedy in Equity, after a Judgment against him at Law. But, I do not think this Judgment ought to bar the remedy of these parties in Equity, considering their situation, infants held in slavery; and that the evidence which they now exhibit, was not then in their power; some of the witnesses, as they say, having determined <em>to let out the truth, only since the trial at Law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">All the children of <em>B. Talbert </em>had a motive for not voluntarily communicating the true character of the transaction at the last division; for they apprehended that the Appellant might, as he threatened he would, claim against them the negroes, which they held under that division, by force of the original Deed to him, as ho claimed <em>Jenny </em>and her children, <em>if they let out the truth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">I am for affirming the Decree.' ' \u2022</p>\n<author id=\"b133-7\">The President.</author>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">'\u2022 The Deed of gift from <em>Basil Talbert </em>to <em>Charles Talbert, </em>having been regularly recorded, and being of prior date to the two Deed's of emancipation, under which tho Appellees claim their freedom, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Deed was an obstacle in the way of their title at Law, which could only be removed, upon the evidence in the record, by a Court of Equity. By that evidence, I think it sufficiently appears, that the Deed of gift was not intended to be effectual between the parties to it; but, to cover the propertj' contained in it, from the consequences of a suit then pending against the donor, and for his benefit only. If this was at all doubtful on the direct evidence to this point in the record, it is rendered manifest by the subsequent conduct of the parties. The full exercise of ownership of the property by <em>the </em>donor, in continuing to hold the possession of it, and in two instances \u25a0 division it his with the of the donee, though ineffectual, prove his entire and exclusive right to it. The Chancellor, I think, was therefore correct in decreeing the Deed of gift to be cancelled, and in liberating the Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Decree affirmed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b134-11\">Judges Cabbie, and Coaiteh, abs'enf,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
