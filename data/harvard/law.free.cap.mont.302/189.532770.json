We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">\u00b62 Therriault raises two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-14\">1. Did an Intensive Supervision Program officer\u2019s entry into Therriault\u2019s unoccupied residence, without consent from Therriault, constitute an unlawful search requiring suppression of evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>2. Did the State provide Therriault with reasonable notice of what constituted a violation of his probation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b63 In October of 1996, Therriault entered into a plea agreement in which he agreed to plead guilty to seven felony counts. Therriault, who was 18 years old at the time of the crimes, stood charged with four counts of felony theft, one count of felony criminal endangerment involving a high-speed chase with a police officer, and two felony counts of sexual intercourse without consent involving a 14-year-old female. All seven occurred within little more than six months time.</p>\n<p id=\"ARd\">\u00b64 In December of 1995, Therriault stole a pickup from a car lot, which was recovered in January of 1996 when the missing vehicle was discovered at a motel where Therriault had registered under his own name. Six months later, Therriault stole a motorcycle and drove it the next day to his 14-year-old girlfriend\u2019s home. The motorcycle was discovered stashed near the residence after police arrived in response to the girl\u2019s mother\u2019s 9-1-1 call. The girl\u2019s mother had apparently warned Therriault not to continue relations with her daughter. Therriault and the young teen had been \u201cdating\u201d for about one-and-a-half years. Therriault was caught sneaking out of the girl\u2019s bedroom window by her brother, who detained him until police arrived. Just days later, having been released on his own recognizance, Therriault was again discovered with the girl, this time by his sister. He fled with the girl by stealing his parents\u2019 car. He would eventually leave the car at a used car lot in Missoula where he and the girl took another vehicle for an unauthorized test drive. The lot\u2019s owner summoned the assistance of law enforcement. The criminal endangerment charge arose during the subsequent failed apprehension of Therriault, as an officer chased him out of town, onto a mountain road, and eventually gave up his pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b65 In exchange for his pleas, the State agreed to recommend concurrent prison terms of 10 years for each count, with a portion suspended. The plea agreement also required the State to recommend that Therriault be placed in the Intensive Supervision Program (ISP). In March of 1997, Therriault was accepted by ISP after an initial rejection by the program in February.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b66 On April 16,1997, following a sentencing hearing, the District Court sentenced Therriault to the Department of Corrections for ten years, with seven years suspended upon several conditions. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>recommended that Therriault be placed in the Intensive Supervision Program, and would be subj ect to \u201call the rules and regulations\u201d of the State Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b67 The conditions of his suspended sentence provided that Therriault could not knowingly engage in any conduct whatsoever \u201coffensive to the laws of the State of Montana, any other states, or any of the laws of the United States of America.\u201d Further, he was required to \u201cconduct himself as a good citizen at all times.\u201d Therriault was also required to \u201csubmit himself, his vehicle and his residence to search at any time by lawful authorities upon reasonable request of his Probation Officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b68 According to his ISP supervising officer, Therriault\u2019s record of compliance as an ISP \u201cinmate\u201d during 1997 was less than stellar. Nevertheless, he made progress to the point that as the end of 1997 drew near, completion of his ISP program was in sight, which apparently meant he would become an ordinary probationer, subject to less intensive supervision. An event in December of that year would change all of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\u00b69 At or before 6 p.m., on December 18,1997, Therriault\u2019s ISP supervising officer, Mike McCarty, arrived at Therriault\u2019s residence near Arlee, Montana, for the purpose of conducting a routine check. Testimony indicated that it may have been as early as 5 p.m., while McCarty stated it was closer to 6 p.m. Therriault was required to comply with a 6 p.m. curfew. According to McCarty\u2019s testimony, he regularly stopped by Therriault\u2019s residence unannounced at various times, conducted random tests for drugs and alcohol, searched the premises for contraband or unauthorized possession of certain items, such as firearms and ammunition, and routinely phoned Therriault to monitor his employment status and involvement with the required community service.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u00b610 McCarty knocked several times, and eventually opened the door and called out to Therriault, and identified himself. With no answer, McCarty entered the residence. He spotted what he thought might be a note left for him on the kitchen counter explaining where Therriault had gone. Instead, the piece of paper apparently was a high school registration application for a female student. Other than perhaps the applicant\u2019s name, it is not clear from the record to what degree McCarty studied and gained information from the application at that time. Satisfied that Therriault was not at home, McCarty left.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u00b611 McCarty then went to Therriault\u2019s sister\u2019s residence, which was next door. According to the testimony of McCarty as well as Therriault\u2019s sister, she informed him that she had seen a girl at Therriault\u2019s home during the course of the past two weeks, and questioned McCarty about the lawful age of consent. Learning this, McCarty returned to and entered Therriault\u2019s residence again, reviewed the application, and observed that the date of birth of the applicant was in 1983, making the female 14 years old at the time. McCarty testified that he left a note next to the registration application, instructing Therriault to contact him, and proceeded to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"ADh\">\u00b612 Later that night, at approximately 10 p.m., McCarty returned to the residence with a deputy sheriff. After several minutes of knocking, Therriault answered the door. He admitted that a girl was in the basement. The officers found the girl (hereinafter A.M.) in a basement bedroom. The officers learned she was the same girl identified in the school registration application found earlier by McCarty. A.M.\u2019s attire consisted of a bed sheet. Her clothes were located upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"AhN\">\u00b613 A.M. was interviewed by Detective Gregory Hintz a month later on January 14,1998, at Charlo High School. According to A.M.\u2019s statements provided to Detective Hintz, her relationship with Therriault was one of friendship that had included sexual intercourse on only one occasion. She stated that she \u201cdidn\u2019t stay there every night, I just stayed there like on and off...\u201d She admitted to using his address as her own on her application to Arlee High School, where she intended to transfer. She explained that on the night of Therriault\u2019s arrest, she had been sleeping downstairs alone, and the two did not have any sexual relations at that time. A.M. told Detective Hintz that Therriault knew her age at the time, which was 14 years old. She told the detective that they had met in late November, several weeks prior to his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\u00b614 On February 23,1998, the State petitioned the District Court to revoke Therriault\u2019s probation. On June 15, 1998, Therriault filed a motion in limine, seeking to preclude the introduction of A.M.\u2019s statements provided to Officer Hintz in the event A.M. failed to testify at the revocation hearing (at some point, A.M. moved to Nevada to live with an aunt and uncle). On that same day, Therriault also filed a motion to suppress all evidence gained as a result of McCarty\u2019s entrance into Therriault\u2019s residence, where he observed A.M.\u2019s high school registration application. Therriault alleged that discovery of subsequent evidence \u2014 namely Therriault\u2019s harboring of A.M. \u2014 directly resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>from what amounted to an illegal search and seizure, and should therefore be suppressed as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b615 At a June 18, 1998 hearing, the District Court denied Therriault\u2019s motion to suppress, and subsequently revoked Therriault\u2019s suspended sentence for violating conditions of his probation in a judgment entered July 1,1998. A.M. was unavailable to testify. The court relied primarily on the hearsay statement she had provided to the detective and the testimony of McCarty.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b616 Therriault moved for a rehearing, providing the court with A.M.\u2019s sworn affidavit, which substantially recanted the information that she had earlier provided to Detective Hintz. The court granted the motion for rehearing on August 10,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u00b617 A.M. would further testify, during a September 9,1998 deposition, and refute many of her prior statements. Notably, she emphatically denied that she had had sexual relations with Therriault, and further denied that she had informed her mother of this, which her testimony to Detective Hintz indicated. She testified that she had lied to Detective Hintz. Further, she testified that she was unsure, or could not recall, if she had ever stayed overnight at Therriault\u2019s residence since the two first met. When presented with a copy of the interview transcript, she stated that she remembered making the statement that she had stayed overnight at Therriault\u2019s house. She stated that they had known each other since September, rather than November, of 1997. She stated she could not remember using his address on her application for Arlee High School.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\u00b618 In A.M.\u2019s affidavit, prepared by Therriault\u2019s counsel following a phone conversation, she also claimed that the testimony provided to Detective Hintz resulted from intimidation. She explained that Detective Hintz had induced her to admit having sex with Therriault by convincing her that Therriault had already admitted this, and that it would be in Therriault\u2019s best interest if she admitted it as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\u00b619 Due to A.M.\u2019s recantation, the State subsequently dismissed the information filed against Therriault stemming from his relations with A.M. Therriault moved to dismiss his sentence revocation, arguing that in light of A.M.\u2019s recantation, the State lacked probable cause to pursue the revocation of his suspended sentence. On December 15, 1998, the District Court denied Therriault\u2019s petition to dismiss. The court determined that A.M.\u2019s \u201csubsequent recanting of her story does not defeat the fact that at the time the petition was filed, the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>demonstrated adequate probable cause to support the revocation petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b620 At the December 30,1998 revocation hearing, testimony on behalf of Therriault provided a far more innocent explanation for A.M.\u2019s presence at his residence. Testimony indicated that the two were friends, and that A.M. was subjected to an abusive home life. According to Therriault\u2019s immediate family\u2019s testimony, A.M. turned to Therriault when she felt it was unsafe for her to stay at home, and stayed in the spare bedroom downstairs, where the officers had found her the night in question. The testimony indicated that each of their respective personal belongings were located in separate rooms, consistent with A.M.\u2019s account of her presence at Therriault\u2019s residence. It was also asserted that the reason for her living with her aunt and uncle in Nevada was to escape the potentially abusive environment at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b621 The District Court found, in its January 19,1999 Opinion and Order, that Therriault had violated the terms of his suspended sentence. Specifically, the court found that Therriault had violated Condition #2, which required that Therriault \u201cconduct himself as a good citizen at all times.\u201d The \u201cgood citizen\u201d standard of conduct was also included in Therriault\u2019s ISP agreement. The court rejected Therriault\u2019s defense that he had been helping A.M. because she was in danger in her own home. The court stated that \u201c[w]hen one is convicted of a sexual crime, it is not to be expected that conducting himself as a good citizen includes having 14-year old naked girls being in one\u2019s basement bedroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u00b622 The court further found that Therriault was \u201ca parolee released to the Intensive Supervision Program subject to the loss of certain privileges including the right to privacy.\u201d The court then issued a judgment on February 19,1999, sentencing Therriault to seven years in the Montana State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\u00b623 Therriault appeals the denial of his motion to suppress, and the order and judgment of the District Court that revoked his suspended sentence based on his violation of the conditions of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\u00b624 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress is whether there is substantial credible evidence to support the court\u2019s findings of fact, and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Parker, </em>1998 MT 6, \u00b6 17, 287 Mont. 151, \u00b6 17, 953 P.2d 692, \u00b6 17 (citing <em>State v. Roberts </em>(1997), 284 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>54, 56, 943 P.2d 1249, 1250). We also review whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law is correct. <em>State v. Hubbel </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 200, 207, 951 P.2d 971, 975 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\u00b625 The standard of review for revocation of a suspended sentence is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>See State v. Baisch, </em>1998 MT 12, \u00b6 10, 287 Mont. 191, \u00b6 10, 953 P.2d 1070, \u00b6 10 (citations omitted). So long as the district court is satisfied that the conduct of the probationer has not been what he agreed it would be when he was given liberty, this Court will not overturn a district court\u2019s decision to revoke a suspended sentence. <em>Baisch, </em>\u00b6 10. However, the State must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the probationer has violated the terms or conditions of the suspended sentence. <em>Baisch, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing \u00a7 46-18-203, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ABB\">\n<em>Issue 1.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\n<em>Did an Intensive Supervision Program officer\u2019s entry into Therriault\u2019s unoccupied residence, without consent from Therriault, constitute an unlawful search requiring the suppression of evidence?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b626 A criminal defendant who seeks to suppress evidence has the burden of proving that the search was illegal. <em>State v. McCarthy </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 51, 55, 852 P.2d 111, 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\u00b627 Although acknowledging his lower expectation of privacy as a probationer, Therriault nevertheless argues that the entry of his ISP officer, McCarty, into his residence without consent while he was not at home constituted an unlawful search pursuant to the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution in conjunction with his greater privacy rights afforded under Article II, Section 10, of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">\u00b628 Consequently, Therriault contends that the information pertaining to A.M. gleaned from McCarty\u2019s unlawful entry tainted the subsequent search for, and discovery of, A.M. by McCarty and a sheriff at Therriault\u2019s residence later that evening. Thus, the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress should have been granted, which should in turn require reversal of the revocation of his suspended sentence based on a lack of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">\u00b629 While it is undisputed that Therriault was required to \u201csubmit\u201d to a search at any time, day or night, the conditions of his suspended sentence, as set forth by the District Court, clearly provide that his submission was contingent upon not only \u201creasonable cause\u201d but also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the \u201creasonable request\u201d of his probation officer. The District Court\u2019s findings clearly indicate that at no time did Therriault\u2019s ISP officer, McCarty, request the alleged \u201csearch\u201d of Therriault\u2019s residence during which time A.M.\u2019s high school application was discovered. Nevertheless, the State argues that McCarty\u2019s conduct in entering Therriault\u2019s unlocked door, in light of the 6 p.m. curfew, did not constitute a search of Therriault\u2019s residence, and was therefore lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"AHH\">\u00b630 Thus, the first preliminary matter for our determination is whether a \u201csearch\u201d occurred here. We addressed this question, under somewhat similar facts, in <em>State v. Carlson </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 113, 644 P.2d 498. In <em>Carlson, </em>after entering the defendant\u2019s home with an arrest warrant for traffic violations, officers noticed drugs in the front room, in plain view. The facts showed that there was no \u201cprying about in hidden places or looking under sofas by the two officers.\u201d <em>Carlson, </em>198 Mont. at 118, 644 P.2d at 501. Further, like McCarty here, the officers seized none of the articles which constituted the evidence sought to be suppressed; rather, the officers observed what appeared to be drugs, left, and later returned with a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b631 We followed a rule, derived from U.S. Supreme Court Fourth Amendment analysis, that if the officers were lawfully in Carlson\u2019s front room when they made the visual observations, a search within the constitutional sense did not occur; on the other hand, if their presence in the front room was unlawful, the visual or \u201cplain view\u201d examination constituted a search in the constitutional sense. <em>Carlson, </em>198 Mont. at 119, 644 P.2d at 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b632 Our review of the case at bar can be narrowed to the question \u201cwas McCarty lawfully in Therriault\u2019s residence when he viewed A.M.\u2019s high school registration application?\u201d We conclude he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"AUK\">\u00b633  To determine what constitutes an unlawful \u201cintrusion\u201d by the government into one\u2019s privacy, under Article II, Section 10, we consider the following factors: (1) whether the person has an actual expectation of privacy; (2) whether society is willing to recognize that expectation as objectively reasonable; and (3) the nature of the state\u2019s intrusion. <em>See State v. Bassett, </em>1999 MT 109, \u00b6 24, 294 Mont. 327, \u00b6 24, 982 P.2d 410, \u00b6 24 (citations omitted). <em>See also State v. Scheetz </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 41, 48-51, 950 P.2d 722, 726-28 (holding that the use of a drug-detecting canine to inspect checked airline luggage does not offensively intrude upon or invade a person\u2019s privacy so as to constitute a search). Article II, Section 10, provides that the right of individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>privacy is \u201cessential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b634 In arguing that Therriault, as a participant in the ISP, enjoyed little or no expectation of privacy, the State contends that Therriault was \u201ctechnically neither a probationer nor a parolee. He was a DOC inmate in ISP.\u201d This contention echoes the findings and conclusions of the District Court, which determined the ISP subjected Therriault \u201cto the loss of certain privileges including the right to privacy\u201d and therefore McCarty\u2019s conduct did not constitute a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b635 Although not clearly articulated, the State seems to be arguing that an ISP officer perhaps need not even abide by the \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard for entering a probationer\u2019s residence without a warrant when the objective is to ascertain the location of the probationer. This Court adopted the \u201creasonable cause\u201d warrantless search standard for probation officers from the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision, <em>Griffin v. Wisconsin </em>(1987), 483 U.S. 868, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 97 L.Ed.2d 709. <em>See State v. Burke </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 165, 766 P.2d 254. <em>See also </em>Rule 20.7.1101(7), ARM (establishing probation or parole condition that upon reasonable cause, the probation \u201cclient\u201d shall submit to a search of his or her residence by a probation officer at any time without a warrant).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b636 The State apparently suggests that Therriault\u2019s ISP officer, McCarty, could access Therriault\u2019s house at any time, unannounced, with or without Therriault\u2019s presence or permission just as any other authorized DOC personnel may access or visually inspect an inmate\u2019s cell. <em>See, e.g., </em>Department of Corrections Policy 3.1.17, 3.1.19, and 3.2.4 (setting forth DOC policy for its facilities, and establishing procedures for offender searches, investigations, and security inspections).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u00b63 7 McCarty testified to this as well, stating that \u201c[m]y understanding is I don\u2019t need any reasonable cause to search an inmate\u2019s residence.\u201d McCarty further testified that he explained the ISP rules to Therriault like any other ISP \u201cinmate.\u201d \u201cI explain the search rules to them, that I have a right to come into their house at any time, that I have [the] right to go into their house and look for contraband at any time.\u201d In response to this testimony, the court asked: \u201cWith or without their permission?\u201d McCarty responded affirmatively: \u201cWith or without their permission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\u00b638 The State contends that the District Court did not err, therefore, in denying Therriault\u2019s motion to suppress, because the findings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the court clearly reveal that McCarty\u2019s \u201cpresence in the ISP inmate\u2019s home was lawful, entitling him to read, in plain view, what he expected was a note from Therriault.\u201d In other words, it was reasonable for Therriault, as an ISP \u201cinmate,\u201d rather than an ordinary probationer, to expect that McCarty might gain entry into his unlocked residence at any time in an effort to find him, and that this conduct did not constitute a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b639 Adding credence to the State\u2019s position is \u00a7 45-7-306, MCA, which defines community corrections programs such as the ISP as \u201cofficial detention.\u201d Pursuant to this classification, an ISP participant may be charged with the offense of felony escape. This statute further provides that \u201cofficial detention does not include supervision of a person on probation or parole.\u201d <em>See also State v. Chandler </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 476, 480-81, 922 P.2d 1164, 1167; \u00a7 53-30-326, MCA (defining \u201cescape\u201d from community corrections facility or program).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b640  We conclude, however, that the authority suggesting that an ISP \u201cclient\u201d is an \u201cinmate\u201d rather than a \u201cprobationer\u201d and is therefore subject to a distinct standard for search and seizure is at best ambiguous, and conflicts with far more persuasive authority that suggests that the ISP is merely a rigid condition imposed on certain probationers, and that it is the sentencing tribunal which establishes the conditions for any search of the \u201cclient\u2019s\u201d person or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b641 The ISP falls under the authority of the Community Corrections Division of the Department of Corrections. In turn, the ISP is administered by the Probation and Parole Bureau. According to the Community Corrections Division\u2019s mission statement, the ISP is a \u201cspecialized form of adult probation and parole supervision lasting nine to 18 months using a heightened level of supervision, monitoring devices and close scheduling. ISP offenders live at home, hold or seek jobs, and are under greater scrutiny than regular probationers and parolees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b642 The purpose of the Intensive Supervision Program, as a community correction program, is to \u201creduce the use of jail space for offenders who need a structured environment, counseling, and supervision but <em>who may not require </em>incarceration.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 53-30-302(3), MCA (emphasis added); <em>State v. Hanners, </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 524, 525, 839 P.2d 1267, 1268. Further, a community corrections program means \u201ca community-based or community-oriented facility or program, <em>other than jail\u201d See </em>\u00a7 53-30-303(2), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>\u00b643 Under \u00a7 46-23-1001(4), MCA, probation is explicitly defined as \u201cthe release by the court <em>without imprisonment, </em>except as otherwise provided by law, of a defendant found guilty of a crime upon verdict or plea, subject to conditions imposed by the court and subject to the supervision of the department [of corrections] upon direction of the court.\u201d See <em>also </em>\u00a7 7-32-2120(4), MCA, and \u00a7 7-32-2241(4), MCA (defining \u201cinmate\u201d as a person who is confined in a detention center); \u00a7 7-32-2120(1), MCA (defining \u201cdetention center\u201d as a \u201cfacility established and maintained by an appropriate entity for the purpose of confining arrested persons or persons sentenced to the detention center\u201d); \u00a7 46-19-301, MCA, and \u00a7 46-19-401, MCA (defining \u201cinmate\u201d as a \u201cmale or female offender who is under sentence to or confined in a prison or other correctional institution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b644 In light of the foregoing, the District Court\u2019s April 16, 1997 Judgment clearly provided that Therriault was a probationer, subject to ISP rules. The court stated that \u201cseven (7) years on each of Defendant\u2019s sentences are hereby suspended on the terms and conditions listed below ... [t]he <em>terms and conditions of probation are as follows...\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b645 One of the conditions of Therriault\u2019s probation required that \u201cduring the period of suspension of this sentence the Defendant shall remain under the jurisdiction of this Court and of the Department of Corrections and Human Services, Adult Parole and Probation Bureau of the State of Montana, and the Defendant shall be and is subject to all the rules and regulations of said department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b646 Nevertheless, the Department of Corrections, pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1002(3), MCA, may adopt rules for the conduct of persons placed on parole or probation, \u201cexcept that the department may not make any rule conflicting with conditions of parole imposed by the board or <em>conditions of probation imposed by a court\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Further, under \u00a7 46-23-1011(1), MCA, the \u201cdepartment shall supervise persons during their probation period in accord with the conditions set by a court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\u00b647  Accordingly, we conclude that any ISP rule, or any terms or conditions to which an ISP participant is subjected, or any means of supervision by an ISP officer that conflict with a court-ordered condition of a person\u2019s probation, would be superseded by that particular court\u2019s conditions. We conclude that based on the foregoing, Therriault was on probation, and as a probationer was subject to those rules of the ISP, as well as any other Department of Corrections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>rules, to the extent that the rules did not conflict with the conditions of his probation as set forth by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b648  The State in this instance, therefore, misconstrues the source of Therriault\u2019s \u201cactual expectation\u201d of privacy by characterizing him as an \u201cinmate.\u201d Therriault\u2019s privacy expectation, however limited, is derived directly from the court\u2019s conditions of his probation, which expressly provide that he would submit his residence \u201cto search at any time by lawful authorities <em>upon reasonable request </em>of his Probation Officer.\u201d This condition is coupled with the DOC\u2019s Rule 20.7.1101(7) \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard, which is necessarily incorporated by reference, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-801, MCA. Thus, Therriault could expect that an intrusion into the privacy of his home would not occur unless McCarty had reasonable cause and first posed a reasonable request.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b649 That this expectation is one that society is willing to view as objectively reasonable flows from the Legislature\u2019s enactment of \u00a7 46-23-1011(1), MCA, providing that the DOC will supervise probationers in accordance with the conditions set by the sentencing court, as well as \u00a7 46-18-801(1), MCA, which provides that a sentencing judge my deprive an offender of a civil or constitutional right as a \u201cnecessary condition of the sentence directed toward the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of society.\u201d In other words, as a society, we have accorded discretion to the judiciary to determine the necessary and proper parameters of a particular probationer\u2019s \u201cconditional liberty,\u201d within the prescribed boundaries of our federal and state constitutions, which in turn establish the probationer\u2019s limited expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u00b650  Accordingly, we conclude that regardless of McCarty\u2019s understanding of his authority to conduct searches as an ISP officer, as well as any administrative rules providing such authority, he was limited by the conditions of probation as set forth by the District Court. <em>See </em>Rule 20.7.1101(9) ARM (DOC regulation acknowledging that sentencing court may require other and additional conditions to be placed on probationer). Thus, whether he had a reasonable cause \u2014 or whether he believed he needed none \u2014 to enter Therriault\u2019s residence was not sufficient in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">\u00b651 Finally, the State contends that the final prong of our analysis, \u201cthe nature of the state\u2019s intrusion,\u201d should lead us to conclude that by its nature, McCarty\u2019s warrantless intrusion into Therriault\u2019s residence without Therriault\u2019s consent, under the specific circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>set forth here was not unlawful. For example, the State argues that McCarty\u2019s entrance was \u201crespectful and courteous\u201d and he did not \u201crummage\u201d through Therriault\u2019s personal effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b652 In <em>State v. Hubbel </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 200, 210, 951 P.2d 971, 977, we analyzed this third prong in the context of a police investigation of the scene of a shooting. We observed that the officers \u201csimply parked in the general parking area routinely used by other visitors, and, after observing blood evidence on the driveway and bullet holes in the front door, continued walking along the sidewalk to the front porch.\u201d We also observed that the officers did not ignore posted warnings, hop fences, open gates, or slip through bushes intended to screen the home from view. In short, we concluded that the officers \u201cdid nothing other than what any other casual visitor to the Hubbel residence would do.\u201d <em>Hubbel, </em>286 Mont. at 210, 951 P.2d at 977 (holding that the District Court did not err in denying Hubbel\u2019s motion to suppress any evidence observed and seized within plain view in the parking area, on the walkway, and on the front porch of Appellant\u2019s home).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b653 In analyzing the officer\u2019s entrance of the home, however, we restated the indelible rule that warrantless searches conducted inside a home are per se unreasonable, \u201csubject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d <em>Hubbel, </em>286 Mont. at 212, 951 P.2d at 978. This Court has routinely stated that the physical invasion of the home is the chief evil to which the 4th Amendment and Montana\u2019s Article II, \u00a7 11, are directed. We have emphasized again and again that the entrance to the home is where the federal and Montana constitutions draw a firm line, and that absent an exception, that threshold may not be crossed without a warrant. <em>See, e.g., State v. Kao </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 277, 282-83, 697 P.2d 903, 907 (quoting <em>Payton v. New York </em>(1980), 445 U.S. 573, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639); <em>State v. Bassett, </em>1999 MT 109, \u00b6 25, 294 Mont. 327, \u00b6 25, 982 P.2d 410, \u00b6 25. Further, it is well-settled that the government\u2019s intrusion into a home through an unlocked door is no different than if entry is gained with a key, or the use of force. <em>See, e.g., Sabbath v. United States </em>(1968), 391 U.S. 585, 590, 88 S.Ct. 1755, 1758-59, 20 L.Ed.2d 828 (interpreting statute that requires an officer to announce his authority before officer may \u201cbreak\u201d into a home to execute a search warrant). Thus, our analysis of the \u201cnature\u201d of an officer\u2019s warrantless intrusion into a person\u2019s home cannot escape the necessity that the State prove that one of the exceptions provided under our search and seizure jurisprudence applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>\u00b654 Taking the State\u2019s position at face value, McCarty entered Therriault\u2019s residence twice, once for the limited purpose of locating Therriault, and a second time for the apparent purpose of reviewing A.M.\u2019s high school registration to either gather or confirm information. While both entries may have satisfied the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d requirement, McCarty\u2019s physical presence inside Therriault\u2019s residence required that he make a reasonable request prior to entering. Combined, the two conditions formed the only \u201cwell-delineated\u201d exception to the warrant requirement at issue here: the one carefully crafted by the District Court as a condition of Therriault\u2019s suspended sentence, pursuant to state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b655  Accordingly, we hold that McCarty was unlawfully in Therriault\u2019s residence on both occasions when he gathered the information, in plain view, concerning A.M., and therefore his conduct constituted an unlawful search.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b656 The State argues, however, that even if McCarty\u2019s entry into Therriault\u2019s residence constituted an unlawful search, and therefore invokes the exclusionary rule, the subsequent \u201cfruit\u201d of the gathered evidence \u2014 in this case the discovery of A.M. in Therriault\u2019s home later that night \u2014 can be \u201cpurged\u201d of the taint, and should therefore not be excluded. The State argues that one of the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d exceptions to the exclusionary rule should apply, and directs our attention to the \u201cinevitable discovery\u201d rule. Therriault, of course, argues that none of the exceptions apply, and therefore all evidence is irreversibly tainted, and should be suppressed pursuant to the Fourth Amendment \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine. Obviously, such an exclusion would extricate all evidence supporting the revocation of Therriault\u2019s suspended sentence, and thereby establish an abuse of discretion by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u00b657  The primary purpose of the exclusionary rule is to \u201cdeter future unlawful police conduct\u201d by making evidence which the State obtains through a search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment, inadmissable in criminal proceedings. <em>State v. Pipkin, </em>1998 MT 143, \u00b6 12, 289 Mont. 240, \u00b6 12, 961 P.2d 733, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted). The \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine forbids the use of evidence which comes to light as a result of the exploitation of an initial illegal act of the police. <em>See State v. New </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 529, 535-36, 917 P.2d 919, 923 (quoting U.S. Supreme Court decision, <em>Murray v. United States </em>(1988), 487 U.S. 533, 108 S.Ct. 2529, 101 L.Ed.2d 472, stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>that police should be placed in the same, not worse, position once tainted evidence is excised).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b658  <em>In New, </em>we set forth the exceptions to the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine. We stated that the \u201cfruit\u201d or derivative evidence is admissible if it is (1) attenuated from the constitutional violation so as to remove its primary taint; (2) obtained from an independent source; or (3) determined to be evidence which would have been inevitably discovered apart from the constitutional violation. <em>New, </em>276 Mont. at 536, 917 P.2d at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b659 In that case there was likewise an apparent causal connection between an unlawful search that led to a subsequent lawful search conducted by the defendant\u2019s probation officer, which produced incriminating evidence that the defendant wished to exclude. We determined that although testimony indicated that the initial unlawful search was a \u201cfactor\u201d in the subsequent search conducted by the officer, he nevertheless possessed sufficient independent information upon which the lawful search was based. <em>See New, </em>276 Mont. at 536-37, 917 P.2d at 923-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b660 The first of the above exceptions is inapplicable due to the proximity in time and place between McCarty\u2019s initial intrusion and Therriault\u2019s eventual arrest. The latter two exceptions are applicable, however, in determining whether the discovery of A.M. at Therriault\u2019s residence on the evening of December 18,1996, should be excluded as \u201cfruit\u201d of McCarty\u2019s prior unlawful entry. Thus, if McCarty possessed either an independent source of information that led him to discover Therriault\u2019s probation violation, or was engaged in an investigation that would have ultimately led him to discover the violation, then the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine should not apply. <em>See New, </em>276 Mont. at 537, 917 P.2d at 924. We conclude that the \u201cindependent source\u201d exception, which is closely related to the inevitable discovery exception, is more attune with the factual circumstances of the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b661 The testimony in this case indicates that McCarty received independent incriminating information from Therriault\u2019s sister. She informed McCarty, with little or no prompting, that she had observed a young female at her brother\u2019s residence several times during a two-week period of time, and proceeded to question McCarty about the lawful age of consent out of apparent concern for her brother as a probationer.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u00b662 Prior to this discussion, and based on his unlawful observation of the application located in Therriault\u2019s residence, McCarty may have observed the girl\u2019s name. It is entirely unclear whether more information than this was obtained at that time. Testimony detailing the subsequent discussion with Therriault\u2019s sister does not convincingly demonstrate that he \u201cexploited\u201d whatever scant bits of information pertaining to A.M. he possessed. To the contrary, his questioning of the sister indicated he was far more concerned with physically locating Therriault, in light of the 6 p.m. curfew. The testimony indicates that the critical piece of evidence that he did not possess, which the sister voluntarily provided, was that a girl had been residing at Therriault\u2019s residence for approximately two weeks. Then, it was the sister, not McCarty, who raised the subject of the girl\u2019s age, as she proceeded to question McCarty about the legal age of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b663 The District Court summarized the evidence to which counsel for both parties agreed: \u201che [McCarty] goes inside the kitchen and on the table he observes a school enrollment form. He leaves the premises and goes and talks to the sister. And in talking to the sister, according to Mr. McCarty, he learns that a young lady named [A.M.] is residing at the residence. Lived there for approximately a couple weeks.\u201d The only clarification raised by Therriault\u2019s counsel was that McCarty may have discovered A.M.\u2019s name during the first entrance into Therriault\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b664 Thus, it was not the \u201ctainted\u201d evidence of the girl\u2019s name, or her age, or the fact that she was transferring to a different school that led to the discovery of A.M. in Therriault\u2019s basement that evening; rather, it was the independent information that a girl, of questionable age, had been residing with Therriault for two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b665 Further, Therriault\u2019s whereabouts were not clearly ascertained by McCarty until he returned that evening at approximately 10 p.m. Establishing that an ISP probationer is at home after curfew through direct, physical observation is clearly a function of McCarty\u2019s duties as Therriault\u2019s ISP officer. This factor provided McCarty with an additional, independent reason to return to Therriault\u2019s residence on the evening that A.M. was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b666  We conclude, therefore, that the irrefutable evidence of A.M.\u2019s presence in Therriault\u2019s residence on the night of December 18, 1996, was ascertained through sources sufficiently independent of McCarty\u2019s unlawful conduct to not warrant exclusion under the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine. Accordingly, we conclude that the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>trict Court did not err when it denied Therriault\u2019s motion to suppress, nor did it abuse its discretion when it revoked Therriault\u2019s suspended sentence based on the evidence of the officer\u2019s subsequent discovery of A.M. in Therriault\u2019s basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\n<em>Issue 2.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\n<em>Did the State provide Therriault with reasonable notice of what constituted a violation of his probation ?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b667 As a preliminary matter, we conclude that whether Therriault and A.M. had sexual intercourse \u2014 which would be a clear-cut violation of his probation on several grounds \u2014 is immaterial to our review on appeal. Thus, the lengthy discussion set forth by both parties regarding the veracity of A.M.\u2019s various versions detailing her sexual relations with Therriault will be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\u00b668 Instead we look to the undisputed fact that at no time did A.M. expressly deny residing, from time to time, at Therriault\u2019s residence, which included overnight stays. Testimony submitted on Therriault\u2019s behalf, in fact, substantiated that A.M. was in fact spending the night at Therriault\u2019s residence at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">\u00b669 Therriault contends that A.M.\u2019s presence in Therriault\u2019s home did not \u201cobjectively\u201d violate his probation, and that the \u201cgood citizenship\u201d standard is unconstitutionally too vague to sufficiently warn him of what would constitute a violation of his probation conditions, and therefore violated his right to due process. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">\u00b670 The District Court revoked Therriault\u2019s suspended sentence based on the \u201cgood citizenship\u201d standard set forth by the court in his 1997 conditions of probation, both in its July 1,1998 Judgment, and then in its January 19,1999 Order and February 19,1999 Judgment. The condition stated that Therriault must \u201cconduct himself as a good citizen at all times.\u201d The court concluded that \u201c[w]hen one is convicted of a sexual crime, it is not to be expected that conducting himself as a good citizen includes having 14-year old naked girls being in one\u2019s basement bedroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">\u00b671 Thus, our review is narrowly drawn to whether the court abused its discretion when it determined that the undisputed evidence of Therriault\u2019s permitting A.M. to remain at his home overnight was not the conduct of a \u201cgood citizen,\u201d and therefore he violated one of the conditions of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">\u00b672 Disregarding the more unseemly side of the District Court\u2019s findings, and accepting Therriault\u2019s explanation for A.M.\u2019s presence at his residence as true \u2014 that he was merely providing shelter for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>girl, who apparently had an abusive home environment \u2014 we are asked to generously consider the argument that he was, at all times, acting as a \u201cgood citizen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b673 We conclude that what this argument lacks in merit, it makes up for with sheer banality. Namely, any \u201cgood citizen,\u201d under any reasonable definition of that term, who was truly concerned about such a girl\u2019s welfare would not allow her to routinely stay overnight in such an environment. The consequences of Therriault\u2019s choice \u2014 i.e., A.M.\u2019s undoubtedly humiliating discovery by officers on the night of his arrest, and the embarrassing questioning at her school and during her deposition \u2014 bear this out. In other words, it is simply ludicrous to argue that a genuinely concerned \u201cgood citizen\u201d would suggest to a 14-year-old girl from a troubled home that for her own safety she should take up residence at the home of a convicted sex offender, who is on probation and subject to random searches, and that this should be accomplished without the supervising probation officer\u2019s knowledge, or without even entertaining the possibility of any other more suitable living arrangements. In this instance, we know \u201cgood citizenship\u201d when we see it. Here, we have not.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b674  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it revoked Therriault\u2019s suspended sentence based on a violation of the \u201cgood citizenship\u201d condition of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b675 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b236-7\">JUSTICES HUNT, REGNIER and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b236-8\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"Ag33\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u00b676 I concur with the result of the maj ority opinion, but not all that is said therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
