He was sentenced to twenty years in the Montana State Prison with all twenty years suspended upon the condition that he pay restitution in the amount of $62,383.72. Pritchett appeals both the restitution order and the length of his sentence. We vacate the sentence and remand for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">\u00b62 On the night of October 1,1998, Pritchett entered the garage of his former employer, Kit Hunter (Hunter) in an attempt to return two hunting rifles he had stolen and pawned to support his gambling habit. At some point, Pritchett stumbled and dropped his flashlight. Unable to locate it in the dark, he lit his cigarette lighter. The flame ignited gas leaking from a nearby propane bottle, causing a large explosion and a fire that destroyed the garage and its contents. Pritchett, despite serious injuries sustained in the blast, fled the scene. Later, when he learned that the police were investigating him, Pritchett returned and confessed his involvement in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b63 Following Pritchett\u2019s guilty plea, the District Court scheduled a sentencing hearing and ordered the-local probation officer to prepare a Presentence Investigation Report (PSI) : On the question of restitution, the completed report noted the loss of the Hunters\u2019 garage and its contents and stated that \u201cthe total restitution to be paid by the Defendant is $63,569.25.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This amount included $15,000 for the garage and $48,569.25 for its contents. The report listed Pritchett\u2019s income as $1,000 per month \u2014 all derived from self employment as a carpenter. It provided no documentation or evidence to support these amounts. The PSI also did not include any documentation of Pritchett\u2019s current assets and liabilities or any estimates of his future ability to pay restitution. Noting that the amount of restitution was \u201cenormous,\u201d the probation/parole officer who prepared the PSI stated that: \u201cTo give the Defendant adequate time to pay off the restitution in this case the Officer recommends a twenty (20) year sentence to the Montana State Prison, with all of the time suspended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err in sentencing Pritchett to pay restitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">\u00b65 Pritchett argues \u00a7 46-18-242(1), MCA, specifically mandates that, prior to an order of restitution, a district court must order the probation officer to document the defendant\u2019s financial resources, future ability to pay restitution and the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss. While the District Court received some evidence of these amounts during its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>sentencing hearing, Pritchett asserts that this fact does not negate the specific mandate of \u00a7 46-18-242(1), MCA, and that, absent this documentation, the District Court had no authority to impose a sentence of restitution. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\u00b66 This Court reviews a criminal sentence for legality only. <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15. Thus, our review is confined to whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by statute. <em>Montoya, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b67  Sentencing courts are required to impose a sentence that includes payment of full restitution whenever they find that the victim of an offense has sustained a pecuniary loss. Section 46-18-201(5), MCA. However, this general mandate is subject to the detailed procedures and qualifications found in \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-241 to 249, MCA. District courts are not authorized to impose a sentence of restitution until all these additional statutory requirements are satisfied. <em>See State v. Hilgers, </em>1999 MT 284, \u00b6 8, 297 Mont. 23, \u00b6 8, 989 P.2d 866, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u00b68 Particularly relevant to the case at hand is the provision designed to ensure that restitution orders are based on documented evidence of the victim\u2019s loss and the offender\u2019s ability to pay. Section 46-18-242, MCA, provides;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-8\">(1) Whenever the court believes that a victim of the offense may have sustained a pecuniary loss as a result of the offense or whenever the prosecuting attorney requests, the court shall order the probation officer, restitution officer, or other designated person to include in the presentence investigation and report:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">(a) documentation of the offender\u2019s financial resources and future ability to pay restitution; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-10\">(b) documentation of the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">\u00b69 This provision requires that the PSI contain documentary evidence. <em>State v. Brown </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 223, 226, 867 P.2d 1098, 1100. In <em>Brown, </em>we held that a PSI containing only conclusory statements about amounts and no documentation regarding the defendant\u2019s future ability to pay restitution did not comply with \u00a7 46-18-242(1), MCA, and that, \u201cwithout the documentation required by the statute, a district court is unable to make a meaningful determination of the propriety or amount of a restitution provision in a sentence.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>263 Mont. at 227, 867 P.2d at 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\">\u00b610 The State, carefully extracting some wording from our holding in <em>Hilgers, </em>argues that failure to satisfy the statutory requirement for documentation does not invalidate a restitution order-so long as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>District Court, as it did in this case, holds a full evidentiary hearing on the amount of the pecuniary loss. The State\u2019s reliance on <em>Hilgers </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u00b6 11 In <em>Hilgers, </em>the PSI did not document the amount of the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss, the defendant\u2019s financial resources or his ability to pay restitution. We held that the failure to document pecuniary loss was not fatal because it was later documented at a full evidentiary hearing. <em>Hilgers, </em>\u00b6 9. However, in <em>Hilgers, </em>we based our holding on the existence of a plea agreement providing that, if the parties were unable to agree to the amount of restitution, the defendant would allow the court to make the determination. <em>Hilgers, </em>\u00b6 9. Unlike <em>Hilgers, </em>Pritchett made no plea agreement allowing the District Court to determine the amount of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b6 12 With regard to the other requirements of \u00a7 46-18-242, MCA, we went on to hold in <em>Hilgers </em>that \u201cthe absence of documentation on [Hilgers\u2019 financial resources and future ability to pay] as required under \u00a7 46-18-242(l)(a), MCA, renders the District Court\u2019s judgment illegal.\u201d <em>Hilgers, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u00b6 13  We conclude, therefore, as we did in <em>Brown </em>and <em>Hilgers, </em>that failure of the PSI to document the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss, Pritchett\u2019s financial resources, and his future ability to pay restitution, renders the District Court\u2019s judgment illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u00b614 In addition to documentation of the information required by \u00a7 46-18-242(1), MCA, a district court imposing a sentence of restitution is required to specify the amount, method and time of each payment to the victim. Section 46-18-244(1), MCA. In doing so, the court must consider the financial resources and future ability of the offender to pay. Section 46-18-244(2), MCA. Pritchett argues that the District Court failed to specify the amount, method and time of each payment he was to make to the victim and that this failure to comply with statutory requirements invalidates the court\u2019s restitution order. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">\u00b615 As stated above, the district court\u2019s authority to impose a sentence of restitution is limited by the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-241 through 249, MCA. Section 46-18-244, MCA, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">(1) The court shall specify the amount, method, and time of each payment to the victim and may permit payment in installments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK\">The District Court failed to comply with this requirement. Rather, it ordered that \u201cpayments on restitution are to be made... according to a schedule to be determined by his Probation Officer....\"</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>\u00b616  Section 46-18-244, MCA, clearly requires the court to specify the amount, method and time of payments. By leaving this determination to the discretion of the probation officer, the District Court failed to comply with the sentencing parameters provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">\u00b617 Did the District Court err when it used replacement cost instead of actual market value to determine the amount of restitution?</p>\n<p id=\"Ae\">\u00b618 Determination of the appropriate measure of restitution is a question of law. The standard of review of a district court\u2019s conclusions of law is whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon Co. v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\u00b619 Pritchett argues that, by law, the appropriate measure of the Hunters\u2019 pecuniary loss is the <em>market value </em>of their property at the time of its destruction. The Hunters, however, estimated the value of their lost property as the cost of replacing it with <em>new items at current prices. </em>Pritchett argues that, in adopting the Hunters\u2019 replacement valuation method, the District Court made an error of law that resulted in a significant over-statement of his restitution obligation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u00b620 Restitution is limited to the pecuniary loss resulting from the offense. Section 46-18-244(2), MCA. Pecuniary loss is defined by statute as \u201call special damages ... that a person could recover against the offender in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the offender\u2019s criminal activities.\u201d Section 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA. Pritchett argues, and the State seems to agree, that the appropriate civil action arising out of Pritchett\u2019s destruction of the Hunters\u2019 garage and its contents would be an action for conversion. The loss caused by the wrongful conversion of personal property is presumed to be the value of the property at the time of its conversion. Section 27-1-320(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u00b621 Both parties acknowledge that the Hunters lost a number of irreplaceable personal items with great sentimental value. However, during the sentencing hearing the State submitted, as evidence of the Hunters\u2019pecuniary <em>loss, </em>a specific and extensive list compiled by the Hunters for insurance purposes. The list included a description of each item destroyed in the fire along with its value. It is clear from a cursory review of the list and the transcript of the hearing that the value assigned by the Hunters for each item was the replacement cost for a new item:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Q. [Mr. Stufft - Pritchett\u2019s Attorney] When you prepared your list, you went and tried to find out what the new cost would be or the replacement value would be for the item; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-4\">A. [Kit Hunter] That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b622 The Hunters also listed, as part of their loss, the $15,000 replacement cost of the garage, despite testimony that it was valued for tax purposes at only $3,640. Except for the addition of $250 for an item left off the list and the deletion of some duplicated items, the District Court wholly adopted the list as a statement of the Hunters\u2019 pecuniary loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b623 The loss of the garage and its contents are certainly \u201cpecuniary losses\u201d for the purposes of determining restitution. However, in this case, the dollar value of that loss must be measured by the actual value of the property at the time the loss occurred. By adopting a valuation based on the cost of a new item-rather than the market value of the actual items prior to their destruction \u2014 the District Court may have significantly overstated the \u201cfull restitution\u201d that Pritchett must pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\u00b624  Where personal property is converted, restitution must be based on the market value of the goods converted. We hold that the District Court, in using the replacement cost of items destroyed, used an incorrect measure to determine the amount of Pritchett\u2019s restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">\u00b625 Did the District Court\u2019s sentence violate Pritchett\u2019s right to due process under Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">\u00b626 The District Court sentenced Pritchett to a suspended sentence of twenty years \u2014 the maximum allowable punishment for burglary. Pritchett contends that the court based the length of his sentence on the time it would take him to make restitution given his limited financial resources. He argues that, in basing his sentence on his indigency, the District Court violated his constitutional right to due process. We agree with both his factual analysis and his conclusion of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">\u00b627 Our review of constitutional questions is plenary. <em>State v. Anderson, </em>1998 MT 258, \u00b6 6, 291 Mont. 242, \u00b6 6, 967 P.2d 413, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">\u00b628 Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution provides that: \u201cNo person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\u201d We have previously considered the application of Montana\u2019s Due Process Clause in the context of a sentence of restitution based on indigency. <em>See State v. Farrell </em>(1984), 207 Mont. 483, 676 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>P.2d 168. In <em>Farrell, </em>we held that a criminal defendant\u2019s right to due process requires that \u201cindigency or poverty not be used as the touchstone for imposing the maximum allowable punishment.\u201d <em>Farrell, </em>207 Mont. at 499, 676 P.2d at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u00b629 In <em>Farrell, </em>the defendant was convicted of theft of public assistance funds and sentenced to ten years, all suspended. <em>Farrell, </em>207 Mont. at 487, 676 P.2d at 171. Among other things, suspension of the sentence was conditioned on payment of restitution. <em>Farrell, </em>207 Mont. at 487, 676 P.2d at 171. On appeal, the defendant challenged the constitutionality of the length of his sentence, alleging that he was only sentenced to the maximum time allowed by law because he was indigent. <em>Farrell, </em>207 Mont. at 493-94, 676 P.2d at 174-75. As evidence of the defendant\u2019s allegation, he set forth a colloquy in which the judge clearly indicated that he was sentencing the defendant to ten years because he did not think the defendant could pay the restitution in less than that amount of time. <em>Farrell, </em>207 Mont. at 494, 676 P.2d at 174. After discussing the application of the equal protection and due process clauses, this Court concluded \u2014 under a due process analysis \u2014 that it was arbitrary and unfair to subject a defendant to the maximum sentence simply because he may not be able to pay the restitution in'less than that amount of time. <em>Farrell, </em>207 Mont. at 498, 676 P.2d at 176-77. We ultimately vacated the defendant\u2019s ten-year suspended sentence and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b630 The question before us, then, is whether the District Court based Pritchett\u2019s sentence on the length of time he would need to pay restitution. We find substantial evidence in the record that it did. Our holding in <em>Farrell </em>clearly applies and the sentence must be overturned as a violation of Pritchett\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b631 Admittedly, the facts in this case are not so clear as they were in <em>Farrell. </em>Unlike the court <em>in Farrell, </em>the District Court never explicitly stated that the length of Pritchett\u2019s sentence was based on the amount of time he would need to pay restitution. In fact, as the State points out in its brief, the District Court stated that the sentence was based on Pritchett\u2019s juvenile record and the nature of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"At\">\u00b632 In the eighth grade Pritchett was charged with writing forged checks on his parents\u2019 account. Pritchett also reported a felony theft when he was sixteen that resulted in his placement at the Pine Hills School and Swan River Youth Forest Camp until the age of eighteen. In the twenty years between this juvenile theft and the present bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>glary conviction, Pritchett\u2019s only offense was a 1994 citation for failure to carry liability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b633 Even crediting Pritchett for this \u201cnot insignificant period of time as an adult\u201d during which he remained law-abiding, the District Court determined that a twenty-year sentence was appropriate because of Pritchett\u2019s failure to learn from his past mistakes and \u201cbecause of the position of trust he violated as a result of having committed this offense and of course the significant harm imposed as a result of his offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b634 We conclude that the \u201csignificant harm,\u201d cited by the District Court as the rationale for the sentence, was the pecuniary loss suffered by the Hunters. First, the PSI explicitly recommended a twenty-year suspended sentence so that the defendant would have enough time to pay restitution. The District Court adopted the length, conditions and restitution amount of this recommendation exactly as proposed by the probation officer. In addition, statements by the court during the sentencing hearing link the term of the sentence and Pritchett\u2019s ability to complete his restitution obligation. The District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">20 years is a long time and I think that the Hunters deserve for you to make every effort you can over that period of time to make them whole from this crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">Nobody is going to put you in prison for not being able to do that as long as you make your best effort, but that\u2019s what you owe to them and that\u2019s what you owe to the court and that\u2019s what you owe to the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">So it\u2019s the order of the court that the defendant be sentenced to Montana State Prison for a period of 20 years, with all of that time suspended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">\u00b635 We find that, while the District Court did not expressly state that it was sentencing Pritchett to the maximum term to provide sufficient time for him to pay the ordered restitution, there is sufficient evidence in the record to conclude that the length of the sentence was, nonetheless, based on Pritchett\u2019s indigency. .</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">\u00b636  While a reasonable suspended sentence coupled with full restitution is appropriate in this case, that fact does excuse the District Court\u2019s failure to comply with statutory requirements for imposing a sentence of restitution. Furthermore, the District Court\u2019s use of replacement value of property destroyed \u2014 rather than its actual market value at the time of the fire \u2014 to measure the Hunters\u2019 pecuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>ary loss is an error of law which may have significantly overstated Pritchett\u2019s restitution obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b637  Finally, we find that the District <em>Court </em>sentenced Pritchett to the maximum term allowed by law because, given his limited financial resources, no shorter time would allow him to pay the court-ordered restitution. We hold, as we did in <em>Farrell, </em>that, in basing the term of his prison sentence on the defendant\u2019s indigency, the District Court violated Pritchett\u2019s rights to due process under Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b638 Therefore, we vacate the District Court\u2019s Judgment and Sentence and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b38-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-9\">.
