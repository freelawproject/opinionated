We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether substantial credible evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict of zero damages on Magart\u2019s claim for lost earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">\u00b63 This case arose from an automobile accident which occurred when a vehicle driven by Gregg Schank (Schank) collided with Magart\u2019s vehicle at an intersection outside of Belgrade, Montana, on November 2,1996. Magart and his wife, who was a passenger in his vehicle, filed a complaint against Schank alleging that Schank negligently caused the accident which resulted in injuries to them and requesting a variety of damages. Schank admitted that he negligently caused the accident and the case proceeded to a jury trial on the issues of whether the accident was the proximate cause of the Magarts\u2019 injuries and damages. The jury found in favor of the Magarts on the proximate cause issue and awarded them damages for past and future medical expenses, past lost earnings, past and future pain and suffering, and loss of established course of life. The jury awarded Magart zero damages on his claim for lost earning capacity. Magart appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">\u00b64 We review a jury\u2019s verdict to determine whether there is substantial credible evidence in the record to support it. <em>Barnes v. United Industry, Inc. </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 25, 33, 909 P.2d 700, 705. It is not our function to agree or disagree with the jury\u2019s verdict and, consequently, if conflicting evidence exists, we do not retry the case because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the jury chose to believe one party over the other. <em>Barnes, </em>275 Mont. at 33, 909 P.2d at 705. It is only in rare cases that a jury verdict should be set aside. <em>Tappan v. Higgins </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 158, 160, 783 P.2d 396, 397. Moreover, in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict, we review the evidence in a light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Morgan v. Great Falls School Dist. No. </em>1, 2000 MT 28, \u00b6 8, 298 Mont. 194, \u00b6 8, 995 P.2d 422, \u00b6 8 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b65 Does substantial credible evidence support the jury\u2019s verdict of zero damages on Magart\u2019s claim for lost earning capacity?</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b66 At the time of the accident in November of 1996, Magart was employed as a concrete truck driver with Kenyon Noble Ready Mix Company (Kenyon Noble). His job entailed driving concrete mixer trucks to locations where concrete was to be poured and lifting metal chutes off of \u2014 and reattaching them to \u2014 the truck to pour the concrete. In the spring of 1998, Magart quit Kenyon Noble and went to work for D\u2019Agostino Concrete doing the same type of work. Later in 1998, he began working for Door Tech installing residential and commercial garage doors; the work included overhead work such as lifting and carrying garage door panels and winding door springs. Magart was still working for Door Tech at the time of trial in May of 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u00b67 Magart contended at trial that, as a result of the accident, he sustained injuries to his neck, upper back and right shoulder. He further contended that his shoulder injury impaired his ability to work in both his previous employment driving a cement truck and his current employment installing commercial and residential garage doors because the injury makes it difficult to do the overhead lifting which is required in these jobs. Accordingly, he requested an award of damages for future loss of earning capacity. The jury found that Magart had been injured as a result of the accident and awarded him damages for his other claims, but awarded zero damages for his lost earning capacity claim. Magart asserts generally that this portion of the jury\u2019s verdict is not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, he argues the jury was required to find that he suffered a loss of earning capacity because the uncontroverted testimony at trial established that he suffered continuing shoulder problems due to his job duties and that he would be unable to continue his employment as either a cement truck driver or garage door installer as a result of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u00b68 Following the accident, Magart sought treatment from Dr. Ronald Hecht (Hecht), a chiropractor, and Dr. James Weiss (Weiss), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>medical doctor, for pain in his neck and upper back. Weiss referred Magart to Steve Anderson (Anderson), a physical therapist, who assessed Magart as having a shoulder impingement problem in addition to soft tissue strain in his neck and back. Thereafter, Magart\u2019s physical therapy sessions with Anderson focused on treating his shoulder problem. Magart subsequently was referred to Dr. John Campbell (Campbell), an orthopedic surgeon, who operated on Magart\u2019s shoulder. Gary Lusin (Lusin), a physical therapist, later performed a functional capacities evaluation (FCE) to determine Magart\u2019s abilities and limitations relative to his shoulder injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b69 At trial, Magart presented expert testimony from Anderson, Campbell and Lusin regarding his shoulder injury. Magart contends these expert witnesses testified unanimously that the condition of his shoulder would gradually deteriorate if he continued in employment which entails overhead lifting, such as driving a cement truck or installing garage doors, and that he must abandon all manual work which requires overhead lifting. He further contends that the expert testimony was uncontradicted and, as a result, could not be disregarded by the jury. Thus, according to Magart, the jury was required to find, based on the expert testimony, that he suffered a loss of earning capacity because he cannot continue working in his current or past employment. He cites <em>Tappan </em>in support of his argument that a jury verdict awarding no damages for loss of future earning capacity must be set aside where there is uncontradicted medical testimony that a plaintiff cannot continue working in his or her occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"AqV\">\u00b610  A jury may not disregard uncontradicted, credible nonopinion evidence. <em>Thompson v. City of Bozeman </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 440, 443, 945 P.2d 48, 50 (citations omitted). This general rule, however, applies only to nonopinion lay witness testimony. Expert testimony is opinion evidence which a jury is entitled to disregard if it finds the testimony unpersuasive. <em>See Barnes, </em>275 Mont. at 33-34, 909 P.2d at <em>705; Holenstein v. Andrews </em>(1975), 166 Mont. 60, 65, 530 P.2d 476, 479; <em>Putman v. Pollei </em>(1969), 153 Mont. 406, 411, 457 P.2d 776, 779. The District Court instructed the jury that it was not bound by the expert testimony and should give the testimony the weight, if any, to which the jury deemed it entitled. Consequently, and contrary to Magart\u2019s contention, the jury was entitled to disregard the testimony of Magart\u2019s expert witnesses regardless of whether the testimony was directly controverted by Schank. <em>See Holenstein, </em>166 Mont. at 65, 530 P.2d at 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u00b611 Moreover, the expert testimony was not as conclusive as Magart contends. For example, he asserts Campbell testified that Magart\u2019s shoulder would definitely deteriorate if he continued performing the overhead lifting required by his past and current employment and that Magart must discontinue such employment. Campbell actually testified, however, that the overhead lifting involved in the cement and door installation jobs only \u201cincreases the risk\u201d that Magart\u2019s shoulder condition would deteriorate over time and that it might be \u201cadvisable\u201d for Magart to change jobs. Additionally, while Lusin testified that Magart\u2019s past and current jobs were not appropriate, his written FCE report states that Magart\u2019s job as a garage door installer was acceptable. As a result, this case is distinguishable from <em>Tappan </em>where the expert testimony unequivocally established that the plaintiff was permanently excluded from working in her previous employment as a baker. <em>See Tappan, </em>240 Mont. at 162, 783 P.2d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b612 Furthermore, the District Court instructed the jury that it was \u201cpermitted to award compensation only for future loss or harm which is reasonably certain to occur.\u201d Reviewing the expert testimony in the light most favorable to Schank, as we must, we conclude the jury could reasonably have determined that future deterioration of Magart\u2019s shoulder, together with a concomitant inability to perform his job, was not reasonably certain to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b613 Magart also argues that lay witness testimony established his shoulder injury has impaired his ability to perform his past and current jobs and required the jury to find his earning capacity has been diminished. Specifically, he refers to his own testimony that his shoulder injury has affected his ability to do both his past and current jobs, as well as the testimony of Morgan Taylor (Taylor), a co-worker of Magart\u2019s at Door Tech, that Magart has difficulty and appears to be in pain when performing some job tasks. Magart asserts that, because this testimony was uncontroverted, the jury could not disregard it and, consequently, the verdict of zero damages for loss of earning capacity is contrary to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u00b614 Brian Cey (Cey) and Mark D\u2019Agostino (D\u2019Agostino), Magart\u2019s supervisors at Kenyon Noble and D\u2019Agostino Concrete, both testified regarding Magart\u2019s employment as a cement truck driver after the accident. Cey testified that Magart was placed on light duty at work for only a short period of time following the accident and the overhead lifting was only a small part of Magart\u2019s duties. Cey also testified Magart quit working for Kenyon Noble because he had found another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>job, not because his shoulder injury made it difficult or impossible to do the work. D\u2019Agostino testified he was unaware of Magart having any difficulty performing his cement truck driver duties, that Magart had never requested any special accommodation to make the work easier on his shoulder and that Magart quit working for D\u2019Agostino Concrete because he found another job. This evidence controverts Magart\u2019s testimony that he had difficulty doing his job driving a cement truck, is sufficient for the jury to have found that Magart\u2019s shoulder injury did not impair his ability to perform that job and supports the jury\u2019s verdict of zero damages for loss of earning capacity with regard to Magart\u2019s past employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b615  With regard to Magart\u2019s current employment with Door Tech, Schank did not present any testimony contradicting Magart and Taylor\u2019s testimony that Magart experienced pain and difficulty doing his job. As stated above, a jury generally may not disregard uncontradicted, credible nonopinion evidence. <em>Thompson, </em>284 Mont. at 443, 945 P.2d at 50. However, \u201cthis does not mean that where there is direct testimony in the record, uncontradicted by other direct testimony, that the court or jury is bound thereby or cannot render a decision contrary to such direct testimony.\u201d <em>Holenstein, </em>166 Mont. at 66, 530 P.2d at 479. A jury is entitled to weigh the testimony against adverse circumstantial evidence and other factors which may affect the credibility of the witness. <em>Holenstein, </em>166 Mont. at 66-67, 530 P.2d at 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b6 16 In response to Magart\u2019s claim that his shoulder injury impaired his ability to perform his job with Door Tech, Schank presented a 23-minute videotape showing Magart at work unloading garage door sections from a truck, carrying tools and doing overhead work. Magart appears to be working in a normal manner with no apparent difficulties. The jury reasonably could have determined the videotape impeached Magart and Taylor\u2019s credibility and constituted substantial evidence that his shoulder injury did not impair Magart\u2019s ability to perform the Door Tech job. As a result, we conclude there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict that Magart\u2019s ability to work in his present employment was not impaired by his shoulder injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b617  We hold that, when viewed in the light most favorable to Schank, substantial credible evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict of zero damages on Magart\u2019s claim for lost earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b184-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
