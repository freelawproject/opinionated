The prosecution later added counts of sexual assault, attempted sexual assault, and an alternative deliberate homicide charge pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA (the felony murder statute). Hill pled not guilty to all charges. The jury found Hill guilty of deliberate homicide and not guilty of the remaining charges. Hill appeals from his conviction. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">\u00b62 Hill presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">\u00b63 (1) Did the District Court err when it denied Hill\u2019s motion for a pretrial psychological evaluation?</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">\u00b64 (2) Did the District Court err when it denied Hill\u2019s motion for a psychological autopsy of the victim?</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">\u00b65 (3) Did the District Court err when it denied the motion to suppress videotapes of Hill\u2019s statement to Ravalli County officers?</p>\n<p id=\"b445-16\">\u00b66 (4) Did the District Court err when it denied Hill\u2019s motion for a poll conducted at state expense and for change of venue?</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>\u00b67 (5) Did the Ravalli County Attorney commit prosecutorial misconduct by disseminating information to the public despite a Justice Court order prohibiting further disclosure?</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b68 On the morning of June 30,1996, Scott Camper found the body of his mother, Laurel Camper, in her bedroom in Hamilton, Montana. Ravalli County Sheriff\u2019s Detective Sterling Maus arrived shortly thereafter and observed Laurel lying facedown on her bed. Scott Camper told Detective Maus that his sister, Christine Dunaway, and her boyfriend, the Defendant Kippy Joe Hill, had been living with Laurel since December and that \u201cthings had been a little bit tense.\u201d Scott Camper told Maus that Dunaway and Hill probably had an argument with Laurel the night before and that the argument probably caused his mother\u2019s death. After an examination, Maus decided to remove the body to the Montana State Crime Lab in Missoula for an autopsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u00b69 Dr. Gary Dale, the State Medical Examiner, telephoned Maus later that afternoon. Dr. Dale told Maus that Laurel\u2019s death looked suspicious. Maus returned to Laurel\u2019s house at 322 Doran Lane to secure the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u00b610 At approximately 4:50 p.m. on June 30, Hill arrived at the Doran Lane residence. Hill informed Maus that he had been at Laurel\u2019s house the previous evening from 8:00 to 9:30 p.m., but that he and Dunaway spent the night at the Hamilton residence of Dunaway\u2019s father and Laurel\u2019s exhusband, Dave Camper.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">\u00b611 Detective Ed Zerbst went to Dave Camper\u2019s house later that evening to interview Hill and Dunaway. After consenting to a search of Dave Camper\u2019s house, Hill and Dunaway agreed to return to the sheriff\u2019s office for the interview. During the interview, which was videotaped, Hill denied seeing Laurel during the previous da}'.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">\u00b612 On July 4,1996, officers took hair samples from several members of Laurel\u2019s family, including Hill. While at the police station, Hill approached Zerbst and admitted that he had been at Laurel\u2019s house on the evening of June 29, but that he avoided a confrontation by remaining in his bedroom until Laurel was asleep. When asked why he did not initially tell the truth about being at Laurel\u2019s house, Hill said he was scared it might sound bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">\u00b613 On July 10,1996, the forensic laboratory informed the detectives that pubic hairs found on Laurel appeared to match, samples taken from Hill. Detectives videotaped an interview with Hill on July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>16, 1996. Prior to the interview, Zerbst advised Hill of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Hill then voluntarily signed a <em>Miranda </em>waiver form provided by Zerbst. At various points during the interview, Hill asked if he could see his children and Dunaway. He also said that he needed \u201csome air, or something, man, some water....\u201d At no time, however, did Hill request an attorney or otherwise indicate his desire to terminate the interrogation. Hill was arrested for deliberate homicide and handcuffed. Sheriff Jay Printz continued the interview and Hill eventually admitted having a physical altercation with Laurel but claimed that she was alive when he left the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u00b614 The State filed a Complaint in Ravalli County Justice Court on July 16,1996. The Complaint accused Hill of deliberate homicide pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA. Following Hill\u2019s arrest, area newspapers reported that Hill had confessed to the homicide and that Laurel was possibly the victim of sexual assault. Hill made an initial appearance with court appointed counsel before Ravalli County Justice of the Peace Edward Sperry on July 17,1996. On July 18,1996, the Justice Court granted Hill\u2019s motion to \u201climit the dissemination of factual and evidentiary information\u201d to the public and the press.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b615 On August 6, 1996, the State filed an Information in the Twenty-First Judicial District Court charging Hill with deliberate homicide pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA. In light of the extensive press coverage, the District Court filed a restrictive order on August 16, 1996 which superseded the Justice Court\u2019s earlier restrictive order. The District Court order prohibited further dissemination of information about the case. This Court reversed the District Court order with a writ of supervisory control based in part on the \u201cright to know\u201d provision in Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution. <em>See State ex rel. The Missoulian v. Montana Twenty-First Jud. Dist. Ct. </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 285, 933 P.2d 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u00b616 On April 25, 1997, the Ravalli County Attorney filed an Amended Information, adding counts of sexual assault, or, alternatively, attempted sexual assault. A Second Amended Information was filed on June 26,1997. The Second Amended Information added an alternative deliberate homicide charge pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA, alleging that the homicide occurred during a sexual or attempted sexual assault; both felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">\u00b617 Hill filed a Motion for State Funds for Psychological Evaluation and a Motion for State Funds to Employ Expert for Post-Mortem Psychological Autopsy on November 12,1996. Hill moved for a change of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>venue and state funding for a poll to establish possible jury prejudice. Hill also moved to suppress the videotaped admission obtained by Ravalli County law enforcement officers during questioning on July 16, 1996. The District Court denied all of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b618 Hill pled not guilty to all counts. On October 29,1997, the jury convicted Hill of deliberate homicide but returned not guilty verdicts on the sexual assault and attempted sexual assault counts. The District Court sentenced Hill to 100 years at the Montana State Prison, with a minimum of 25 years and conditional parole eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b619 Hill now appeals the District Court orders which denied his motions for a psychological evaluation and psychological autopsy. He further appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress his videotaped statements and the denial of his motion for change of venue and state-funded poll. Finally, Hill alleges that the Ravalli County Attorney committed prosecutorial misconduct by disclosing facts not previously known to the public while the Justice Court gag order was still in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AbI\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"AjQ\">\u00b620  Did the District Court err when it denied Hill\u2019s motion for a pretrial psychological evaluation?</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">\u00b621 Motions requesting an examination by a psychiatrist where the existence of a mental disease or defect is not at issue fall within the discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Cox, </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 110, 117-18, 879 P.2d 662, 666-67. We review discretionary trial court rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>May v. First Nat\u2019l Pawn Brokers, Ltd. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 132, 134, 890 P.2d 386, 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">\u00b622 Hill contends that the District Court erred when it denied his motion for a pretrial psychological examination. Hill argues that the District Court\u2019s order amounted to a denial of due process. In support of this argument, Hill cites the following rule established by the United States Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">[WJhen a defendant demonstrates to the trial judge that his sanity at the time of the offense is to be a significant factor at trial, the State must, at a minimum, assure the defendant access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">Ake <em>v. Oklahoma </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 68, 83, 105 S. Ct. 1087, 1096, 84 L. Ed. 2d 53, 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Hill also relies on \u00a7 46-14-205, MCA, which, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\">If either the defendant or the prosecution wishes the defendant to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist or licensed clinical psychologist ... to determine the defendant\u2019s fitness to proceed or whether the defendant had, at the time the offense was committed, a particular state of mind that is an essential element of the offense, the examiner shall be permitted to have reasonable access to the defendant for the purpose of the examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b623 Hill concludes that the quoted language entitled him to a psychological evaluation as part of the affirmative defense of mitigated deliberate homicide pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-103(1), MCA, which permits the defendant to introduce evidence of extreme mental or emotional stress for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse. However, the State\u2019s duty to provide meaningful assistance to indigent defendants does not encompass every conceivable defense strategy. Rather, the right to a psychological evaluation is a limited one and is invoked only when the defendant\u2019s mental state has been placed directly at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b624  Hill does not enjoy a statutory right to the appointment of a psychiatrist absent a preliminary showing of mental disease or defect. <em>See Cox, </em>266 Mont. at 117-18, 879 P.2d at 666-67. In those limited instances where the defendant\u2019s mental state is directly at issue, \u00a7 46-14-202, MCA, grants the defendant a statutory right to psychological evaluation by a qualified psychiatrist appointed by the district court. Likewise, the statute cited by Hill, \u00a7 46-14-205, MCA, applies only after the defendant\u2019s mental state is at issue. Significantly, both \u00a7\u00a7 46-14-202 and -205 are found in a section of the code entitled \u201cProcedure When Mental Disease or Defect an Issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u00b625 Hill\u2019s reliance on <em>Ake </em>is similarly misplaced. The Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ake </em>applies only upon a preliminary showing that the defendant\u2019s sanity will be an issue at trial. <em>Ake, </em>470 U.S. at 74, 105 S. Ct. at 1091-92, 84 L. Ed. 2d at 60. Federal courts have consistently recognized that <em>Ake </em>does not require that an indigent defendant be afforded a psychological expert on request. \u201c[A] defendant satisfies the threshold requirement of <em>Ake </em>only when he has made a factual showing sufficient to give the trial court reasonable ground to doubt his sanity at the time of the offense.\u201d <em>Williams v. Collins </em>(5th Cir. 1993), 989 F.2d 841, 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\u00b626  Hill did not place his mental condition directly at issue. In his Motion for State Funds for Psychological Evaluation, Hill argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>[T]he defendant\u2019s mental state in regard to offering a defense of mental disease or defect <em>will not be at issue in this case </em>because the defense will be challenging the admissibility of admissions made by the Defendant. In order to challenge such evidence, the Defense will need to show that Kippy Joe Hill is below average intelligence, that he is easily influenced by others, especially authoritative figures, that he wishes to please others and is easily led to admissions even if he did not commit an act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Hill was charged with deliberate homicide and the State bore the initial burden of proving that Hill acted purposely or knowingly pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA. The right to a psychological examination found in \u00a7\u00a7 46-14-202 and -205 did not apply because Hill did not argue that the existence of a mental disease or defect precluded him from forming the requisite mental state of purposely or knowingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b627 Hill further contends that \u201c[t]he Court in <em>Park </em>implied that raising the defense of mitigated deliberate homicide entitled the defendant to a psychological evaluation.\u201d <em>See Park v. Sixth Judicial District Court, </em>1998 MT 164, 289 Mont. 367, 961 P.2d 1267. We disagree. Our holding in <em>Park </em>did not recognize the right to a psychological examination for defendants who raise the affirmative defense of mitigated deliberate homicide. Rather, <em>Park </em>addressed the unrelated issue of whether the State was entitled to a psychological examination by its own expert in order to rebut psychological evidence offered by the defendant in support of a mitigated deliberate homicide defense. <em>Park, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\u00b628 We have previously found the exclusion of psychological testimony to be a violation of due process and held that psychological testimony is admissible to prove or disprove the state of mind of a defendant charged with deliberate homicide. <em>State v. Fish </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 461, 471-72, 621 P.2d 1072, 1078. <em>Fish, </em>however, concerned the admissibility of psychological evidence previously gathered at the initiative of the defendant, not the antecedent question of whether the State must appoint an expert to assist in the preparation of such testimony. Where, as here, the defendant has failed to place mental state directly at issue by alleging the existence of a mental disease or defect, the right to appointment of a psychiatrist outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 46-14-202 and -205 does not attach. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Hill\u2019s Motion for State Funds for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Psychological Evaluation. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court. However, by doing so we do not mean to infer that trial courts may never exercise discretion to provide funds for a psychological examination except when required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b629 Did the District Court err when it denied Hill\u2019s motion for a psychological autopsy of the victim?</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u00b630 Hill appeals the denial of his motion for state funds to employ an expert to conduct a post-mortem psychological autopsy. We review discretionary trial court rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>May, </em>270 Mont. at 134, 890 P.2d at 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u00b631 Hill requested state funds to employ Dr. Robert Shea, a certified psychologist, in the preparation of a \u201cPost-Mortem Psychological Autopsy\u201d of the victim. Hill argued that such an evaluation was necessary \u201cfor the purpose of establishing the existence of mitigating factors in the causation of her death.\u201d As part of Hill\u2019s contention that any homicide was mitigated deliberate or negligent homicide, Hill sought to portray Laurel as a confrontational woman who constantly badgered and berated him. Hill claimed that Dr. Shea could offer an expert opinion based on Laurel\u2019s writings, past counseling, and interviews with family and friends. Ultimately, Hill hoped to demonstrate that Laurel\u2019s confrontational nature, when \u201cjuxtaposed to the mental capacity of the defendant,\u201d would support a finding of mitigated deliberate homicide or negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\u00b632 Hill does not enjoy a statutory right to state funds for a psychological autopsy. The issue here, much like the issue discussed in the preceding section, is whether the State must provide financial assistance to an indigent defendant who wishes to present mitigating evidence. For the same reasons set forth above, the decision fell within the discretion of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">\u00b633 Much of Hill\u2019s brief on this issue deals with the scientific validity of the post-mortem psychological autopsy. Even assuming the scientific validity of the method, however, Hill does not demonstrate the relevance of his proposed psychological analysis. Mitigated deliberate homicide is an affirmative defense which allows the defendant to demonstrate the influence of extreme mental or emotional stress for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse. Section 45-5-103(2), MCA. The reasonableness of the explanation or excuse must be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the actor\u2019s situation. Section 45-5-103(1), MCA. Therefore, the focus of the mitigated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>deliberate homicide statute is on the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>mental state at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b634 However, the requested psychological autopsy of the <em>victim </em>is unrelated to Hill\u2019s mental state. Relevant evidence is any evidence having a tendency to make the existence of any important fact more or less probable. Rule 401, M.R.Evid. The psychological profile of Laurel Camper is not directly relevant to Hill\u2019s attempt to establish the existence of extreme mental or emotional stress in conjunction with a mitigated deliberate homicide defense. Consequently, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the psychological autopsy would not make any issue in this matter more or less probable.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b635  Moreover, the evidence Hill sought to elicit did not require expert interpretation. To be admissible, expert testimony must assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue. Rule 702, M.R.Evid. Hill wanted to prove mitigation by illustrating Laurel\u2019s psychological makeup. Even without the requested psychological autopsy, the record contains numerous references to the victim\u2019s personality. The State did not offer evidence to contradict Hill\u2019s depiction of her behavior on the night of her death. Most importantly, there was no indication that Hill\u2019s depiction of Laurel\u2019s personality was beyond the understanding of the average juror. Hill presented evidence and the jury interpreted that evidence based on everyday life experiences, which include exposure to quarrelsome people. Therefore, expert testimony was not required to assist the jury\u2019s understanding of the victim\u2019s psychological profile and its effect on Hill\u2019s mental state at the time of the homicide. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Hill\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">\u00b636 Did the District Court err when it denied the motion to suppress videotapes of Hill\u2019s statement to Ravalli County officers?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">\u00b637 Hill challenges the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the videotaped admission taken by Ravalli County officers on July 16,1996. We have recognized that \u201cwhen a defendant raises the question of voluntariness, the State must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the confession or admission was voluntarily obtained.\u201d <em>State v. Mayes </em>(1992), 251 Mont. 358, 376, 825 P.2d 1196, 1208; \u00a7 46-13-301(2), MCA. The question of whether a defendant has given a voluntary confession \u201cis largely a factual determination that is within the discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>State v. Grey </em>(1995), 274 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Mont. 206, 209, 907 P.2d 951, 953. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Parker, </em>1998 MT 6, \u00b6 17, 287 Mont. 151, \u00b6 17, 953 P.2d 692, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b638 Hill challenges the voluntariness of his confession based on insufficient <em>Miranda </em>warnings and the coercive tactics of the interviewing officers. Hill admits that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given and that he signed a waiver form prior to the interview with Detective Zerbst on July 16,1996. However, Hill now argues that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were inadequate in several respects. Hill argues that the demeanor of the officers was misleading; that he was not put on notice that he was considered a suspect; that there was insufficient discussion of his constitutional rights; that the officers used coercive tactics; that Hill\u2019s repeated attempts to terminate the interview were ignored; and that he lacked the mental capacity to knowingly waive his rights. For these reasons, he contends that the videotaped confession should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b639  Prior to any questioning during a custodial interrogation, the subject must be informed of the right to remain silent, that any statement he makes may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed. <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 1612, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 707. An individual may waive these Fifth Amendment rights only if the waiver has been made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S. Ct. at 1612, 16 L. Ed. 2d at 707; See <em>also State v. Allies </em>(1979), 186 Mont. 99, 109, 606 P.2d 1043, 1049. The question of voluntariness depends on the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Lenon </em>(1977), 174 Mont. 264, 271, 570 P.2d 901, 906. In determining whether a confession is voluntary under the totality of circumstances test, courts consider the characteristics of the defendant and what transpired during the interview. <em>State v. Hermes </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 446, 449, 904 P.2d 587, 589. The following factors, among others, are considered as part of the totality of circumstances analysis: the defendant\u2019s age and level of education; the interrogation technique and whether the defendant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights; the defendant\u2019s prior experience with the criminal justice system and police interrogation; and the defendant\u2019s background and experience. <em>Hermes, </em>273 Mont. at 450, 904 P.2d at 589. These are the same factors discussed by Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>\u00b640 Hill received Miranda warnings prior to his interview with Detective Zerbst and Sheriff Jay Printz on July 16,1996. The record contains the following exchange between Zerbst and Hill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">Zerbst: Ok? so, I, ah, got a couple of Rights forms here, and we\u2019ll go ahead and do that quickly. I\u2019m gonna do this, I\u2019ll just let you read along with me there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">Hill: Ok. Alright.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">Zerbst: Alright, there\u2019s a spot for your initials on each one of those. Ok? Basically if you want to read along with me, it says: \u201cI know that I have the right to remain silent... and if I give up the right to remain silent anything I say can and will be used against me in a court of law. That I have the right to talk to a lawyer and have a lawyer present while I\u2019m being questioned. And if I cannot afford to hire a lawyer one will be appointed to represent me free of any cost to me. That I can decide at any time to exercise these rights and not answer any questions or make any statements and no one has threatened or mistreated me either by word or act to make me answer any questions or make any statements. No one gave, offered, or promised me anything whatsoever to answer any questions or make any statements. And I understand each of these rights and I have read this Warning and Waiver or had it read to me.\u201d Which we did both of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">Hill: Ok.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">Zerbst: \u201cI understand and know what I am doing and I am willing to answer these questions and make a statement.\u201d And if that\u2019s your wish go ahead and sign right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">Hill: There you go.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">The \u201cvoluntary statement Miranda warning waiver\u201d form appears in the record complete with Hill\u2019s initials by each statement of rights and signed by Hill at the bottom.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">\u00b641 Hill contends that the warnings issued by Zerbst were ineffectual. He claims that Zerbst\u2019s cavalier demeanor belied the serious nature of the interview and misled him to think he was not a suspect. Hill further argues that his low intelligence negated a voluntary waiver of his Fifth Amendment rights because he did not understand what he was doing. Hill relies on <em>State v. Allies </em>(1979), 186 Mont. 99, 606 P.2d 1043 to support his argument that the officers utilized coercive tactics.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">\u00b642 We consider the following facts relevant to the totality of circumstances test. Hill was found to have slightly below-average intel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>ligence. However, the videotape Hill seeks to suppress shows Hill acting in a responsive and coherent manner. The trial transcript of his cross-examination by the prosecutor demonstrates that Hill was fully capable of understanding questions and formulating answers. We find no support for Hill\u2019s contention that his level of intelligence prevented him from understanding his <em>Miranda </em>rights and effectuating a waiver of those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b643 Nor were the interrogation techniques utilized by the officers at the July 16,1996 interview overly coercive. In <em>Allies, </em>we threw out a confession that resulted from coercive interrogation techniques. However, comparison of the interview tactics used by the officers in <em>Allies </em>to the tactics used in this case leads us to conclude that <em>Allies </em>does not support Hill\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b644 Hill\u2019s interview with Ravalli County officers differs in almost every respect from the interview in <em>Allies. </em>Hill knew from the beginning that he was a suspect. Detectives interviewed Hill at the police station on the day Laurel\u2019s body was discovered. Hill subsequently changed his initial statement in order to deflect suspicion when he returned to the police station on July 4 to have hair samples taken. \u00b645 Hill received adequate <em>Miranda </em>warnings immediately prior to the interview in question and indicated that he understood his rights by signing a waiver form. Hill appeared fully coherent throughout the videotape and stated that he was not under the influence of any intoxicants. Detective Zerbst did not mislead Hill about the evidence against him. Rather, Zerbst confronted Hill with physical evidence and asked him to explain the presence of his pubic hair on the body of the victim. Sheriff Printz and Detective Zerbst appealed to Hill\u2019s morality in asking for an admission but did not promise or threaten any particular treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b646 Hill did not request an attorney at any time during the interview. The expression of his desire to see his wife and children does not amount to a request for counsel. This Court has held that a request to \u201ctalk to someone\u201d is equivalent to asking for an attorney. <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 503, 514, 719 P.2d 1248, 1255. However, in the context of Hill\u2019s interview it does not appear that his request to see Christine and his young children was motivated by the desire to receive legal advice. Furthermore, Hill did not specifically request that the interview terminate. When he asked to see Christine, he was informed that she was present at the station, though he was not per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>mitted to see her immediately. When he asked for water, the detectives brought him water within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b647 Finally, Hill had some prior experience with the police. Although his prior convictions were all misdemeanors, Hill had at least minimal exposure to the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b648  Considering the factors set forth in <em>Hermes, </em>we conclude that the totality of circumstances surrounding Hill\u2019s July 16,1996 interview demonstrate the voluntariness of Hill\u2019s videotaped statement. The State met the burden of establishing the voluntariness of Hill\u2019s statement when it provided compelling evidence that Hill received his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to the interview and waived those rights. Consequently, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Hill\u2019s motion to suppress his videotaped statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">\u00b649 Did the District Court err when it denied Hill\u2019s motion for a poll conducted at state expense and for change of venue?</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">\u00b650 Hill challenges the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for change of venue and state funds to conduct an opinion poll in support of the motion. This Court will reverse a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for change of venue only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Moore </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 20, 51, 885 P.2d 457, 477, <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Gollehon </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 116, 122, 906 P.2d 697, 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">\u00b651  Change of venue is permitted when \u201cthere exists in the county in which the charge is pending such prejudice that a fair trial cannot be had in the county.\u201d Section 46-13-203(1), MCA. The standard for change of venue is whether there is a reasonable apprehension that the defendant cannot receive a fair trial. <em>State v. Brandon </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 231, 246, 870 P.2d 734, 743. Motions for change of venue based on adverse publicity must demonstrate: (1) that the news reports were inflammatory; and (2) that the news reports actually inflamed the prejudice of the community to an extent that a reasonable possibility exists that the defendant may not receive a fair trial. <em>Moore, </em>268 Mont. at 52, 885 P.2d at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">\u00b652 Hill based his motion for change of venue on the extensive press coverage of the homicide in Ravalli County and the surrounding area. Hill emphasized the prejudicial effect of Sheriff Printz\u2019s reference to Hill\u2019s statement as a \u201cconfession\u201d in local newspapers. Hill also requested state funds to support his motion for change of venue, argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>ing that the burden of demonstrating prejudice sufficient to preclude a fair trial necessitated an opinion poll in Ravalli County.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b653 We conclude that Hill failed to satisfy both prongs of the test outlined in <em>Moore. </em>The record contains numerous newspaper articles, all of which seem to report the facts of the case with reasonable accuracy. We therefore agree with the trial court\u2019s assessment that \u201cmedia coverage has been factual, there has been little if any editorializing or sensationalism, and the factual error concerning the alleged \u2018confession\u2019 is a stale story that the newspaper has not recently repeated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AlY\">\u00b654 As for the second prong of the <em>Moore </em>test, Hill failed to demonstrate that extensive press coverage resulted in actual prejudice in the community. In a criminal prosecution, the state as well as the accused enjoys a right to examine potential jurors on voir dire in order to select a jury able to judge the facts in issue without bias, prejudice, or partiality. 47 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Jury </em>\u00a7 189 (1995). We have supported the voir dire process as the most economical and logical way to determine whether an impartial jury can be found within the disputed venue. <em>See, e.g., State v. Nichols </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 438, 444-46, 734 P.2d 170, 173-75; <em>State v. Miller </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 497, 506-07, 757 P.2d 1275, 1281. Our determination that Hill failed to establish actual prejudice is supported by the fact that during jury selection defense counsel challenged only one potential juror for cause, and that juror had known the victim. Therefore, despite numerous questions concerning the prejudicial effect of media coverage during examination of the jurors, defense counsel did not encounter widespread prejudice among the potential jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b655 Hill made his motion for change of venue prior to trial and juror examination. A motion for change of venue may be granted prior to voir dire when the facts indicate inherent prejudice. <em>State ex rel. Coburn v. Bennet </em>(1982), 202 Mont. 20, 655 P.2d 502. In <em>Coburn, </em>the facts that indicated inherent prejudice against the defendant were angry citizens marching on the courthouse, public meetings, vandalism, and extrajudicial statements in the newspaper by county officials. <em>Coburn, </em>202 Mont. at 30, 655 P.2d at 507. In stark contrast, the record here is devoid of any indicia of actual prejudice against Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayh\">\u00b656  Hill argues that his motion for change of venue necessitated an opinion poll conducted with state funds. However, Hill cites no authority for the proposition that allegations of prejudice as a basis for change of venue require the dispersal of state funds by a district court. Hill did not establish the inflammatory nature of media cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>age, nor did he provide a factual basis for his contention that the community was so prejudiced that a fair trial was impossible. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Hill\u2019s motions for a state-funded poll and for change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">ISSUE 5</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b657 Did the Ravalli County Attorney commit prosecutorial misconduct by disseminating information to the public despite a Justice Court order prohibiting further disclosure?</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b658 Hill claims that the Ravalli County Attorney deliberately included facts not previously known to the public in support of the Amended Informations filed in the District Court. Hill argues that the County Attorney included prejudicial and unnecessary facts in his affidavit despite the Justice Court\u2019s order prohibiting such disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\u00b659 Hill does not present an issue subject to review by this Court because he did not request relief on this basis in the District Court. Furthermore, no prejudice from the prosecutor\u2019s disclosures has been demonstrated since Hill was acquitted of the amended charges in support of which the additional facts were provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">\u00b660 For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b458-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
