Johnson (Johnson) appeals from an April 5, 1999 Judgment entered by the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, sentencing her to ten years with five suspended for issuing bad checks as part of a common scheme. Johnson claims that certain provisions in the written judgment were not enumerated by the court at her August 19,1998 sentencing, and are therefore unlawful pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ant to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, 288 Mont. 286, 957 P.2d 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b62 We agree in part, and reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b63 Johnson raises one issue \u2014 the legality of certain provisions in the District Court\u2019s written sentence \u2014 which can be set forth as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">Did the District Court err when it included conditions in its written judgment that it did not impose in open court, thereby rendering portions of the written judgment unlawful?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\u00b64 Johnson was charged by information on March 3,1997, for issuing bad checks totaling $22,740.67 as part of a common scheme in violation of \u00a7 45-6-316, MCA. Johnson would eventually plead guilty. At her August 19,1998 sentencing hearing, the District Court sentenced her to ten years in the Montana State Prison at the Women\u2019s Correctional Facility, with five years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">\u00b65 At the time, Johnson was already serving a five-year felony theft sentence, with one year suspended \u2014 also for issuing bad checks \u2014 that had been imposed by the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, on April 29,1998. Johnson also faces similar charges in Ravalli County and Washington State.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">\u00b66 The Missoula County court stated that the conditions of her suspended sentence would be those contained in the Cascade County judgment, those arising from the Ravalli County action, and \u201cconditions one through ten as contained in Ms. Peterson\u2019s presentence investigation and report.\u201d Antoinette Peterson performed the presentence investigation (PSI) for the action in Cascade County, and her recommendations were adopted virtually verbatim by that court\u2019s sentence of Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">\u00b67 The referenced conditions for the most part were the stock requirements of all probationers: that she obey the rules of the Adult Probation and Parole Bureau, not possess drugs, alcohol or firearms, submit to drug testing and searches, and obtain counseling. Additionally, the conditions included case-specific requirements: that Johnson pay a fee of $ 120 for probation supervision; that she pay a $5 surcharge for \u201ccourt information technology;\u201d that she pay $5,826.25 in restitution; that she pay the $250 cost of \u201csupervising payment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>restitution;\u201d that she pay a $20 surcharge for each felony conviction; and that she reimburse the attorney\u2019s fees for her defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b68 The Missoula County court further specified that Johnson would be assessed the \u201cadditional fees and surcharges in connection with this cause\u201d and that the court would recommend to the Department of Corrections that \u201cif you\u2019re placed in a community setting or paroled, that you\u2019re to have all these same conditions apply, specifically restitution.\u201d The court added that \u201c[rjestitution will be paid in the priority as outlined by Mr. Van Valkenburg concerning this Clearwater Realty deal\u201d and would be \u201cthe amount of damage actually suffered\u201d as opposed to the amount of the checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b69 Missoula County Attorney, Fred Van Valkenburg, recommended the following to the court at the sentencing hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">[T]hat the Court consider suspension of no more than five years of that sentence on the condition that the Defendant make restitution to the victims in this case in the total amount of $22,740.67. Prioritize that restitution so that the first amount of money will go towards reimbursement of the Montana Transfer Company, then subsequently the Rocky Mountain Moving and Storage Company, then all other victims equally, except the Clearwater River Realty, that being last priority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">That the Defendant also be required to reimburse Missoula County for the cost of medical expenses incurred on her behalf in the amount of $16,636.78. That that be paid prior to the restitution being paid to Clearwater River Realty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Van Valkenburg also recommended that Johnson pay \u201csurcharges, cost of prosecution in the amount of $ 100, and reimbursement of public defender fees in Missoula County ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">\u00b610 On April 5,1999, the District Court issued its written Judgement. The court stated that \u201cthe Defendant shall abide by all of the conditions and provisions as set out in this Judgment, specifically restitution.\u201d The court further provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that pursuant to Section 46-18-244(3)(c), MCA, one-third (1/3) of any earnings by the Defendant in the Montana State Prison or any other correctional institution shall be applied to the restitution ordered in this cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">\u00b611 The court then listed 22 conditions of her suspended sentence, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-12\">15. That the Defendant shall make restitution through the Clerk of the District Court in the amount of Fourteen Thousand One Hun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>dred Twenty-five and 40/100 Dollars ($14,125.40), according to a schedule as set by her Probation Officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\">18. That the Defendant shall pay the cost of prosecution through the Clerk of the District Court in the amount of One Thousand Three Hundred Five and 30/100 Dollars ($1,305.30), according to a schedule as set by her Probation Officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">19. That the Defendant shall pay restitution for medical expenses to the Missoula County Jail through the Clerk of the District Court in the amount of Sixteen Thousand Six Hundred Thirty-six and 78/100 Dollars ($16,636.78), according to a schedule as set by her Probation Officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u00b612 Johnson appeals the written Judgment, contending that it unlawfully includes conditions that were not enumerated at her oral sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u00b613  This Court has recently clarified the proper standard of review of criminal sentences. \u201cThis Court reviews a criminal sentence only for legality.\u201d <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15. We review questions of law <em>de novo </em>to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>See State v. Waters, </em>1999 MT 229, \u00b6 14, 296 Mont. 101, \u00b6 14, 987 P.2d 1142, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\"><em>Did the District Court err when it included conditions in its written judgment that it did not impose in open court, thereby rendering portions of the written judgment </em>unlawful?</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">\u00b614 Johnson argues that while the District Court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence was legal, its subsequent written sentence was unlawful because of numerous conflicts with the sentence imposed in open court. Specifically, Johnson claims that the April 5,1999 written judgment unlawfully ordered: (1) that her wages while incarcerated would be applied to paying restitution; (2) that she must pay $16,636.78 in \u201crestitution\u201d to the Missoula County Jail for her medical expenses; (3) that she would be subject to certain previously undisclosed \u201ccivil\u201d restrictions as conditions of her suspended sentence; and (4) that she pay $1,305.30 for \u201cthe cost of prosecution.\u201d Johnson contends that none of the foregoing was orally imposed by the court at her sentencing, and therefore upon remand should be deleted from the written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u00b615 In <em>State v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, \u00b6 40, 288 Mont. 286, \u00b6 40, 957 P.2d 9, \u00b6 40, we held that the oral pronouncement of a criminal sentence in the presence of the defendant is the \u201clegally effective sentence and valid, final judgment\u201d and that the written judgment is merely evidence of the oral sentence. <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 40. <em>See also, </em>Art. II, Sec. 24, Mont. Const. (accused in \u201call criminal prosecutions\u201d shall have the right to appear and defend in person); \u00a7 46-16-121, MCA (defendant must be present at sentencing); \u00a7 46-16-123, MCA (defendant shall appear in person when sentence is imposed); \u00a7 46-1-202, MCA (defining \u201csentence\u201d as the \u201cjudicial disposition of a criminal proceeding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b616 The sentencing judge in <em>Lane, </em>in open court, required that the defendant complete sexual offender treatment before being eligible for parole. In its subsequent written judgment the court incorrectly stated that such treatment was only recommended. <em>See Lane, </em>\u00b6 9. A year later, the court entered a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order to correct the error. <em>See Lane, </em>\u00b6 10. Based on the argument of the State on appeal, we concluded that in the event of conflict between the oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment and sentence, the oral pronouncement controls. <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 48. Therefore, we also concluded that a district court may correct an error in a written judgment so that it accurately reflects what has been orally pronounced. <em>See Lane, </em>\u00b6 48. <em>See also State v. Osterloth, </em>2000 MT 129, \u00b6 40, [299 Mont. 517, \u00b6 40], 1 P.3d 946, \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b6 17 Johnson argues that our holding in <em>Lane </em>logically implies that, in a strict sense, any portion of a subsequent written judgment that fails to conform, or in some manner conflicts, with an oral sentence is unlawful. Thus, as mere \u201cevidence\u201d of a sentence, the written judgment must provide a mirror image of the court\u2019s sentencing language. <em>See Lane, </em>\u00b6 38 (quoting <em>United States v. Villano </em>(10th Cir. 1987), 816 F.2d 1448, 1452-53, that sentencing \u201cshould be conducted with the judge and defendant facing one another and not in secret\u201d and that defendant should be \u201caware of his sentence when he leaves the courtroom\u201d). <em>See also State v. Simpson, </em>1999 MT 259, \u00b6 12, 296 Mont. 335, \u00b6 12, 989 P.2d 361, \u00b6 12 (following <em>Lane, </em>and concluding that a direct conflict existed between the court\u2019s oral suspended sentence and the subsequent written judgment due to the imposition of additional conditions); \u00a7 46-18-115(6), MCA (requiring court to \u201cspecifically state all reasons for the sentence, including restrictions, conditions, or enhancements imposed, in open court on the record and in the written judgment\u201d); \u00a7 46-18-801(1), MCA (requiring sentencing judge to spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>cifically enumerate conditions that deprive offender of a civil or constitutional right).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b618 The State\u2019s argument suggests that in applying <em>Lane </em>to a particular set of circumstances we must not lose sight of the underlying constitutional principle \u2014 that it is only the \u201csentence\u201d that cannot be imposed on a defendant in absentia. <em>See Lane, </em>\u00b6 33. With this understanding, the State argues that under certain circumstances an orally imposed sentence may later be clarified by a court\u2019s written judgment without unlawfully imposing an additional or new sentence, and relies on <em>State v. Waters, </em>1999 MT 229, 296 Mont. 101, 987 P.2d 1142, for this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u00b619 The State\u2019s argument has its merits. For example, the Legislature\u2019s statement of \u201csentencing policy\u201d under \u00a7 46-18-101, MCA, can be distilled into two distinct methods (aside from the death penalty) by which we \u201cpunish each offender\u201d when a sentence is imposed: the loss of liberty and the sacrifice of property. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-101(2) and (3), MCA; \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA (1997) (providing \u201csentences that may be imposed\u201d and listing various forms of incarceration, rehabilitation programs, and monetary penalties); \u00a7 46-18-202, MCA (providing \u201cadditional restrictions on sentence\u201d such as prohibiting defendant from holding public office and owning or carrying a dangerous weapon, and restricting freedom of association and movement).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u00b620 Thus, as this Court declared in <em>State v. Waters, </em>we must be \u201cmindful of the need to apply <em>Lane </em>in a principled manner,\u201d and avoid \u201cabsolutist\u201d arguments. <em>See Waters, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31 and 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\u00b621 Our decision in <em>Waters </em>is particularly instructive. There, the defendant argued that he should have been excused from paying restitution within six months of the discharge of sentence \u2014 as required by his written judgment \u2014 because the sentencing judge failed to mention in open court any specific conditions for the payment of restitution, including the amount. The defendant argued that such an obvious \u201cconflict\u201d rendered that portion of the written judgment unlawful. <em>Waters, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\u00b622 We did not disagree with the defendant\u2019s characterization. We observed that the court had orally pronounced that Waters would be liable for restitution, but it had nevertheless \u201cfailed to elaborate on the specific ... terms and conditions for paying restitution.\u201d <em>Waters, </em>\u00b6 32. We determined, however, that the district court\u2019s written sentencing order merely clarified \u201cambiguous sentencing conditions imposed orally.\u201d <em>Waters, </em>\u00b6 31 (citing <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 37). We reasoned that where a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>fendant was \u201cclearly put on notice of sentencing conditions and given a sufficient opportunity to respond to those conditions and ask for clarification, that defendant should not be heard to complain.\u201d <em>Waters, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b623 Subsequently, in <em>State v. Simpson </em>we distinguished our \u201cambiguous clarification\u201d rule in <em>Waters </em>and determined that certain conditions set forth in a written judgment were invalid pursuant to our decision in <em>Lane. See Simpson, </em>\u00b6 14. In that case, the sentencing judge\u2019s oral imposition of sentence diverged from the recommended conditions set forth in the plea agreement and the PSI report, and therefore provided the defendant no prior notice or opportunity to respond to the conditions of his suspended sentence that would later appear in the written judgment. <em>Simpson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-12. In contrast to <em>Waters, </em>we concluded that the sentencing court could not later \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d left void by the court\u2019s oral sentence that was silent as to those conditions. <em>Simpson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b624  Based on our holdings in Lane, <em>Waters, </em>and <em>Simpson, </em>weconclude that one problematic rule that has emerged \u2014 that a subsequent written judgment may not \u201cconflict\u201d with the oral pronouncement of sentence \u2014 is vague, and serves only to cloud what is truly at issue: whether a written judgment has, without notice, substantively <em>increased </em>a defendant\u2019s criminal sentence that was previously imposed in open court in the defendant\u2019s presence. In determining whether any portion of a judge\u2019s subsequent written judgment is unlawful, therefore, we need only determine first, whether the defendant was afforded the opportunity to respond to its inclusion upon sufficient notice at sentencing, and second, whether that portion of the written judgment substantively increases one of two things: (1) the defendant\u2019s loss of liberty; and (2) the defendant\u2019s sacrifice of property.</p>\n<p id=\"AREf\">\u00b625 Applying this rationale to the case at bar we conclude:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b626  1. The District Court did not err when it ordered that one-third of Johnson\u2019s earnings while incarcerated would be applied to her restitution obligation, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-244(3)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Agi\">\u00b627 Subsection (3) of \u00a7 46-18-244, MCA, provides that in addition to other methods of payment, the court may order one or more of the following in order to satisfy the offender\u2019s restitution obligation: \u201c(c) payment of up to one-third of the offender\u2019s prison earnings.\u201d Under \u00a7 46-18-201(2), MCA (1997) (now subsection (5) under 1999 MCA), as well as \u00a7 46-18-241(1), MCA, a sentencing judge must, as a matter of law, impose restitution in a sentence for the full amount of a victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>pecuniary loss. The duty to pay full restitution under a sentence remains with the offender until full restitution is paid, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-241(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b628 The District Court specifically emphasized restitution in imposing sentence in open court. Further, the issue of restitution was thoroughly addressed by the State and Johnson\u2019s counsel, as well as Johnson herself, whose last words to the court prior to receiving her sentence were: \u2018Your Honor, just give me the chance to pay people back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b629  As a reflection of her oral sentence, the court\u2019s written judgment actually reduced the amount requested by the State, from $22,740.67 to $14,125.40, which is consistent with its oral pronouncement that \u201crestitution be the amount of damage actually suffered ... as opposed to the amount of the check.\u201d The court\u2019s subsequent determination of the <em>method </em>for this payment, which is allowable under the foregoing statute, did not increase either Johnson\u2019s loss of liberty or sacrifice of property as imposed in open court, and thus did not impose an unlawful condition on her sentence. <em>See Waters, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"A4O\">\u00b630 2. The District Court erred when it imposed \u201crestitution\u201d to the Missoula County Jail for $16,636.78 in medical expenses, in its written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u00b631 First, the court made no reference whatsoever to the imposition of this cost in its oral sentence, even though under \u00a7 7-32-2245(1), MCA, an inmate may be held responsible for the \u201cactual medical costs\u201d accrued during an inmate\u2019s confinement in a detention center upon a finding of ability to pay. This omission occurred despite the fact that the State just moments prior to imposition of sentence specifically requested its inclusion, and counsel for Johnson acknowledged that this sum was owed, but contended that Johnson lacked the ability to pay, and that it should be \u201ca last priority, if at all.\u201d Clearly, Johnson did not leave the court room that day \u201caware of her sentence\u201d in this respect. <em>See Lane, </em>\u00b6 38 (quoting <em>United States v. Villano </em>(10th Cir. 1987), 816 F.2d 1448, 1452-53).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\u00b632  Second, even if the court\u2019s oral reference to \u201crestitution\u201d intended to include this cost, the Missoula County Jail does not fall within the statutory definition of a \u201cvictim,\u201d which is a requisite for the imposition of restitution. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-241(1), MCA (requiring an offender to make full restitution to a \u201cvictim of the offense\u201d) and \u00a7 46-18-243(2)(a)(iii), MCA (defining \u201cvictim\u201d as a governmental entity that suffers loss of property as a result of the commission of an of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>fense). We therefore conclude that the imposition of medical costs as \u201crestitution\u201d in the court\u2019s written judgment clearly increased Johnson\u2019s sacrifice of property under her oral sentence, and therefore was unlawful and should be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b633 3. The District Court did not err when it imposed certain \u201ccivil\u201d restrictions as conditions of Johnson\u2019s suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b634 In stark contrast to our decision in <em>Simpson, </em>the court here informed Johnson at sentencing that the \u201ccivil restrictions\u201d currently in place under her other judgments, and a presentence investigation (PSI) report, would apply to her new suspended sentence in this matter as well. These conditions were recommended by the State and not contested by Johnson at her sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b635 Subsequently, the court imposed 22 conditions for Johnson\u2019s suspended sentence in its April 5,1999 written judgment. The first 14 involve \u201ccivil restrictions\u201d as opposed to an imposition of monetary punishment. On appeal, Johnson does not specifically identify which of the 14 allegedly do not appear in either the presentence investigation (PSI) report, or the prior judgments as referenced by the court\u2019s oral sentence, nor does she specifically allege how the \u201cadditional\u201d conditions substantively restrict her liberty. Further, Johnson concedes that the court\u2019s oral reference to \u201cconditions one through ten as contained in Ms. Peterson\u2019s presentence investigation and report\u201d apply to her, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-801, MCA (requiring that civil or constitutional rights be \u201cspecifically enumerated by the sentencing judge\u201d). Instead, she maintains that the PSI report and Department of Corrections rules and regulations do not include all of the restrictions subsequently imposed in the court\u2019s written judgment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\u00b636  Upon review, we find no evidence, and Johnson has presented none, that any one of the 14 \u201ccivil restriction\u201d conditions substantively increased the loss of liberty or sacrifice of property imposed by her oral sentence. The written conditions set forth by the court are largely verbatim to those that Johnson concedes apply to her. If not verbatim, the conditions merely add more detail to those already in place under Peterson\u2019s PSI report. For example, the referenced PSI report prohibited Johnson from entering \u201cany establishment where alcohol is the chief item of sale,\u201d which is also found in the Ravalli PSI report and the Cascade County judgment. In turn, condition number five in the court\u2019s written judgment provided this same restriction and included the language \u201cany gambling casinos.\u201d Such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>clarification did not substantively increase her loss of liberty. We conclude, therefore, that the 14 \u201ccivil restriction\u201d conditions in the court\u2019s written judgment were lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b637  4. The District Court erred when it required that Johnson pay $1,305.30 for the \u201ccost of prosecution\u201d in its written judgment. \u00b638 At the sentencing hearing, the State recommended that Johnson pay the <em>\u201ccost ofprosecution </em>in the amount of $ 100...\u201d in addition to its recommendation that she pay \u201csurcharges\u201d and \u201cpublic defender fees\u201d similar to those imposed by Johnson\u2019s Cascade County sentence. The court did not expressly address the <em>\u201ccost </em>ofprosecution\u201d recommendation in its oral sentence; rather, it stated that Johnson would be assessed with \u201cadditional fees and surcharges in connection with this cause.\u201d Further, the conditions found in the Cascade County PSI and other judgments do not provide for the imposition of the \u201ccost of prosecution.\u201d Once again, Johnson did not leave the court room that day \u201caware of her sentence\u201d with respect to the imposition of the \u201ccost of prosecution\u201d that, at the court\u2019s discretion, may be imposed pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-232, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b639 We conclude, therefore, that the imposition of this \u201ccost\u201d in the court\u2019s written judgment was included without notice, and unlawfully increased Johnson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u00b640 Accordingly, this matter is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded so that the written judgment may be conformed to the oral pronouncement of sentence consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b303-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, LEAPHART, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
