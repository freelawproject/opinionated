As part of his sentence, the District Court ordered him to pay restitution for ambulance and towing fees related to this incident. LaTray appeals this order of restitution claiming that the District Court had no authority to order payment of restitution for these services. We affirm the District Court\u2019s sentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b40-13\">\u00b62 On April 24,1999, LaTray was driving down U.S. Highway 87. He had been drinking and was driving with a suspended license. During the course of his drive, LaTray overtook a 1974 Jeep pickup driven by Douglas Bingeman (Bingeman) and, while attempting to pass, clipped its rear bumper. LaTray did not stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-14\">\u00b63 Since his Jeep pickup had sustained only minor damage, Bingeman drove after LaTray in an attempt to stop him or get his license plate number. Bingeman testified at trial that he observed LaTray weaving between the shoulder and the median, sometimes crossing over into the oncoming lane of traffic. Other drivers called the police from cellular phones to report LaTray\u2019s erratic driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u00b64 When sheriff\u2019s deputies caught up with LaTray he ignored their flashing lights and sirens and continued driving at speeds of up to 100 miles per hour. LaTray drove into a hayfield, nearly hit one of the deputy\u2019s cars and fled down a dirt road. The chase ended when LaTray lost control of his car, went into a ditch and rolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b65 Although LaTray did not appear to be seriously injured, deputies called an ambulance as a precautionary measure. They also called a tow truck to remove LaTray\u2019s overturned vehicle from the ditch and take it to Lewistown.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b66 Because LaTray appeared to be unconscious when the ambulance crew arrived, medical personnel called for an Advanced Life Support (ALS) ambulance to meet them en route to Great Falls. Paramedics prepared LaTray for transport by immobilizing him and applying a cervical collar. After meeting the ALS ambulance, paramedics took additional measures to assess and stabilize LaTray\u2019s condition. Doctors at the hospital ultimately determined that LaTray had no significant injuries but a blood screening revealed a blood-alcohol content of .156.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\u00b67 LaTray was charged by information with driving under the influence of alcohol, a felony; operating a motor vehicle without proof of liability insurance; operating a motor vehicle while a habitual traffic offender; leaving a vehicle accident scene; and felony criminal endangerment. He was convicted of all charges. The District Court sentenced him to ten years in prison and four years of supervised probation. In addition, the court ordered LaTray to pay restitution of $1,561.80 to Superior Towingfor towing and storage fees and $317.50 to the Stanford Ambulance Service for ambulance services incurred as a result of the incident. LaTray appeals this sentence and asks this Court to strike the restitution requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err when it ordered LaTray to pay restitution for ambulance and towing services?</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">\u00b69 This Court reviews a criminal sentence for legality. <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15. Thus, our review is confined to whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by statute. <em>Montoya, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">\u00b6 10 LaTray argues that the court\u2019s statutory authority to order restitution is limited to pecuniary losses suffered by <em>direct victims, </em>defined in terms of the offense for which he was convicted. He asserts that, while the driver of the pickup struck by LaTray may be a victim, neither the towing service nor the ambulance company qualify as victims of any of the offenses of which he was convicted. He concludes, therefore, that the court exceeded its authority when it ordered him to pay restitution for these services. We disagree. LaTray\u2019s interpretation is neither implied by the plain words of the controlling statutes nor is it supported by our case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b6 11 Our role in construing statutory language is clear. We must \u201cascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein...we may not insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA. If the intention of the legislature can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used, a court may not go further and apply other means of interpretation. <em>Curtis v. Dist. Court of 21st Jud. Dist. </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 231, 235, 879 P.2d 1164, 1166 (citing <em>State v. Hubbard </em>(1982), 200 Mont. 106, 111, 649 P.2d 1331, 1333). Where the statutory language is \u201cplain, unambiguous, direct and certain, the statute speaks for itself and there is nothing left for the court to construe.\u201d <em>Curtis, </em>266 Mont. at 235, 879 P.2d at 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u00b612  Under Montana law, sentencing courts must order offenders to make full restitution to <em>\u201cany </em>victim of the offense who has sustained pecuniary loss <em>as a result of the offense, </em>including a person suffering an economic loss as a result of the crime.\u201d Section 46-18-241(1), MCA (emphasis added). The plain language of this statute does not limit restitution to victims defined in terms of the offense for which the defendant was convicted or to losses arising directly from the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\u00b613 LaTray argues, in essence, that \u201cany victim\u201d means \u201conly those victims legally related to the convicted offense\u201d and \u201cas a result of the offense\u201d means \u201cas a <em>direct </em>result of the offense.\u201d LaTray would have us interpret the word \u201cany\u201d as somehow restrictive or limiting. But, clearly, the term <em>any </em>is not limiting in <em>any </em>way.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">\u00b6 14 In arguing that courts only have authority to require restitution for losses that occur as a <em>direct </em>result of an offense, LaTray would, again, have this Court insert a limiting term into the plain text of the statute. Admittedly, application of \u00a7 46-18-241(1), MCA, requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>some interpretation of just how remote a loss can be before it can no longer be considered to be \u201ca result of the offense.\u201d However, the fact that the language is somewhat open does not imply that \u201cdirect\u201d losses are the only ones that qualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u00b615 Had the legislature wished to add the limiting terms that LaTray\u2019s argument suggest, it surely could have done so. It is not our role to insert this language in a statute that is otherwise plain on its face. Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u00b6 16  Our case law also holds that classification of an individual as a victim \u2014 for the purpose of ordering restitution \u2014 does not depend on the individual\u2019s relationship to the elements of the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced. <em>State v. Morgan </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 391, 402, 646 P.2d 1177, 1183. In <em>Morgan, </em>the defendant was convicted of negligent homicide following a motor vehicle accident in which two people were killed and three others injured. We affirmed the district court\u2019s order of restitution to the three injured passengers, holding that they fell within the class of persons injured by the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct. <em>Morgan, </em>198 Mont. at 402, 646 P.2d at 1183. That is, for purposes of restitution, the victims of negligent <em>homicide </em>were not limited to those who <em>died </em>as a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct. Although <em>Morgan </em>was decided before the adoption of the current statute, it interpreted identical language and we find its reasoning applicable to the case at hand. LaTray\u2019s conviction for criminal endangerment in no way limits restitution only to those he endangered.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u00b617 Given the sentencing authority statutorily granted to courts, the issue in this case boils down to the question of whether the towing and ambulance services come within the following language; \u201cvictim who sustained pecuniary loss as a result of the offense, including a person suffering an economic loss as a result of the crime.\u201d Section 46-18-241(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\u00b618 The statutory definition of \u201cvictim\u201d states, in relevant part;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">(2)(a) \u201cVictim\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\">(i) a person who suffers loss of property, bodily injury, or death as a result of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-11\">(A) the commission of an offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">Section 46-18-243(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-13\">\u00b619 Most of our cases that apply this definition deal with situations in which the victim was the person directly harmed by the defendant\u2019s conduct. As such, they provide little authority, one way or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>other, for the situation presented here; where a judge has ordered restitution paid to a party other than the one directly injured by the offender. The two cases that address this issue are somewhat in conflict. In <em>Morgan, </em>cited above, we held that the court properly ordered restitution to surviving passengers for losses incurred as a result of the negligent homicide of their parents. <em>Morgan, </em>198 Mont. at 402, 646 P.2d at 1183. However, in a more recent case, we held that surviving family members were not \u201cvictims\u201d for the purpose of ordering restitution. <em>State v. Brown </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 223, 227, 867 P.2d 1098, 1101. In <em>Brown, </em>the defendant pled guilty to felony criminal endangerment and negligent homicide after he lost control of his vehicle and struck two pedestrians. This Court held that, although the families of the pedestrians had incurred \u201cstaggering financial losses\u201d as a result of the accident, the court improperly ordered restitution to these families. In reaching this conclusion, the court did not analyze the statutory definition of victim as set out in \u00a7 46-18-243(2)(a), MCA. Rather, it seemed to rely on the State\u2019s concession that surviving family members could not be considered victims. <em>Brown, </em>263 Mont. at 227, 867 P.2d at 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u00b620 In any case, it is not necessary to reconcile these cases here. In 1995, the legislature expanded the scope of persons entitled to receive restitution to include those \u201csuffering an economic loss as a result of the crime.\u201d Section 46-18-241(1), MCA. That language is sufficiently broad to cover the ambulance and towing charges in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b621  Montana\u2019s restitution statute does not confine restitution to the amount by which a defendant enriches himself at the victim\u2019s expense but rather, empowers courts to impose restitution for economic loss as a result of the crime. <em>State v. Brewer, </em>1999 MT 369, \u00b6 21, 296 Mont. 453, \u00b6 21, 989 P.2d 407, \u00b6 21. In <em>Brewer, </em>the defendant embezzled funds from his employer over a number of years. Following the theft, the employer paid his employees, a software company, a locksmith and an accounting firm in excess of $15,000 in an attempt to assess and rectify the damage caused by the theft. We held that such expenditures, necessary to address and rectify the effect of the defendant\u2019s criminal acts, were \u201cthe result of the crime\u201d and properly the subject of a restitution order. <em>State v. Brewer, </em>1999 MT 369, \u00b6\u00b6 19-23, 296 Mont. 453, \u00b6\u00b6 19-23, 989 P.2d 407, \u00b6\u00b6 19-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b622  Under the facts of this case, the towing and ambulance services suffered an economic loss because they incurred out of pocket expenses for which they were not reimbursed. Moreover, these ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>penses were a result of LaTray\u2019s criminal conduct. Regardless of whether the services were ordered by the sheriffs deputies on the scene, LaTray\u2019s criminal acts created a situation in which ambulance and towing services were reasonably necessary for public safety or for the safety of LaTray himself. The expenditures incurred by the ambulance and towing services were a result of LaTray\u2019s crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">\u00b623 We hold, therefore, that the District Court had authority under \u00a7 46-18-241(1), MCA, to order LaTray to pay restitution to the companies that provided these services.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b45-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON and REGNIER concur</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
