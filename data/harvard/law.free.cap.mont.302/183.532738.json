Zempel, Jr. (Zempel). Deborah K. Palmer (Palmer) appeals this order. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">\u00b62 The only issue before us is whether or not the District Court erred in appointing Kathleen Newman as personal representative of the estate of Fred W. Zempel, Jr.?</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">\u00b63 Zempel was a longtime resident and rancher in Rosebud County, Montana. Over the years, he developed a personal and business relationship with Daryl and Kathleen Newman. The Newmans had leased a ranch from Zempel for more than eighteen years, and they took care of him during his final illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">\u00b64 On October 4,1996, Zempel was diagnosed with lung cancer. On October 10, 1996, Zemple executed his last will and testament. He named his daughter, Palmer, who resides in Tucson, Arizona, as his sole devisee. He also named Newman as personal representative of his estate. On the same day, he also executed a power of attorney appointing Newman as his attorney in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-16\">\u00b65 On October 24,1996, Zempel and the Newmans entered into an option agreement where the Newmans would buy the ranch land they were leasing from him. Zempel had expressed his reasons for selling this property to the Newmans to another longtime friend, Max Bauer, who testified that Zempel did not believe his daughter, Palmer, could operate the place, and he wanted to make sure the ranch stayed in good hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\u00b66 On December 31,1996, Newman, acting pursuant to the power of attorney, executed a contract for deed and lease which transferred the ranch property to her and her husband. Zempel died on January 15, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b67 The estate of Zempel was opened on January 16,1997, with a petition, for appointment of Palmer as special administrator. The petition was filed without notification to Newman and without any sworn facts in support of the petition. The District Court appointed Palmer as the special administrator based on the <em>ex parte </em>application.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b68 On January 27,1997, Newman filed a petition for a formal probate of the will and appointment of personal representative. The petition for appointment was filed in conjunction with a motion to set aside the <em>ex parte </em>order appointing Palmer as special administrator of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u00b69 The District Court set a hearing date on this matter. The first part of the hearing was held on February 10, 1997, and the hearing was concluded on February 13,1997. Palmer filed an objection to the appointment of Newman as personal representative on February 13, 1997. The matter was deemed submitted to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u00b610 On September 4,1997, the District Court issued a memorandum and order. Its order terminated the appointment of Palmer as special administrator, and appointed Newman as personal representative. In the memorandum portion of the order the District Court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">From the evidence presented to date, it appears that Fred W. Zempel, Jr. died testate, with his will naming Ms. Newman as personal representative and Ms. Palmer as alternative personal representative. The evidence presented also indicates that Mr. Zempel wanted to sell his ranch to Ms. Newman and her husband and that Ms. Newman, acting pursuant to a power of attorney, attempted to finalize a sale of the property before Mr. Zempel\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\">There has been no credible evidence indicating that Mr. Zempel was incompetent or acting under any undue influence at the time he executed his will or any of the other documents including an Option to Buy....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\">Given Mr. Zempel\u2019s expressed wishes that the ranch be sold to the Newmans and Ms. Palmer\u2019s acquiescence in such transaction so long as the transaction can qualify for \u201cspecial use\u201d valuation, and given Ms. Newman\u2019s willingness to reframe the transaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>accordingly, the Court does not find a conflict of interest on the part of Ms. Newman so long as the parties proceed along those lines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The District Court further ordered that \u201c[a]ny real estate transaction must be approved by the Court after notice and hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b611 On October 2,1997, Palmer appealed the District Court\u2019s September 4,1997 order. This appeal was held in abeyance by stipulation of the parties, but the matter is now before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\u00b6 12 We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding the removal of a personal representative to determine if the district court abused its discretion. <em>In re Estate of Haagenson </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 34, 37, 952 P.2d 1385, 1387 (denial of a petition to remove the personal representative was not an abuse of discretion, despite claims of conflict of interest). A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscious judgment or it exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Investigative Records of City of Columbus Pol. Dept. </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 486, 488, 901 P.2d 565, 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">\u00b613 Did the District Court err in appointing Kathleen Newman as personal representative of the estate of Fred W. Zempel, Jr.?</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">\u00b614 Palmer argues that the District Court erred in appointing Newman personal representative in light of the conflict of interest that arose from the documents purportedly transferring estate assets to her and her husband. Montana law provides that a personal representative must act as a fiduciary and avoid conflicts of interest. Palmer argues that the District Court erred in attempting to bypass the conflict by relying on a \u201ccompromise\u201d between the parties that never existed.</p>\n<p id=\"AIo\">\u00b615 Newman argues that the District Court did not abuse its discretion. She argues that it is established under law, that the Testator\u2019s appointment of personal representative should be given great deference, and refusal to appoint should be done only when authorized by statute. Furthermore, the allegation of conflict between the personal representative and an interested party can be remedied by the District Court\u2019s supervision of the estate\u2019s administration. Newman points out that conflicts of interests between a personal representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>tive and other interested parties are common, and can usually be dealt with by court supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b616  We have long held that a personal representative should not be removed except for good cause shown. <em>Tice\u2019s Estate v. Tice </em>(1962), 140 Mont. 28, 35, 367 P.2d 771, 774. Pursuant to \u00a7 72-3-526(2), MCA, a district court may find good cause for removal of the personal representative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">(a) when removal would be in the best interests of the estate; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">(b) if it is shown that a personal representative or the person seeking his appointment intentionally misrepresented material facts in the proceedings leading to his appointment or that the personal representative has disregarded an order of the court, has become incapable of discharging the duties of his office, or has mismanaged the estate or failed to perform any duty pertaining to the office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\u00b617 Palmer argues that by applying this standard, it is clear that it is in the best interest of this estate to remove Newman due to her conflict of interest. She argues that the conflict over the option contract and the contract for deed, both involving the ranch property, places Newman in an irreconcilable conflict of interest. Palmer presents evidence and argument to demonstrate the extent of the dispute over these documents. Palmer asserts that as a fiduciary, a personal representative must never deal with estate property for her own benefit or take part in any transaction in which the personal representative has an adverse interest to the beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u00b618  We agree with Palmer that a conflict of interest is sufficient for removal of a personal representative for cause under \u00a7 72-3-526, MCA. <em>Matter of Estate of Peterson </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 104, 109, 874 P.2d 1230, 1233 (district court properly removed a personal representative who testified that he would not pursue a claim against himself). This is not to say, however, that a conflict of interest mandates the removal of a personal representative. Our statute effectively deals with issues of conflict of interest involving transactions between personal representatives and the estate. Section 72-3-615, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">Any sale or encumbrance to the personal representative, his spouse, agent, or attorney or any corporation or trust in which he has a substantial beneficial interest or any transaction which is affected by a substantial conflict of interest on the part of the personal representative is voidable by any person interested in the estate except one who has consented after fair disclosure, unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>(1) the will or a contract entered into by the decedent expressly authorized the transaction; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\">(2) <em>the transaction is approved by the court after notice to interested persons.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Section 72-3-615, MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u00b619  Newman argues that the District Court implemented \u00a7 72-3-615(2), MCA, in its September 4, 1997, order, and effectively cured any allegations of conflict of interest by requiring its approval of the real estate transaction between the personal representative and the estate. A.transaction involving a conflict of interest between a personal representative and the estate can be cured by court ordered supervision of the transaction. <em>In re Estate of Goick </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 13, 22, 909 P.2d 1165, 1170. We agree with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">\u00b620 Palmer attempts to distinguish <em>Goick, </em>and argues that because she is the only beneficiary and she does not consent to Newman\u2019s appointment that this case is factually different. Palmer also points out that the personal representative in <em>Goick </em>benefitted from the maximizing of the estate where here Newman does not. She argues that this requires the District Court to take a much more active role in supervising the ranch transaction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">\u00b621 In <em>Goick, </em>the district court cured a conflict of interest by prohibiting the personal representative from taking any substantive action without the court\u2019s approval. We held that this court ordered supervision of the estate\u2019s administration protected the other interested parties. <em>Goick, </em>275 Mont. at 22, 909 P.2d at 1170. Here, the District Court required its approval for the final transaction between the personal representative and the estate. Any objection or challenge Palmer may have, is protected through the District Court\u2019s supervision of the disputed transaction. As in <em>Goick, </em>the court ordered supervision cures the conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">\u00b622  For a district court to abuse its discretion, it must act arbitrarily without the employment of conscious judgment or by exceeding the bounds of reason which results in substantial injustice. Here, the District Court considered both sides\u2019 evidence and its decision was neither arbitrary nor unjust. We conclude that the District Court did not err in appointing Newman as personal representative of the Zempel estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">\u00b623 The District Court\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b216-12\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
