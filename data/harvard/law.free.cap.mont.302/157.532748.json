The District Court also awarded attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Glenn A. Huestis, who was declared the successful candidate for Sheriff of Blaine County. Theron Peter Paulsen appeals. We affirm the District Court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">\u00b62 Paulsen frames the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in dismissing Paulsen\u2019s challenge to the results of the Blaine County Sheriff\u2019s race in the 1998 general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in awarding Huestis his attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">\u00b65 Incumbent Sheriff Paulsen and challenger Huestis contested the Democratic nomination for Sheriff of Blaine County, Montana, in the 1998 primary election; no Republican sought the office. Huestis prevailed. Paulsen then ran in the general election as a write-in candidate. The record indicates he conducted a vigorous campaign, and was the only candidate to file a Declaration of Intent For Write-In Candidates (hereinafter Declaration of Intent) to challenge Huestis in the general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">\u00b66 On election day, Blaine County election officials posted the statutorily-prescribed voter instructions. Nearly half of the voters complied with Montana\u2019s election law governing write-in candidates and wrote in one of the thirty legally acceptable name derivations of candidate Paulsen as properly submitted by him on his Declaration of Intent. However, 37 voters only wrote in the surname \u201cPaulson\u201d or \u201cPaulsen,\u201d or the name \u201cPat Paulsen\u201d or \u201cPat Paulson.\u201d The record indicates that after a recount, the final vote tally was 1,219 for Huestis and 1,200 for Paulsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">\u00b67 These 37 ballots, invalidated by Blaine County election officials as not complying with the statutory requirements for write-in candidates, were sufficient to cause Paulsen to lose the election. Nine other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>ballots were invalidated for reasons unknown. After the recount Paulsen\u2019s margin of loss had widened slightly. He filed a complaint in January 1999, contesting the invalidation of the 37 ballots and asking that he be declared the victor, or in the alternative, that a new election be held, and that he be awarded legal fees and expenses, and any other relief the court might grant. The District Court found that the treatment of the ballots in question was correct under the law, and that fees and expenses should be awarded to Huestis. Paulsen appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b68 <em>Whether the District Court erred in rejecting Paulsen\u2019s challenge to the results of the Blaine County Sheriff\u2019s race in the 1998 general election.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b69 This Court views its role in maintaining the sanctity and integrity of the electoral process for the people of Montana as one of its greatest areas of responsibility. Montana\u2019s laws governing the electoral process are, for the most part, clear. However, in some instances their application, as this case demonstrates, can result in seemingly harsh consequences, potentially even undermining the will of the majority of voters. Amending the election statutes is a task for the legislature; this Court\u2019s task is simply to ascertain what is in terms or in substance contained in these statutes, neither inserting what has been omitted nor omitting what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA. That said, the legislature may wish to re-examine the election statutes pertaining to write-in votes with a view to amending these laws so as to obviate the sort of problems appearing in this case and in <em>Marsh v. Overland </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 21, 905 P.2d 1088. Against this backdrop, we discuss the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u00b610 The proper grounds for contesting a nomination or election in Montana are set forth in \u00a713-36-101, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">Grounds for contest of nomination or election to public office. An elector may contest the right of any person to any nomination or election to public office for which the elector has the right to vote, for any of the following causes: (1) on the ground of a deliberate, serious, and material violation of any provision of the law relating to nominations or elections; (2) whenever the person whose right is contested was not, at the time of the election, eligible to such office; (3) on account of illegal votes or an erroneous or fraudulent count or canvass of votes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Section 13-36-101, MCA. While Paulsen does not cite this statute, we will attempt to frame his arguments within its context.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b611 Paulsen first argues that the 37 votes in question were unquestionably cast for Theron Peter Paulsen and should thus be counted in the election results. This approach is generally consistent with an argument under \u00a7 13-36-101(3), MCA, that there was an erroneous canvassing of votes. Paulsen never does allege fraud. Paulsen argues as well, without compelling statutory or case law in support, that the instructions to voters posted at polling places were inadequate. He also asserts in his brief to this Court that the rejection of these votes, which was determinative of the election outcome, violated his due process rights under both the U.S. and Montana Constitutions. We will dispose of this last argument first.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b612 While Paulsen did, indeed, assert his due process claim in his initial complaint, the question still arises as to whether or not this argument was properly raised in the trial court. If it was not, Paulsen is precluded from raising the issue on appeal. <em>Marsh, </em>274 Mont. at 29, 905 P.2d at 1093. A careful review of the trial court transcript reveals that it was only upon prompting by the court to establish a clear record on appeal that Paulsen made the briefest mention of due process rights. That reference, moreover, was not to his own due process rights \u2014 the argument he advances before this Court \u2014 but to the rights of the voters, none of whom are parties to these proceedings. Paulsen again refers to the due process rights of voters in his brief. While Paulsen may have been a voter in the election being contested, he brings this action as a candidate. We conclude that Paulsen has failed to properly raise in the District Court the due process argument he now makes on appeal. Accordingly, we will not consider this issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Marsh, </em>274 Mont. at 25, 905 P.2d at 1090. With regard to Paulsen\u2019s first argument \u2014 i.e. that there was an erroneous canvassing of votes \u2014 we conclude that the relevant statutes were complied with as written, and we uphold the ruling of the District Court as correct under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b614 Montana\u2019s statutes governing write-in candidacies for elective office, \u00a7\u00a7 13-10-211, 13-13-117(4) and 13-15-202(3), MCA, must be read collectively. We interpreted these statutes in <em>Marsh </em>and follow the approach of that case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u00b615 <em>Marsh </em>was a case of first impression. Our decision invoked the application of case law and Montana election statutes and involved the question of voter intent in the context of a write-in election for the sheriff of Sheridan County. The disallowance of 40 ballots by Sheridan County election officials \u2014 upheld by the District Court \u2014 was sufficient to cause Marsh to lose the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b616 In <em>Marsh, </em>four ballots were cast with different first names, but the same surname as the Appellant; 12 ballots listed only the last name \u201cMarsh.\u201d Additionally, 22 persons wrote the correct name, but neglected to place an <em>\u201cX\u201d </em>in front of the name as required by \u00a7 13-13-117(4), MCA. We determined that these ballots did not comport with Montana\u2019s election laws requiring certainty of voter intent \u2014 \u00a7 13-15-202(3), MCA \u2014 and we affirmed the ruling of the District Court to that effect. <em>Marsh, </em>274 Mont. at 28, 905 P.2d at 1092. We also upheld the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b617 In the case <em>subjudice, </em>a total of 37 ballots are at issue, principally ballots with only the last name \u201cPaulsen\u201d or \u201cPaulson.\u201d The dis-allowance of these ballots also caused Paulsen to lose the election. In <em>Marsh </em>we concluded that both statutory and case law required that ballots be disallowed unless the intent of electors could be established with reasonable certainty from the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b6 18 <em>Marsh </em>was grounded in our prior case law wherein we have consistently ruled that ballots that do not clearly express the intent of the voter will be disallowed. <em>See Rennie v. Nistler </em>(1987), 226 Mont. 412, 735 P.2d <em>1124; Peterson v. Billings </em>(1939), 109 Mont. 390, 96 P.2d 922. Our rationale for rejecting ballots where the voters\u2019 intent is not clear was set forth in <em>Spaeth v. Kendall </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 352, 354-55, 801 P.2d 591, 593. In that case we stated, \u201cThe paramount and ultimate object of all election laws under our system of government is to obtain an honest and fair expression from the voters upon all questions submitted to them. When such expression cannot be gleaned without speculation, however, the vote is to be voided, to insure a standard of objectivity in our election process.\u201d <em>Spaeth, </em>245 Mont. 352, 354-55, 801 P.2d 591, 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b619 Election judges must be able to discern voter intent strictly from the ballot, and \u00a7 13-15-202(3), MCA, sets out the black-letter law as to how election officials are to accomplish that task. This statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">A ballot or part of a ballot is void and may not be counted if the elector\u2019s choice cannot be determined. If part of a ballot is sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>plain to determine the elector\u2019s intention, the election judges shall count that part. Except as provided in 13-10-211(4)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, <em>a write-in vote may be counted only if the write-in vote identifies an individual by any of the designations filed pursuant to 13-10-211(l)(a). </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b620 Section 13-15-202(3), MCA, makes clear the requirement that the name on a write-in ballot must conform to one of the names submitted by a write-in candidate in his declaration of intent to be a write-in candidate. In pertinent part this statute \u2014 \u00a7 13-10-211(l)(a)\u2014 requires that the declaration of intent for write-in candidates, among other requirements, must contain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">(i) the candidate\u2019s first and last names;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">(ii) the candidate\u2019s initials, if any, used instead of a first name, or first and middle name, and the candidate\u2019s last name;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">(iii) the candidate\u2019s nickname, if any, used instead of a first name, and the candidate\u2019s last name; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">(iv) a derivative or diminutive name, if any, used instead of a first name, and the candidate\u2019s last name.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">\u00b621 The record shows the 37 rejected ballots at issue here did not comply with this statutory requirement, as they did not contain a name consistent with one of the 30 names submitted by Paulsen in his declaration of intent. Moreover, write-in votes using only the candidate\u2019s last name, do not identify the person being voted for by \u201cany of the designations filed pursuant to 13-10-211(l)(a)\u201d as is required under \u00a7 13-15-202(3), MCA. The various subsections of \u00a7 13-10-211(l)(a), MCA, unambiguously require that the write-in candidate\u2019s last name also must be accompanied by, alternatively, the candidate\u2019s first name, initials, first and middle name, nickname or a derivative or diminutive name. <em>See, also, Marsh, </em>274 Mont. at 28, 905 P.2d at 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">\u00b622  Furthermore, while facially appealing, Paulsen\u2019s argument that, since no other person named \u201cPaulsen\u201d or \u201cPaulson\u201d filed a declaration of intent <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that, therefore, all written-in votes with those names should have been counted for Theron Peter Paulsen, is not persuasive. The election laws referred to above clearly specify what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>names voters may write-in where the candidate being voted for has filed a declaration of intent. Statutorily, if one of those names is not used, then the vote may not be counted by the election judges. Section 13-15-202(3), MCA. Again, if this statutory framework is too harsh and, arguably, subverts the exercise of the elector\u2019s franchise, then it is up to the legislature, not this Court, to change the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b623 With regard to the other statutory bases for contesting an election, Paulsen does not allege that Huestis was ineligible as a candidate under \u00a7 13-36-101(2), MCA. With regard to \u00a7 13-36-101(1), MCA, Paulsen devotes some time to discussing the content of voter instructions. However, he does not allege that the instructions actually given to Blaine County voters did not comply with \u00a7 13-13-112, MCA and \u00a7 13-12-209, MCA, even though he would have preferred the posted instructions to affirmatively set forth the proper names for his write-in candidacy. Section 13-13-112, MCA, does not require such an act, but, rather, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">Display of instructions for electors. (1) Instructions for electors on how to prepare their ballots or use machines or devices must be posted in each compartment provided for the preparation of ballots and elsewhere in the polling place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">(2) The instructions must be in easily read type, 18 point or larger, and explain how to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">(a) obtain ballots for voting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">(b) prepare ballots for deposit in the ballot box; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">(c) obtain a new ballot in place of one spoiled by accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">\u00b624 Similarly, as to the instructions to be placed on the ballots themselves, \u00a7 13-12-209, MCA, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">Paper ballots-stub size-content. (1) Paper ballots shall be printed on the same sheet with a stub, separated by perforation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-12\">(2) The stub shall extend the entire width of the ballot and have instructions printed on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-13\">(3) Upon the stub shall be printed the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-14\">This ballot should be marked with an \u201cx\u201d in the square before the name of each individual or candidate for whom the elector intends to vote. The elector may write in or affix a preprinted label in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>blank spaces or over any other name, the name of an individual for whom he wishes to vote and vote by marking an \u201cx\u201d in the square before the name.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b625 The record shows the statutory instructions given complied with \u00a7 13-13-112, MCA, and with \u00a7 13-12-209, MCA. Moreover, the record reflects that, in addition, the election administrators furnished each precinct a list of the proper names submitted by Paulsen, and that these proper names were available to any voter who might have further inquired of polling place election officials. In fact, three persons did inquire and were shown the list during absentee voting. \u00b626 The county election officials testified that, in their view, an actual posting of Paulsen\u2019s list of names would have violated Montana law regarding electioneering within a prohibited distance of polling places under \u00a7 13-35-211, MCA. We do not reach that question here, but it is, nevertheless, apparent that the record, as a whole, demonstrates that the election officials were familiar with the statutes governing the election and were attempting to follow those to the letter. Once again, if Paulsen believes that the laws should be changed, then his argument should be made to the legislature, not this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b627  Even though there is a strong tradition in Montana\u2019s jurisprudence to effectuate the \u201chonest choice of the electors,\u201d <em>Dickerman v. Gelsthorpe </em>(1897), 19 Mont. 249, 47 Pac. 999, 1001, the electors\u2019 marking must not be expressly forbidden by statute, and must be in substantial compliance with the law. <em>Peterson v. Billings </em>(1939), 109 Mont. 390, 96 P.2d 922. Here, the 37 rejected ballots did not substantially comply with the law governing write-in candidates, and it was, therefore, correct for the election judges to disallow these ballots and for the District Court to uphold the election officials\u2019 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b628 Finally, it bears noting that Paulsen was not blind-sided by the statutory requirements pertaining to his write-in candidacy. The record shows that he had considerable advance notice of the proper form of names required for write-in votes. In fact, Paulsen was sufficiently concerned about this matter that he contacted the local election administrator months before the election to inquire about proper form. He also pre-printed and distributed labels with a lawful form of his name so that voters could stick them on the ballot on election day. It appears from representative ballots in the record that some voters used these pre-printed stickers.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">\u00b629 Additionally, the county election administrator forwarded Paulsen\u2019s concerns about the proper form of names to the Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Secretary of State, who accurately cited the relevant statutes in correspondence to Paulsen\u2019s campaign staff as early as August 20,1998. The Secretary of State called specific attention to the requirement that write-in votes in declared candidacies must match one of the names furnished by the candidate. Again, Paulsen submitted 30 names, all of which had the requisite first name or a derivative or diminutive, along with Paulsen\u2019s last name with multiple spellings.</p>\n<p id=\"ARE\">\u00b630 Furthermore, Paulsen acknowledged in testimony before the District Court that an informed person alerted his campaign days before the election that county election officials were advising absentee voters that a write-in vote for Paulsen must have two names to be counted. Paulsen\u2019s argument that he did not add his first name to his widely-distributed signs because it was too difficult is hardly compelling. The record is clear that Paulsen deployed numerous forms of campaign advertising, including newspapers and electronic media, but apparently used none of that to alert potential voters to the basic requirement that two names must be used on ballots, even when he knew it was necessary. Paulsen was sufficiently concerned to inquire about the form each vote must take, and yet apparently ignored and failed to effectively disseminate to the electorate the fruits of his inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b631 In conclusion, we agree that the 37 ballots at issue were properly rejected by the election judges as failing to comply with the controlling statutes and we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b632 <em>Whether the District Court erred in awarding Huestis his attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\u00b633 Section 13-36-205, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">Recovery of costs. In any contest, the prevailing party may recover his costs, disbursements, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Costs, disbursements, and attorney\u2019s fees in all such cases shall be in the discretion of the court. In case judgment is rendered against the petitioner, it shall also be rendered against the sureties on the bond.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">\u00b634 Paulsen argues that attorney\u2019s fees are not warranted, and in the alternative, with no supporting authority, that \u00a7 13-36-204, MCA, which sets the requirements for posting bond in election contests, should establish a ceiling of $2,000 for the award of attorney\u2019s fees. Paulsen\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. The legislature has not imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>any arbitrary limits on the prevailing party\u2019s recovery of costs, disbursements and attorney\u2019s fees in an election contest, but, rather, has left that decision to the sound discretion of the trial court. Once again, if Paulsen wants the law changed, then his argument is with the legislative branch of government, not the judicial branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b635 Because \u00a7 13-36-205, MCA, places the award of attorney\u2019s fees within the trial court\u2019s discretion, our standard of review is whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Swenson v. Janke </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 354, 360, 908 P.2d 678, 682. Moreover, as Paulsen is also attempting, in the alternative, to reduce the award of fees, he is essentially questioning the reasonableness of the fees awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b636 In determining the reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees, the following factors are to be considered: (1) the amount and character of the services rendered; (2) the labor, time and trouble involved; (3) the character and importance of the litigation in which the services were rendered; (4) the amount of money or the value of the property affected; (5) the professional skill and experience called for; (6) the attorney\u2019s character and standing in the profession; and (7) the result secured by the services of the attorney. <em>Swenson v. Janke </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 354, 361, 908 P.2d 678, 682-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b637  We have previously held in an election contest for mayor where a total of 269 votes were cast that attorney\u2019s fees totaling $13,034.05 were reasonable. <em>Walker v. Higgins </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 443, 922 P.2d 1154. Here, in awarding attorney\u2019s fees totaling $4,582.14, the District Court reviewed the evidence presented and ruled consistently with the factors set forth above. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion. We affirm the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to Huestis as the prevailing party in Paulsen\u2019s election contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\u00b638 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b194-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES LEAPHART, REGNIER and GRAY.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-12\">.
