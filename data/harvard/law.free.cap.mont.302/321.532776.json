Bokma Farms contends that the District Court erred when it excluded evidence of Bokma Farms\u2019 anticipated profits from the leases. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">\u00b62 Bokma Farms is a Montana corporation that operates a farm in Pondera County, Montana. Ronald and Kay Bokma are its sole shareholders. The Montana Department of Natural Resources (\u201cDNRC\u201d) is the state administrative agency responsible for leasing agricultural land owned by the state of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">\u00b63 On January 17,1995, DNRC terminated Margaret J. Maclean and Maclean Ranch Partnership\u2019s (\u201cMaclean\u201d) lease to land in Pondera County under state lease Nos. 4896 and 7101 for failure to timely pay 1994 lease payments. DNRC advertised the leases for bid. Bokma Farms submitted bids for the leases and, on March 14,1995, DNRC notified Ron Bokma by telephone that Bokma Farms was the high bidder. On March 17,1995, Ron Bokma received a certified letter from DNRC notifying him that Bokma Farms was the high bidder and that DNRC was issuing the lease to Bokma Farms. After DNRC informed Ron Bokma that it had awarded Bokma Farms the leases, Ron Bokma and his employees gathered fertilizer and seed and moved equipment to the leased land in order to prepare for cultivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">\u00b64 DNRC subsequently determined that Maclean had timely paid the 1994 lease payment and that, therefore, it had erroneously terminated the Maclean leases. Ron Bokma learned that DNRC was reinstating the Maclean leases on April 10,1995. The State Board of Land Commissioners denied Bokma Farms\u2019 request for reconsideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>DNRC\u2019s decision to reinstate the Maclean leases. Importantly, written leases were never executed between DNRC and Bokma Farms.</p>\n<p id=\"ADE\">\u00b65 On August 6,1997, Bokma Farms filed a complaint against the State seeking damages for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. DNRC subsequently moved for summary judgment on both the contract and misrepresentation claims. Regarding the contract claim, DNRC argued that it was entitled to summary judgment because written leases were never executed by DNRC and Bokma Farms. In response, Bokma Farms properly conceded that DNRC was entitled to summary judgment on the contract claim but resisted summary judgment on the negligent misrepresentation claim. On April 19,1999, the District Court denied the State\u2019s request for summary judgment on Bokma Farms\u2019 negligent misrepresentation claim and granted summary judgment in favor of the State on Bokma Farms\u2019 breach of contract claim. On June 10, 1999, the State filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude evidence of Bokma Farms\u2019 alleged lost future profits from the leases. The District Court granted the State\u2019s motion in limine. The District Court held a trial on Bokma Farms\u2019 negligent misrepresentation claim on October 6, 1999. The court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order on October 27, 1999, concluding that DNRC negligently misrepresented that the Maclean leases were properly terminated; the leases were available for bid; and that those leases would be awarded to Bokma Farms. The court awarded damages to Bokma Farms in the amount of $700. Bokma Farms appeals the District Court\u2019s exclusion of evidence of its anticipated profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b66 The District Court\u2019s determination that Bokma Farms\u2019 damages for negligent misrepresentation do not include its anticipated profits is a conclusion of law which we review to determine whether it is correct. <em>See Boreen v. Christensen </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 405, 408, 884 P.2d 761, 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\u00b67 Whether the District Court erred when it concluded that Bokma Farms\u2019 was not entitled to the profits it anticipated receiving from the leases?</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\u00b68 In its Order on Defendant\u2019s Motion in Limine, the District Court excluded evidence regarding Bokma Farms\u2019 expected profits from the leases. The District Court stated, \u201cIn this case, Plaintiff\u2019s expectation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>of what [its] profits would have been from the lease, had [it] obtained it... [is] an expectancy of a pecuniary damage and [is] not recoverable as damages in a negligent misrepresentation case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b69 The State argues that the District Court correctly excluded evidence of \u201clost profits\u201d because pursuant to Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552B (1976) lost profits can never be awarded for negligent misrepresentation. We disagree. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552B, which provides the measure of damages for negligent misrepresentation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does not preclude an award of damages which in some instances can be properly characterized as lost profits. Section 552B specifically provides for the recovery of consequential damages sustained as a result of the plaintiff\u2019s justifiable reliance upon the defendant\u2019s negligent misrepresentation. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552B(l)(b) (1976). Section 552B does not preclude the possibility that consequential damages may include lost profits. If a plaintiff can prove that it lost profits on account of its justifiable reliance upon the defendant\u2019s negligent misrepresentations, and the plaintiff can also prove the amount of lost profits with reasonable certainty, we see no reason why lost profits should not be awarded as consequential damages for negligent misrepresentation. <em>See </em>Robert L. Dunn, <em>Recovery of Damages for Fraud </em>\u00a7 4.3 at 167 (2d ed. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b610 In fact, the illustrations of consequential damages in the Restatement appear to support claims for profits lost due to a defendant\u2019s negligent misrepresentation. Illustrations 1 and 2 of comment d under \u00a7 549 both appear to support an award of lost profits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For example, Illustration 2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">The A Automobile Company puts upon the market cars in part made by itself, in part consisting of parts bought elsewhere and assembled in the cars. B sells to the A Company a quantity of roller bearings by misrepresenting them to be X roller bearings. The X bearings are standard and high class bearings. The bearings sold are in fact inferior and not made by the X company. After these bearings have been assembled in a number of cars their true character is discovered and the cars are sold at a lesser price because the bearings are not the X bearings. The A Company is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>recover the depreciation in the sales value of its cars because of the inferior bearings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 549 cmt. d., illus. 2 (1976). The losses sustained by A Company are the profits it lost as a consequence of its reliance upon B\u2019s misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\u00b611  Bokma Farms is not entitled to the profits it expected to earn from anticipated but unexecuted leases because those anticipated profits were not lost as a consequence of Bokma Farms\u2019 reliance upon DNRC\u2019s misrepresentations. Losses caused by a negligent misrepresentation are those losses incurred by the plaintiff in justifiable reliance upon the defendant\u2019s misstatements. <em>See State Bank of Townsend v. Maryann\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 21, 33, 664 P.2d 295, 301 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552). DNRC\u2019s misrepresentations that the leases were available for bid and that it would award Bokma Farms the leases induced Bokma Farms to incur the following consequential damages: the costs incurred in preparing its bids and the costs incurred in preparing to cultivate the leased lands. The District Court properly awarded those damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\u00b612  Bokma Farms\u2019 loss of its anticipated profits from the leases was caused by the fact that it did not have an enforceable lease which would have entitled it to profits. Bokma Farms and DNRC never got to the point of executing a written lease for the property. Had such a lease been executed, no doubt Bokma Farms could have successfully maintained a claim for lost profits based on a breach of contract by DNRC. However, Bokma Farms correctly conceded in response to the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment that it could not maintain its contract claim and the District Court granted summary judgment on this claim in favor of the State. We also note that Bokma Farms is not contending that it failed to lease other ground by virtue of DNRC\u2019s conduct and somehow sustained lost profits or a missed opportunity. Accordingly, Bokma Farms is not entitled to damages due to lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">\u00b613 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b353-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, GRAY and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\">.
