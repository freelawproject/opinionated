The District Court entered a dispositional order pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-208, MCA. The dispositional order revoked Lesmeister\u2019s suspended commitment and sentenced Lesmeister to the Department of Corrections until the age of 25 with one year suspended. Lesmeister now appeals from the District Court\u2019s dispositional order on the grounds that it exceeded the sentencing authority of the District Court. We affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u00b62 The sole issue presented on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it revoked Lesmeister\u2019s suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\u00b63 The Youth Court for the Eighth Judicial District originally declared Jeremy Lesmeister a delinquent youth and a serious juvenile offender. Following a dispositional hearing on December 15,1997, the Youth Court entered a dispositional order convicting Lesmeister of felony escape, accountability for negligent arson, obstructing a police officer, misdemeanor assault, and felony common scheme theft. The Youth Court dispositional order simultaneously transferred Lesmeister\u2019s case to the District Court pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-208, MCA, and placed Lesmeister on formal probation until the age of 25. At the time of the dispositional order, Lesmeister was 18 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">\u00b64 On April 17,1998, the County Attorney for Cascade County filed a petition to revoke Lesmeister\u2019s probationary sentence. Following a hearing, the District Court issued an order for revocation of Lesmeister\u2019s deferred sentence. The District Court order committed Lesmeister to the Department of Corrections until he reached the age of 25, with the entire commitment suspended upon certain conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">\u00b65 On October 26,1998, the Cascade County Attorney filed a petition to revoke Lesmeister\u2019s suspended sentence. The petition alleged several violations of the terms of Lesmeister\u2019s suspended sentence. Following a hearing, the District Court recommitted Lesmeister to the Department of Corrections until age 25. The District Court again suspended Lesmeister\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">\u00b66 On September 29,1999, the Cascade County Attorney filed yet another petition to revoke Lesmeister\u2019s suspended sentence based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>further violations of the terms of his probation. On November 30, 1999, Lesmeister appeared in court and admitted eight different violations of the conditions of his probation. On December 28,1999, the District Court revoked Lesmeister\u2019s stispended sentence and thereby-committed him to the Department of Corrections until the age of 25, with one year suspended. The dispositional order of the District Court recommended that Lesmeister serve his time at boot camp, pre-release, or the Intensive Supervision Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">\u00b67 On February 11,2000, Lesmeister filed a Notice of Appeal which challenged the legality of the District Court\u2019s dispositional order of December 28,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err when it revoked Lesmeister\u2019s suspended sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">\u00b69 We review a criminal sentence to determine whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by statute. <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15. When a challenge to a district court\u2019s sentence involves a question of statutory interpretation, we review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law to determine whether that interpretation is correct. <em>Montoya, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">\u00b610 Lesmeister challenges the legality of the District Court\u2019s sentence on appeal. Lesmeister contends that because he was not incarcerated in a youth facility at the time his case was transferred to the District Court, the District Court\u2019s sentencing authority should have been limited to the provisions of \u00a7 41-5-208(4), MCA. Lesmeister further argues that pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-208(4), MCA, the District Court may only impose the conditions provided for pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201 through -203, MCA, which does not include a sentence to the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">\u00b611 Section 41-5-208(4), MCA, provides as follows: \u201cIf a youth whose case has been transferred to district court under this section violates a disposition previously imposed under 41-5-1512 or 41-5-1513, the district court may, after hearing, impose conditions as provided under 46-18-201 through 46-18-203.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">\u00b612  Section 46-18-201, MCA, provides that a district court may defer imposition of sentences, suspend execution of sentence, and may impose a sentence that includes a fine, order of payment of costs, or a term of incarceration at a county detention center or state prison. The statute also provides that the court imposing a sentence may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>commit an offender to the Department of Corrections where all but the first five years are suspended. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-201(3)(d)(i), MCA. Moreover, the district court may revoke a suspended sentence in favor of the sentence imposed where the judge finds that the offender has violated the terms and conditions of the suspended sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-203(7)(iii), MCA. Based on the plain language of the relevant statutes, we hold that the District Court had the statutory authority to revoke Lesmeister\u2019s suspended commitment to the Department of Corrections. Consequently, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b531-4\">JUSTICES GRAY, REGNIER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
