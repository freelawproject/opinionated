We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-16\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal can be restated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-17\">Did the District Court err in holding that a defense witness\u2019 gratuitous statement, offered in response to the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>cross-examination, opened the door for rebuttal character evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\u00b63 On October 21,1997, Gowan was charged by information with two counts of criminal sale of dangerous drugs, both felonies. At his arraignment, Gowan pled not guilty to both counts. On November 17, 1997, the District Court executed a preprinted form entitled Action Taken at Omnibus Hearing. In that form the State indicated that it would not rely upon Gowan\u2019s prior acts or convictions. Gowan indicated his intent to rely upon the defense of entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u00b64 A jury trial was held on March 2-3,1998. After opening statements, the parties again met with the District Court to discuss the admissibility of Gowan\u2019s prior peijury conviction and what evidence, if any, would be admissible should Gowan choose to testify. The District Court ruled that while direct evidence of a prior conviction was not admissible, the State would be permitted to ask Gowan, in the event he testified, only if he had lied under oath in the past. Once again, the District Court clarified that the State was not to make references to Gowan\u2019s prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\u00b65 At trial, Gowan called his girl friend, Kris McPherson (McPherson), as a witness. She was not designated as a character witness and on direct-examination McPherson offered no character testimony. On cross-examination, however, the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0B\">[Prosecutor]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">Q. Why didn\u2019t you tell him to go to the police, instead of selling drugs, to get the title to your car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">[McPherson]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-10\">A. Because I didn\u2019t tell him to sell drugs to get the title to the car. I actually told him the guy\u2019s melon -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYU\">(court reporter stops proceedings)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">A. Sorry. And then it wasn\u2019t until after everything had went down that I found out -1 never knew Paul\u2019s last name. I\u2019m in the car business, so I deal with all the car dealers in town. He had just told me about some car from Paul, paid him in full, and he hadn\u2019t got a title yet. And I couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d do that, but he\u2019s a very honest and trusting person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-12\">Q. Who\u2019s honest and trusting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-13\">A. Lance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-14\">Q. Lance is honest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>A. Yes. He trusted Mr. Southwick with the title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\">Q. What do you base that comment on, him being honest? Come on, Ms. McPherson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">A. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting at, Mr. Corrigan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">Q. Lance isn\u2019t honest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">[Defense Counsel]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">Mr. Musick: Objection, your honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">\u00b66 After argument of counsels, the District Court ruled that in light of our decision in <em>State v. Austad </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 70, 641 P.2d 1373, and under Rules 404(a)(1) and 405(a), M.R.Evid., that McPherson had offered character evidence. Therefore, the District Court concluded that McPherson had opened the door to character evidence, even though her testimony was in response to cross-examination. The State was allowed to inquire if McPherson was aware that Gowan had been convicted of perjury. The State also made references to Gowan being on probation and being sued for failure to deliver a title.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">\u00b67 The jury found Gowan guilty of both counts of criminal sale of dangerous drugs. Gowan filed an application for review of his sentence with the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court. After they carefully considered Gowan\u2019s application, the board affirmed his sentence with the modification that one year be suspended on count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">\u00b68 On May 19, 1998, Gowan, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a notice of appeal with the Clerk of the Montana Supreme Court, which was subsequently filed with the Clerk of the District Court, Flathead County, on May 28, 1998. The District Court also granted Gowan\u2019s request for the appointment of counsel and his request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Gowan now appeals his conviction to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. MacKinnon, </em>1998 MT 78, \u00b6 12, 288 Mont. 329, \u00b6 12, 957 P.2d 23, \u00b6 12 (not an abuse of discretion to prohibit cross-examination of the victim\u2019s mother about prior unrelated incidents of sexual assault). A district court is granted broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible. <em>MacKinnon, </em>\u00b6 12. If evidence has been improperly admitted, however, we will find reversible error based on prejudice to the defendant where there is a reasonable probability that the inadmissible evidence might have contributed to the conviction. <em>State v. Berger, </em>1998 MT 170, \u00b6 39, 290 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Mont. 78, \u00b6 39, 964 P.2d 725, \u00b6 39 (not an abuse of discretion to allow questions during redirect-examination about why the witness moved from town in order to give a complete impression. The jury is entitled to a complete explanation, even if that explanation reflects poorly upon the defendant.).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err in holding that a defense witness\u2019 gratuitous statement, offered in response to the State\u2019s cross-examination opened the door for rebuttal character evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u00b611  This issue requires us to address, for the first time, whether a gratuitous character statement made by a defense witness while being cross-examined by the State \u201copens the door\u201d to rebuttal character evidence. We conclude that although a defendant can open the door with statements made during either direct or cross-examination, and a defense witness can open the door on direct-examination, a defense witness cannot inadvertently open the door on cross-examination. Under Rule 404(a)(1), M.R.Evid.,only the accused can \u201copen the door\u201d for the prosecution to introduce rebuttal character evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\u00b612 Gowan argues that the District Court abused its discretion by allowing evidence of his perjury conviction in violation of its own pretrial order. He claims that this was inherently prejudicial, because he did not have the opportunity to adequately prepare for admission of this evidence. He alleges that he made critical decisions regarding both <em>voir dire </em>and trial strategy in reliance upon the District Court\u2019s pretrial order. Gowan cites <em>State v. Doll </em>(1985), 214 Mont. 390, 396-97, 692 P.2d 473, 476; and <em>State v. Howell </em>(1987), 226 Mont. 148, 152, 734 P.2d 214, 217, in support of this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">\u00b613 Gowan concedes that the State can enter rebuttal evidence of bad character if a defendant opens the door by first entering evidence of good character. He, however, argues that a non-character defense witness cannot place a defendant\u2019s character at issue with statements made in response to the State\u2019s cross-examination, because only the defendant can place his character at issue and thus open the door for the State\u2019s rebuttal. Gowan argues that his situation is distinguishable from <em>Austad. </em>He points out that <em>in Austad, </em>the accused himself made unnecessary, self-serving statements which he knew to be untrue. While in his case his witness inadvertently commented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>that he was honest and trusting in explaining how he could have been duped by the State\u2019s informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u00b614 Gowan argues that his case is closer to <em>State v. Webb </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 248, 255, 828 P.2d 1351, 1356; and <em>State v. Harris </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 405, 410, 808 P.2d 453, 456. In those cases we held that it was improper for the State to open its own door so it could then enter evidence of good character to rehabilitate its own witness. Gowan claims that allowing a witness to open the door on cross-examination would discourage defendants, with a criminal history, from calling witnesses who could provide crucial testimony about a limited aspect or element of the alleged crime. He further asserts that in virtually every case, the State could devise some strategy to elicit character testimony from a witness and open the door to present impeachment evidence or rebuttal testimony of bad character. On cross-examination, the State is in control of the witness and able to substantially prejudice the defendant with one question.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u00b615 The State counters that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed the State to cross-examine a defense witness regarding Gowan\u2019s prior pexjury conviction after the witness testified that Gowan was honest. The State claims that Rules 404(a) and 405(a), M.R.Evid., allow the State to inquire into relevant specific instances of conduct once the defense offers a pertinent trait of the defendant\u2019s character. The State argues that this also applies to statements made by defense witnesses on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b616 The State argues that this case is similar to <em>Austad. </em>In that case the defendant answered a cross-examination question with an unnecessary, self-serving statement. Here, the witness testified that Gowan was honest when the State cross-examined her. The State asserts that her answer was an unnecessary, self-serving statement which, as further questioning revealed, she knew to be untrue, but which obviously placed Gowan in a better light with the jury. Therefore, she opened the door to Gowan\u2019s character by testifying that he was honest.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\u00b617 The State attempts to lend credence to this argument by saying that once the statement was made it was necessary to counter it\u2019s effect on the jury. In support, the State cites \u00a3\u00a3[t]he right of cross-examination extends not only to all facts stated by the witness in his original examination, but to all other facts connected with them, whether directly or indirectly, which tend to enlighten the jury upon the question in controversy.... As a general rule, in the interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>of truth and justice, a wide latitude should be permitted, in the cross-examination of an adverse witness; or as otherwise stated, a full cross-examination should be permitted.\u201d <em>State v. McKnight </em>(1955), 129 Mont. 8, 20, 281 P.2d 816, 822 (citing <em>State v. Howard </em>(1904), 30 Mont. 518, 527, 77 P. 50, 54 and 70 C. J., <em>Witnesses, </em>\u00a7 792 at 619) overruled on other grounds by <em>State v. Wirtanen </em>(1965), 146 Mont. 268, 406 P.2d 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b6 18  The right to a full cross-examination of a defendant\u2019s character traits, once placed at issue, is not limitless. <em>State v. Eklund </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 420, 430, 872 P.2d 323, 329 (it was reversible error for the State to cross-examine defendant\u2019s character witness about the defendant\u2019s prior murder charges to rebut his nonviolent character evidence); <em>State v. Heine </em>(1976), 169 Mont. 25, 29, 544 P.2d 1212, 1214 (\u201cthe accused\u2019s entire life should not be searched in an effort to convict him.\u201d). Further, where the defendant has not opened the door regarding a pertinent character trait, the State is not allowed to inquire on cross-examination into relevant, specific instances of conduct. Rule 404(a), M.R.Evid.; <em>United States v. Park </em>(5th Cir. 1976), 525 F.2d 1279, 1283 (where the prosecution elicited testimony from two witnesses that was beyond the scope of direct-examination). Unless and until the accused places his character at issue, the door is closed for the State to enter evidence of a defendant\u2019s character because the dangers of prejudice, confusion, and time-consumption outweigh the probative value, <em>see, </em>1 John W. Strong et al., McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 190, at 658-59 (5th ed. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b619  Generally, a defendant\u2019s character or character trait is not admissible in criminal cases to prove that the defendant acted in conformity with that trait. Rule 404(a), M.R.Evid. \u201cThe inquiry is not rejected because character is irrelevant; on the contrary, it is said to weigh too much with the jury and to so overpersuade [sic] them as to prejudge one with a bad general record and deny him a fair opportunity to defend against a particular charge.\u201d <em>Michelson v. United States </em>(1948), 335 U.S. 469, 475-76, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168. In other words, persons of bad character are more likely to commit crimes than are persons of good character, but the law fears that a defendant will be convicted merely because he is an unsavory person.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u00b620 The various justifications for this general rule are reducible to three: (1) the strong tendency to believe a defendant is guilty of the offense charged merely because he is a likely person to do such acts because of his distasteful propensities; (2) the deep tendency of human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>nature to condemn, not because a defendant is guilty of the offense charged, but because he is a bad person who has escaped punishment from past transgressions and may as well be punished now that he is caught; and (3) the overwhelming burden of requiring a defendant to not only defend against the offense charged but also allegations of bad conduct from his whole past. 1A Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 58.2, at 1215 (Tiller rev. 1983). Or put simply, character evidence is excluded to prevent undue prejudice, confusion of issues, and unfair surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"AGB\">\u00b621 Justice Jackson rightfully described the law regarding proof of a criminal defendant\u2019s character as \u201carchaic, paradoxical and full of compromises and compensations by which an irrational advantage to one side is offset by a poorly reasoned counterprivilege to the other.\u201d <em>Michelson, </em>335 U.S. at 486, 69 S.Ct. 213. It extends \u201chelpful but illogical options to a defendant\u201d but then balances these with \u201cequally illogical conditions to keep the advantage from becoming an unfair and unreasonable <em>one\u201dMichelson, </em>335 U.S. at 478-79, 69 S.Ct. 213. Even saying that the defendant placed his character at issue is misleading. The defendant\u2019s character does not become an element of the offense. Rather, the defendant is attempting to prove his innocence through circumstantial evidence. Likewise, the State attempts to establish that the defendant\u2019s bad propensities make his guilt of the charged crime more probable.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b622  Because character evidence is relevant in resolving probabilities of guilt, however, the law allows a defendant to introduce evidence of his good character. Rule 404(a)(1), M.R.Evid.; see, 1 Christopher B. Mueller &amp; Laird C. Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence \u00a7 101, at 544 (2nd ed. 1994). \u201cHe may introduce affirmative testimony that the general estimate of his character is so favorable that the jury may infer that he would not be likely to commit the offense charged.\u201d <em>Michelson, </em>335 U.S. at 476, 69 S.Ct. 213. But in doing so, he may be opening the door to irresponsible gossip, innuendo and smear.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b623  Once the door is opened, the State may introduce rebuttal evidence of its version of the defendant\u2019s true character. Rule 404(a)(1), M.R.Evid; <em>State v. Baker </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 156, 159, 815 P.2d 587, 589. The State may accomplish this by either cross-examining the defendant\u2019s character witness or by calling rebuttal witnesses of its own. Rule 405(a), M.R.Evid; <em>State v. D.B.S. </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 234, 245-46, 700 P.2d 630, 637-38 (cross-examining a character witness) overruled on other grounds by <em>State v. Olson </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 364, 951 P.2d 571; <em>State v. Anderson </em>(1984), 211 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Mont. 272, 292, 686 P.2d 193, 204 (use of a rebuttal witness). In establishing bad character, the State may enter evidence of both reputation and opinion. <em>State v. Clark </em>(1984), 209 Mont. 473, 489, 682 P.2d 1339, 1348. \u201c[I]t is not the man that he is, but the name that he has which is put in issue.\u201d <em>Michelson, </em>335 U.S. at 479. For these reasons, only the defendant is allowed to make the precarious decision to put character at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b624 We have held that a defendant put his character at issue by answering a question on cross-examination with an unnecessary, self-serving statement which he knew to be untrue, intended to place him in a better light with the jury. In that situation, the door is open for the prosecution to rebut this gratuitous character testimony by the defendant. <em>Austad, </em>197 Mont. at 90, 641 P.2d at 1384. We concluded that \u201c[t]he Rules of Evidence were not intended to muzzle the State against [a] defendant\u2019s deliberate attempts to mislead jury members by lying to them in answering specific question.\u201d <em>Austad, </em>197 Mont. at 90, 641 P.2d at 1384. The case at bar, however, involves statements that the defendant had no control over.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b625 Here, Gowan\u2019s witness offered no character testimony on direct-examination. On cross-examination, however, this defense witness gave a non-responsive answer which contained a gratuitous good character statement about Gowan. She said \u201cbut he\u2019s a very honest and trusting person.\u201d The State should have requested that the witness confine her answers to the questions asked, and requested that her statement be stricken from the record. Instead the State pounced on this opportunity to introduce evidence of bad character. The District Court, relying on our decision in <em>Austad, </em>concluded that this opened the door for the State to pursue rebuttal character evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b626 The facts here are distinguishable from those of <em>Austad. </em>In <em>Austad, </em>the defendant opened the door with his own statements. Something he had total control over. He attempted to enter testimony of his good character and he paid the price. Gowan, conversely, had no control over what his witness said while being cross-examined by the State. The State cannot elect to convert a defense witness, who has neither been called as a character witness nor testified of good character on direct-examination, into a character witness. 2 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence \u00a7 404.11[2][b], at 404-25 (Joseph M. McLaughlin ed., 2nd ed. 2000). Because of the deep tendency of human nature to give evidence of bad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>character much weight in assigning guilt, only the accused are allowed to open that door.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b627  Since only a defendant can open the door to rebuttal character evidence, the District Court erred in holding that a defense witness could in a statement made during cross- examination. Something Gowan had no control over. Because this issue is dispositive, we need not address the other issues Gowan raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b628 Gowan\u2019s conviction is reversed and his case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b164-6\">JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"Af\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"ApU\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u00b629 In this case the majority announce a new rule of criminal procedure. Hereafter, if, in a criminal trial, a defense witness, on cross-examination, gratuitously testifies or answers in a non-responsive manner and in so doing vouches for the defendant\u2019s good character when the defendant has not otherwise placed his character in issue, the prosecution must stand mute. The State may not cross-examine further regarding the witness\u2019s character testimony and the State may not offer rebuttal character testimony. Rather, the State may only request the court to direct the witness to confine her answers to the questions asked and request that the offending statements be stricken from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\u00b630 The majority\u2019s articulation and adoption of this new rule suffers from a fundamental flaw. There is no legal authority to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"APj\">\u00b631 The majority start with the statement at \u00b6 11, that \u201c[ujnder Rule 404(a)(1), M.R.Evid., only the accused can \u2018open the door\u2019 for the prosecution to introduce rebuttal character evidence.\u201d Actually, Rule 404(a)(1), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">(a) Character evidence generally. Evidence of a person\u2019s character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az19\">(1) Character of accused. Evidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APR\">The plain language of the Rule allows the State to rebut evidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused. The Rule itself places no limitations on how (intentionally or inadvertently) or when (on direct examination or on cross-examination) the accused puts his character in issue. Moreover, the Rule does not restrict the accused from putting his character in issue through his own witness. Indeed, as here, should the accused put his character at issue through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>statements of his witness on cross-examination, then the plain language of Rule 404(a)(1) allows the State to question and to rebut that evidence. The majority improperly read into the Rule limitations and restrictions that are simply not there. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA (office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained in a statute \u2014 not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has be inserted).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b632 Next, the majority cite various cases in support of its creative interpretation of Rule 404(a)(1). Again, however, the cited authorities fail to support the Court\u2019s decision. In <em>State v. Harris </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 405, 808 P.2d 453, there was no Rule 404(a)(1) issue at all and no claim that the State improperly put the defendant\u2019s character at issue. <em>Harris </em>involved but three issues: whether the State\u2019s expert witness improperly commented on the credibility of an alleged victim who testified at trial (Harris, 252 Mont. at 407, 808 P.2d at 454); whether the trial court erred in allowing the State\u2019s expert to identify the defendant as the perpetrator by allowing the expert to testify as to hearsay statements made by the alleged victims during therapy (Harris, 252 Mont. at 408, 808 P.2d at 454); and whether the district court erred in granting the jury\u2019s request to have the alleged victim\u2019s testimony read during deliberations <em>(Harris, </em>247 Mont at 408, 808 P.2d at 454). Not only was the factual underpinning for the legal issues framed in <em>Harris </em>entirely different from that in the instant case, but, more importantly, Rule 404(a)(1) and the defendant\u2019s character were never at issue at all. In fact, Rule 404(a)(1) is never even mentioned in the <em>Harris </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b633 Likewise, in <em>State v. Webb </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 248, 828 P.2d 1351, there was no issue involving the prosecutor improperly placing the defendant\u2019s character in issue. Webb, 252 Mont. at 250-51, 828 P.2d at 1353. The only even remotely similar issue involved the State\u2019s attack on the character of a defense witness and its violation of Rule 608(a), M.R.Evid. <em>Webb, </em>252 Mont. at 255-57, 828 P.2d at 1355-57. Citing <em>Harris, </em>we condemned the State for opening the door for opinion testimony regarding the witness\u2019s veracity and then attacking the witness\u2019s character. <em>Webb, </em>252 Mont. at 256-57, 828 P.2d at 356-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b634 That, of course, did not happen in the case at bar. Here, the prosecutor did not open the door to the defendant\u2019s character. Rather, Gowan\u2019s own witness, McPherson, through her gratuitous, non-responsive and perjurious answer to the State\u2019s proper cross-examination put his character in issue. Under the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>rule, Rule 404(a)(1), the prosecution was entitled to rebut this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b635 Obviously, neither <em>Harris </em>nor <em>Webb </em>support the majority\u2019s rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b636 Moreover, while Gowan argues these cases for the proposition that \u201cin virtually every case the State could devise some strategy to elicit character testimony from a witness and open the door to present impeachment evidence or rebuttal testimony of bad character\u201d it is undisputed that that is not the fact situation presented in the instant case. There is not one scintilla of evidence in the record that the prosecution devised any strategy to elicit or to open the door to the testimony that McPherson offered. Again, Gowan\u2019s witness took it upon herself to gratuitously bolster his character by presenting testimony known to be untrue through a non-responsive answer to the State\u2019s legitimate cross-examination questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u00b637 Indeed, in \u201cpouncing\u201d on Gowan\u2019s paranoid speculation as to the potential for machinations of character evidence by the State, the majority create an equally untenable situation. Now, in virtually every case, <em>the defendant </em>can devise some strategy to elicit favorable character testimony from his witness during cross-examination knowing that the State will not be able to rebut the evidence once it is placed before the jury. To the extent they apply at all, <em>Webb </em>and <em>Harris </em>already protect a defendant from the very sort of improper conduct that is of concern to Gowan. These cases do not, however, support the new rule created by the <em>majority from </em>whole cloth in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AC5\">\u00b638 Similarly, <em>United States v. Park </em>(5th Cir. 1976), 525 F.2d 1279, is inapposite. There the court determined that the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination of the witness was \u201cnot only beyond the scope of direct examination [but was] also irrelevant to the issues before the court, improper, and highly prejudicial.\u201d <em>Park, </em>525 F.2d at 1283. Again, that is not what happened in Gowan\u2019s trial. Here the State was properly cross-examining Gowan\u2019s witness and <em>she </em>put in the good character testimony by an unresponsive and knowingly untruthful answer to the State\u2019s question. Under this fact scenario, <em>Park </em>is contra to the majority\u2019s holding in allowing the examiner to rebut improper testimony offered by the witness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">The restrictive rule [prohibiting cross-examination from exceeding the scope of direct examination] does not foreclose inquiries designed to impeach a witness, by, for example, attacking his reliability and credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>Park, </em>525 P.2d at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b639 <em>State v. Eklund </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 420, 872 P.2d 323, is not on point either. In that case we reversed based on the State attacking the defendant\u2019s good character evidence by cross-examination of a defense witness with information that the defendant had been <em>charged </em>with murder when, in fact, he had only been <em>convicted </em>of manslaughter. <em>Eklund, </em>264 Mont. at 429-30, 872 P.2d at 328-29. We did not prohibit the State from rebutting knowingly untruthful good character evidence gratuitously offered by a defense witness. That was not even an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b640 <em>State v. Heine </em>(1976), 169 Mont. 25, 544 P.2d 1212, also cited by the majority, likewise does not buttress its rationale. There, the issue was the remoteness of the prosecution\u2019s impeachment evidence as to the defendant\u2019s good character. We concluded that the impeachment offered was not too remote \u2014 i.e., not an improper search of the defendant\u2019s entire life in an effort to convict him . <em>Heine, </em>169 Mont. at 29, 544 P.2d at 1214. Of course, there was no \u201csearching of the defendant\u2019s entire life\u201d by the State\u2019s cross-examination of McPherson in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u00b641 More importantly, however, in <em>Heine </em>we adhered to the rule that the majority ignore in the case at bar.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">When the accused calls a witness to support his generally good reputation in the community, he opens the door to all legitimate cross-examination of that witness and must therefore accept the consequences which result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-8\"><em>Heine, </em>169 Mont. at 28, 544 P.2d at 1214 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">\u00b642 Again, neither <em>Park, Eklund </em>nor <em>Heine </em>can be legitimately cited as justification for the majority\u2019s unprecedented, court-created rule of evidence in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">\u00b643 In like fashion, the Court\u2019s discussion commencing at \u00b6\u00b6 19-22 is simply a red herring. No one disputes the good reasons for normally not allowing evidence of bad character. That, however, is not the issue. Here, the State did not first put the defendant\u2019s character in issue by offering adverse character evidence. Rather, Gowan\u2019s claim of good character was first injected into the trial by <em>his </em>witness. His witness \u201copened the door\u201d via her untruthful, gratuitous and non-responsive answer to the prosecutor\u2019s question. Once the door is opened, Rule 404(a)(1) allows, as it should, the State to rebut that evidence (the majority\u2019s misreading of the Rule to the contrary) as do Montana\u2019s cases cited at \u00b6 23 of the majority opinion. There is, however, nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>in these authorities supporting the Court\u2019s statement that \u201conly the defendant is allowed to make the precarious decision to put character at issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b644 Finally, I note that in our case law, we repeatedly emphasize those aspects of trial practice and procedure which enhance the \u201csearch for truth.\u201d <em>See, e.g., State v. Waters </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 490, 495, 743 P.2d 617, 620 (the purpose of Montana\u2019s discovery scheme is to enhance the search for truth); <em>State v. Dezeeuw, </em>1999 MT 331, \u00b6 16, 297 Mont. 379, \u00b6 16, 992 P.2d 1276, \u00b6 16 (holding that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of defendant\u2019s eyewitness to the altercation, when his only defense was self-defense, hindered the search for truth and therefore was an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion); <em>Billings Leasing Co. v. Payne </em>(1978), 176 Mont. 217, 225, 577 P.2d 386, 390-91 (quoting from Wright &amp; Miller that it is the \u201cinescapable duty of the trial judge to instruct the jurors, fully and correctly, on the applicable law of the case, and to guide, direct, and assist them toward an intelligent understanding of the legal and factual issues involved in their search for truth\u201d); <em>State v. Jones </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 121, 128, 923 P.2d 560, 564 (counsel\u2019s duties of loyalty and confidentiality are compatible with the search for truth).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b645 Frankly, I am hard pressed to understand how the \u201csearch for truth\u201d is advanced by a rule which requires the State\u2019s counsel to stand like a deer in the headlights after the defendant\u2019s own witness, through no misconduct of the prosecutor, perjuriously misleads the jury as to the defendant\u2019s character during the State\u2019s proper cross-examination of the witness. The majority\u2019s new rule is not only without any underpinning legal authority, it is patently unfair. It protects no one but liars.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b646 I can find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s ruling that the defendant\u2019s witness, McPherson, offered character testimony which the State was entitled to rebut. I would affirm Gowan\u2019s conviction. I dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b168-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICE GRAY concur in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
