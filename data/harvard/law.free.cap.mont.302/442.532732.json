The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court denied Wallace\u2019s petition and Wallace appeals from that decision. We affirm the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">\u00b62 The sole issue raised on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">\u00b63 Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err when it held that the State Fund was not required to comply with the steps set forth in <em>Coles v. Seven Eleven Stores </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 343, 704 P.2d 1048, or the 14-day notice requirement of \u00a7 39-71-609, MCA (1981) prior to converting Wallace\u2019s temporary total disability benefits to permanent partial disability benefits?</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">\u00b64 At the time of his work-related injury, the Claimant, Carl Wallace was employed by Professional Farm Systems, primarily \u201cselling grain handling equipment and storage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">\u00b65 On May 21,1982, he suffered a herniated inter-vertebral disc in his lower back while delivering a grain bin to a farmer. Wallace filed a claim with the Respondent, State Fund. The Fund accepted liability and began paying him temporary total disability benefits in 1983. Wallace continued to experience pain. He was evaluated at the Mayo Clinic in 1985 and 1993. The diagnosis was an early onset of arachnoiditis causing fixation of the lumbar roots, leading to friction with spine movement and radicular pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">\u00b66 In May 1985, Wallace attempted to go back to work. The State Fund converted his benefits to permanent partial disability benefits, but resumed paying him total temporary disability benefits when he was forced to quit in November 1985 due to his back injury. In 1986, Wallace received training to be a real estate salesperson. His doctors determined that real estate would provide a healthy working environment within his physical limitations. Additionally, in November 1986, the State Fund requested that Dr. David Friedrick examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Wallace to evaluate his medical impairment. Dr. Friedrick found that he had reached maximum medical improvement and provided a 5 percent impairment rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b67 Wallace obtained his realtor\u2019s license and began working at Bison Realty on April 2,1987. After Wallace received his first commission from a real estate sale, the State' Fund reduced his payments to the partial disability rate. The State Fund admitted that Friedrick\u2019s report affected this decision but that they had not notified Wallace of Friedrick\u2019s report. He did not receive notice of Dr. Friedrick\u2019s diagnosis until 1997 when it was produced as part of the discovery in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b68 After petitioning the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for retroactive payments of his temporary total disability benefits, Wallace and the State Fund agreed to allow the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court decide the issues presented as a matter of law. Wallace filed a Motion for Summary Judgment to which the State Fund responded. The Court denied Wallace\u2019s motion, and held that the State Fund properly reduced Wallace\u2019s benefit rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\u00b69 Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err when it held that the State Fund was not required to comply with the steps set forth in <em>Coles v. Seven Eleven Stores </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 343, 704 P.2d 1048, or the 14-day notice requirement of \u00a7 39-71-609, MCA (1981), prior to converting Wallace\u2019s temporary total disability benefits to permanent partial disability benefits?</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">\u00b610 The issues in this case were submitted to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court as issues of law. We review the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law to decide whether they were correctly decided. <em>Stordalend v. Ricci\u2019s Food Farm </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 256, 258 862 P.2d 393, 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">\u00b6 11  Wallace first contends that the State Fund failed to comply with the third and fourth requirements set out in <em>Coles. </em>In <em>Wood v. Consolidated Freightways, Inc. </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 26, 30, 808 P.2d 502, 505, this Court clarified the <em>Coles </em>criteria and held that before an insurer can reduce benefits it must obtain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">(1) a physician\u2019s determination that the claimant is as far restored as the permanent character of his injuries will permit, (2) a physician\u2019s determination of claimant\u2019s physical restrictions resulting from an industrial accident, (3) a physician\u2019s determination based on his knowledge of the claimant\u2019s former duties, that the claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>can return to work, with or without restrictions, on the job for which he is fitted by age, education, work experience, and physical condition and (4) notice to the claimant....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b612 Wallace contends that the State Fund violated the <em>Coles </em>requirements because it failed to inform Dr. Friedrick of Wallace\u2019s job history. In addition, Wallace points out that he was not notified of Dr. Friedrick\u2019s medical opinion that Wallace had reached maximum medical recovery. Wallace now claims that these omissions by the State Fund require that it continue to pay Wallace total disability benefits until the State Fund complies with the <em>Coles </em>requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b613 In response, the State Fund contends that it is not required to comply with the <em>Coles </em>criteria because Wallace returned to work as a real estate salesperson in 1987. In <em>Larson v. CIGNA Insurance Company </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 283, 915 P.2d 863, we held that \u201cthe insurer can rightfully terminate temporary total benefits without proceeding with an investigation under \u00a7 39-71-609 ... [sjince the duty of investigation was statutorily discharged, the <em>Coles </em>criteria do not apply.\u201d <em>Larson, </em>276 Mont. at 294, 915 P.2d at 870. Our decision in <em>Larson </em>applies when a claimant returns to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u00b614 The record in this case establishes that Wallace did return to work. He began work as a real estate agent in 1987. Since then, he worked an average of 30 hours per week. In addition, he did spot jobs for the U.S.D.A. from 1987 to 1997. Therefore, we conclude that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not err when it held that the State Fund was not required to comply with the <em>Coles </em>procedures before reducing Wallace\u2019s benefit rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\u00b615  Next, Wallace contends that the State Fund failed to comply with the statutory requirements set out in \u00a7 39-71-609, MCA (1981) which requires that \u201can insurer must give 14 days\u2019 written notice to the claimant before reducing benefits from total to partial.\u201d Section 39-71-609, MCA (1981). However, Wallace overlooks the additional provision which states that \u201cbenefits may be terminated as of the time the claimant has returned to work.\u201d Section 39-71-609(1), MCA (1981). Wallace returned to work as a real estate agent in April 1987. His benefits were not reduced until he realized income from that work. Therefore, we conclude that the 14-day notice requirement in \u00a7 39-71-609(1), MCA (1981) does not apply to the reduction of his benefits. Contrary to Wallace\u2019s argument, we conclude that the exception to the 14-day notice requirement upon which we base our decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>does not require that Wallace be \u201cemployed\u201d or earn \u201cwages\u201d as defined in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\u00b616 For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b474-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
