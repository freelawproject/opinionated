We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u00b62 Dodson and Azure are jointly represented on appeal by the same counsel, while Vannatta is represented by her own counsel. Thus, two separate sets of briefs were filed by the parties referred to herein as the Appellants. Although framed differently, the issues on appeal can be consolidated and restated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">1. Did the District Court err in granting Infinity Insurance Company\u2019s prayer for Interpleader?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">2. Did the District Court err by not ruling that the policy issued by Infinity Insurance Company was ambiguous and therefore unenforceable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">3. Did the District Court err in determining that Montana\u2019s vehicle insurance omnibus statutes do not require separate, full coverage for multiple insureds where each insured is liable for independent acts of negligence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">\u00b63 This case arose as the result of a December 7,1997 one-car rollover accident near Havre, Montana, in which Dodson, Azure and Josh Shelstad were injured and the driver, Jessica Vannatta, was killed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The vehicle was owned by Paul R. Christeck (Christeck) and insured under his policy with Infinity, for the statutory mandatory minimum liability amount of $50,000 per accident involving two or more in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>jured persons. Jessica Vannatta, an unlicensed 16-year-old with little driving experience, allegedly used Christeck\u2019s Ford Bronco with his permission on the day the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b64 In the underlying action, Dodson, Azure, and Vannatta (Jessica\u2019s mother, who is serving as personal representative on behalf of Jessica\u2019s estate) alleged that Christeck negligently entrusted his motor vehicle to Jessica, and is therefore legally liable for their injuries. Dodson and Azure have further alleged that Jessica negligently operated Christeck\u2019s vehicle at the time of the accident, and is therefore legally liable for their injuries as well. (Shelstad did not appear and a judgment by default was entered against him.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b65 On November 16,1998, Infinity and Vannatta moved for summary judgment, and on November 13,1998, Dodson and Azure moved for declaratory judgment, which the District Court treated as summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b66 Relevant to the District Court\u2019s summary judgment inquiry were the terms of Christeck\u2019s policy with Infinity. Specifically, Christeck\u2019s policy provided him up to $50,000 in the event an \u201cinsured\u201d was found legally liable for bodily injuries sustained in an accident involving more than one person. At issue, however, was whether this limit applied to not only him, but the driver (Jessica Vannatta) as well, meaning that Infinity by the terms of its policy would have to pay up to $50,000 on behalf of Christeck, and another $50,000 on behalf of Vannatta, for their separate acts of negligence. The Appellants maintained that the policy was ambiguous in defining \u201caccident,\u201d and therefore should rightfully be construed in their favor. This theory was premised on the contention that Jessica Vannatta\u2019s negligence and Christeck\u2019s negligent entrustment constituted two separate \u201caccidents\u201d under the terms of the policy. Thus, Christeck\u2019s policy with Infinity should provide $100,000 total in liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b67 Another theory advanced by Appellants was that regardless of the language of the Infinity policy, state omnibus laws require that all insureds must carry the mandatory minimum coverage, including \u201cpermissive drivers\u201d such as Jessica Vannatta. They contended that by limiting its liability to a maximum of $50,000 where more than one insured may be liable, the terms of Infinity\u2019s policy contravened state law as well as public policy under Montana\u2019s Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act. Appellants maintained that under the undisputed facts, state law should be construed to require that $100,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>of liability coverage be made available to the injured parties under Christeck\u2019s policy with Infinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b68 Infinity, on the other hand, in its May 6,1998 Complaint for Interpleader, requested that upon payment of $50,000 into the court, it should be dismissed with prejudice as a party from all claims arising from the accident. Infinity recognized that its policy limit of $50,000 would be paid, and requested that the parties and court proceed (without Infinity as a named party) to determine to whom and in what amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b69 Infinity claimed that both its policy as well as state law is clear: $50,000 is the total coverage available for one accident, and that the number of insureds found liable under these facts is irrelevant. The policy issued by Infinity to Christeck states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">We will pay damages, except for punitive or exemplary damages, up to the policy limit shown on the Declarations Page, for which an insured person is legally liable because of bodily injury or property damage resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of your insured car or non-owned car. The bodily injury or property damage must be caused by an accident and not be expected nor intended from the stand point of the insured person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">It is undisputed that under the policy both Christeck and Jessica Vannatta were an \u201cinsured.\u201d The policy later provides, however, that Infinity would not pay more than the maximum limit of liability regardless of the number of \u201cinsured persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\u00b610 Following a hearing, the District Court entered its order granting summary judgment to Infinity on February 1,1999, which it certified as a final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">\u00b611 The court acknowledged that no facts were in dispute, and therefore what remained were purely legal determinations. The court first determined that the Infinity policy was not ambiguous. \u201cAny reasonable person, with no legal training, but a working knowledge of the English language, is informed that no matter how many persons are considered insureds, and no matter how many people are injured in an accident, the policy limit is $50,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">\u00b612 The court further stated that it would be \u201ca stretch of the word \u2018accident\u2019 that in this incident there were in fact two accidents that triggered separate coverage, i.e. the negligent entrustment and the rollover.\u201d Although the term \u201caccident\u201d was not expressly defined, the court observed that the policy provided that: \u201cAll bodily injury and property damage arising out of continuous or repeated exposure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>substantially the same general conditions shall be considered out of one (1) accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b613 The court also took note of the policy provisions that stated that the $50,000 liability limit \u201cis the maximum we will pay as damages for all bodily injury to two (2) or more persons in any one accident,\u201d and that Infinity would pay no more than this maximum regardless \u201cof the number of vehicles described on the Declarations Page, insured persons, claims, or policies, or vehicles involved in the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b6 14 In construing Montana\u2019s mandatory vehicle insurance laws, the court stated that \u00a7\u00a7 61-6-103 and 301, MCA, are not directed at insurance companies; rather, compliance is directed at vehicle users and owners, and therefore does not affect Infinity\u2019s obligations. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">In this instance, both the owner and the permissive user are clearly insured as required. Payment of the limit of the policy does not leave either uninsured, it exhausts the insurance amount. The required amount of insurance is provided. While the limit is probably too low for 1997-99 costs, it is what the legislature fixed. It is not for the courts to increase it by strained interpretations of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u00b615 The court granted Infinity\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and ordered that upon payment of $50,000 to the court, Infinity would be dismissed as a party, and that its prayers for relief under its Complaint for Interpleader were granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">\u00b616 This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">\u00b617 This Court reviews an order granting summary judgment under Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., by utilizing the same criteria as the district court. <em>See Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903. Summary judgment is a remedy which should be granted when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. The procedure should never be substituted for trial if a material factual controversy exists. <em>See Payne Realty v. First Sec. Bank </em>(1992), 256 Mont. 19, 24, 844 P.2d 90, 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">\u00b618 When we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law, our standard of review is plenary and we must determine whether the court\u2019s conclusions are correct as a matter of law. <em>See Hicklin v. CSC Logic, Inc. </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 298, 301, 940 P.2d 447, 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u00b619 Appellants\u2019 challenge to the District Court\u2019s interpretation of Montana\u2019s Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act, enacted by the Legislature in 1951, raises a question of first impression: whether each insured under one policy, who are both found legally liable for causing one accident, must each be covered by the mandatory limits provided under \u00a7 61-6-103, MCA. In light of the unwavering principles that the Act serves to protect the \u201cgeneral traveling public\u201d from uncompensated injury (see <em>Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. Davis </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 166, 173, 752 P.2d 166, 171), and that its omnibus provisions must be \u201cliberally construed so as to effectuate the manifest public policy of broadening the insurance coverage\u201d (see <em>Cascade Ins. Co. v. Glacier Gen. Ins. Co. </em>(1971), 156 Mont. 236, 242, 479 P.2d 259, 262), we must determine whether the ends of these principles justify imposing a greater financial obligation on vehicle insurers, as well as insureds, than has previously been presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u00b620 By no means has this question been settled elsewhere, in other states where legislatures have similarly mandated that all vehicle owners carry minimum levels of liability insurance to cover the damage inflicted on persons and property resulting from accidents. To the contrary, a sharp polarity exists from jurisdiction to jurisdiction where divided courts have been obliged to construe fairly uniform legislation governing mandatory liability insurance that includes coverage for permissive users of an owner\u2019s vehicle. <em>See GRE Ins. Group v. Green </em>(Ariz.Ct.App. 1999), 980 P.2d 963, 966 (holding that omnibus statute requiring $15,000 minimum per-person coverage did not require insurer to provide separate limits of liability for permissive user for negligently causing accident and named insured for negligent entrustment leading to same accident so that one injured party may recover twice statutory minimum); <em>but see Iaquinta v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(Wis.Ct.App. 1993), 510 N.W.2d 715, 717-18 (concluding that pursuant to omnibus statute insurer must provide separate coverage up to the policy limit of $25,000 per person on behalf of both the owner and the permissive user, thereby providing up to $50,000 for injuries sustained by one person).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\u00b621 With this in mind, we first proceed to the two preliminary issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\n<em>Issue 1.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in granting Infinity Insurance Company\u2019s prayer for Interpleader?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b622 Appellants raise the legal question of whether the District Court, by granting Infinity\u2019s prayer for interpleader in its entirety, infringed on their rights to seek further relief under Montana law after the $50,000 in insurance proceeds is distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u00b623 Infinity, in its Complaint for Interpleader, requested an order \u201cenjoining and restraining each and all of the defendants from instituting or prosecuting further any proceeding on account of the incident or the insurance policy.\u201d Aside from this one request, the remainder of its prayers for relief pertained specifically to the release of Infinity from further claims in this matter \u2014 thus, it is unclear whether Infinity specifically requested additional relief for other parties. In addition to granting its motion for summary judgment, the District Court granted the relief sought by Infinity\u2019s interpleader without comment, and the summary judgment was certified as a final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b), M.R.Civ.R</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u00b624  Appellants argue that, regardless of the outcome of the issues on summary judgment, they are prejudiced in that they are technically enjoined from pursuing either Christeck, individually, or Vannatta\u2019s estate, once Infinity is released from all claims arising from the accident. We agree with Appellants that the measure of damage for negligence, notwithstanding available insurance proceeds, is the amount that will compensate the injured for all detriment proximately caused. The fundamental purpose of any tort remedy is to return the plaintiff to his or her rightful position, or \u201cthe position or state the party would have attained had the wrong not occurred.\u201d <em>Butler v. Germann </em>(1991), 251 Mont. 107, 110, 822 P.2d 1067, 1069. <em>See also </em>\u00a7\u00a7 27-1-202 and 27-1-317, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\u00b625  It is not clear, however \u2014 and Infinity sheds no further light \u2014 on whether it, and subsequently the District Court, intended such a comprehensive exclusion of remedies. As a matter of law, pursuant to the principles of subject matter jurisdiction, the court should have only released Infinity from further claims, not the potentially liable individuals involved in this matter. <em>See generally Old Fashion Baptist Church v. Department of Revenue </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 451, 457, 671 P.2d 625, 628. Upon remand, the District Court is instructed to clarify its order accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\n<em>Issue 2.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\n<em>Did the District Court err by not ruling that the policy issued by Infinity Insurance Company was ambiguous and therefore unenforceable?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b626 Appellants argue that Christeck\u2019s policy with Infinity is ambiguous, in that the term \u201caccident\u201d is not defined, and is therefore subject to more than one interpretation. Specifically, Appellants argue that Jessica Yannatta\u2019s alleged negligent driving, which caused the roll-over accident, and Christeck\u2019s alleged negligence in permitting Jessica to use his vehicle, constituted two separate \u201caccidents\u201d under Christeck\u2019s policy with Infinity, and therefore gave rise to separate coverage, each with a $50,000 limit. Infinity maintains its policy is plain and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u00b627  A long-standing and often-cited rule in Montana is that an insurance policy must be interpreted according to what a reasonable person in the position of an insured would understand the language to mean. <em>See, e.g., St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Thompson </em>(1967), 150 Mont. 182, 187, 433 P.2d 795, 798. An ambiguity exists when \u201cdifferent persons looking at it in light of its purpose cannot agree upon its meaning.\u201d <em>Bauer Ranch, Inc. v. Mountain West Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 153, 156, 695 P.2d 1307, 1309. The complementary rule to the foregoing is that ambiguous provisions in insurance policies must be construed against the insurance company. <em>See Bauer Ranch, </em>215 Mont. at 156, 695 P.2d at 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\u00b628 As a preliminary matter, the policy unquestionably provides an absolute cap of $50,000 in the event more than one insured is found liable for an accident in which two or more persons are injured. On page three, the policy expressly provides that Infinity would not \u201cpay more than the maximum limit of liability [$50,000] regardless of the number of: (b) insured persons.\u201d On page four, the policy further provides that \u201c[r]egardless of the number of vehicles described on the Declarations Page, insured persons, claims or policies, or vehicles involved in the accident, we will pay no more than the limit of liability shown for this coverage on the Declarations Page for each person injured in any one accident.\u201d By including these provisions, we conclude that Infinity has made clear what Montana\u2019s mandatory vehicle liability insurance statutes have not.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">\u00b629  We therefore conclude that the District Court correctly determined that under the terms of Infinity\u2019s policy, the maximum amount paid by the insurer remains constant \u2014 at $25,000 per person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>and $50,000 per accident \u2014 and the fact that an accident involved multiple liable insureds is inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b630 Next, the District Court correctly determined that the term \u201caccident\u201d is not defined by the policy itself. We agree with the District Court, however, that a reasonable person in the position of an insured would understand that the term \u201caccident\u201das used throughout the policy refers to a singular event where bodily injury or property damage results from the ownership, maintenance, or use of a vehicle. For example, the policy provides on page three that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">All bodily injury and property damage arising out of continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions shall be considered as arising out of one (1) accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b631  Thus, there was only one accident on December 7,1997, and, accordingly, we conclude that the District Court was correct in determining that although more than one act of negligence may have contributed to this one accident, the maximum amount of coverage under the policy remained constant.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u00b632 Whether such express limitations of liability in Infinity\u2019s policy with Christeck comport with state law is the subject of the final issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">\n<em>Issue 3.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in determining that Montana\u2019s vehicle insurance omnibus statutes do not require separate, full coverage for multiple insureds where each insured is liable for independent acts of negligence arising from one accident ?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">\u00b633 The Appellants contend that Montana\u2019s omnibus statutes<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> should be construed to require that where two insureds under one policy each are separately liable for injuries to two or more persons arising from one accident, the mandatory limit of $50,000 must, in effect, be doubled to fully cover both insured\u2019s negligence. Consequently, Appellants contend that if a provision in Infinity\u2019s policy excludes the mandatory liability limits for both insureds \u2014 i.e., $50,000 each for a total of $100,000 \u2014 it would violate the public policy expressed in our case law interpreting the Motor Vehicle Safety Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>sibility Act, and must therefore be deemed void as a matter of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As indicated, this is a question of first impression before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AOV\">\u00b634 The relevant portion of Montana\u2019s omnibus statute under \u00a7 61-6-103, MCA, provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">(2) The owner\u2019s policy of liability insurance must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">(b) insure the person named therein and any other person, as insured, using any motor vehicle or motor vehicles with the express or implied permission of the named insured, against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the motor vehicle or motor vehicles within the United States of America or the Dominion of Canada, subject to limits exclusive of interest and costs, with respect to each motor vehicle, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">(i) $25,000 because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident and subject to said limit for one person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">(ii) $50,000 because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">(iii) $10,000 because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">In 1979, the foregoing coverage became mandatory for all vehicle owners in Montana under \u00a7 61-6-301(l)(a), MCA, which provides: \u201can owner of a motor vehicle that is registered and operated in Montana by the owner or with the owner\u2019s permission shall continuously provide insurance against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death or damage to property suffered by any person caused by maintenance or use of a motor vehicle\u201d in an amount not less than that required by \u00a7 61-6-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">\u00b635 We agree with Appellants that our prior decisions interpreting insurance policies in the context of the foregoing statutes hold that policy language which excludes statutorily-mandated coverage is void as contrary to public policy. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hankinson </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 1, 4, 795 P.2d 480, 482 (citations omitted). Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>we have declared that when an insurer fails to provide a policy in compliance with the requirements of a statute mandating insurance protection, the courts are forced to reform the policy so that it is in compliance. <em>See Horace Mann Ins. v. Hampton </em>(1989), 235 Mont. 354, 358, 767 P.2d 343, 345 (citing 12A Couch on Insurance \u00a7 45:692 (rev.ed.)). This Court has also acknowledged that the omnibus coverage required by statute must be \u201cliberally construed so as to effectuate the manifest public policy of broadening the insurance coverage.\u201d <em>See Cascade Ins. Co. v. Glacier Gen. Ins. Co. </em>(1971), 156 Mont. 236, 242, 479 P.2d 259, 262 (quoting <em>Jurd v. Pacific Indem. Co. </em>(Cal. 1962), 371 P.2d 569, 571).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u00b636 The foregoing principle expressed in <em>Cascade </em>was recently applied in <em>Swank v. Chrysler Ins. Corp. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 376, 938 P.2d 631, where this Court firmly established the rule that a vehicle owner\u2019s policy cannot deviate from the mandatory automatic omnibus coverage under \u00a7\u00a7 61-6-103(2)(b) and 61-6-301(l)(a), MCA. The issue in <em>Swank </em>was whether a permissive driver, who was liable for damages in an accident, could be expressly excluded under a vehicle owner\u2019s policy if the permissive driver had her own insurance that covered the accident. In that case, a car dealer attempted to exclude \u201ccustomers\u201d who test drove its vehicles from its policy so long as the customers carried insurance which provided liability coverage for use of a \u201cnon-owner\u201d vehicle. We held that the provision was contrary to public policy and unenforceable, because the language clearly excluded or limited the coverage mandated by \u00a7 61-6-301(1), MCA, as defined under \u00a7 61-6-103, MCA, for permissive operators of vehicles. <em>See Swank, </em>282 Mont. at 383, 938 P.2d at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b637 In arguing that <em>Swank </em>is relevant here, Appellants contend that if Infinity pays the $50,000 limits on behalf of Christeck or Vannatta, then either Christeck or Vannatta, effectively, will be \u201cexcluded\u201d from coverage as mandated by \u00a7\u00a7 61-6-103 and 301, MCA. Thus, as a matter of law, \u00a7\u00a7 61-6-103 and 301, MCA, require that Infinity must provide the statutory limits for both insureds. Appellants contend that such a liberal statutory interpretation is required under the public policy of broadening insurance coverage to effectively protect the traveling public injured in vehicle accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b638 The District Court disagreed with Appellants\u2019 generous interpretation of \u00a7 61-6-103(2)(b), MCA, and determined that the statute refers to each <em>accident, </em>not each separate act of negligence that may have contributed to causing the accident. The court determined that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>as a matter of law, once the injured persons\u2019 damages resulting from the one accident exhaust the $50,000 policy limit, the insurer\u2019s obligation to cover any further claims ceases. The District Court reasoned that, in this instance, regardless of Christeck\u2019s and Jessica Vannatta\u2019s alleged independent acts of negligence, the most liability coverage mandated under state law is $50,000 where two or more persons are injured \u2014 a level of coverage which Christeck\u2019s policy with Infinity undisputedly provides. The court concluded that \u201c[wjhile the limit is probably too low for 1997-99 costs, it is what the legislature fixed. It is not for the courts to increase it by strained interpretations of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b639 This conclusion closely followed the dissenting opinion in <em>Haislip v. Southern Heritage Ins. Co. </em>(Va. 1997), 492 S.E.2d 135, a case relied on by Appellants, where the Supreme Court of Virginia, in a 4-3 split decision, held that the insurer must provide the same mandatory $25,000-per-person coverage for both the permissive user and the named insured. <em>See Haislip, </em>492 S.E.2d at 138 (Compton, J., dissenting) (stating that \u201cthe liability limits are per accident, not per act of negligence\u201d and quoting <em>Helmick v. Jones </em>(W.Va. 1994), 452 S.E.2d 408, 411). The District Court\u2019s conclusion accords not only with the dissent in <em>Haislip, </em>but also several other courts that have construed omnibus statutes whose language is nearly identical to Montana\u2019s. <em>See, e.g., GRE Ins. Group v. Green </em>(Ariz.Ct.App. 1999), 980 P.2d 963, 966; <em>Manriquez v. Mid-Century Ins. Co. of Texas </em>(Tex.App. 1989), 779 S.W.2d 482, 485 (concluding that the fact that two defendants are being sued does not enlarge $50,000 liability limitation to $100,000).</p>\n<p id=\"AEs\">\u00b640 Although we ultimately agree with the District Court\u2019s determination, we conclude that the court, in flatly dismissing the on-point Virginia decision, failed to reveal the requisite analysis statutory interpretation requires under Montana law. Under these circumstances, it is paramount that the Legislature\u2019s intent be scrutinized where $50,000 in liability coverage conceivably may double merely by a vehicle owner handing his keys to another person, who then drives negligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b641 As interpreted by the Virginia Supreme Court \u2014 and argued by Appellants \u2014 the term \u201cand\u201d in such an omnibus statute is unambiguous. <em>See Haislip, </em>492 S.E.2d at 137-38. Virginia\u2019s statute, similar to \u00a7 61-6-103(2)(b), MCA, requires that all vehicle insurance policies provide coverage to the \u201cnamed insured, <em>and </em>any other person using or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>responsible for the use of the motor vehicle ....\u201d Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 38.2-2204 (emphasis added). The Virginia court reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\">The General Assembly\u2019s use of the word \u201cand\u201d in Code \u00a7 38.2-2204(A) means that Southern Heritage is required to provide insurance coverage to both Price, who is the name insured, and Goode, who was driving the motor vehicle with Price\u2019s consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_x\"><em>Haislip, </em>492 S.E.2d at 137. The facts in <em>Haislip </em>are nearly identical to those here: allegedly, the named insured, Price, negligently entrusted her vehicle to Goode, who in turn negligently operated the vehicle causing injury to a third party, Haislip. The court ultimately declared that the insurer, Southern Heritage, must \u201cprovide a maximum of $25,000 in coverage for any claim that Haislip may make against Price in addition to the $25,000 that Southern Heritage has already paid to settle Haislip\u2019s claims against <em>Goode.\u201dHaislip, </em>492 S.E.2d at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b642 Appellants here contend that Montana\u2019s omnibus statute similarly requires that where two or more persons are injured \u201cin any one accident,\u201d an owner\u2019s policy of liability insurance must insure the named insured <em>and </em>any other person \u201cagainst loss from liability imposed by law for damages\u201d for $50,000. Appellants argue that this Court should therefore follow <em>Haislip, </em>and adopt the approach of other state courts which have interpreted similar omnibus statutes to require separate, full coverage in cases where both the owner <em>and </em>the permissive user are \u201cactively negligent.\u201d <em>See Iaquinta v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(Wis.Ct.App. 1993), 510 N.W.2d 715, 717-18 (concluding that insurer must, pursuant to omnibus statute, provide separate coverage up to the policy limit of $25,000 per person on behalf of both the owner and the permissive user, thereby providing up to $50,000 for injuries sustained by one person); <em>accord, Miller v. Amundson </em>(Wis.Ct.App. 1984), 345 N.W.2d 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b643 We are, however, not entirely persuaded by the Virginia court\u2019s approach to statutory interpretation intended to achieve the elusive \u201cintention of the legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u00b644 Apparently, the Virginia General Assembly was not persuaded, either. In 1999, the Assembly tacked on the following amendment to the omnibus statute: \u201chowever, nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to prohibit an insurer from limiting its liability under any one policy for bodily injury or property damage resulting from any one accident or occurrence to the liability limits for such coverage set forth in the policy for any such accident or occurrence <em>regardless of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>number of insureds under that policy.\u201d </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 38.2-2204 (1999) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\u00b645 This is not to say that those jurisdictions that have arrived at the same conclusion as the District Court here, have utilized more thorough methods. For example, under the guise of interpreting its legislature\u2019s intent, an Arizona court of appeals reached the exact opposite conclusion as the Virginia court in construing a nearly identical omnibus statute. <em>See GRE Ins. Group v. Green </em>(Ariz.Ct.App. 1999), 980 P.2d 963. A portion of the court\u2019s analysis reveals the problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARa\">There is nothing in the language of the statute, nor do we find any other authority, that supports the argument that the statute requires insurers to cover the permissive user for negligently causing the accident and the named insured for negligent entrustment leading to the same accident so that one injured party may recover twice the statutory minimum. Rather, <em>it seems that the intent of the statute </em>is that, whether the named insured or a permissive user is operating the vehicle and causes the accident, the policy must provide at least $15,000 in coverage for each injured person subject to the overall per-accident limit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><em>GRE, </em>980 P.2d at 966 (emphasis added). While this end result accords with the District Court\u2019s determination here, we conclude that <em>intent </em>simply cannot be inferred from whatever the statutory language \u201cseems\u201d to mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b646 Unlike the Virginia and Arizona courts, we are bound by the more stringent mandate that \u201cthe office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins. Co. v. Holeman </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 274, 277, 924 P.2d 1315, 1317. Further, statutory language must be construed according to its plain meaning and, if the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required. <em>Dahl v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>1999 MT 168, \u00b6 16, 295 Mont. 173, \u00b6 16, 983 P.2d 363, \u00b6 16 (citation omitted). In construing a statute, this Court must also read and construe each statute as a whole so as to avoid an absurd result \u201cand to give effect to the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Christenot v. Department of Commerce </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 396, 401, 901 P.2d 545, 548. If the plain words of a statute are ambiguous, however, the next step injudicial interpretation of the statute is to determine the intent of the legislature. <em>See Montana Contractors\u2019Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Department of Highways </em>(1986), 220 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>392, 394, 715 P.2d 1056, 1058. This is accomplished by examining the legislative history of the statute, including the title of the original bill. <em>See Montana Contractors\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>220 Mont. at 394, 715 P.2d at 1058; <em>Gaub v. Milbank Ins. Co. </em>(1986), 220 Mont. 424, 428, 715 P.2d 443, 445. Further, when determining legislative intent, our interpretation must be reasonable. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-3-233, MCA; <em>Grossman v. State Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources </em>(1984), 209 Mont. 427, 451, 682 P.2d 1319, 1332. Accordingly, it would be injudicious for this Court to follow jurisdictions where the intent of an entire statute turns on the word \u201cand\u201d or its intent is construed by what it \u201cseems\u201d to mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b647 Our review of the plain language of the Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act leads us to conclude that if in fact the Legislature ever wished to allow such a double-recovery system, it has never expressly provided the necessary language for such an interpretation. Then again, \u00a7 61-6-103, MCA, read as a whole, does not definitively prohibit such a recovery. In other words, Appellants\u2019 argument, in light of the strong policy for liberally construing statutes designed to protect the innocent public, cannot be dismissed as mere \u201csophistry,\u201d a label the District Court used in describing the Virginia court\u2019s decision in <em>Haislip.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b648 What is clear from the plain language of \u00a7 6 l-6-103(2)(b), MCA, is that an \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d must provide a base amount of insurance coverage of $25,000-per-person, $50,000-per-accident, and $10,000 for property damage when persons or property are injured by another person\u2019s use of a vehicle in Montana. The operative language in this statute, however, requires that the foregoing is: <em>\u201csubject to limits exclusive of interest and costs, with respect to each motor vehicle. </em>...\u201d Thus, each vehicle in Montana \u2014 not each insured \u2014 must be cloaked by the foregoing mandatory limits in the event <em>it </em>causes damage to persons or property, regardless of who is behind the wheel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, this Comb cannot give effect to any purpose beyond this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u00b649 As indicated, the central issue raised here strikes at the heart of a particular ambiguity, one which obviously has led other courts to reach contrary conclusions. To this end, our review of the legislative history, as well as case law from other states that have adopted a similar act, is at best inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"AP2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\u00b650 We can find no evidence that the Montana Legislature ever contemplated, let alone wished to require, that the minimum limits of liability under \u00a7 61-6-103, MCA, could or should be increased depending on the number of insureds found legally liable for causing one accident. The overall purpose of the Act, as stated in its original title, was for the \u201celimination of reckless and irresponsible drivers of motor vehicles from the highways of the state of Montana.\u201d <em>See Boldt v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1968), 151 Mont. 337, 340-43, 443 P.2d 33, 35-36 (describing \u201cgeneral legislative intent in enacting the financial responsibility provisions of the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act\u201d). This intent \u2014 to shield the public from reckless and irresponsible drivers \u2014 is expressed under the \u201ceach motor vehicle\u201d limitation under \u00a7 61-6-103(2)(b), MCA, meaning each vehicle, regardless of ownership, must be covered by the mandatory liability limits when in use on the roadways of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b651 Since enacted in 1951, what is now \u00a7 61-6-103(2)(b), MCA (formerly \u00a7 53-438, RCM), has been amended numerous times. The amendments, however, primarily focussed on increasing the mandatory liability from the original $5,000-per-person, $10,000-per-accident, and $1,000 property damage limits, and passed through the legislative process with little comment concerning the overall intent of such mandatory limits. The last such increase occurred in 1989. The $50,000-per-accident limit, however, has remained unchanged since 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b652 Finally, other jurisdictions have obviously arrived at opposite conclusions with no reference at all to their respective legislatures\u2019 hearing minutes or committee reports \u2014 and, accordingly, are instructive but not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b653 Therefore, we hold that it would be in error for this Court to construe the statute in such a way that we ultimately question, rather than resolve, our Legislature\u2019s intent. To do so would require us to insert a particular and precise meaning that has been omitted, contrary to the edicts of \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA. If the Legislature wishes to clearly mandate such a requirement, it may do so; or, like Virginia\u2019s General Assembly, it may wish to constrict this apparent loophole in the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"Aff\">\u00b654  Therefore, the District Court\u2019s conclusion that, pursuant to the Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Act, Infinity is obligated to pay the $50,000 policy limit on behalf of its insureds \u2014 and no more \u2014 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>\u00b655 Accordingly, this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, REGNIER, GRAY and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-13\">.

Hunt, Sr.,</author>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u00b656 dissents from the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"AaDk\">\u00b657 I believe that under the language of the statute and of the policy both Vannatta and Christeck are insured persons under the policy. Infinity, as the insurer, should be responsible to provide coverage up to the limits of the policy for each of the insureds individually. Section 61-6-103(2), MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">(B) The owner\u2019s policy of liability insurance must... <em>insure the person named therein and any other person, as insured, </em>using any motor vehicle or motor vehicles with the express or implied permission of the named insured, against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the motor vehicle ... with respect to each motor vehicle, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">(i) $25,000 because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident and subject to said limit for one person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">(ii) $50,000 because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">(iii) $10,000 because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\u00b658 Christeck\u2019s policy with Infinity appears to comply with the statute. Christeck, as the named insured, is entitled to liability coverage under the policy agreement at page 2 which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-11\">We will pay damages ... up to the policy limits shown on the Declarations Page, for which an insured person is legally liable because of bodily injury or property damage resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of your insured car or a non-owned car. The bodily injury or property damage must be caused by an accident and not be expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">Negligent entrustment is conduct which clearly falls within the parameters of the policy as an unintended consequence resulting from the ownership of the car. In addition, Vannatta appears to be entitled to insurance under Christeck\u2019s policy falling under the definition of an insured person. The definition of insured persons is found on the same page of the policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-13\">As used in this Part \u201cinsured person\u201d or \u201cinsured persons\u201d means with respect to your insured car:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>(1) you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">(2) any other person using your insured car with your express or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">implied permission to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">\u00b659 In limiting the coverage, the majority opinion does not address the issue of which party is insured under the policy in this kind of situation. The use of the word \u201cand\u201d in the statute means that the policy should provide both with insurance coverage as required. Their construction of the contract and the statute ultimately leaves one of the two negligent parties uninsured. This is puzzling, since the parties are statutorily required to have insurance and since they both appear to be insured under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">\u00b660 If Vannatta is fully covered under the policy, as required by statute, then her liability must be assumed by the insurance company up to the limits of the policy. As the named policy-holder Christeck should be entitled to the same amount of coverage under the policy. Under the majority\u2019s interpretation, only one of the two is fully insured as required by the statute. The limits of liability coverage should apply fully and separately to both Christek, for negligent entrustment, and to Vannatta, for negligent operation of the vehicle. In instituting the permissive user coverage requirement under the financial responsibility laws, the legislature surely didn\u2019t intend to leave persons who complied with the law open to additional liability.</p>\n<p id=\"ADr\">\u00b661 The language of both the policy and the statute imply that both Christeck (as the owner of the vehicle) and Vannatta (as a permissive user) are fully insured in the event that their negligence triggers liability to third parties. Under the majority\u2019s approach, however, this is not the case. There are three possibilities: Christeck is insured, Vannatta is insured or they\u2019re both under-insured by half of the policy limits, which is contrary to the statute. Public policy would seem to require that the insured parties be each <em>individually </em>entitled to coverage up to the full amount of the policy limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">\u00b662 The state legislature has created mandatory liability statutes for exactly this reason. If someone is either an owner of a car or is operating a car he or she has a responsibility to third parties who might become injured as a result. The statute expressly requires that both the named insured <em>and </em>permissive users be insured under a policy. Paul Christeck and Jessica Vannatta complied with the statute and have been left with half of what was promised.</p>\n<judges id=\"b255-10\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER concurs in the dissent by JUSTICE HUNT.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
