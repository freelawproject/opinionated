We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\u00b62 Brady raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Brady\u2019s motion for a mistrial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\">2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it did not dismiss the case on its own motion for insufficiency of the evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">\u00b63 On October 15,1998, Brady was charged by information with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, a fourth or subsequent offense, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-401,714, MCA. The case arose from the circumstances surrounding a wreck in which Brady, driving alone between Seeley Lake and Missoula, swerved off Montana Highway 200, struck a rock wall, and rolled over. The information also charged Brady with three misdemeanors: driving while license suspended or revoked, in violation of \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA; failure to provide proof of insurance, in violation of \u00a7 61-6-302, MCA; and failure to give notice of an accident by the quickest means, in violation of \u00a7 61-7-108, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">\u00b64 On February 9,1999, shortly before voir dire, Brady\u2019s trial counsel stated that Brady would plead guilty to the three misdemeanors. He moved the District Court to \u201cinstruct the State to instruct their witnesses not to mention any of those offenses for which he was charged and which he will plead guilty to.\u201d Brady\u2019s counsel also said, \u201cI don\u2019t object to the fact of them mentioning that he left his wallet at the scene or that his driver\u2019s license was left, but I believe it would be unduly prejudicial for the jury to learn that it was suspended.\u201d He only objected to references to the effect that Brady was driving while his license was suspended or without insurance. The State did not object to this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">\u00b65 During trial, the State\u2019s third witness, Chris Schultz, a Missoula County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy, testified on direct examination that at the scene of the wreck, \u201cabout four or five feet from the driver\u2019s door, there was a wallet laying on the ground. And I picked that wallet up, went through it, and found an expired driver\u2019s license to \u2014 .\u201d At this point, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Brady objected and the District Court sustained the objection. Shortly thereafter, the judge, counsels, and Brady met in chambers. Brady\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial, arguing that the judge had ordered the State not to mention an expired license. The State countered that the stipulation was that the State would not mention that his license was suspended, but that its expired status was not covered. The State argued that the remark was inadvertent and the license was part of the transaction. The State affirmed that they had instructed the three officers who would testify not to mention the suspension of Brady\u2019s driver\u2019s license. The District Court agreed with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b66 The District Court found that there was a difference between the jury knowing that Brady\u201ds license had expired and hearing that it was suspended, which would suggest prior criminal behavior. The District Court said, \u201c[a]nd I think that\u2019s what\u2019s prejudicial to your client-is prior criminal behavior suggested by a suspended license.\u201d The District Court gave the following admonition to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the officer just mentioned that the Defendant had an expired license. I would request that you please disregard this testimony. This fact has nothing to do with the case. An expired license is no indication of guilt of any offense by the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The State did not again mention the license except to note that the information in Brady\u2019s wallet, coupled with the vehicle registration, allowed the officers to track down Brady at his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u00b67 The State also called several other witnesses. The State called a truck driver who had witnessed Brady speeding and exhibiting poor control over his vehicle shortly before the crash. The State called Brady\u2019s sister. She testified that she only saw Brady drink one beer after the wreck. The State called two officers, including Officer Schultz, who testified about the scene of the wreck and Brady\u2019s condition at his home. They concluded that the wreck was not caused by a tire coming off and that Brady was very intoxicated. They also testified about Brady attempting to lie about being involved in the wreck. The State\u2019s final witness was an officer who did not see the scene of the wreck, but testified as to Brady\u2019s intoxication. He testified that although Brady was injured, his drunken state was not from a head trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u00b68 After the State closed its case in chief, Brady moved for a directed verdict of acquittal. The District Court denied Brady\u2019s motion. Brady <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>called his sister as his first witness. Brady also called two witnesses in an attempt to establish that a malfunctioning tire caused the wreck. Brady then rested, and the State recalled one of the officers to rebut that a tire caused the wreck. At the close of evidence, Brady did not renew his motion for dismissal or for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b69 The jury found Brady guilty of driving while under the influence. On March 22,1999, Brady was sentenced to thirteen months at the Montana State Prison, followed by a four-year suspended sentence. He now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u00b610 Brady first argues that the denial of his motion for a mistrial was reversible error because the State\u2019s witness deliberately violated an order in limine, to which the State had previously stipulated, and because the evidence against him was far from overwhelming. Second, Brady argues that the District Court should have taken the case from the jury at the close of all the evidence, since the totality of the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, established reasonable doubt of guilt as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">\u00b611 The State concedes that after the State and Brady stipulated that the evidence of Brady\u2019s driving while his license was suspended and driving without insurance would not be brought before the jury, an officer testified that he found Brady\u2019s wallet near the wrecked car. The wallet contained Brady\u2019s expired driver\u2019s license. The State argues, however, that reading the record strictly, the expired status of the license was not excluded by the stipulation. Further, the prosecution said that its mention was inadvertent, and there is nothing on the record to refute that assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">\u00b612 The State also points out that the District Court sustained an obj ection to the testimony that Brady\u2019s license was expired and gave a corrective admonition to the jury. According to the State, even if the evidence was presented contrary to the stipulation, it could not have contributed to Brady\u2019s conviction because having an expired license is not commonly thought of as a serious or even a criminal matter, and there was ample evidence to convict Brady. Lastly, the State argues that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying Brady\u2019s motions for a mistrial and acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case, or when it did not dismiss the case on its own motion as permitted by \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b613 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Brady\u2019s motion for a mistrial?</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u00b614  We review a denial of a motion for a mistrial for an abuse of discretion. A mistrial is appropriate when a reasonable possibility exists that inadmissible evidence might have contributed to the conviction. <em>State v. Partin </em>(1997), 287 Mont. 12, 18, 951 P.2d 1002, 1005 (officer\u2019s improper reference in forgery prosecution to sample of a defendant\u2019s handwriting from a prior arrest denied defendant a fair and impartial trial). The strength of the evidence against the defendant together with the prejudicial influence of the inadmissible evidence and whether a cautionary, jury instruction could cure any prejudice must be considered in determining whether a prohibited statement contributed to the conviction. <em>Partin, </em>287 Mont. at 18, 951 P.2d at 1005. A mistrial should be denied, however, for technical errors or defects that do not affect the substantial rights of the defendant and the record is sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>State v. Berosik, </em>1999 MT 238, \u00b6 20, 296 Mont. 165, \u00b6 20, 988 P.2d 775, \u00b6 20. \u201cAny error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d Section 46-20-701(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b6 15 Brady argues that not only was it inherently prejudicial for the State\u2019s witness to mention that Brady\u2019s driver\u2019s license was expired, but the officer deliberately violated the stipulation excluding evidence of Brady driving with a suspended license and without insurance. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\u00b616  Brady\u2019s motion in limine did not apply to the officer\u2019s testimony that Brady\u2019s license was expired. Brady only objected to references to the effect that he was driving while his license was suspended or without insurance. As the District Court noted, there is a difference between an expired license and a suspended license. A driver\u2019s license is suspended because its bearer did something wrong, but anyone can allow a license to expire. Having an expired license is not in itself criminal. It is a common mistake that does not imply bad character.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">\u00b617 This is distinct from the <em>Partin </em>case. In <em>Partin, </em>it was undisputed that the officer\u2019s testimony violated the district court\u2019s order in limine and was inadmissible. <em>Partin, </em>287 Mont. at 18, 951 P.2d at 1005. Here, the State\u2019s witness did not directly violate the stipulation in limine. Testimony that Brady\u2019s license had expired was admissible. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Therefore, we need not determine whether a reasonable possibility exists that it contributed to Brady\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b618  Further, the District Court admonished the jury to disregard the testimony and that \u201c[a]n expired license is no indication of guilt of any offense by the Defendant.\u201d Any potential prejudice that might have resulted from the testimony of Brady\u2019s license being expired was sufficiently cured by the District Court\u2019s admonition to the jury. \u201c[A]n error in the admission of evidence may be cured if the jury is admonished to disregard it.\u201d <em>State v. Ford </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 353, 361, 926 P.2d 245, 249 (citing <em>State v. Conrad </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 1, 9, 785 P.2d 185, 190)(prejudicial effect of testimony about a defendant\u2019s prior crimes was cured by cautionary instruction). The District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying Brady\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\u00b619 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it did not dismiss the case on its own motion for insufficiency of the evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\u00b620 We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a criminal defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict for an abuse of discretion. A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal if reasonable persons could not conclude from the evidence, taken in a light most favorable to the prosecution, that guilt was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. State <em>v. Bromgard </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 291, 293, 862 P.2d 1140, 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"AzZ\">\u00b621 Brady argues that, taken as a whole, the evidence was insufficient to submit to the jury because there was no direct or even circumstantial evidence that he had anything at all to drink, much less was intoxicated, at the time he was driving and was involved in an accident. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">\u00b622 Immediately before the wreck, a truck driver witnessed Brady driving dangerously, speeding and exhibiting poor control of his vehicle. Brady apparently just swerved off the road and into a rock wall. He did not use his brakes before hitting the wall. Brady then fled the scene of the accident without reporting it to the police. A bottle of rum, found in Brady\u2019s wrecked car, established alcohol was available to him before the crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">\u00b623 Brady produced evidence of only one beer consumed after the wreck. His behavior, physical appearance and the results of the horizontal gaze nystagmus test showed that he was quite intoxicated when the officers arrived at his home. One beer would not explain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>slurred speech, red eyes, and staggering that the officers observed. Although Brady was injured and no doubt shaken by his accident, it does not follow that the evidence failed to show he was intoxicated when the wreck occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b624 One of the investigating officers who was trained to look for physical injuries or symptoms that could have accounted for Brady\u2019s behavior other than intoxication concluded that Brady was not suffering from a head injury or some other injury that would mimic intoxication. Rather, it was the officer\u2019s expert opinion that Brady was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b625 Brady\u2019s conduct at his home was further incriminating. He first tried to lead the police to believe that he had not been in the wreck acting as though he had no knowledge of the wreck. Then Brady told the police that his facial injuries were from his sister punching him. Then he changed his story to some unknown person struck him at a bar the night before, but he did not know where the bar was. Brady also refused to perform any field sobriety maneuvers. A reasonable juror could easily conclude that Brady was trying to hide illegal behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b626 Brady called two witnesses in an attempt to establish that a tire malfunction could have caused the accident. An officer, however, testified that Brady\u2019s vehicle left yaw marks from all four tires. A yaw mark is laid down from the edges of tires when a vehicle is in a side skid. If a tire was loosening or actually came off, as Brady claims, the yaw marks would not have been straight or laid down evenly. There would not have been four tire marks across the roadway and there would have been other kinds of marks from a dragging hub or axle if a tire had come off. The physical evidence at the accident scene does not support Brady\u2019s claim that a tire malfunction caused the wreck.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u00b627 Brady argues that witnesses at the scene would have told the police whether he was intoxicated. The record is silent as to the identity of any such purported witnesses. From the record one cannot tell what they might have testified to or whether they were even available for Brady\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">\u00b628  The jury apparently did not believe the wreck happened because Brady\u2019s car malfunctioned, and it did not believe that his injuries accounted for his drunken behavior or that his apparent intoxication when the officers saw him was the consequence of the beer he drank after the accident. We have long held that when circumstantial evidence is susceptible to differing interpretations, it is within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>providence of the jury to determine which will prevail. <em>See, e.g., State v. Brodniak </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 212, 222, 718 P.2d 322, 329; <em>State v. Flack </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 181, 189, 860 P.2d 89, 94; <em>State v. Hall, </em>1999 MT 297, \u00b6 22, 297 Mont. 111, \u00b6 22, 991 P.2d 929, \u00b6 22. Further, the State is not obligated to supply any specific type of evidence: a jury may consider the facts and circumstances of an accident and the observations and opinions of witnesses, giving effect to the evidence it finds credible. <em>State v. Peterson </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 247, 250, 769 P.2d 1221, 1223; <em>State v. Longacre </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 311, 313, 542 P.2d 1221, 1222. We hold that when the evidence is taken in a light most favorable to the State a reasonable juror could have found Brady guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the evidence to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u00b629 The District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b210-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
