At the close of the State\u2019s case, Flatley moved the District Court to dismiss the action based on insufficient evidence. The District Court denied Flatley\u2019s motion and he was subsequently convicted. Flatley appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. We reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b62 Although a number of issues were raised on appeal, we find the following issue dispositive:</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it denied the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss based on insufficient evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u00b64 Alan Real agreed with Ray Malley, an agent for the Southwest Montana Drug Task Force, to arrange a drug purchase from the Defendant, Richard Flatley, who was an acquaintance of Real\u2019s. Real testified that he tried to call Flatley five or six times and left several messages, but that Flatley did not return his calls. When Real eventually contacted Flatley, Real testified that the following conversation occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">Q. And what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">A. Told him I was going to Boulder that night, the night that I was coming over; and he said, \u2018Well, come on over.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">Q. Okay. And what did you do then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">A. Then I got hold of the Southwest Drug Task Force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">Q. Okay. Did you tell anyone from the Southwest Drug Task Force that Rick Flatley said, \u201cI could buy a quarter ounce of marijuana in Boulder for $65?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-14\">A. I told them that I could buy one over there. But, and I also told them that Rick Flatley said that. But Rick Flatley never said that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZx3\">Q. Why did you tell them that then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-15\">A. Because they wanted me to set Rick Flatley up. And I know when I go to Boulder, nine times out of ten I can get a bag of marijuana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">\u00b65 On June 6, 1996, Real met with Agent Timothy Barkell and Agent Malley of the drug task force in Whitehall, Montana. Real and Barkell drove from Whitehall to Boulder, Montana in Barkell\u2019s car. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Malley followed in his car. When they arrived in Boulder, Barkell fixed a wire on Real\u2019s body.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After Real identified Flatley\u2019s house, Barkell parked his car in Flatley\u2019s driveway and remained in the car. Malley was parked half a block away, where he was listening to the transmission of Real\u2019s conversation and taking photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b66 Real then exited Barkell\u2019s car and walked to the back of the house, where Flatley and Lucas Janacaro were repairing a car. Real testified that he asked Flatley, \u2018Well, can you hook me up?\u201d to which, Flatley responded, \u201cNo, the guy\u2019s gone fishing.\u201d Real testified that he then asked Janacaro if he could help him get some marijuana; and that Janacaro responded, \u201cwe have to go to Jefferson City because I want to get some for myself too. So can you guys give me a ride?\u201d The recording device that Real was wearing recorded the conversation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">Flatley: So how long are you going to be in town?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">Real: Oh, not long hopefully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">Flatley: No Shit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">Real: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">Flatley: That dude\u2019s gone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">Real: Oh, he is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\">Flatley: Yeah, he\u2019s up fishing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-12\">Real: Can you hook me up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-13\">Janacaro: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-14\">Real: How much per quarter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-15\">Janacaro: For a quarter, um, we can go to Jefferson City and it\u2019s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-16\">sixty-five at Jefferson City. They\u2019re pretty fat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-17\">Janacaro testified that Flatley did not introduce him to Real; and that Flatley did not tell Real that he could get him drugs. Real testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvA\">Q. Okay. And isn\u2019t it true that then Mr. Flatley never directed Mr. Real to ask you about getting hooked up; correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-19\">A. Right, correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-20\">Following the conversation in Flatley\u2019s yard, Real, Flatley, and Janacaro walked to the car where Barkell was waiting. Barkell testified that the following conversation resulted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>A. They came out, and [Real] introduced me as his uncle. [Flatley] asked if I was looking for some marijuana, and I said yeah. And he said, \u201chow much?\u201d And I said, \u201cFd like to get an ounce.\u201d And then I believe he said he didn\u2019t believe he could get an ounce at this time but could get a quarter ounce. And [] Janacaro joined in and said, \u2018Yeah, we can get a quarter ounce.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\">Q. Did they say where they could get the marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">A. They told me we could go to Jefferson City if I\u2019d give them a ride; and if we couldn\u2019t get it in Jefferson City, we could go to Helena.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">Q. Okay, and when you say \u201cthe/\u2019, do you recall specifically who was talking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">A. Rick [Flatley] and Lucas [Janacaro].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">Q. Both of them were talking to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">\u00b67 Before they left for Jefferson City, Real testified that Barkell suggested that Janacaro call the supplier. Janacaro testified that Flatley also suggested calling the supplier. Janacaro, however, responded that the supplier did not have a phone. While driving to Jefferson City, Barkell testified the following conversation occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">Q. Okay. Now on the way over there, did you have some conversation about what was going to happen when you got there; or can you recall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">A. Yes, I asked, I asked if this bud we were picking up is good bud. And both [Flatley] and [Janacaro] said, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s excellent bud.\u201d And [Flatley] made a statement that he used to always have bud on hand, but the cops are watching him now. And so now he only hooks people up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">\u00b68 When the group arrived in Jefferson City, Barkell parked the car at Ting\u2019s Bar. Flatley and Janacaro exited the car and walked to Justin Jones\u2019 house, while Barkell and Real waited in the car. Jones was not home, but his mother said he was at the dredge ponds. After Flatley and Janacaro returned to the car, Barkell drove to the dredge ponds. According to Barkell, both Flatley and Janacaro directed him to the ponds. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-14\">A. Both [Flatley] and [Janacaro] were telling me the way to go to the dredge pond. \u201cTurn around here, go up this dirt road, take a right at the stop sign.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Q. Was it kind of a landmark in Jefferson City?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">A. The dredge pond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">Q. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">A. I-Apparently, I guess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">When they arrived at the dredge ponds, Janacaro went to talk with Jones, while Flatley, Real, and Barkell remained in the car. Janacaro then returned to the car with Jones, where Janacaro introduced Jones to Barkell. Janacaro and Jones entered the car and Barkell drove back to Ting\u2019s bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">\u00b69 Once at Ting\u2019s bar, Barkell gave Janacaro $65. Jones and Janacaro then exited the car. Flatley, Real, and Barkell remained in the car. Janacaro testified that he and Jones then went to Jones\u2019 house, where Jones gathered a quarter ounce of marijuana. Jones and Janacaro returned about 15 minutes later. Jones then gave Barkell a bag of marijuana which he placed under his seat. Jones and Janacaro remained in Jefferson City and Real, Flatley, and Barkell departed for Boulder. While driving to Boulder, Barkell testified the following conversation occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">A. I took it and I put it under my seat. And then as we were driving back to Boulder, [Flatley] asked me to see it. I handed him a baggy. He smelled it and handed it back to me, and I put it back under my seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-10\">Q. Did he say anything after he smelled it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-11\">A. He said, \u201cThis is good bud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-12\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-13\">A. Or skunk bud. Skunk bud I believe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">When they arrived in Boulder, Real and Barkell returned Flatley to his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b346-16\">\u00b610 We review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction to determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Medrano </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 69, 73, 945 P.2d 937, 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-17\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b346-18\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err when it denied the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss based on insufficient evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u00b612  \u201cA person commits the offense of criminal distribution of dangerous drugs if the person sells, barters, exchanges, gives away, or offers to sell, barter, exchange, or give away any dangerous drug, as defined in 50-32-101.\u201d Section 45-9-101(1), MCA. Section 45-2-301, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">A person is responsible for conduct which is an element of an offense if the conduct is either that of the person himself or that of another and he is legally accountable for such conduct as provided in 45-2-302, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">(3) either before or during the commission of an offense with the purpose to promote or facilitate such commission, he solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid such other person in the planning or commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Section 45-2-302(3), MCA. To convict a person of criminal distribution of dangerous drugs by accountability, the state must prove the defendant promoted or facilitated the sale of drugs. <em>State v. Lyons </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 360, 366, 838 P.2d 397, 401. Mere presence at the scene of a crime is, however, insufficient to establish criminal responsibility. <em>State ex rel. Murphy v. McKinnon </em>(1976), 171 Mont. 120, 125, 556 P.2d 906, 909 (holding that the defendant\u2019s presence during a deliberate homicide was insufficient to hold him accountable, even though he said the victim \u201chad this coming.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">\u00b613 Flatley contends that he did not arrange the drug transaction between Jones and Barkell; that he did not introduce Janacaro to Real or Barkell; and that the drug transaction between Barkell and Jones would have taken place whether or not he traveled to Jefferson City with Barkell, Real, and Janacaro. In reliance on <em>State v. Downing </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 215, 217, 783 P.2d 412, 414, the State responds that Flatley had the intent to facilitate the drug transaction between Barkell and Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">\u00b614 In <em>Downing, </em>an informant introduced Downing to an undercover agent, who asked Downing if he could purchase drugs. <em>Downing, </em>240 Mont. at 216, 783 P.2d at 413. Downing responded that he had no drugs, but that he would arrange for the agent to meet Ohl. Ohl also had no drugs, but said the he was expecting a shipment. The following day, the informant, the agent, and Downing drove to Ohl\u2019s house, where Ohl introduced the agent to Huskins, who sold the agent drugs for $110. <em>Downing, </em>240 Mont. at 216, 783 P.2d at 413. In affirming Downing\u2019s conviction, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable jury could have found that [Downing] intended to aid in a drug sale by whomever had the drugs available. Downing\u2019s intent was not necessarily limited to a sale by Earl Ohl. [The agent] initiated an open invitation to purchase drugs from whomever Downing could contact. On the testimony presented, the fact that Ohl happened to be the most accessible dealer, would not preclude a jury from finding that [Downing] intended to abet a drug sale by some other individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><em>Downing, </em>240 Mont. at 219, 783 P.2d at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b615 Unlike the defendant in <em>Downing, </em>who intended to facilitate a drug sale, even if not with the original provider, Flatley only intended to connect Real with one person, and that person had gone fishing. No transaction occurred. \u201cAccountability must be predicated upon a separate, underlying offense.\u201d <em>Downing, </em>240 Mont. at 217, 783 P.2d at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u00b6 16 Real testified that after he asked Flatley to hook him up, Flatley responded, \u201cNo, the guy\u2019s gone fishing.\u201d Janacaro testified that Flatley did not introduce him to Real; and that he offered to get Real drugs without being prompted by Flatley. A rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, could not have found that Flatley purposely promoted or facilitated the sale of drugs by Jones to Barkell. It was Janacaro who facilitated the transaction between Barkell and Jones, not Flatley. Mere presence is insufficient to prove accountability. <em>See State ex rel. Murphy, </em>171 Mont. at 125, 556 P.2d at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u00b617  Flatley waited in the car when Janacaro talked to Jones at the dredge ponds, and Flatley waited in the car when Janacaro and Jones went to retrieve the drugs at Jones\u2019 house. Further, there was no evidence that Flatley ever discussed the drug transaction with Jones. During the course of the evening, Flatley made statements which revealed his knowledge of drugs and the drug trade, but such knowledge does not amount to a criminal offense. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court erred when it denied the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss based on insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">\u00b618 The Judgment of the District Court is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b348-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, GRAY, NELSON, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-21\">.
