We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">\u00b62 The lone issue presented on appeal is whether the District Court made an incorrect conclusion of law when it ruled that the transfer of territory from one K-12 school district to another K-12 school district under the undisputed facts did not require two separate petitions pursuant to state law, and consequently erred by granting summary judgment in favor of County Superintendents.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b63 This controversy commenced in October of 1997 when residents of the Upper Nine Mile Valley in Missoula County petitioned the Missoula County Superintendent of Schools to have the territory in which they resided transferred from the Alberton K-12 School District No. 2 to the Frenchtown K-12 School District No. 40. The Upper Nine Mile territory is located between Frenchtown and Alberton.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b64 This proposed transfer is related to a failed 1992 petition that sought the same result. During the course of that prior dispute, the Frenchtown School District\u2019s board of trustees temporarily permitted affected Upper Nine Mile students to attend Frenchtown schools if they wished. This arrangement would end, however, at the close of the 1997-98 school year. Unless the petition was approved, the Upper Nine Mile students could no longer attend Frenchtown schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b65 The 1997 petition apparently affected 24 to 26 students, 11 of whom attended Frenchtown schools. According to their \u201cPetition to Transfer K-12,\u201d the petitioners claimed that as residents of Missoula County, most of whom worked in Frenchtown and Missoula, it was impractical for their children to be bused to Alberton schools. The petition stated that \u201cFrenchtown [is] much more accessible for parent participation in school and community activities.\u201d The petition also addressed the \u201ccommunity\u201d aspect of the Nine Mile Valley. Currently, Upper Nine Mile residents reside in the Alberton School District, while Lower Nine Mile residents reside in the Frenchtown School District. The transfer would therefore unite the Nine Mile area, as well as enhance the Upper Nine Mile\u2019s existing ties with Frenchtown, according to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"AV\">\u00b66 The desired transfer met opposition early on from the Alberton School District, which raised the issue of the economic impact that the proposed transfer presented. According to the record, at an estimated taxable value of $358,614, the Upper Nine Mile territory in question represents nearly 14 percent of the total taxable value of the Alberton School District, which according to a Rural Education Center survey is among the poorer school districts in the state. The record indicates that removal of the Upper Nine Mile territory from the Alberton School District property tax base would result in higher taxes for its remaining residents to compensate for the loss, and would lower taxes for those residents of the Upper Nine Mile once they joined the much larger Frenchtown School District. A precise forecast of the economic impact was never determined, and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>remained in dispute throughout the petition process. Supporters of the transfer, however, adamantly maintained that such economic factors had nothing at all to do with the original purpose of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b67 Upon receipt of the petition, the Missoula County superintendent determined that it was valid, pursuant to state law, and scheduled a November 12,1997 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b68 Prior to the hearing, however, the Alberton Board of Trustees requested that the hearing be canceled \u201cbecause the single petition was invalid, it did not reference MCA 20-6-320, and the letter from Frenchtown Superintendent Hargrove was not sufficient notification of the intent of the Frenchtown Board of Trustees to accept the territory.\u201d This request was denied, and the hearing was conducted as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b69 Following the November 12,1997 hearing, the petition was approved by a panel of three county school superintendents, representing Missoula, Mineral and Ravalli counties, who are the named Respondents in this action. The superintendent from Ravalli County, pursuant to state law, was chosen as a tie-breaker vote on the transfer. On December 17,1997, each superintendent filed his or her own set of findings and conclusions. The Mineral County superintendent dissented from the Missoula and Ravalli superintendents, and would have denied the petition for the transfer of territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u00b610 The issue of the validity of the petition, however, was not disputed among the three superintendents. Regarding the Alberton Trustees\u2019 contentions, the Missoula County superintendent found (and the other superintendents agreed) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">Only one petition was received although it was clear from the testimony of those in the support of the petition that they were requesting a territory transfer for grades K-12. The filing of a single petition was based on advice from the author of HB 0491, the revised territory transfer bill which passed during the 55th Legislative Session held in 1997.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">It is undisputed that as of July 1,1997, the Alberton School District became a K-12 school district, and that the Frenchtown School District was likewise a K-12 school district. Thus, the panel concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-10\">Both Alberton and Frenchtown School Districts are K-12 school districts, i.e., their elementary districts have been unified with their respective high school districts to form a single legal entity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>pursuant to Part 7 of Title 20, MCA, and therefore any territory transfer must be for K-12 students.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b611 Nevertheless, the panel concluded that the petition as submitted contained some \u201cminor flaws,\u201d but were not sufficient to \u201crender the petition invalid.\u201d The panel stated that \u201c[i]f indeed there should have been two sets of petitions, the remedy would be to require that the petitioners begin the process anew, this time asking the resident electors to sign in two places rather than one.\u201d This, the panel concluded, was not a reasonable request in light of the \u201cclear intent to include grades K-12 in the transfer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b612 Alberton Trustees filed for judicial review of the County Superintendents\u2019 decision in January of 1998. Alberton Trustees again claimed that the lone petition was deficient pursuant to state law, and that separate petitions were necessaiy where such a transfer involved both high school and elementary school territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b613 Upon motion by both parties, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the County Superintendents on July 7, 1999. Specifically, the court stated that although \u201cthe original petitions reference only \u00a7 20-6-213, MCA, the contents of the petitions satisfy all of the statutory requirements of said section relating to the transfer of territory from one elementary district to another and all of the statutory requirements of \u00a7 20-6-320, MCA, relating to the transfer of territory from one high school district to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u00b614 The court then concluded that the \u201coriginal petitions also clearly reference the transfer of territory to another K-12 District, and it is undisputed that the territory sought therein to be transferred was from one K-12 District (Alberton) to another K-12 District (Frenchtown).\u201d Thus, the court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">Both the District from which the territory was sought to be transferred and the District to receive said territory having met the statutory definition of a K-12 District as set forth in \u00a7 20-6-701(2), MCA, the petitions herein are deemed sufficient, and the decision of the county superintendents is affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The court apparently referred to the \u201cpetition\u201d for territory transfer in the plural form because, as the record shows, numerous copies of the same petition were circulated among residents for the purpose of collecting signatures. Thus, numerous signed \u201cpetitions\u201d were submitted to the Missoula County superintendent, and are a matter of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\u00b615 Alberton Trustees appealed the court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of County Superintendents.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b616 This Court reviews an order granting summary judgment under Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., by utilizing the same criteria as the district court. <em>See Erker v. Kester, </em>1999 MT 231, \u00b6 16, 296 Mont. 123, \u00b6 16, 988 P.2d 1221, \u00b6 16. Summary judgment is a remedy which should be granted when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b6 17 In this instance, no material facts remain in dispute. The granting of summary judgment turned on whether the County Superintendents were entitled to judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to the relevant statutes. When we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law, our standard of review is plenary and we must determine whether the court\u2019s conclusions are correct as a matter of law. <em>See Hicklin v. CSC Logic, Inc. </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 298, 301, 940 P.2d 447, 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">\u00b618 Alberton Trustees contend that the applicable statutes at issue require that two separate petitions must be submitted to a school superintendent in order to transfer both elementary and high school territories from one K-12 school district to another K-12 school district. It is undisputed that only one petition for the transfer in question was made. Because of this procedural technicality, Alberton Trustees contend that the petition hearing as well as the subsequent decision to transfer the territory are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">\u00b619 Accordingly, Alberton Trustees raise the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEI\">\n<em>Whether the District Court erred in affirming a decision to allow the transfer of territory from one school district to another where separate petitions for transfer of the elementary and the high school territories were not used?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">\u00b620 The relevant portion of the statute in question, according to Alberton Trustees, is \u00a7 20-6-213(8), MCA, which provides that a petition \u201cseeking to transfer elementary territory out of or into a K-12 district must be accompanied by a petition to transfer the same territory as high school territory in accordance with 20-6-320.\u201d The statute then provides that \u201c[i]n the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12 district, an elementary petition that is not accompanied by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>high school petition is invalid for the purpose of subsection (3).\u201d Subsection (3) provides that on receipt of a \u201cvalid petition\u201d for a territory transfer, the county superintendent shall: (a) file the petition; (b) set a hearing place, date, and time for consideration of the petition that is not more than 40 days after receipt of the petition; and (c) give notice of the place, date, and time of the hearing. Alberton Trustees argue that without a valid petition in the first instance, all subsequent action pursuant to subsection (3) is likewise invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b621 Alberton Trustees also point out that under \u00a7 20-6-320(8), MCA, a petition \u201cseeking to transfer high school territory out of or into a K-12 district must be accompanied by a petition to transfer the same territory as elementary territory in accordance with 20-6-213.\u201d Likewise, the statute provides that \u201cin the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12 district, a high school petition that is not accompanied by an elementary petition is invalid for the purpose of subsection (3).\u201d Subsection (3) -under \u00a7 20-6-320, MCA, is identical to subsection (3) under \u00a7 20-6-213, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b622 Alberton Trustees argue that pursuant to either of the foregoing statutes, two petitions should have been presented to the Missoula County superintendent, one for the elementary school territory and one for the high school territory. They contend that this two-petition requirement is based on a reasonable reading of the plain language of the statutes, and relies on <em>Skinner Enterprises, Inc. v. Board of Health </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 256, 274, 950 P.2d 733, 744, as well as other related case law for support of this proposition. In <em>Skinner, </em>we provided the following synthesis of the governing rules for construing statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">In construing a statute, this Court must read and construe each statute as a whole so as to avoid an absurd result and to give effect to the purpose of the statute. Indeed, statutes do not exist in a vacuum, [but] must be read in relationship to one another to effectuate the intent of the statutes as a whole. This Court will, if possible, construe statutes so as to give effect to all of them. When more than one statute applies to a given situation, such construction, if possible, is to be adopted as will give effect to all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-7\"><em>Skinner, </em>286 Mont. at 271-72, 950 P.2d at 742 (internal citations and quotations omitted). Additionally, it is beyond dispute that, in ascertaining the Legislature\u2019s intent, we are bound by plain and unambiguous language used in a statute and may not consider legislative history or any other means of statutory construction. <em>See, e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>MacMillan v. State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 202, 208, 947 P.2d 75, 78 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b623 The County Superintendents argue, however, that the foregoing subsections \u2014 which address elementary and high school territories as separate entities \u2014 simply do not apply to the factual circumstances of the Upper Nine Mile petitioners. Rather, the petitioners requested the transfer of combined territory from one K-12 school district into another K-12 district, as defined by \u00a7 20-6-701(2), MCA. Accordingly, the County Superintendents on appeal maintain that only one petition is necessary when the transfer involves the transfer of such combined territory. They, too, argue that this result may be derived from the plain and unambiguous language of the statutes in question. They further contend that the intent of the petitioners was clearly understood by the Missoula County superintendent, who upon receipt of the petition referenced both \u00a7 20-6-213, MCA, and \u00a7 20-6-320, MCA, in her \u201cnotice of hearing,\u201d which set forth the November 12,1997 hearing date and identified the petitioners\u2019 precinct as well as provided information concerning the legal description of the proposed territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u00b624 Therefore, according to County Superintendents, the one petition here satisfies either or both applicable statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 20-6-213 and 20-6-320, MCA. In turn, subsection (8) of each statute is applicable only when one of the school districts involved is not K-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b625 The District Court followed the County Superintendents\u2019 line of reasoning when it concluded that \u201c[a]lthough the original petitions reference only \u00a7 20-6-213, MCA, the contents of the petitions satisfy all of the statutory requirements of said section relating to the transfer of territory from one elementary district to another and all of the statutory requirements of \u00a7 20-6-320, MCA, relating to the transfer of territory from one high school district to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u00b626 This conclusion accords with the conclusion of the county superintendent panel, that \u201c[i]f indeed there should have been two sets of petitions, the remedy would be to require that the petitioners begin the process anew, this time asking the resident electors to sign in two places rather than one.\u201d This, the panel concluded, was not a reasonable request in light of the \u201cclear intent to include grades K-12 in the transfer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u00b627 As a starting point, we agree with Alberton Trustees that we must first look to the plain and unambiguous language of all the statutes at issue in determining what the Legislature requires for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>valid transfer of territory under the circumstances presented here. We begin this inquiry by acknowledging the undisputed material fact that both the Alberton and Frenchtown school districts are K-12 districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b628 Under \u00a7 20-6-701(2), MCA, a K-12 school district \u201cmeans a high school district with an elementary district that has been attached to the high school district under the procedures provided in this section, with the high school district remaining an organized district under the provisions of 20-6-101 and <em>other provisions of law </em>and the elementary district becoming an inactive district under the provisions of 20-6-101\u201d (emphasis added). Neither party argues that this statute is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b629  Thus, in order to give meaning to all the interrelated statutes under Title 20, Chapter 6, a K-12 school district is a high school district upon which an elementary school district has been attached, and remains, for the purposes of the governing statutes, a high school district. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 20-6-101(2)(b), MCA (defining \u201chigh school district\u201d and stating that a high school district with an \u201cattached\u201d elementary district may provide the education services for an elementary district). In this sense, the term \u201cK-12\u201d serves to characterize the <em>kind </em>of high school district in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u00b630  Accordingly, we conclude that the statute, \u00a7 20-6-320, MCA, entitled \u201cTransfer of territory from one high school district to another,\u201d applies to the proposed transfer here.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">\u00b631 Turning solely to \u00a7 20-6-320(1), MCA, we next observe that the Legislature has plainly and unambiguously provided that the \u201cmajority of registered electors of a high school district who reside in territory that is a part of a high school district may petition the county superintendent to transfer the territory in which they reside to another high school district ...\u201d This is precisely what the petition in question sought in requesting a transfer of \u201cTERRITORY K-12.\u201d Next, the statute provides that certain criteria under subsection (1) and (2) be met. It is undisputed that the petition satisfied the criteria under both subsection (1) and (2) under \u00a7 20-6-320, MCA, prior to the hearing, although, as identified above, the petition incorrectly provided that the petition conformed to \u00a7 20-6-213, MCA, and incorrectly stated the permissible taxable value. Further, Alberton Trustees do not challenge the petitioners\u2019 satisfaction of the statutory requirements under either \u00a7 20-6-320(1) and (2), MCA, or the same corollary requirements under \u00a7 20-6-213(1) and (2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>\u00b632 We are left, then, with subsection (8) under \u00a7 20-6-320, MCA. This subsection was added to \u00a7 20-6-320, MCA, in 1997. Prior to its adoption, there was no clear codified process for transferring either elementary school or high school territory in or out of K-12 school districts. Further, subsection (8) \u2014 under either \u00a7\u00a7 20-6-213 or 320, MCA \u2014 has not been addressed by this Court, and therefore our interpretation of the statute is one of first-impression. In its entirety, \u00a7 20-6-320(8), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">A petition seeking to transfer high school territory out of or into a K-12 district must be accompanied by a petition to transfer the same territory as elementary territory in accordance with 20-6-213. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12 district, a high school petition that is not accompanied by an elementary petition is invalid for the purpose of subsection (3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Applying the foregoing to the circumstances at hand, obviously the petitioners were trying to transfer \u201chigh school\u201d territory out of as well as into a K-12 district, and thus a petition to transfer the same Upper Nine Mile territory \u2014 as elementary territory rather than high school territory \u2014 was required by this subsection. We therefore conclude that the County Superintendents\u2019 argument that \u00a7 20-6-320(8), MCA, does not apply to these particular circumstances due to the fact that both territories were K-12 must be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u00b633 The legal question becomes, therefore, not whether a formal, second petition was required, but whether the petition as found valid by the Missoula Superintendent, satisfied the purpose of the foregoing statute: namely, whether the petition was \u201caccompanied\u201d by an elementary \u201cpetition,\u201d one that satisfied the corollary requirements of \u00a7 20-6-213(1) and (2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b634 Neither \u00a7 20-6-213, MCA, nor \u00a7 20-6-320, MCA, precisely define what constitutes a \u201cpetition.\u201d Rather, both statutes provide that first, certain criteria be met before a \u201cpetition\u201d may be submitted to a county superintendent, and second, that the \u201cpetition\u201d must include certain information in order to be valid. The statues simply do not indicate that in this instance \u201caccompanied\u201d requires a separate petition that in turn must be signed by a maj ority of registered electors.</p>\n<p id=\"A0\">\u00b635 As Alberton Trustees would have it, unless a second separate and distinct petition \u201caccompanied\u201d the high school petition, the entire transfer process was invalid. Under similar circumstances, this Court has refused to abide by such a strict, formalistic approach to statutory interpretation, and have readily applied the maxim: \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>law respects form less than substance,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 1-3-219, MCA. <em>See City of Missoula v. Gillispie, </em>1999 MT 268, \u00b6 27, 296 Mont. 444, \u00b6 27, 989 P.2d 401, \u00b6 27. Alberton Trustees\u2019 position disregards the possibility \u2014 which the statutes in question do not forbid \u2014 of simply physically combining the two necessary \u201cpetitions\u201d into one petition, where the proposed territory itself is already legally combined as K-12 territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b636 The petition in question clearly identifies that the territory is K-12, meaning that any elementary school territory \u2014 which as a matter of law was \u201cattached\u201d to the high school district and rendered inactive \u2014 would be transferred. The petition actually focuses on \u00a7 20-6-213, MCA, which applies to the transfer of elementary school territory. The petition identifies that the \u201cnumber of K-12 students residing in the territory is 24.\u201d Thus, the petition to transfer high school territory was unquestionably \u201caccompanied\u201d by a petition to transfer elementary territory as well. That both petitions appeared on but one sheet of paper is far from fatal. In keeping with our rules of statutory interpretation, we conclude that the mandate of invalidity, under \u00a7 20-6-320(8), MCA, may be invoked only where such a petition entirely fails to recognize the existence of elementary school territory.</p>\n<p id=\"AP5\">\u00b637  Therefore, under the circumstances we conclude that the petition in question complied with the mandate of \u00a7 20-6-320(8), MCA. It would be unreasonable, and far too formalistic to require that two separate petitions must be submitted to the school superintendent, where one petition, clearly identifying the intent to transfer both high school and elementary territory, serves the same function.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u00b638 Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court granting summary judgment in favor of the County Superintendents is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b56-6\">JUSTICES HUNT, REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
