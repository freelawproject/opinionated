Marker (Marker) guilty of aggravated assault by accountability in the Fifth Judicial District Court, Jefferson County. The District Court set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial <em>sua sponte. </em>The State of Montana (State) appeals the order. We reverse the order granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal can be restated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">1. Do the time and notice requirements in \u00a7 46-16-702(2), MCA, apply to the District Court when it grants a new trial <em>sua </em>sponte?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by setting aside the verdict and ordering a new trial <em>sua </em>sponte?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">\u00b63 The facts relevant to this discussion are as follows: On January 3, 1998, Marker, Jimmy Piazzola (Piazzola), Kevin Anderson, William Arnold (Arnold), Jamie Norris, and Rick Lamb were involved in a bar fight at the Mint Bar in Whitehall, Montana. During the melee, Arnold was severely injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">\u00b64 Following an investigation, law enforcement charged Marker and Piazzola with misdemeanor assault and misdemeanor disturbing the peace. The next day, before the county attorney was aware of the severity of Arnold\u2019s injuries, Piazzola entered a guilty plea to the misdemeanor charges. Both Marker and Piazzola were charged in District Court with felony assault. In light of Piazzola\u2019s prior plea to the misdemeanor charge, the felony charges against him were dismissed on double jeopardy grounds. The State then pursued the felony assault charges against Marker.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">\u00b65 The matter was tried to a jury. At the close of evidence, the trial court instructed the jury on the elements of aggravated assault, assault, and aggravated assault by accountability. Marker objected to the State\u2019s verdict form and requested that the verdict specify whether the crimes were misdemeanor or felony offenses. The State did not object to Marker\u2019s motion. The judge\u2019s secretary typed the new two-page verdict form. The verdict recorded by the court read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>VERDICT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">WE, THE JURY, rend [sic] our verdict in this cause in the manner following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">Aggravated Assault (a felony)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">GUILTY_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">NOT GUILTY_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">-OR-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">Aggravated Assault By Accountability</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">GUILTY_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-11\">NOT GUILTY_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-12\">\n<em>Consider only one of the above charges</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-13\">If you find the Defendant GUILTY as to one of the charges above, you need go no further.

The jury failed to mark either guilty or not guilty on all other charges. Once the verdict was read, the District Court and attorneys for both sides discussed the jury\u2019s failure to reach a verdict on the misdemeanor counts contained upon the second page of the verdict sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-26\">\u00b67 On May 19,1999, the District Court <em>sua sponte </em>entered an order setting aside the verdict and granting a new trial. The State appeals from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b68 Do the time and notice requirements in \u00a7 46-16-702(2), MCA, apply to the District Court when it grants a new trial <em>sua </em>sponte?</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b69 The State concedes that the District Court has the power to order a new trial <em>sua sponte. </em>The State argues, however, that the District Court abused its discretion in setting aside the jury verdict and ordering a new trial, <em>sua sponte, </em>without following the time and notice requirements set forth in \u00a7 46-16-702(2), MCA (1997)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>'</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\u00b610 Section 46-16-702, MCA, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">Motion for new trial. (1) Following a verdict or finding of guilty, the court may grant the defendant a new trial if required in the interest of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">(2) The motion for new trial must be in writing and must specify the grounds for a new trial. The motion must be filed by the defendant within 30 days following a verdict or finding of guilty and be served upon the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-10\">(3) On hearing the motion for a new trial, if justified by law and the weight of the evidence, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-11\">(a) deny the motion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-12\">(b) grant a new trial; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-13\">(c) modify or change the verdict or finding by finding the defendant guilty of a lesser included offense or finding the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">\u00b611  We reject the State\u2019s argument that the District Court is bound by the notice and time requirements contained in \u00a7 46-16-702(2), MCA. Subsection (2) requires that when a <em>defendant </em>files a motion for a new trial, the motion must be filed within 30 days following the verdict or finding of guilt. It has no bearing on how or when a court, <em>sua sponte, </em>may grant a new trial under subsection (1). We have held that the subsection (2) requirement that a defendant file a motion when seeking a new trial does not affect the court\u2019s inherent power to order a new trial <em>sua sponte </em>when required in the interests of justice. <em>State v. Brummer, </em>1998 MT 11, \u00b6 46, 287 Mont. 168, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\u00b6 46, 953 P.2d 250, \u00b6 46. We now hold that the subsection (2) time and notice requirements pertaining to the filing of motions do not apply to a district court acting <em>sua sponte </em>under subsection (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b612 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by setting aside the verdict and ordering a new trial <em>sua </em>sponte?</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b613 The standard of review for a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a new trial is whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Brummer, </em>\u00b6 49. A district court is authorized to grant a new trial <em>sua sponte </em>in the interests of justice. <em>Brummer, </em>\u00b6 35; \u00a7 46-16-702(1), MCA. \u201cThis authority embodies \u2018the equitable concept that neither a wronged litigant nor society itself can afford to be without some means to remedy a palpable miscarriage of justice.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Brummer, </em>\u00b6 38 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AR1S\">\u00b614 The State argues that the jury instructions fully and fairly stated the law and thus the verdict form was correct. Marker counters that the words \u201cyou need go no further\u201d confused the jury, as is evidenced by the fact that the jury failed to address the charges contained upon the second page of the verdict form. The District Court agreed with Marker and in its memorandum granting the new trial stated: \"After the close of the case, it was brought to the court\u2019s attention that the jury believed that they were not to render a decision on Counts II and III, because the verdict form stated they were to \u2018go no further.\u2019 \u201d The District Court memorandum further stated: \u201cA special post verdict survey completed by the individual jurors confirms this finding.\u201d The court concluded that given the ambiguity of the verdict form the only fair response was to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b615 The record is silent as to how or when the post-verdict survey was conducted by the court. We do not know what questions were asked of which jurors or what responses were elicited. We do know that the jury was not polled pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-604, MCA, which allows for polling of the jury at the request of either party or <em>upon the court\u2019s own motion. </em>Irrespective of the particulars surrounding the post-verdict survey, Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid., prohibits testimony and affidavits of jurors for the purpose of impeaching the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXu\">Testimony of the jurors to impeach their own verdict is excluded not because it is irrelevant to the matter in issue, but because <em>experience has shown that it is more likely to prevent than to promote the discovery of the truth. Hence, the affidavit of a juror cannot he admitted to show anything relating to what passed in the jury room </em>during the investigation of the cause, or the effect of a colloquy be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>tween the court and a juror, or the arguments made to a juror by a fellow juryman.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><em>Boyd v. State Medical Oxygen &amp; Supply, Inc. </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 247, 252, 805 P.2d 1282, 1285-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b616 Rule 606(b) recognizes three exceptions to the rule against allowing jurors to impeach their own verdict. The exceptions allow juror affidavits for purposes of showing (1) whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury\u2019s attention; or (2) whether any outside influence was brought to bear upon any juror; or (3) whether any juror has been induced to assent to any general or special verdict, or finding on any question submitted to them by the court, by a resort to the determination of chance. <em>Sandman v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, </em>1998 MT 286, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 291 Mont. 456, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 969 P.2d 277, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, in which we held that the exceptions to Rule 606(b) are exclusive and narrowly construed. Since the District Court did not purport to act pursuant to any of the three exceptions to Rule 606(b), we can only conclude that its reliance on the post-verdict survey violated the clear mandate of that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b617  We hold that the District Court abused its discretion when, in contravention of Rule 606(b), M.R.Evid., it <em>sua sponte </em>granted a new trial based upon its own post-verdict survey of jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\u00b618 The District Court order vacating Marker\u2019s verdict is reversed and his conviction of aggravated assault by accountability, a felony, is hereby reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b413-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICE REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-16\">.

Brummer, </em>1998 MT 11, 287 Mont. 168, 953 P.2d 250, for the reasons which I articulated in my dissent in that case. <em>See Brummer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 60-75 (Nelson, J., dissenting). I will not reiterate in detail my opposition here other than to note that the majority continues to improperly read language into and out of \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA (1997), in total disregard of what the statute actually says.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">\u00b621 Contrary to the discussion in Issue 1, both subsections (2) and (3) of the statute plainly and unambiguously require that a predicate motion for new trial first be filed before the court has any authority to act under subsections (1) and (3). In its entirety, \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA (1997), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Motion for a new trial. (1) Following a verdict or finding of guilty, the court may grant the defendant a new trial if required in the interest of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\">(2) The motion for a new trial must be in writing and must specify the grounds for a new trial. The motion must be filed by the defendant within 30 days following a verdict or finding of guilty and be served upon the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">(3) On hearing the motion for a new trial, if justified by law and the weight of the evidence, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">(a) deny the motion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">(b) grant a new trial; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">(c) modify or change the verdict or finding by finding the defendant guilty of a lesser included offense or finding the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">\u00b622 Obviously, \u201cThe motion\u201d referred to in subsection (2) refers to the \u201cMotion\u201d in the title of the statute. Moreover, if read independently of subsection (1) \u201cThe motion\u201d in subsection (2) has no antecedent reference. Likewise, \u201cthe motion\u201d referred to in subsection (3) has no antecedent reference apart from subsection (2) and, thus, is, without question, the same \u201cmotion\u201d that must be filed within 30 days following the verdict or finding of guilty as required by subsection (2). Read in context, both subsections (2) and (3) refer back to subsection (1). There is no other logical or grammatically correct way to read the three subsections; each is an integral part of the entirety of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">\u00b623 Indeed, if, as the majority appear to conclude, subsections (1) and (3) apply to the court to the exclusion of the parties, then it still follows that the court may only grant a new trial on the basis of a motion \u2014 not <em>sua sponte. </em>The predicate for subsection (3) is still \u201cthe motion,\u201d just as in subsection (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">\u00b624 That the majority simply choose to ignore \u2014 or read out of the <em>statute </em>\u2014 that part of subsection (3) which provides \u201c[o]n hearing the motion,\u201d in no way changes the clear, logical and unambiguous language of the statute. This technique does, however, fly in the face of the well-settled principles of our case law governing statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">\u00b625 Specifically, these rules require that if the intention of the Legislature can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used, a court may not go further and apply other means of interpretation. In other words, where the statute speaks for itself, there is nothing left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>for the court to construe. <em>Curtis v. Dist. Court of 21st Jud. Dist. </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 231, 235, 879 P.2d 1164, 1166 (citing <em>State v. Hubbard </em>(1982), 200 Mont. 106, 111, 649 P.2d 1331, 1333). See also \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA (the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained in the statute, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted, and to give effect to all of the statute\u2019s provisions and particulars). Moreover, when interpreting various subsections of a statute or various statutes together we adhere to the canon that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-4\">In construing a statute, this Court must read and construe each statute as a whole so as to avoid an absurd result and to give effect to the purpose of the statute. Indeed[, statutes do not exist in a vacuum, [but] must be read in relationship to one another to effectuate the intent of the statutes as a whole. This Court will, if possible, construe statutes so as to give effect to all of them. When more than one statute applies to a given situation, such construction, if possible, is to be adopted as will give effect to all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-5\"><em>Skinner Enterprises v. Board of Health </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 256, 271-72, 950 P.2d 733, 742 (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\u00b626 The majority opinion in <em>Brummer </em>and the majority opinion here as to Issue 1 violate all of these rules of construction. On the other hand, having jumped into interpretational quicksand in <em>Brummer, </em>the majority\u2019s holding in Issue 1 does not come as much of a surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\u00b627 My continuing disagreement with <em>Brummer </em>notwithstanding, I do note, however, that the 1999 Legislature attempted to accommodate this Court\u2019s decision in that case by adding to \u00a7 46-16-702(1), MCA, a new last sentence: <em>\u201cA </em>new trial may be ordered by the court without a motion or may be granted after motion and hearing.\u201d Of course, this amendment begs the question of why, if the pre-1999 version of the statute already clearly and unambiguously provided the trial courts with that authority, as was decreed by the <em>Brummer </em>majority, it subsequently was necessary for the Legislature to textually add what this Court had already said was there. The answer is implicit in the question. <em>Brummer </em>was improperly decided. Prior to our decision the Legislature had neither intended nor assumed that \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA (1997), provided district courts with the power to <em>sua sponte </em>grant new criminal trials. And, following <em>Brummer, </em>recognizing that the statute still contained no such textual authority, the Legislature chose to give trial courts that power by adding to the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>the language that this Court previously \u2014 albeit improperly \u2014 had read into it.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b628 That aside, the more fundamental \u2014 and serious \u2014 problem in <em>Brummer </em>was recognized by Senator Mike Halligan during the legislative debate on the 1999 amendment. Sen. Halligan \u201cremarked that he would rather have this handled by motion and hearing rather than having judges be activists.\u201d See Sec. 1, Ch. 301, L. 1999 (SB 416 minutes of Senate Committee on Judiciary) (February 15,1999). I submit that Sen. Halligan hit the nail on the head. I suggest, however, that the lawmakers unfortunately failed to appreciate the mischief which trial judges were set free to visit upon criminal jury verdicts under our decision in <em>Brummer </em>and, after its amendment, under the revised version of \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u00b629 In my opinion the law should be changed. Because of <em>Brummer </em>and its spawn, there needs to be restored some protection for the finality of and some sense of judicial respect for the sanctity of jury verdicts. It should be and remain the obligation of the defense lawyer \u2014 not the trial judge \u2014 to represent and advocate for the defendant and to determine, in a timely manner, whether and on what grounds a new trial should be requested. It should be and remain the obligation of the court to dispassionately rule on the merits of a motion for new trial following a hearing in which both sides have notice and an opportunity to present arguments for and against. Trial courts should let the lawyers do the lawyering. Trial courts, under the guise of \u201cinherent authority\u201d should not be allowed, months after the fact, to blind-side either party with <em>sua sponte </em>rulings which have no basis in the record, as was the situation in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\u00b630 The bottom line is this: few, if any, criminal jury verdicts are now safe. Bound by no time limits; without a motion from either party; with no objection by a litigant on the record; without notice and hearing; and with no other standard than the judge\u2019s own personal \u201cinnate sense of injustice,\u2019\u2019this State\u2019s trial judges may now exercise jurisprudential and statutory authority to discretionarily overturn criminal jury verdicts. The case at bar \u2014 wherein the trial court, 7 months after the conclusion of the trial, on the basis of an unlawful private jury survey, and without notice to counsel or hearing, <em>sua sponte </em>threw out a lawful jury verdict \u2014 demonstrates just how far afield trial courts can and will run with this newly-minted power.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">\u00b631 Given this state of the law, the next Legislature should exercise <em>its </em>\u201cdiscretion\u201d and <em>its </em>\u201cinherent authority\u201d to impose, at the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>least, some reasonable time limits and notice and hearing requirements on a trial court\u2019s ability to order new trials in criminal cases. Better, the Legislature should make it clear statutorily that new trials may be ordered only on the basis of a timely filed and noticed motion from counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b632 I dissent from our decision as to Issue 1, but concur in our decision as to Issue 2 and as to the result reached in this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-5\">JUSTICE GRAY concurs in the foregoing concurrence and dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"Abe\">JUSTICE HUNT</author>\n<p id=\"AfA\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u00b633 I dissent from the Court\u2019s holding and result based on its determination in the second issue for the reasons stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u00b634 The majority declares that the District Court granted a new trial <em>sua sponte </em>based upon a special post verdict survey, and in doing so, abused its discretion. The District Court does not state that its decision to grant a new trial <em>sua sponte </em>is based upon this survey. Rather, the District Court\u2019s memorandum gives many reasons why the jury verdict form confused the jury and why their verdict did not clearly express the jury\u2019s intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">\u00b635 The District Court found that there were \u201cglaring insufficiencies within the verdict form,\u201d particularly in the absence of the grade of offense of aggravated assault by accountability. It reasoned that the omission of the grade of offense of aggravated assault by accountability may have inadvertently led the jury to believe that it was the lesser included offense or misdemeanor charge alluded to in its Instruction No. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">\u00b636 Instruction No. 10 clearly stated that Marker was charged with a felony in the verdict form which stated \u201cAggravated Assault (a felony).\u201d This instruction went on to say \u201c[i]n the event you find the Defendant not guilty... you must consider the lesser included offense....\u201d Again the verdict form states \u201cAggravated Assault (a felony) -OR\u2014 Aggravated Assault By Accountability.\u201d The District Court reasoned that the jury never saw the lesser included offense contained on the second page of the verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">\u00b637 The District Court found that credence was given to the argument that the jury was confused by the language on the bottom of the first page of the jury form which said, \u201cyou need go no further.\u201d The court reasoned that, \u201cobviously this instruction was taken out of context, for it resulted in the jury\u2019s failure to even address Counts II and III [both contained on page two].\u201d The District Court pointed out that at trial, the jury informed the bailiff that they had reached a verdict, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>but did not specify that they were unable to reach a decision on the other counts. The District Court did not believe that the jury simply refused to make a determination on Counts II and III. Instead, the District Court found that the jury was confused by the verdict form. \u00b638 The District Court briefly mentioned that a special post verdict survey confirmed its finding that the jury was confused and thus the verdict did not express the jury\u2019s intention. The court determined that the language and format of the verdict form were confusing. In addition, the jury failed to completely fill out the verdict form. These incongruities provide more than enough support from the record that the jury was confused. Contrary to the claims of the majority, the District Court\u2019s decision was clearly not based solely on this post verdict survey. Rather, the mention of the post verdict survey appears to have served as a further confirmation to the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the verdict form was flawed. The District Court found that the insufficient verdict precluded it from intelligibly rendering a judgment. The defective form did not clearly express the jury\u2019s intention, and the District Court felt that it could not \u201ccorrect, remold or reform the verdict\u201d and still do its duty. It decided that the only fair response to these serious procedural flaws was to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u00b639 Ultimately, I agree with the District Court that we owe a duty to the defendant to correct what appears to be an injustice to the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">By way of summary, the Court adds that this case sadly reflects little credit to the system, a fault which many, including the Court, must share. The Defendant is the victim and if the verdict stands he faces revocation of a probationary sentence in Madison County. The probation officer is as distressed as the Court because his client was making remarkable progress. This is not to say that he was blameless. As a probationer, he should not have even been in a bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">What bothers the Court and to some extent the prosecution, is that the principal culprit \u201cwalked\u201d and will never be held \u201caccountable,\u201d at least criminally. In contrast it is Defendant who became \u201caccountable.\u201d If he is to be held accountable, it should be in an unflawed proceeding, otherwise justice has not prevailed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u00b640 For the reasons set forth in the Court\u2019s holding in issue one, I concur. Regarding issue two, for the reasons set forth above, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"A3Y\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER joins in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
