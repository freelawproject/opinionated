Whether\u2019a certain legacy to the maker of a note could be set-off against his liability thereon. 2d. To whom did the title to a certain lot of land belong? The jury returned the following verdict: \u201cWe, the jury, decree as follows: 1st. That the balance due on note against the estate of T. M. Nelson, and the legacy in favor of T. M. Nelson, be both canceled. 2d. That the title to lot in dispute be vested in the estate of T. M.

Decree. Before Judge Wjright. DoughertySuperior Court. April Term, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-6\">Hartwell, as executor of James C. Solomon, deceased, brought suit against Tift, administrator of T. M. Nelson, deceased, on a promissory note made by Nelson to R. F. Lyon, or bearer. The amount of the note was $800 00; but on it was indorsed a credit of $500 00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-7\">Tift filed his bill, in which he alleged that Solomon had left to Nelson a legacy of $500 00; that the executor, Hart-well, refused to give his assent thereto, although the estate was free from debt, and there were assets remaining. The prayer was that the aforesaid suit be enjoined, and Hartwell be compelled to pay the balance of the legacy after deducting what should be shown, to be due to his testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-8\">Respondent filed his answer in the nature of a cross-bill. He admitted the legacy as charged in the bill and his refusal to assent thereto. He further alleged that the estate of his testator consisted largely of slaves; that during the war this legacy could have beeu paid; but that Nelson having died, and there being at that time no representation on his estate, no settlement was had ; that since the war nothing was left in his hands, as executor,except certain ante-bellum debts (which he believed to be valueless) and the title to a lot in the city of Columbus; that this lot was bought by his testator from Nelson, and paid for; that the latter referred him to R. F. Lyon for titles; that said Lyon refused to make titles until the purchase mouey should be paid, for which he held Nelson\u2019s note for $800 00; that this was paid by respondent\u2019s testator, and titles taken; that he went into possession of such lot, and so continued until his death, and afterwards it passed to respondent, as executor, and he still pays tax thereon: that some two years since, plaintiff took possession of said lot, claiming'it as part of the estate of Nelson, and is still holding it and receiving profits therefrom ; that such claim has injured his in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>testate\u2019s estate and imperiled its solvency. The prayer is that plaintiff may be compelled to pay the balance due on the promissory note, and reasonable rents for the property, and that the legacy may be scaled so as to arrive at its value in present currency, the intention of testator having been to give it in Confederate money; and, finally, that plaintiff be enjoined from setting up title to the aforesaid lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-5\">To this cross-bill plaintiff answered, denying that the title to said lot ever passed out of his intestate, and averring that the note on which suit was brought was purchased by Solomon from Lyon, the former being in the discounting business; and that the deed made by said Lyon was merely an escrow to secure the payment of the money for which such note was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-6\">The other material facts are contained in the decision.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-7\">S.

There was a good deal of evidence introduced on both sides. The jury returned the following verdict: \u201cWe, the jury, decree as follows: First, that the balance due on the note against the estate of T. M. Nelson, and the legacy in favor of T. M. Nelson, be both canceled. Second, that the title to the lot in dispute be vested in the estate of T. M. Nelson.\u201d Upon this vei\u2019dict the complainant\u2019s solicitor presented a decree to the chancellor for his signature, which he refused to sign on the ground, as stated in the bill of exceptions, that the verdict was void for want of certainty. Whereupon the complainant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">If the verdict was void for uncertainty, then it should have been set aside, but in our judgment, the verdict was not void <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>for uncertainty; its terms are quite plain and easily understood, and the chancellor should have signed a decree thereon as required by the 4212th section of the Code, and it was error in refusing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Let the judgment of the court below be reversed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
