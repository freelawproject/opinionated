For the reasons we shall discuss, that contention fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Appellant also complains about the amount of restitution he has been ordered to pay, and the prosecutor\u2019s comments and conduct during his rebuttal to the defense\u2019s closing argument. We discern no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to closing argument. We conclude, however, that the court erred in determining the amount of restitution. We shall therefore vacate the restitution order and remand for a new determination of the proper amount of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">The underlying facts of this case are straightforward. In April 2001, appellant participated in a scheme that involved the purchase of automotive parts with stolen credit card information. Early in that month, appellant, representing himself as \u201cJohn\u201d from \u201cWade\u2019s Towing,\u201d made a telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>call to Brandywine Auto Parts, Inc. (\u201cBrandywine\u201d). He placed an order for parts, supplying the number of a credit card belonging to Bonnie and Thaddus Rose. He informed the sales clerk that he anticipated making a number of future purchases and wanted to use the same credit card number for each transaction. The clerk recorded the credit card number. During the next several weeks, appellant placed numerous telephone orders using that card number. Appellant or other persons picked up the orders from Brandywine.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">A grand jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Charles County returned an indictment charging appellant with one count of theft of property with a value of $500.00 or more. Following a two-day jury trial, he was found guilty of that offense. The court sentenced appellant to fifteen years\u2019 incarceration, with all but eleven years suspended, and four years\u2019 probation. The court also ordered, as a condition of probation, that appellant pay $6,881.42 in restitution to Brandywine. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Appellant frames the questions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">I. Did the prosecutor\u2019s comments and conduct during closing argument deprive [appellant] of his right to a fair trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">II. Did the trial court err in ordering [appellant] to pay restitution in the amount of $6,881.42?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">A. Maryland\u2019s restitution statute is unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">B. The circuit court erred in failing to make explicit findings of fact with respect to the amount of restitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\">C. The amount of restitution is not supported by competent evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">We shall address the two questions in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">\n<em>Restitution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">Appellant challenges the constitutionality of Maryland\u2019s \u201cstatutory restitution scheme,\u201d arguing that the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>violates due process because it dispenses with the requirement that the State prove by a preponderance of the evidence both the victim\u2019s entitlement to restitution and the amount of it. He points to the statute\u2019s inclusion of the language that a victim\u2019s entitlement to restitution is \u201cpresumed,\u201d enabling the sentencing court to order that relief solely on the basis of \u201ccompetent evidence.\u201d He separately contests the restitution award as not supported by competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The State responds to the merits of appellant\u2019s arguments. The State also interposes the contention that appellant has not preserved the arguments for our review. We first shall consider the State\u2019s preservation argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The court entered the order of restitution in this case as a condition of probation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cAn order to pay restitution as a condition of probation is part of the punishment for the crime. As such, \u2018an illegal condition of probation can be challenged as an illegal sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Goff v. State, </em>387 Md. 327, 340, 875 A.2d 132 (2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">A sentence, if illegal, may be corrected at any time. Md. Rule 4-345(a); <em>Mateen v. Saar, </em>376 Md. 385, 397, 829 A.2d 1007 (2003); <em>see Walczak v. State, </em>302 Md. 422, 427, 488 A.2d 949 (1985) (holding \u201cthat when the trial court has allegedly imposed a sentence not permitted by law, the issue should ordinarily be reviewed on direct appeal even if no objection was made in the trial court\u201d). Appellant contests the restitution order as illegal because it was the product of an unconstitutional statute and it was, in any event, unsupported by competent evidence proved by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The State cites several cases, <em>Brecker v. State, </em>304 Md. 36, 497 A.2d 479 (1985), <em>Saenz v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 238, 620 A.2d 401 (1993), and <em>Corcoran v. State, </em>67 Md.App. 252, 507 A.2d 200, <em>cert. denied, </em>307 Md. 83, 512 A.2d 377, <em>cert. denied, </em>479 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>U.S. 932, 107 S.Ct. 404, 93 L.Ed.2d 357 (1986), in support of its argument that appellant\u2019s contentions are not properly before us. Those cases are inapposite, because none addresses review of the legality of the sentence itself. <em>See Breaker, </em>304 Md. at 39-42, 497 A.2d 479 (distinguishing <em>Walczak, supra, </em>and holding that the appellant\u2019s complaint that the court\u2019s ordering restitution, without first inquiring into his ability to pay restitution, was not preserved for appeal because the argument did not challenge the legality of the sentence and the appellant had not objected to the award on that ground at sentencing); <em>Saenz, </em>95 Md.App. at 241 n. 1, 620 A.2d 401 (noting merely that we would consider Saenz\u2019s appellate argument notwithstanding that his trial counsel\u2019s comment of \u201cThank you, Your Honor\u201d did \u201cnot constitute an objection\u201d that would preserve Saenz\u2019s argument for appellate review); <em>Corcoran, </em>67 Md.App. at 254-55, 507 A.2d 200 (distinguishing <em>Walczak </em>and holding that the appellant waived the contention that Maryland Rule 4-346 was violated because the hearing was held before someone other than the sentencing judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The contentions appellant presents attack the substantive legality of the restitution order. Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s failure to object at sentencing, his arguments are properly before us. <em>See Goff, </em>387 Md. at 339-40, 875 A.2d 132; <em>Walc-zak, </em>302 Md. at 427, 488 A.2d 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\n<em>The constitutional challenge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Appellant\u2019s first attack is grounded in a challenge to the constitutionality of a portion of Maryland\u2019s restitution statute. For purposes of this case, the operative version of the statute is Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.VoL, 2000 Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 807. That section in pertinent part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">(a) <em>Restitution upon conviction, acceptance of plea of nolo contendere, etc.; priority of payment; reasons for not ordering restitution. </em>-(1) A court may issue a judgment of restitution directing a defendant to make restitution in addition to any other penalty for the commission of a crime, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>(i) Property of the victim was stolen, damaged, destroyed, converted, unlawfully obtained, or its value substantially decreased as a direct result of the crime;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">(2) A victim is <em>presumed </em>to have a right to restitution under paragraph (1) of this subsection if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">(i) The victim or the State requests restitution; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">(ii) The court is presented with <em>competent evidence </em>of any of items (i) through (vi) of paragraph (1) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Focusing upon \u00a7 807(a)(2), appellant declares that the statute \u201cviolates due process because it does not require the State to prove the facts supporting an award of restitution by a preponderance of the evidence, and instead creates a presumption that restitution is warranted merely upon \u2018competent evidence\u2019 of a qualifying loss by the victim.\u201d Appellant insists that, \u201cunder the statutory scheme governing restitution, the existence of any evidence of a loss, so long as it is not legally incompetent, generates a presumption that restitution is warranted, no matter how unpersuasive the \u2018competent evidence\u2019 may be in light of the totality of the evidence before the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">We disagree that the statute\u2019s reference to competent evidence generating a presumption of a qualifying loss by the victim eliminates the proof required for imposition of a restitution award. As we consider the issue, we are guided by the standard rules of statutory construction, principal among which is that we give effect to the plain language of the statute. <em>Goff, </em>387 Md. at 341, 875 A.2d 132. Moreover, when, as here, a statute\u2019s constitutionality is challenged, our consideration of the issue is governed by the principles that \u201cthere is a presumption that the statute is valid,\u201d and appellate courts are \u201creluctant to find a statute unconstitutional if, by any construction, it can be sustained.\u201d <em>Galloway v. State, </em>365 Md. 599, 610, 781 A.2d 851 (2001) (citations and internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 990, 122 S.Ct. 1547, 152 L.Ed.2d 472 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">By no stretch can it successfully be argued that Article 27, \u00a7 807 eliminates the basic requirement that the State prove the victim\u2019s entitlement to a restitution award. Certainly, the State must introduce \u201ccompetent evidence\u201d to carry its burdens of production and persuasion that the victim is entitled to restitution, and, if so, the amount of it. \u201cCompetent evidence\u201d is simply evidence that is reliable and admissible. <em>See In re Billy W., </em>387 Md. 405, 433, 875 A.2d 734 (2005) (citing <em>Alix v. E-Z Serve Corp., </em>846 So.2d 156, 159 (La.App. 2003), for the proposition that \u201ccompetent evidence\u201d is evidence that has \u201csome degree of reliability and trustworthiness\u201d); <em>Grier v. State, </em>351 Md. 241, 261, 718 A.2d 211 (1998) (\u201cIncompetent evidence refers to evidence that is inadmissible for reasons other than relevancy.\u201d); Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook, </em>\u00a7 600 at 233 (3d ed.1999) (stating that \u201c[t]he competency issue focuses upon the inherent reliability of the evidence being offered. Evidence that passes the relevancy and materiality tests will be admitted unless it is incompetent or privileged\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">We are convinced that a victim\u2019s entitlement to a restitution award and the amount of the award are facts that the State must establish by a preponderance of the evidence. The Supreme Court has held that use of the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof during sentencing generally satisfies due process. <em>See United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 156, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997) (per curiam); <em>McMillan v. Pennsylvania, </em>477 U.S. 79, 91-92, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986); <em>cf. Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 487 n. 13, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (noting that the holding of <em>McMillan </em>is not overruled; rather, the holding is limited \u201cto cases that do not involve the imposition of a sentence more severe than the statutory maximum for the offense established by the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The federal courts and a number of our sister states require the prosecution, by statute or by case law, to prove a victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>entitlement to restitution by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Palma, </em>760 F.2d 475, 480 (3rd Cir.1985) (stating that, by statute, the government must prove the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss by a preponderance of the evidence); <em>Ex Parte Stutts, </em>897 So.2d 431, 433 (Ala.2004) (stating that, at a restitution hearing, the court need be convinced only by a preponderance of the evidence); <em>In re Stephanie B., </em>204 Ariz. 466, 65 P.3d 114, 118 (2003) (stating that \u201c[t]he burden of proof applicable to restitution is proof by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d); <em>People v.

Richmond, </em>137 Idaho 35, 43 P.3d 794, 796 (2002) (stating that, by statute, when determining the amount of restitution in a criminal case, \u201ceconomic loss shall be based upon the preponderance of evidence submitted to the court by the prosecutor, defendant, victim or presentence investigator\u201d); State <em>v.

Hughes, </em>154 Wash.2d 118, 110 P.3d 192, 211 (2005) (stating that, when \u201cdetermining] the amount of restitution, the trial court can either rely on a defendant\u2019s acknowledgment or it can determine the amount by a preponderance of evidence\u201d); <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>190 Wis.2d 252, 528 N.W.2d 9, 11 (1994) (stating that, whereas a jury must be convinced of the value of an item beyond a reasonable doubt, the sentencing court may determine the amount of loss to the victim of a crime by a preponderance of the evidence); <em>Renfro v. State, </em>785 P.2d 491, 493 (Wyo.1990) (stating that \u201c[p]roof of the restitution amount as a question of sentence need only be proved by credible evidence, by a preponderance, or burden of the evidence\u201d); <em>see also 5 </em>Wayne R. LaFave <em>et al., Criminal Procedure, </em>\u00a7 26.6(c) (2002) (stating that, generally, courts must find the facts underlying a restitution order by a preponderance of the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The language of Article 27, \u00a7 807(a)(2) does not eliminate the preponderance of the evidence proof requirement, as appellant contends. That subsection provides that, once the State establishes by competent evidence that the victim is entitled to restitution, then the victim is \u201cpresumed\u201d to have a right to it. We construe \u201cpresumed\u201d in that context to mean simply that, once the State proves by competent evidence the loss to the victim, the court should award the victim that amount of restitution unless the court determines it is not appropriate to do so. Indeed, \u00a7 807 specifically addresses such a possibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">(4) A court need not issue a judgment of restitution under this section if the court finds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">(i) That the defendant or liable parent does not have the ability to pay the judgment of restitution; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">(ii) Good cause to establish extenuating circumstances as to why a judgment of restitution is inappropriate in a case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Section 807, read as a whole, makes plain that the State is not relieved of its obligation at sentencing to prove a victim\u2019s entitlement to restitution. The statute does not offend due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\n<em>Competency of the evidence and the court\u2019s findings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Appellant argues that the court erred because it did not require the introduction of competent evidence of an appropriate award of restitution, and because the court did not make explicit findings concerning the amount of restitution ordered. The State counters that the court is not required to make explicit findings before entering an award of restitution. The State further maintains that, because appellant did not contest the restitution award at the sentencing hearing, he may not be heard to complain about it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">We already have held that appellant has not waived the argument by failing to raise it at sentencing. Moreover, we agree with appellant that there is a disputed factual basis for the circuit court\u2019s restitution order. Certain bills and credit card receipts were admitted into evidence at trial. By our calculation, those bills total $7,001.24. The prosecutor did not rely on any of those documents at sentencing; instead, he merely proffered that restitution should be ordered in the amount of $6,881.42. That number conflicted not only with the total amount of the bills and invoices admitted into evidence, but also with other dollar amounts represented in the case: $6,400.00 (state\u2019s opening statement); and $6,558.00 (state\u2019s rebuttal closing argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">We hold that the prosecutor\u2019s representations during the sentencing phase of appellant\u2019s trial do not constitute \u201ccompetent evidence\u201d of Brandywine\u2019s loss. <em>See, e.g., State v. Shelton, </em>167 N.C.App. 225, 605 S.E.2d 228, 233-34 (2004) (holding that a prosecutor\u2019s unsworn statement of economic loss during sentencing was insufficient to sustain an award of restitution, particularly when the record did not include any evidence supporting the statement); <em>Winborn v. State, </em>625 So.2d 977, 977 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1993) (reversing a restitution order on the ground that a prosecutor\u2019s statement regarding the vie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>tim\u2019s loss in a grand theft case was not \u201ccompetent evidence\u201d sufficient to establish the victim\u2019s loss).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">It is evident from the record that Brandywine is entitled to some measure of recompense for the loss sustained as the result of the theft by appellant; indeed, appellant does not argue otherwise. We therefore shall vacate the order of restitution and remand the case to the circuit court so that it may conduct a restitution hearing, at which the prosecution must establish, by competent evidence, the appropriate amount of restitution to be ordered in this case. Our disposition obviates the need to address appellant\u2019s additional argument that the court failed to make explicit findings concerning the amount of restitution ordered. We nevertheless point out that in every case the record should clearly reflect the basis for the amount of restitution ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">\n<em>Closing argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Appellant assails the trial court\u2019s decision to permit the prosecutor to make what appellant describes as an improper closing argument. Appellant argues that: (1) the prosecutor twice invited the jurors to consider their own interests by urging them to place themselves in the shoes of the victim (the so-called \u201cgolden rule\u201d argument); and (2) the prosecutor approached the defense table and \u201cpointed in [appellant\u2019s] face\u201d while characterizing him as a \u201cthief.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Appellant asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s actions violated his right to a fair trial. He declares that this was a close case, and that he was prejudiced because the jury\u2019s attention was \u201cdiverted from the evidence by the prosecutor\u2019s variation of the prohibited Golden Rule argument and his inflammatory statements.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">\u201cThe prosecutor is allowed liberal freedom of speech and may make any comment [during closing argument] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>that is warranted by the evidence or inferences reasonably drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Grandison v. State, </em>341 Md. 175, 224, 670 A.2d 398 (1995) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted), cert. <em>denied, </em>519 U.S. 1027, 117 S.Ct. 581, 136 L.Ed.2d 512 (1996). Indeed, not every improper remark requires reversal of the conviction. <em>See Hill v. State, </em>355 Md. 206, 226, 734 A.2d 199 (1999); <em>see also Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 432-37, 722 A.2d 887 (1999) (attorneys enjoy great leeway during closing argument). Rather, \u201c[rjeversal ... is only required where it appears that the remarks of the prosecutor actually misled the jury or were likely to have misled or influenced the jury to the prejudice of the accused.\u201d <em>Grandi-son, </em>341 Md. at 244, 670 A.2d 398 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Lawson v. State, </em>389 Md. 570, 580, 886 A.2d 876 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The \u201cdetermination of whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments were prejudicial or simply rhetorical flourish lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. On review, an appellate court should not reverse the trial court unless that court clearly abused the exercise of its discretion and prejudiced the accused.\u201d <em>Spain v. State, </em>386 Md. 145, 158-59, 872 A.2d 25 (2005) (quoting <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 431, 722 A.2d 887). In other words, we defer to the trial court\u2019s evaluation of the effect of a comment upon the jury. <em>Henry v. State, </em>324 Md. 204, 231, 596 A.2d 1024 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 972, 112 S.Ct. 1590, 118 L.Ed.2d 307 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The argument about which appellant complains was made during the State\u2019s rebuttal, and in response to defense counsel\u2019s suggestion, during his argument, that Brandywine employees attempted to cover up their handling of the credit card transactions. Defense counsel pointed out several facts suggested by the evidence and then argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">Those things lead me to believe that after the fact when the bank started calling and somebody [at the store] had screwed up that there was a little bit of damage control there. Because, as anyone knows, the ... when you sit there and you\u2019re stupid about the way you transact busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>ness, that you get what you deserve. And, I think that a lot of this is that they tried to cover it up after the fact kind of thing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Evidently perceiving that argument as defense counsel\u2019s attempt to \u201cblame the victim,\u201d the prosecutor responded with the following during rebuttal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: You know and at some point ... at one point during his argument [defense counsel] said, \u201c[a Brandywine employee] thought about damage control ... you get what you deserve.[\u201d] Okay. Mrs. 7-11 clerk, if you\u2019re counting money at 1 a.m., you deserve to get robbed. Young lady, you\u2019re walking to the park alone at night, you deserve to get attacked. Grandma ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Defense counsel objected, the court overruled the objection, and the prosecutor continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Grandma, when a guy says he runs a lottery and he\u2019s going to double your five thousand dollars in thirty days if you give him five thousand dollars, shame on you. Let\u2019s blame the victim. Okay. Could if [sic] Brandywine had been a little bit more careful? Sure. But, because they could have been more careful, we\u2019re going to let this thief walk?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Defense counsel again objected, and the court called the attorneys to the bench, where the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I\u2019m okay with the conclusion of thief by [the prosecutor] one time, but when he comes over and when he comes over to the table and he points in his face and he says the thief again, that\u2019s too much, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-13\">THE COURT: Well ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It\u2019s [the prosecutor\u2019s] opinion is all it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-15\">THE COURT: Well, of course it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And it\u2019s inflammatory because of the way it\u2019s done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>THE COURT: Well, I think you ought to wander around the courtroom less. Okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The bench conference concluded and the prosecutor resumed his rebuttal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: And, ultimately, did they do anything terribly wrong? They believe in good customer service. They believe in a fantasy world where you could trust people. A much better world to live in, I think, than [defense counsel\u2019s] world where you\u2019ve got to double check everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">The prosecutor concluded rebuttal without further objection. At no time did defense counsel request a mistrial or other relief on the basis of the above remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">Appellant characterizes the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument as akin to the prohibited \u201cgolden rule\u201d argument. \u201cA \u2018golden rule\u2019 argument is one in which an arguing attorney asks the jury to place themselves in the shoes of the victim.\u201d <em>Lawson, </em>389 Md. at 593 n. 11, 886 A.2d 876 (citations omitted). Such argument is impermissible because it \u201cimproperly appeals to [the jurors\u2019] prejudices and asks them to abandon their neutral fact finding role.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594, 886 A.2d 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">Appellant directs us to the following cases: <em>Hill, </em>355 Md. at 225, 734 A.2d 199 (cautioning this Court to \u201cremain cognizant of [our] own conclusion that appeals to jurors to convict a defendant in order to preserve the safety or quality of their communities are improper and prejudicial\u201d); <em>Holmes v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 518, 526-27, 705 A.2d 118 (1998) (disapproving of prosecutor\u2019s comments to jury that the case is \u201c \u2018about the day of reckoning, the day of accountability, the day we say no, Mr. Holmes, no longer will we allow you to spread that poison on the streets\u2019 \u201d); and <em>Couser v. State, </em>36 Md.App. 485, 501-02, 374 A.2d 399 (1977) (characterizing as improper the prosecutor\u2019s remarks to the jury that \u201cby your vote you can say no to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>drug dealers, to people who rain destruction\u201d but holding that the remarks did not constitute reversible error because of a curative instruction). We shall also consider <em>Lawson. See </em>389 Md. at 594-95, 886 A.2d 876 (addressing the impropriety of the prosecutor\u2019s question to the jurors that asked them to place themselves in the shoes of the mother whose child had been sexually molested).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Appellant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s argument generated the same fairness concerns as in those cases. We do not read the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument in the same light as does appellant. The prosecutor\u2019s argument strikes us as a legitimate response to the defense counsel\u2019s statement, during his argument, that \u201cBecause, as anyone knows, [ ] ... when you [meaning the Brandywine employees] sit there and you\u2019re stupid about the way you transact business, that you get what you deserve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Nor do we conclude that reversal is required because the prosecutor twice referred to appellant as a thief, while (at least once) standing near him and pointing at him. The trial judge evidently concluded that the reference was not beyond the bounds of legitimate argument, but admonished the prosecutor to \u201cwander around the courtroom less.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">To be sure, this Court has found it improper for a prosecutor to refer to the defendant in a murder trial as a \u201ckiller.\u201d <em>Mouzone v. State, </em>33 Md.App. 201, 210, 364 A.2d 58 (1976). This Court also has found it improper for a prosecutor to refer to the defendant in a child sexual abuse case as \u201can animal\u201d and a \u201cpervert.\u201d <em>Walker v. State, </em>121 Md.App. 364, 380-81, 709 A.2d 177 (1998). Likewise, the Court of Appeals has found it improper for a prosecutor to refer to a defendant charged with second degree rape of a child as a \u201cmonster.\u201d <em>Lawson, </em>389 Md. at 596-97, 886 A.2d 876. As we said in <em>Walker, </em>counsel should \u201crefer to the actions of a defendant rather than resort to epithets, thereby avoiding the unnecessary risk of overturning any conviction obtained.\u201d 121 Md.App. at 382, 709 A.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>We nonetheless are persuaded by our review of the record in its entirety, including the strong case the State presented against appellant, that the prosecutor\u2019s words and actions during closing argument did not render appellant\u2019s trial unfair. Even were we to assume that the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal comments overstepped the bounds of legitimate argument, we are convinced that none of those comments \u201cactually misled the jury or were likely to have misled or influenced the jury to the prejudice of the accused.\u201d <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 431, 722 A.2d 887 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">ORDER OF RESTITUTION VACATED AND CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CHARLES COUNTY FOR A NEW RESTITUTION HEARING CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
