In his brief in this Court, Janey raised two issues for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-4\">1. Whether the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to instruct the jury as requested on the issue of cross-racial identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">2. Whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain Janey\u2019s conviction for obstruction of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">We revisit our decision in <em>Smith v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 673, 679, 857 A.2d 1198 (2004), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Smith and, Mack v. State, </em>388 Md. 468, 880 A.2d 288 (2005), in which we held that it is within the trial judge\u2019s discretion to decide whether to give a requested jury instruction regarding cross-racial eyewitness identification. We conclude that the Court of Appeals\u2019s ruling in <em>Smith and Mack </em>that, in some circumstances, cross-racial identification is a permissible subject of comment in closing argument does not impose an obligation upon the trial judge to give a separate instruction on this issue. We shall hold that the decision of whether to give such an instruction, when requested, remains committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. We find no abuse of discretion in the trial judge\u2019s refusal to give the requested jury instruction in Janey\u2019s case, and shall affirm the conviction for second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The State concedes that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the conviction for obstruction of justice, and we shall reverse that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">At Janey\u2019s trial, Eugene Jones, who was one of Janey\u2019s long-time Mends, testified, under a grant of immunity, that Janey had called him on the evening of April 1, 2003, and asked him to go for a ride. Jones testified that when Janey picked him up, Janey asked him if he had any shovels. Jones borrowed two shovels from his sister\u2019s house, and went for a ride in Janey\u2019s pickup truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>According to Jones\u2019s testimony, Janey and Jones first drove to the St. Leonard\u2019s Seventh Day Adventist Church, and dug a hole large enough to dispose of a body. After digging the hole, they stopped at two filling stations, and at each gas station, they \u201cthrew something in the trash.\u201d At the second filling station, Janey asked Jones to help him unbolt the large metal toolbox that was fastened to the rear of the pickup. Jones noted that Janey asked the \u201clittle foreign guy\u201d who owned the station for a tool to assist them. According to Jones, Janey \u201cknew the guy, so he went in and asked him, and he came and helped us out.\u201d They eventually loosened all of the bolts.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Jones further testified that Janey then drove him to Janey\u2019s apartment, and asked him to help carry the toolbox from the pickup to the apartment. When they reached the apartment, Jones observed scratches on Janey\u2019s face, and Janey told Jones that his wife, Ebony Janey, had scratched him. Janey confessed to Jones that he had gotten into an argument with his wife, and \u201c[t]hat he killed her, that he broke her neck.\u201d Janey showed Jones Ebony Janey\u2019s dead body, and enlisted Jones\u2019s assistance in disposing of the body and cleaning up the apartment. The two men placed the dead body in the large toolbox, then carried the box downstairs to the pickup, and drove back to the hole they had dug, where they buried Ebony Janey\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In the course of investigating Mrs. Janey\u2019s disappearance, the police interviewed Jones because he was a known associate of Mr. Janey. Jones was initially uncooperative, but eventually, through legal counsel, Jones agreed to provide information regarding Mrs. Janey\u2019s disappearance if Jones were granted immunity. After arrangements were made that were satisfactory to Jones and his attorney, Jones led police to the grave containing Mrs. Janey\u2019s body, and testified at Janey\u2019s trial as summarized above.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">One of the witnesses the prosecution called at trial to corroborate Jones\u2019s story was Zaheer Akhtar, who was identified as the \u201cforeign guy\u201d from the second gas station men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>tioned in Jones\u2019s account of events. Mr. Akhtar identified Janey as one of two men who came to his gas station on the night of April 1, 2003. Mr. Akhtar\u2019s testimony included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">[PROSECUTOR:] On the evening of April 1st, 2003 did you speak with someone who needed help loosening some bolts on the tool box in the back of a pickup truck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">A Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">Q Can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">A I was sitting in my office and a gentleman pointed me [sic] from my garage door. He signaled me like that. I went outside. He was trying to take the tool box off the truck. He asked me for the specific socket ... for the taking the bolt off the tool box, and he was asking me actually the wrong socket, but I told him which one he needed. I went to try to help him. In the meantime he already taken care of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">Q So he asked you for help, but by the time you could get him the right socket he had already gotten it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-10\">A He has already got it off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-11\">Q Was there two gentlemen there or just one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-12\">A Two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-13\">Q Now, the one who was talking to you, do you recall if there was anything unusual about his face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-14\">A Yes. I saw scuff, you know, like I describe on my paper on testimony before. It\u2019s a shiny, you know, face on \u2014 like a cat type, you know, like you defend some \u2014 somebody. It was like Vaseline, you know, on his face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-15\">Q So it was scratches?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-16\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-17\">Q Like a cat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-18\">A Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-19\">Q And then there was Vaseline on top of the scratches?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>A On the top of them, I mean the shiny thing. So I describe Vaseline, it could be anything else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">Q It looked to you like Vaseline?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">Q Now, this person with the scratches on his face, had you seen him before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">AI saw him once before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">Q And how was it you came to see him once before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-10\">A One time he asking me if I can switch couple tires for him, he \u2014 I talked to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-11\">Q So he had been in your shop before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-12\">A Just one time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-13\">Q Is that person that you spoke to that night that you helped, is he in the courtroom today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-14\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-15\">Q Can you identify him please for the ladies and gentlemen of the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-16\">A He is right over there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-17\">On cross-examination, defense counsel brought out the fact that Mr. Akhtar had previously had difficulty selecting Janey\u2019s picture from an array of six photographs. Mr. Akhtar further admitted that he has difficulty identifying African Americans:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKa\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] And at the time that you looked at these photos at least by [the detective\u2019s] account it took you about two minutes, is that a fair\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-18\">AI guess it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-19\">Q And at the time that you looked at the pictures Detective Whitacker said that you had indicated it could be that person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-20\">AI said \u2014 because I told him I said I am not very good with, you know, these kind of faces. If \u2014 I said if you look at Asian face, a whole bunch of them, you will not recognize. But if I see a whole bunch of African American face, I\u2019ll probably miss, you know, I\u2019m not very good picking. So I said I know this is person here, but I could be \u2014 but I said if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>I see him again, I will point it very quickly. Because these faces, if you look at it, it look like same, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">Q So you were a little unsure when you looked at the photographs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">A Yes, but then I pointed, I said, yes, this is the person. Q Now ... did Detective Whitacker ever say, well, let\u2019s do a line-up where you could actually see the people?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">Q The only thing he did was this photo spread?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\">A That\u2019s exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">Q And the of course seeing Mr. Janey sitting here today? A Yes. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-11\">Q Now, after you picked out picture number four you asked Detective Whitacker if you had picked the right person, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-12\">A Well, I was just asking like did I did right thing for you, he said I can\u2019t tell you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-13\">Q But you were still unsure, you wanted to ask him if you had picked the right person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-14\">A Well, I just want to ask him, you know, just formality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-15\">Q And you called [the defendant] Mr. Janey. Did you know his name was Janey before all of this happened? A No, not really the name, but I met him one time before. He came to my shop. He said \u2014 he was nice person. He told me he moved in this county and he needs a couple tire change. I help him out, and he told me he just moved in, and his brother was helping him with his tires and stuff like that. So, you know, that\u2019s why he pointed me, and he said you remember me, I said yes, I remember you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-16\">Q But at the time this happened in April you didn\u2019t know his name was William Janey, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-17\">A No. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Q ... but the reason you used the name Janey today is because you have learned the name Janey between April and now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">A ... exactly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">On redirect examination, Mr. Akhtar responded \u201cyes\u201d when asked whether, even though he could not recall the date Janey came to the station, he was \u201csure that the person [he] saw that night had scratches on his face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Relying upon the concurring opinion of Chief Judge Bazelon in <em>United States v. Telfaire, </em>469 F.2d 552, 561 (D.C.Cir.1972), the defense requested that the trial court instruct the jury as follows with respect to the reliability of cross-racial identification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">In this case, the identifying witness is of a different race than the defendant. In the experience of many, it is more difficult to identify the members of a different race than members of one\u2019s own. If this is also your own experience, you may consider it in evaluating the witness\u2019s testimony. You must also consider, of course, whether there are other factors present in this case which overcome any such difficulty of identification. For example, you may conclude that the witness has had sufficient contacts with members of the defendant\u2019s race that [he] would not have great difficulty in making a reliable identification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">(The requested instruction is identical to the instruction on cross-racial identification that was requested, but not given, in <em>Smith v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 673, 679, 857 A.2d 1198 (2004), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Smith and Mack v. State, </em>388 Md. 468, 880 A.2d 288 (2005).)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">The trial judge refused to give this instruction. He instead charged the jury using the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions relating to credibility of witnesses and identification testimony, MPJI-Cr. 3:10 and 3:30:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-11\">You are the sole judges of whether \u2014 or judge of whether a witness should be believed. In making this decision you may apply your own common sense and every day experiences. In determining whether a witness should be be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>lieved you should carefully judge all the testimony and evidence and the circumstances under which the witness testified. You should consider such factors as the witness\u2019s behavior on the stand and manner of testifying, did the witness appear to be telling truth, the witness\u2019s opportunity to see or hear the things about which testimony was given, the accuracy of the witness\u2019s memory, does the witness have a motive not to tell the truth, does the witness have an interest in the outcome of the case, was the witness\u2019s testimony supported or contradicted by evidence that you believe, and whether and the extent to which the witness\u2019s testimony in court differed from the statements made by the witness on any previous occasion. You need not believe any witness, even if the testimony is uncontradicted. You may believe all, part, or none of the testimony of any witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">The burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense was committed and the defendant was the person who committed it. You have heard evidence regarding the identification of the defendant as the person who committed the crime. In this connection you should consider the witness\u2019s opportunity to observe the criminal act and the person committing it, including the length of time the witness had to observe the persons committing the crime, the witness\u2019s state of mind, and any other circumstances surrounding the event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">You should also consider the witness\u2019s certainty or lack of certainty, the accuracy of any prior description, and the witness\u2019s credibility or lack of credibility, as well as any other factors surrounding the identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">The identification of the defendant by a single eyewitness as the person who committed the crime if believed beyond a reasonable doubt can be enough evidence to convict the defendant. However, you should examine the identification of the defendant with great care. It is for you to determine the reliability of any identification and give it the weight you believe it deserves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>After the trial judge instructed the jury, counsel for the defendant objected, as required by Maryland Rule 4-325(e), to the court\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction regarding cross-racial identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The general rule regarding jury instructions is that the trial judge \u201chas a duty, upon request in a criminal case, to instruct the jury on the applicable law.\u201d <em>Gunning v. State, </em>347 Md. 332, 347, 701 A.2d 374 (1997). Maryland Rule 4-325(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">The court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding.... The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">In evaluating a trial court\u2019s refusal to charge a jury as requested, a reviewing court \u201cmust determine whether the requested instruction was a correct statement of the law; whether it was applicable under the facts of the case <em>[i.e., </em>whether the evidence was sufficient to generate the desired instruction]; and whether it was fairly covered in the instructions actually given.\u201d <em>Gunning, </em>347 Md. at 348, 701 A.2d 374 (quoting <em>Grandison v. State, </em>341 Md. 175, 211, 670 A.2d 398 (1995), <em>cert. denied., </em>519 U.S. 1027, 117 S.Ct. 581, 136 L.Ed.2d 512 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">In contrast to the judge\u2019s duty to instruct the jury as to the applicable law, however, there is generally no duty for a trial court to give instructions that emphasize particular facts in evidence. In <em>Patterson v. State, </em>356 Md. 677, 684-85, 741 A.2d 1119 (1999), Judge Cathell wrote for the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">Maryland Rule 4-325(c) imposes a requirement that instructions be given in respect to the applicable law in a case. It does not apply to factual matters or inferences of fact. Instructions as to facts and inferences of fact are normally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>not required. When a party fails to produce evidence, an inference may be made against it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">... Elements, affirmative defenses and certain presumptions relate to the requirement that a party meet a burden of proof that is set by a legal standard. A trial judge must give such an instruction if the evidence generates the right to it because it sets the legal guidelines for the jury to act effectively as the trier of fact. An evidentiary inference, such as a missing evidence or missing witness inference, however, is not based on a legal standard but on the individual facts from which inferences can be drawn and, in many instances, several inferences may be made from the same set of facts. A determination as to the presence of such inferences does not normally support a jury instruction. While supported instructions in respect to matters of law are required upon request, instructions as to evidentiary inferences normally are not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\"><em>Accord Lowry v. State, </em>368 Md. 357, 374, 768 A.2d 688 (2001)(per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Notwithstanding the general rule that instructions relating to facts and inferences to be drawn from the evidence need not be given, the Court of Appeals has expressed concern that jurors may need guidance in some cases to assist them in evaluating eyewitness identification testimony. In <em>Gunning, </em>supra, the trial judge had rejected out of hand a request that the judge give MPJI-Cr 3:30 (regarding identification testimony). Judge Chasanow wrote for the Court of Appeals, 347 Md. at 354-55, 701 A.2d 374 (footnotes omitted)(emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">If a party requests an identification instruction in a criminal case, the trial judge must evaluate whether the instruction is applicable to the facts of the case at hand, keeping in mind that the purpose of a jury instruction is \u201cto aid the jury in clearly understanding the case, to provide guidance for the jury\u2019s deliberations, and to help the jury arrive at a correct verdict.\u201d <em>Chambers v. State, </em>337 Md. 44, 48, 650 A.2d 727, 729 (1994). <em>When uncorroborated eyewitness testimony is a critical element of the State\u2019s case and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>doubts have been raised about the reliability of that testimony, a request for an eyewitness identif\u00edcation instruction should be given careful consideration. </em>Conversely, a request for an eyewitness identification instruction may be rejected when there is corroboration of the defendant\u2019s participation in the crime, when the circumstances surrounding the eyewitness identification do not give rise to any reasonable doubts as to its accuracy, or when other instructions contain criteria or guidance that is similar to the requested instruction. Such determinations lie within the sound discretion of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In <em>Gunning, </em>the trial judge in two separate cases had refused to give a requested eyewitness identification instruction. In each case, the defendant was convicted on the basis of uncorroborated eyewitness identification testimony. Each defendant had interposed a mistaken-identity defense, but the requested instruction was rejected in each instance because the trial court was of the opinion that identification was a question of fact that required no specific instruction to the jury. The trial judge further commented that he \u201cnever\u201d gives a witness identification instruction, and that it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that MPJI-Cr 3:30 \u201cfound its way into the pattern jury instructions.\u201d 347 Md. at 339, 701 A.2d 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed, but in doing so, did not hold that the failure to give such an instruction was reversible error. Rather, after surveying the division of authority on the issue of whether identification instructions must be given in every case involving eyewitness testimony, the Court of Appeals declined to adopt a mandatory rule, and agreed with those courts that have \u201cheld that the decision as to whether to give such an instruction lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Gunning, </em>347 Md. at 345, 701 A.2d 374 (footnote omitted). The Court stated: \u201cWe do not find instructions on such issues to be always mandatory, but neither do we consider them never necessary or <em>per se </em>improper as suggested by the trial judge. We instead recognize that an identification instruction may be appropriate and necessary in certain in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>stances, but the matter is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348, 701 A.2d 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The reversible error in <em>Gunning </em>was that the trial judge had not exercised any discretion. As the Court of Appeals pointed out, \u201cthe judge\u2019s denial of the requested eyewitness identification instructions was not grounded on the exercise of judicial discretion; rather, the record ... is clear that the denial was based on the application of a uniform policy [of the trial judge], a policy which arose from the judge\u2019s personal opinion that identification instructions are not \u2018appropriate.\u2019 \u201d 347 Md. at 351, 701 A.2d 374. \u201c[T]he requested identification instructions should have at least been given careful consideration in the instant cases, and arbitrarily rejecting them as always inappropriate was an abuse of discretion.\u201d 347 Md. at 353-54, 701 A.2d 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The Court in <em>Gunning </em>found \u201clittle merit\u201d in the State\u2019s argument that an identification instruction as sought by the defense \u201cgoes beyond an explanation of the substantive law, and includes particular factors that the jury should consider in evaluating the identification testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347, 701 A.2d 374. <em>But cf. Patterson v. State, supra, </em>356 Md. at 684, 741 A.2d 1119 (because Rule 4-325(c) is inapplicable to factual matters, \u201cregardless of the evidence, a missing evidence instruction generally need not be given; the failure to give such an instruction is neither error nor an abuse of discretion\u201d); <em>Lowry v. State, </em>363 Md. 357, 374, 768 A.2d 688 (2001) (quoting <em>Patterson </em>with approval); <em>Imes v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 176, 193 n. 9, 855 A.2d 381 (\u201cA trial judge is not required to give an instruction with respect to evidentiary inferences.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>384 Md. 158, 862 A.2d 994 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The Court in <em>Gunning </em>explained that an identification instruction such as MPJI-Cr 3:30 may be helpful in some cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACL\">In ruling on a request for an identification instruction, therefore, the trial judge must necessarily exercise discretion in assessing whether the instruction ought to be given and whether the issue of identification is fairly covered by other instructions. In many cases, detailed instructions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>such issues as witness credibility and/or the burden of proof may adequately encompass the subject matter of a requested identification instruction. In other cases, however, because of the centrality of the identification issue and the nature of the eyewitness testimony, a separate identification instruction might be helpful to the jury. Although jurors might know generally that a witness\u2019s perception, especially in times of stress, is not always reliable and that memory is not infallible, an identification instruction assists the jury in its task by pointing out the specific factors that may affect eyewitness identification. A credibility instruction that focuses primarily on honesty and bias may not adequately cover those factors, and thus may not be sufficient in some cases to assist the jury in evaluating whether an eyewitness is mistaken. In any event, the trial judge must examine the unique circumstances of each case before rejecting a requested eyewitness identification instruction. In particular, the trial judge should consider whether there is a real issue of mistaken identity generated by the defense, as well as such factors as whether the identification testimony is questionable because of the circumstances surrounding either the witnesses\u2019 observations or the identification procedures, and whether there is corroborating evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s participation in the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-5\"><em>Gunning, </em>347 Md. at 350, 701 A.2d 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">It is clear, therefore, that an instruction that cautions the jury about pertinent factors that can affect the reliability of eyewitness identifications in general may be appropriate. Indeed, the witness identification instruction given by the trial judge in Janey\u2019s case, based upon MPJI-Cr 3:30, did address the factors highlighted in <em>Gunning.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">One question that was not specifically argued by Janey is whether the omission of any mention of the races of the witness and the defendant from the list of factors that may be considered could lead some jurors to conclude that they may not consider such facts. We note, however, that the pattern instructions do not purport to be exhaustive lists of permissible considerations. Rather, MPJI-Cr 3:30 instructs the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>to consider certain factors \u201cas well as any other factor surrounding the identification.\u201d Similarly, the more general pattern instruction regarding evaluation of witnesses, MPJI-Cr 3:10, instructs the jury: \u201c[Y]ou may apply your own common sense and every day experiences.\u201d Moreover, if counsel are permitted, in some circumstances, to argue to the jury that cross-racial identifications may be less reliable, there is less danger of jurors concluding in such cases that this is an issue that may not be considered in evaluating the credibility of the witness\u2019s identification of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">In <em>Smith v. State, supra, </em>158 Md.App. 673, 857 A.2d 1198, this Court was asked to find reversible error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant the same cross-racial identification instruction that was requested by Janey <em>(i.e., </em>an instruction that would have told the jurors that, in addition to the factors mentioned in MPJI-Cr 3:30, they may also consider that, \u201c[i]n the experience of many, it is more difficult to identify members of a different race than members of one\u2019s own\u201d). In <em>Smith, </em>the African American defendants were convicted on the basis of the testimony of a single eyewitness, who was white. On appeal to this Court, the defendants asserted that the trial court erred, first, by refusing to instruct the jury on the difficulties of cross-racial identification, and, second, by refusing to allow defense counsel to refer in closing argument to that same identification issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">A divided panel of this Court would have affirmed the conviction. There was no division among the judges of this Court, however, with regard to the requested instruction that addressed cross-racial identification: all three judges agreed that it was within the discretion of the trial court to refuse to give Chief Judge Bazelon\u2019s <em>Telfaire </em>instruction. 158 Md.App. at 696, 857 A.2d 1198 (Eyler, James, J.: \u201cUnder the holding of <em>Giunning, </em>that the giving of an eyewitness identification instruction lies within the discretion of the trial court, it necessarily follows that the giving of the instruction at issue in this case lies within the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d); 158 Md.App. at 708, 857 A.2d 1198 (Davis, J.: \u201cAlthough I concur with the majority opinion that the lower court did not err in denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>the request of counsel to argue cross-racial identification to the jury, I write separately to express my profound concern that, in a proper case, counsel should be allowed latitude by the trial judge with respect to argument concerning matters legitimately a part of a judicial proceeding.\u201d); and 158 Md. App. at 711, 857 A.2d 1198 (Adkins, J.: \u201cI agree that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to instruct the jury on the difficulties of cross-racial identification.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">This Court split with regard to whether the trial court erred in refusing to permit defense counsel to address in closing argument the possibility that the identification of the defendants was less reliable because the witness was white and the defendants were African American. For the majority of this Court\u2019s panel, Judge Eyler wrote that the trial judge acted within her discretion in refusing to allow closing argument on cross-racial identification because there was not sufficient evidence in the record to support such an argument. Judge Davis, concurring, wrote separately to emphasize that counsel should be afforded latitude with respect to closing argument in an appropriate case. <em>Smith, </em>158 Md.App. at 708-11, 857 A.2d 1198. Judge Adkins dissented, arguing that the trial judge did abuse her discretion by curtailing closing argument. <em>Smith, </em>158 Md.App. at 711-18, 857 A.2d 1198.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Upon further appellate review, in <em>Smith and Mack, supra, </em>388 Md. at 470, 880 A.2d 288, the Court of Appeals reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the convictions and remanded for a new trial, but specifically declined to address the question of whether the trial court erred by refusing to give a <em>Telfaire </em>instruction on cross-racial identification. The Court of Appeals gave this explanation for not addressing the question that had been raised regarding the trial court's obligation to give a jury instruction on cross-racial identification: \u201cBecause we hold that under the circumstances of this case, the trial judge erred in precluding the defendants from discussing cross-racial identification in their closing arguments and reverse the defendants\u2019 convictions, we do not reach the jury instruction question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478, 880 A.2d 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Although the Court of Appeals expressed no opinion with respect to whether a <em>Telfaire </em>instruction would be required when the <em>Smith </em>case was retried and the defense counsel were expressly permitted to argue that cross-racial identifications are less reliable, we find nothing in the Court of Appeals\u2019s opinion that causes us to reach a conclusion different from the conclusion we reached previously in <em>Smith, </em>158 Md.App. at 696, 857 A.2d 1198, namely, that \u201cthe giving of the instruction at issue in this case lies within the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In <em>Smith and Mack, </em>the Court of Appeals reviewed a variety of literature regarding cross-racial identification and concluded: \u201cOverall, there is strong consensus among researchers conducting both laboratory and field studies on cross-racial identification that some witnesses are more likely to misidentify members of other races than their own.\u201d 388 Md. at 482, 880 A.2d 288. At the same time, however, the Court acknowledged continuing uncertainty regarding the topic, stating: \u201cAt this juncture the extent to which own-race bias affects eyewitness identification is unclear based on the available studies addressing this issue, so that we cannot state with certainty that difficulty in cross-racial identification is an established matter of common knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 880 A.2d 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Notwithstanding that lack of certainty, however, the Court of Appeals concluded that, under the circumstances of that case, the defendants had the right to comment on cross-racial identification in closing argument. The Court pointed out that \u201ca criminal defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel guarantees, in part, an opportunity for counsel to present closing argument at the close of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 880 A.2d 288 (quoting <em>Holmes v. State, </em>333 Md. 652, 658-59, 637 A.2d 113 (1994)). The Court noted that trial advocates \u201care given wide latitude' in the conduct of closing argument, including the right to explain or to attack all the evidence in the case.\u201d 388 Md. at 488, 880 A.2d 288 (quoting <em>Trimble v. State, </em>300 Md. 387, 405, 478 A.2d 1143 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1230, 105 S.Ct. 1231, 84 L.Ed.2d 368 (1985)). Quoting from <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 412-13 and 438, 326 A.2d 707 (1974), the Court noted that in closing argument, counsel \u201c \u2018may indulge in oratorical conceit or flourish and in illustrations and metaphorical allusions.\u2019 ... We also have held that in closing argument \u2018|j]urors may be reminded of what everyone else knows, and they may act upon and take notice of those facts which are of such general notoriety as to be matters of common knowledge.\u2019 \u201d 388 Md. at 487, 488, 880 A.2d 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">After reviewing the broad scope of permissible closing arguments, and noting that \u201cthe victim\u2019s eyewitness cross-racial identification of the defendants ... was the sole piece of significant evidence\u201d against Smith and Mack, <em>id. </em>at 488, 880 A.2d 288, and further noting that \u201cthe victim\u2019s identification of the defendants was anchored in her enhanced ability to identify faces,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 488-89, 880 A.2d 288, the Court of Appeals concluded that, \u201c[u]nder these circumstances, defense counsel should have been allowed to argue the difficulties of cross-racial identification in closing argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 880 A.2d 288. The trial court\u2019s failure to permit such closing argument was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">We conclude that the holding of the Court of Appeals in <em>Smith and Mack, </em>which focused upon a defendant\u2019s right to counsel and the right to make closing arguments, did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>impose any new duty upon trial judges to give jury instructions addressing cross-racial identification. The underpinning of the Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Smith and Mack </em>was that it is reversible error for a trial court to prevent a defendant from attacking the prosecution\u2019s evidence during closing argument. That holding does not support the conclusion that a trial court commits reversible error if it declines to give the jury an instruction on cross-racial identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">In this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Smith, </em>Judge Eyler highlighted some of the difficult questions that begin to surface when the courts consider imposing a rule requiring instructions regarding factors to consider in witness identification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">Should an eyewitness identification instruction always include a laundry list of specific factors based on the perceived common knowledge of men and women? When does such an instruction constitute an improper comment on the evidence by the court? More to the point here, if race is to be identified as a factor, should the same be true for ethnicity and other analogous factors? What is the rule for multi-racial persons? How does one determine race? Is race self-proclaimed? What is the rule for persons who marry persons of another race?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-6\"><em>Smith, supra, </em>158 Md.App. at 702, 857 A.2d 1198. Such questions call to mind the comment made by Judge Leventhal in his concurring opinion in <em>Telfaire, supra, </em>469 F.2d at 562: \u201cThe more I ponder the problems, the better I understand the kernel of wisdom in the decisions that shy away from instructions on inter-racial identifications as divisive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">As the dissent in <em>Smith and Mack </em>pointed out, 388 Md. at 495, 880 A.2d 288, there is a concern among some that jury instructions regarding the difference in race between the witness and defendant could spawn much mischief. The dissent noted that the Supreme Court of New Jersey has expressed reservations about the potential for appeals to racism, even though New Jersey has adopted a position requiring instructions on cross-racial identification. The dissent in <em>Smith and Mack, </em>388 Md. at 494-95, 880 A.2d 288, quoted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>following comment from <em>State v. Cromedy, </em>158 N.J. 112, 132, 727 A.2d 457, 467 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">At the same time, we recognize that unrestricted use of cross-racial identification instructions could be counter-productive. Consequently, care must be taken to insulate criminal trials from base appeals to racial prejudice. An appropriate jury instruction should carefully delineate the context in which the jury is permitted to consider racial differences. The simple fact pattern of a white victim of a violent crime at the hands of a black assailant would not automatically give rise to the need for a cross-racial identification charge. More is required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In <em>Cromedy, </em>727 A.2d at 467, the New Jersey Supreme Court emphasized that an instruction on cross-racial identification \u201cshould be given only when ... [1] identification is a critical issue in the case, and [2] an eyewitness\u2019s cross-racial identification is not corroborated by other evidence giving it independent reliability.\u201d Consequently, even if Janey had been tried in New Jersey, where the <em>Cromedy </em>standard requires that an instruction on cross-racial identification be given under certain circumstances, it would not have been reversible error for the trial judge to refuse to grant the instruction in Janey\u2019s case because (1) Akhtar\u2019s identification of Janey was not a critical issue in the case, and (2) in any event, Akhtar\u2019s identification was corroborated by Janey\u2019s childhood friend, Jones, who placed Janey at Akhtar\u2019s filling station.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Moreover, Akhtar candidly admitted that he was not good at identifying African Americans. This admission on Akhtar\u2019s part not only supported a closing argument commenting on the unreliability of his identification testimony, it also reduced the need for the jury to question whether Akhtar <em>might </em>be among the group of persons who have more difficulty with cross-racial identification; Akhtar admitted that he in fact has such difficulty. Under such circumstances, the requested <em>Telfaire </em>instruction \u2014 advising jurors that \u201c[i]n the experience of many, it is more difficult to identify the members of a different race than members of one\u2019s own\u201d \u2014 would have mere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ly confirmed that Akhtar\u2019s self-professed difficulty in recognizing African American faces was consistent with \u201cthe experience of many.\u201d Given the facts of this case, the requested instruction could have had no significant influence on the outcome of deliberations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Conversely, the mere fact that a witness denies any difficulty in making cross-racial identifications should not deter the trial judge from considering giving such an instruction, particularly if, in the language of the <em>Cromedy </em>court, \u201cidentification is a critical issue in the case, and [the] eyewitness\u2019s cross-racial identification is not corroborated by other evidence giving it independent reliability.\u201d 727 A.2d at 467. Even in the face of a witness\u2019s strenuous denial of personal difficulty in making cross-racial identifications, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>studies cited by the Court of Appeals in <em>Smith and Mack, </em>388 Md. at 478-86, 880 A.2d 288, indicate that there is a \u201cstrong consensus among researchers ... that some witnesses are more likely to misidentify members of other races than their own,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 482, 880 A.2d 288, the trial judge must, upon request, consider whether an instruction is appropriate in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Accordingly, our holding in this case \u2014 that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to give the requested instruction on cross-racial identification \u2014 should not be interpreted as holding that it is never appropriate to give such an instruction. Nor should the fact that no instruction on cross-racial identification appears yet in the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions serve as the basis for an arbitrary refusal to consider granting such an instruction. As the introduction to the current version of the pattern instructions states, MPJI-Cr. at xv: \u201cWe hope that this text will relieve judges and lawyers of the burden of drafting basic instructions. However, there is still the need to draft instructions, or modify instructions to accommodate the circumstances of a particular case.\u201d <em>Accord, Boone v. American Manufacturers, </em>150 Md.App. 201, 232, 819 A.2d 1099 (\u201c \u2018When the evidence generates an issue that is not covered by a pattern instruction, we must count on the court to incorporate relevant and valid legal principles gleaned from the case law.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Green v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 547, 562, 705 A.2d 133 (1998))), cert. denied, 376 Md. 50, 827 A.2d 112 (2003). Just as the trial judge in <em>Gunning </em>abused his discretion by adopting a predetermined position of never giving the requested instruction, 347 Md. at 351-354, 701 A.2d 374, it would be an abuse of discretion for a trial judge to apply a uniform policy of rejecting all requested instructions that are not covered by some pattern instruction. \u201c[A] court errs when it attempts to resolve discretionary matters by the application of a uniform rule, without regard to the particulars of the individual case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352, 701 A.2d 374.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Nevertheless, we acknowledge the tremendous assistance the pattern instructions provide to both the bench and bar, and we repeat what we said in <em>Smith, </em>supra, 158 Md.App. at 703-04, 857 A.2d 1198: \u201cAssuming that, in a given case, it may be appropriate for a trial court to mention specific factors [the jury should consider in its evaluation of eyewitness testimony], including cross-racial identification, it would be helpful if the Court of Appeals provided guidance as to when and under what circumstances.

Cross racial identification is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>merely a subset of a much broader problem borne out by recent revelations of defendants wrongly convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">I expressed my concern, in <em>Smith, </em>that there was a substantial body of empirical study suggesting that cross racial identification, particular by whites of blacks, is more difficult than identification of a person within one\u2019s own race. Further, expressing the view that cross racial identification is but a subset of a more universal problem, <em>ie., </em>the unreliability of eyewitness identification, generally, I observed that the problem was exacerbated by the stress of the critical moment to observe, particularly when that moment is short. When the witness is called upon to distinguish features unfamiliar to him or her, the identification, I said, is made more difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The thorough and luminous research<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provided by Judge Battaglia, in <em>Smith, </em>388 Md. 468, 880 A.2d 288 (2005), rein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>forces my view that eyewitness identification, generally, has been elevated to an unwarranted degree of certitude in determining criminal agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">1 agree with the majority that the Court of Appeals, because it decided the appeal on the issue of closing argument in <em>Smith, </em>388 Md. at 475, 880 A.2d 288, obviates the necessity to address the propriety of giving jury instructions. I depart, however, with the majority in its view that the \u201ccandid\u201d admission of Zaheer Akhtar that he \u201cwas not good at identifying African-Americans\u201d tended to make less important the imprimatur of judicial condonation.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Notwithstanding that the Court declined to address the issue of instructions on cross-racial identification, one of the principal bases upon which the court decided there was the right to present the issue in closing argument is instructive: \u201cThe case <em>sub judice </em>involves the victim\u2019s eyewitness cross-racial identification of the defendants, <em>which was the sole piece of significant evidence.\u201d Id. </em>at 488, 880 A.2d 288. I concur with the majority in this case, primarily because the conviction was not based solely on the eyewitness identification. But, until such time as the Court of Appeals speaks to the issue, in the rare case where there is a confluence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>difficulty in identifying persons of another race and where the eyewitness identification is the only evidence of criminal agency, I believe an instruction, as well as leave to present closing argument on the issue, is appropriate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\">. We note that during closing argument in Janey\u2019s case, defense counsel emphasized the unreliability of Mr. Akhtar's identification. Without mentioning race, counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-8\">Zaheer Akhtar is not a positive identification. You can tell that from his testimony. He starts out with about four or five different statements according to him and according to Detective Whitacker. The first is it\u2019s number four. Then he equivocates, well, I think it\u2019s number four. And then when he is asked it could be number four, and then the best part is at the end of the whole process he said [\"]did I pick the right personf?\u201d] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-9\">... He is not positive. He is not sure. It's a reason to doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayi\">Janey did not contend that he should have been granted greater leeway to expressly argue that Mr. Akhtar's difficulty in identifying Janey was attributable to the fact that it was a cross-racial identification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b687-6\">. Appellant contends that Akhtar's identification of Janey was critical corroboration of the accomplice testimony of Eugene Jones, without which Jones's incriminating testimony would be insufficient to prove that appellant killed Ebony Janey. <em>See In re Anthony W., </em>388 Md. 251, 263-64, 879 A.2d 717 (2005). This argument misses the mark, however, because there was no evidence that Jones was an accomplice to the murder itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Even if Eugene Jones could have potentially been considered an accomplice to Janey's alleged obstruction of justice, such that Jones\u2019s testimony supporting that charge required corroboration, Jones was not an accomplice to the murder, but rather was an accessory after the fact. Appellant went to Jones to request help in preparing the grave and moving the body after the murder. The Court of Appeals has explained that \" '[t]o be an accomplice a person must participate in the commission of the crime ... with common criminal intent with the principal offender, or must in some way advocate or encourage the commission of the crime.' \" <em>In re Anthony W., supra, </em>388 Md. at 276, 879 A.2d 717 (quoting <em>Watson v. State, </em>208 Md. 210, 219, 117 A.2d 549 (1955)). <em>Cf. Rivenbark </em>v. <em>State, </em>58 Md.App. 626, 636 n. 3, 473 A.2d 1329 (accessory after fact does not qualify as accomplice), <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 795, 481 A.2d 240 (1984). Moreover, Akhtar's testimony corroborated more than Janey\u2019s <em>identification. </em>Even if Akhtar had been totally unable to say it was Janey who appeared at his filling station on the evening of April 1, 2003, Akhtar would nevertheless have been able to testify about two men stopping there that evening and asking for a tool to remove a toolbox. Such testimony would have corroborated Jones\u2019s testimony about stopping at the station to remove the toolbox, Janey\u2019s effort to borrow a tool from the station owner, and the fact that Janey had scratches on his face on that occasion, even if Akhtar could not have picked Janey\u2019s photo out in a photographic lineup.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b688-5\">. The Court of Appeals emphasized in <em>Gunning, supra, </em>347 Md. at 351, 701 A.2d 374, that the failure to exercise discretion can constitute an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>abuse of discretion. The Court stated: \"It is well settled that a trial judge who encounters a matter that falls within the realm of judicial discretion <em>must </em>exercise his or her discretion in ruling on the matter. .. .That exercise of discretion must be clear from the record.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) Although the trial judge in Janey\u2019s case ultimately refused to give \"the non-pattern instructions,\u201d he did not reject out of hand the request for such instructions, but rather listened to argument of counsel and considered the requests overnight before ruling that the court was not going to give the requested instructions. Consequently, in contrast to <em>Gunning, supra, </em>347 Md. at 351, 701 A.2d 374, it appears that the denial in this case was based upon the exercise of judicial discretion rather than the rote application of a predetermined uniform policy of never giving non-pattern instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\">. Only three published field studies have investigated the cross-race effect. <em>See </em>Spo'rer, <em>supra, 7 </em>Psychol. Pub. Pol\u2019y &amp; Law at 176. In one field study, black and white subjects posing as customers visited a series of convenience stores browsing for a few minutes and then went to the register to pay. <em>See </em>John C. Brigham <em>et al., Accuracy of Eyewitness Identifications in a Field Setting, </em>42 J. Personality &amp; Soc. Psychology 673, 681 (1982). Researchers would then ask the convenience store clerks, some black and others white, to identify the \"customers\u201d from a photo array. <em>Id. </em>The study found some evidence of the cross-race effect in white clerks identifying black customers. <em>Id. </em>According to the study, the overall accuracy rate for all participants was only 34.2%, with black participants being more accurate 69.2% than whites 39.9%. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, white clerks misidentified white customers 34.9% of the time and misidentified black customers 54.8% of the time. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">A second field study conducted in 1988 was modeled after the Brigham study and included Hispanic participants in addition to black and white clerks and customers. <em>See </em>Stephanie J.

Pub. Pol'y &amp; Law 119 (2001). The researchers found a cross-race effect in both black and white participants; however, other researchers have noted that the study's findings are difficult to compare to previous studies because of the procedures used to compile the data. <em>See </em>Sporer, <em>supra, </em>7 Psychol. Pub. Pol\u2019y &amp; Law at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Overall, there is strong consensus among researchers conducting both laboratory and field studies on cross-racial identification that some witnesses are more likely to misidentify members of other races than their own. <em>See </em>Wells &amp; Olson, <em>supra, </em>7 Psychol. Pub. Pol\u2019y &amp; Law at 230 (stating that \"it is reasonable to conclude that there is internal validity to the studies showing the other-race effect\u201d). Although many scientists and researchers conducting these studies agree that some witnesses exhibit own-race bias, they disagree on the extent to which such bias affects eyewitness identification due to the variations in the statistical data showing a cross-race effect. <em>See </em>Sporer, <em>supra, </em>7 Psy-chol. Pub. Pol'y &amp; Law at 177; Deborah Bartolomey, <em>Cross-Racial Identification Testimony and What Not To Do About It, 1 </em>Psychol. Pub. Pol'y &amp; Law 247, 249 (March 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\"><em>Smith, </em>388 Md. al 481-83, 880 A.2d 288.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
