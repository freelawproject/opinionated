Is the jury\u2019s finding that Syphax\u2019s negligence caused Patras\u2019s injuries inconsistent with its zero dollar damage award?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">II.

Did the trial court err in permitting the jury to consider allegedly prejudicial evidence and argument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">IV. Did the trial court err in denying Patras\u2019s motion for a new trial on damages?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">I. <em>FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">On March 20, 2000, motorists Patras and Syphax were involved in a rush-hour, rear-end accident near the intersection of Seminary Road on Georgia Avenue in Silver Spring. According to the defendant, Paul Syphax, the impact was a mere \u201ctap\u201d that caused no damage to either vehicle. Mr. Patras, on the other hand, described the impact as \u201cforceful\u201d and said that the impact caused him to be rendered momentarily unconscious and also caused \u201ca bend\u201d in the back of the trunk of the rental vehicle he was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">Patras was examined, treated, and released from a hospital emergency room within hours of the accident. He later completed a course of physical therapy for a strained neck and back.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Patras sued Syphax on a single count of negligence. At trial, Syphax admitted that he was following Patras too closely in rainy conditions. The defense focused primarily<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on Pa-tras\u2019s injury claims, offering evidence to show that he exaggerated his pain and injuries from the accident, possibly to obtain compensation for non-existent injuries or pre-existing conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Bernard Stopak, M.D., Patras\u2019s treating physician, recounted the course of evaluation and treatment he prescribed. A list of medical expenses totaling $11,832.60, itemized by provider and showing \u201cdates of service,\u201d was introduced into evidence after Stopak testified that each of these was a reasonable and necessary medical expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">In a <em>de bene esse </em>video deposition, Clifford Hinkes, M.D., testified as an expert on behalf of Syphax. After examining Patras, Dr. Hinkes agreed that he had some physical injuries from the collision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">[Defense Counsel:] Do you have an opinion, within [a] ... degree of medical probability, as to whether Mr. Patras did, in fact, sustain some injuries in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">[Dr. Hinkes:] Well, I do have an opinion. He did sustain an injury. There had been a car accident, and a good description. And Mr. Patras has a muscular strain of his neck, and probably his lower back also. He had some aches and pains from the accident. I don\u2019t dispute that. I think he had a temporary injury. I think he had ... pain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Dr. Hinkes also testified that Patras incurred reasonable medical expenses in the course of treatment for these injuries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">[Dr. Hinkes:] Some of the treatment was necessary, and some was not. To be exact, one visit to the emergency room at Holy Cross was necessary, due to the accident.... Treatment with Dr. Shaw was necessary April, May, June, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>and July of 2000____The two MRI scans were necessary. The one opinion from Dr. Stopak was necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">Physical therapy .... should have been limited to visits twice a week for four weeks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In support of the \u201cexaggeration\u201d defense, counsel presented medical records showing that Patras, age 69 at time of the accident, suffered from degenerative arthritis before the accident. Notwithstanding Dr. Hinkes\u2019s expert opinion regarding causation and injury, the defense also challenged whether the conditions for which Patras was evaluated and treated were caused by the collision with Syphax.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Defense counsel cross-examined Patras about (a) hospital records showing that, after he was evaluated following the accident, Patras refused to leave, which caused security personnel to escort him out of the emergency room; and (b) other personal injury claims that Patras made as a result of unrelated incidents. In addition to evidence that Patras had previously been treated for arthritis, the defense offered medical records showing that Patras was seen in a hospital emergency room in 1995 with reports of the same symptoms that he told Drs. Stopak and Hinkes that he experienced for the first time after the subject accident. Defense counsel argued that this evidence shows that Patras \u201clied\u201d to Drs. Stopak and Hinkes, and that both physicians premised their causation opinions on Patras\u2019s false reports that he had no prior injuries or complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">The trial judge\u2019s jury instructions included the following passages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\">You need not believe any witness even though the testimony is uncontradicted. <em>You may believe all, part, or none of the testimony of any witness.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-11\">An expert is a witness who has special training or experience in a given field. You should give expert testimony the weight and value you believe it should have. <em>You are not required to accept any expert\u2019s opinion. </em>You should consider an expert\u2019s opinion together with all the other evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The party who asserts a claim has the burden of proving it by what we call the preponderance of the evidence. To prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, means to prove that something is more likely so, than not so. In other words, a preponderance of the evidence means such evidence which, when considered and compared with the evidence opposed to it, has more convincing force and produces, in your minds, a belief, that it is more likely true than not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">In determining whether a party has met the burden of proof you should consider the quality of all of the evidence, regardless of who called the witness, or introduced the exhibit, and regardless of the number of witnesses which one party or the other may have produced. <em>If you believe that the evidence is evenly balanced on an issue, then your finding on that issue must be against the party who has the burden of proving it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">For the plaintiff to recover, the defendant\u2019s negligence must be a cause of the plaintiffs injury. In the event you find for the plaintiff on the issue of liability, then you must go on to consider the question of damages. It will be your duty to determine what, if any, award will fairly compensate the plaintiff for the losses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\"><em>The burden is on the plaintiff to prove, by the preponderance of the evidence, each item of damage claimed to be caused by the defendant. </em>In considering the items of damage you must keep in mind that your award must adequately and fairly compensate the plaintiff, but an award should not be based on guess work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Counsel for Patras made no objection to any of the above instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">The questions on the verdict sheet that was submitted to the jury and the answers by the jury to the questions were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">1. Do you find that Plaintiff Dan Patras has established by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant, Paul <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Syphax, was negligent in operating his motor vehicle and that this negligence was a proximate cause of the automobile accident on March 20, 2000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">Yes / No_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">2. Was the Defendant\u2019s negligence a proximate cause of the injuries sustained by the Plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">Yes y No_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">If you answered \u201cYes\u201d to Question No. 2, then go on to answer Question No. 3. If you answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question No. 2, then your job is done and you may not award any damages in this case. You should proceed no further except to sign this form and return it to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">3. What amount, if any, do you award as damages to the Plaintiff:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">a) Medical expenses <em>$0.00</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">b) Non-economic damages <em>$0.00</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">Other than asking that the jury be polled, Patras\u2019s counsel did not ask the court to take any action at trial after the answers to the questions on the verdict sheet were announced. Within ten days of the date a judgment in favor of Syphax was entered, Patras moved for a new trial as to damages, only. He argued: (1) the jury\u2019s answer to Question 3 on the verdict sheet constituted \u201ca miscarriage of justice ... [and amounted to]' jury nullification and an illegal verdict\u201d in light of the fact that \u201cthe jury found that the [defendant's negligence was the proximate cause of the accident and further found that the [defendant's negligence was the proximate cause of injury to [p]laintiff\u2019; (2) \u201cthe jury\u2019s verdict of zero damages was legally inadequate given the jury\u2019s findings that the [defendant was negligent in causing the accident and that the [defendant\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of injury to [pjlaintiff\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe verdict of zero damages was against the weight of the evidence.\u201d Following the trial court\u2019s denial of his new trial motion, Patras noted this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">A. <em>Inconsistent Verdicts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Whereas inconsistent verdicts in criminal trials \u201cmay be permitted to stand,\u201d the Court of Appeals has held that <em>\u201cirreconcilably inconsistent jury verdicts </em>\u201d in a civil case \u201ccannot stand.\u201d <em>Southern Mgmt. Corp. v. Taha, </em>378 Md. 461, 487-88, 836 A.2d 627 (2003). \u201c \u2018Where the answer to one of the questions in a special verdict form would require a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and an answer to another would require a verdict in favor of the defendant, the verdict is irreconcilably defective.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 836 A.2d 627 (citation omitted). The question we must resolve is this: Based on the jury instructions, did the answer to Question 2 on the special verdict form require that some damages be awarded when Question No. 3 was answered?</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Patras argues that the jury\u2019s zero-damage awards for both medical expenses and non-economic damages (answer to special Interrogatory No. 3) are irreconcilably inconsistent with its findings that Syphax\u2019s negligence caused both the accident (answer to special Interrogatory No. 1) and Patras\u2019s injuries (answer to special Interrogatory No. 2). Patras contends that, because the jury found by special interrogatory that Syphax\u2019s negligence caused Patras\u2019s injuries, some award of damages was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Syphax responds that \u201ccase law supports the jury\u2019s ability to award zero damages to the [pjlaintiff even if negligence is found.\u201d He cites, <em>inter alia, Mason v. Lynch, </em>151 Md.App. 17, 822 A.2d 1281 (2003), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>388 Md. 37, 878 A.2d 588 (2005), in which we recently affirmed a zero-damage award, even though the jury found that the defendant was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">We disagree with Patras\u2019s assertion that the jury\u2019s zero-damage award cannot be reconciled with its causation findings. Based on the unobjected-to instruction that the burden was on Patras to prove by a preponderance of evidence \u201ceach item of damage claimed to be caused by a defendant,\u201d the jury could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>have found that as a result of the accident Patras had suffered some injury, but he nevertheless had failed to meet his burden of proof in showing the amount that would compensate him for his injury as to any particular item of damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Syphax, the jury could have concluded that (1) the negligence of Syphax caused an almost negligible impact with Patras\u2019s vehicle; (2) that Patras gave false information to Drs. Stopak and Hinkes in an effort to increase the value of his claim against Syphax; (3) that Patras\u2019s testimony concerning his post-accident physical complaints was intentionally false; and (4) that the expert\u2019s opinions as to the necessity and reasonableness of medical treatment was based on a false history provided by Patras and was therefore unreliable. If the jury reached those conclusions, it could have, in conformity with the court\u2019s instructions, believed that Patras had no legitimate medical expenses resulting from the accident but nevertheless experienced some minor pain as a result of the \u201cslight tap\u201d of his vehicle. A reasonable juror could conclude that no monetary award was justified because Patras was so untrustworthy as a medical historian that he had failed to meet his burden of proving the amount of money that would compensate him for his pain. Accordingly, having been told by the judge that a damage award should not be based on guesswork or speculation, a reasonable juror could also conclude that zero damages were warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Appellant stresses that the standard definition of negligence \u201crequires \u2018actual injury or loss.\u2019 \u201d <em>Supik v. Bodie, Nagle, Dolina, Smith &amp; Hobbs, P.A., </em>152 Md.App. 698, 719, 834 A.2d 170 (2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 Md. 225, 841 A.2d 340 (2004) (citing <em>Edmonds v. Cytology Serv. of Maryland, Inc., </em>111 Md.App. 233, 681 A.2d 546 (1996)), <em>aff'd sub. nom., Rivera v. Edmonds, </em>347 Md. 208, 218, 699 A.2d 1194 (1997), and therefore \u201cnominal damages or technical liability do not exist\u201d (citing <em>Peroti v. Williams, </em>258 Md. 663, 671, 267 A.2d 114 (1970)). We have no quarrel with the precepts discussed in the cases cited. Those cases contain learned academic discus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>sions concerning tort principles. Here, however, the issue cannot be resolved by applying academic definition to words used in the verdict sheet. Jurors are presumed to have understood and to have followed the court\u2019s instructions. <em>State v. Gray, </em>344 Md. 417, 425 n. 6, 687 A.2d 660 (1997); <em>Matthews v. State, </em>106 Md.App. 725, 743, 666 A.2d 912 (1995). Nothing in the record rebuts that presumption in the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">The jury was told:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">Negligence is something that a person using reasonable care would not do. Or not doing something that a person using reasonable care would do. Reasonable care means that caution, attention, or skill a reasonable person would use under similar circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Neither that instruction nor any other required the jury to award monetary damages in the event that it found that plaintiff, although injured by the defendant\u2019s action, had failed to meet his burden of proving (by a preponderance of evidence) the amount of damages that would fairly compensate him for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">B. <em>The Zero Damage Award Is Not Inconsistent With Uncontroverted Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Patras argues that the zero-damage award is also inconsistent with uncontroverted evidentiary facts establishing causation. The Court of Appeals has explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">\u201cfor evidentiary facts and inferences to be uncontroverted or undisputed, there must be either actual or constructive acquiescence in their truth on the part of all affected parties.\u201d While a jury must accept uncontroverted evidence as a matter of law, the jury may disbelieve uncontradicted evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-10\"><em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Miller, </em>315 Md. 182, 186, 553 A.2d 1268 (1989) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">Patras relies on the testimony of Drs. Stopak and Hinkes that he suffered pain and some reasonable medical expenses as a result of the accident. According to Patras, Syphax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u201cactually acquiesced to the fact of Mr. Patras\u2019s injuries\u201d by presenting Dr. Hinkes\u2019s testimony, which made \u201cthe fact of such injuries\u201d \u201cuncontroverted.\u201d He asserts that he is entitled to compensatory damages as a matter of law; therefore, the appropriate remedy is a new trial on damages alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Syphax disputes that he acquiesced as alleged. We agree with Syphax that the jury was obligated to consider Dr. Hinkes\u2019s opinion that Patras was injured in the accident, but it was not obligated to believe that opinion. As the record shows, the jury had enough reason to question whether Patras sustained the injuries testified to by Dr. Hinkes; thus, the issue of whether any injury was sustained was controverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Syphax offered Dr. Hinkes\u2019s testimony primarily to establish that Patras exaggerated his physical ailments in an effort to enhance his damage claim. But, after Dr. Hinkes offered his expert opinion that Patras was injured in the accident, defense counsel introduced medical records to undermine that opinion. Specifically, counsel offered evidence to show that both doctors\u2019 causation opinions were premised on the factually incorrect assumption that Patras, prior to the accident, had no injuries or symptoms similar to those he said he experienced immediately after the accident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In doing so, Syphax controverted the issue of whether Patras\u2019s ailments were caused by the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">There being no \u201cuncontroverted evidentiary fact,\u201d the zero-damage award cannot be inconsistent with an uncontroverted fact, as Patras contends. This conclusion follows our decision in <em>Mason v. Lynch, </em>151 Md.App. at 17, 822 A.2d 1281. In <em>Mason, </em>we also declined to hold that a zero-damage award was inconsistent with expert testimony from a defense physician that the plaintiff \u201csustained some injury and that some treatment was reasonable,\u201d because \u201cthe jurors were free to accept or reject all or any part of any witness\u2019s testimony or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the reports of experts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 822 A.2d 1281. In <em>Mason, </em>extrinsic evidence controverted the defense expert\u2019s causation testimony, including evidence that the plaintiff \u201cdid not claim any injuries at the scene,\u201d that she \u201cwent to see a lawyer before going to a doctor,\u201d and that she \u201chad been involved in an accident in 1995, in which she struck her head on the window of her vehicle.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\"><em>Edsall v. Huffaker, </em>159 Md.App. 337, 859 A.2d 274 (2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>387 Md. 122, 874 A.2d 917 (2005), also supports our holding. In <em>Edsall, </em>we affirmed a zero-damage award arising from an auto accident, even though the defendant failed to present evidence to contradict causation testimony by the plaintiffs expert. We held that this defense strategy \u201cdid not make the evidence that the accident caused [plaintiffs] injury to his right knee uncontroverted,\u201d because the defense was entitled to challenge the causation testimony by the plaintiffs expert on the ground that it was equivocal. <em>See id. </em>at 343-44, 859 A.2d 274 (plaintiffs orthopedic expert admitted that knee injury allegedly resulting from car accident might have been caused by plaintiffs athletic activities, or by repetitive use of knee, which was affected by tendinitis).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">III. <em>ALLEGED EVIDENTIARY ERRORS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Patras claims that reversible error was committed at several points in the trial, <em>viz: </em>(1) during opening statement defense counsel said that \u201c[i]t\u2019s going to be a roller coaster ride when\u201d Patras testifies and that Mr. Patras had come to court for a \u201ccup of justice\u201d but, after the jury considered the evidence, \u201cthat cup should be empty\u201d; (2) that during cross-examination of Patras, defense counsel tried to \u201ctake advantage\u201d of the witness\u2019s misunderstanding of a series of questions; (3) that at several points in his cross-examination of Patras, defense counsel tried to make \u201cthe elderly witness extremely uncomfortable.\u201d None of these \u201cerrors\u201d are preserved for appellate review because Patras\u2019s counsel never objected to the words or conduct of defense counsel, nor was a request for mistrial made. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a) (except for issues involving subject matter jurisdiction, an appellate court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ordinarily will not decide any issue neither raised nor decided below).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Patras also claims that the trial judge erred by allowing defense counsel to ask him the following question: \u201cMr. Patras, so if the records reflect that security was called to escort you [out of the hospital\u2019s emergency room] because they were done with you, those records are incorrect?\u201d Appellant now asserts that the objection to that question should have been sustained because the question was both \u201cirrelevant and prejudicial.\u201d But at trial, Patras\u2019s counsel objected to the question on the sole grounds that there \u201cwas no foundation\u201d for the question, nor \u201ctestimony to this effect.\u201d The issue of whether the question was either irrelevant or prejudicial has not been preserved for review. <em>See Anderson v. Litzenberg, </em>115 Md.App. 549, 569, 694 A.2d 150 (1997) (when counsel volunteers a specific ground for objection at trial, only that ground will be reviewed on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Lastly, Patras claims that the trial judge erred in allowing defense counsel to inquire as to whether he made a claim concerning a bus accident that occurred forty-six days after the subject accident. Before asking the question at issue, defense counsel and Patras engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">Q You complained of some dizziness and problems with your head after this accident [with Syphax], isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">Q All right. But isn\u2019t it [a] fact that on May 5th, 2000, you went to the emergency room at Suburban Hospital complaining that you hit the left side of your head on a pole in a bus when the bus slammed on its brakes, and that you lost consciousness and you complained of headache and blurred vision and dizziness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">A I did hit my [ear], again, with the reckless driving of the bus that I was riding on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">Defense counsel then asked Patras, \u201cDid you file a claim against the bus company?\u201d Patras\u2019s counsel\u2019s objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>to that question was overruled. That question was not answered, however, because counsel for defendant rephrased the question and asked: \u201cDid you file a claim against the bus company for reckless driving?\u201d No objection was made to that question, and Patras answered: \u201cI did because (inaudible) compensation from the medical bills, and they refuse to do it.\u201d Appellant contends that allowing defense counsel to ask the second question was improper because the question constituted \u201ca form of inquiry into a prior bad act.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reject that contention because, under anyone\u2019s definition, filing an accident claim against a third party is not a \u201cbad act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">In any event, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in overruling appellant\u2019s objection to the first question. Because the bus accident was close in time to the one at issue and because the bus accident evidently resulted in the same type of injuries as those for which Patras sought recompense in the subject suit, the defense had a right to know whether the subsequent injuries were serious enough to cause a claim to be filed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Patras\u2019s counsel filed a motion for new trial within ten days of the entry of the judgment in favor of Syphax. Patras claims that the trial judge erred in denying that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Appellant\u2019s brief sets forth four grounds as to why the new trial motion should have been granted. None of those grounds were mentioned in Patras\u2019s motion for new trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the grounds upon which Patras now claims a new trial should have been granted are not preserved for review. <em>See </em>Md.

Syphax\u2019s counsel also contended, based on evidence introduced at trial, that the accident was not Syphax's fault because Patras stopped suddenly on a wet road when another motorist made a \"U\u201d turn in front of him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\">. Defense counsel was entitled to impeach Hinkes\u2019s causation testimony because a party does not vouch for the credibility of its witness. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-607; <em>Walker v.

Patras claims that the \"trial judge erred in not admonishing the jury to disregard the prejudicial inquiry\u201d about the bus-accident case.

No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.
