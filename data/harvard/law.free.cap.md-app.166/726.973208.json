Thereafter, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held an evidentiary \u201cfair hearing\u201d to review the matter. Instead of resolving the case on the merits, however, the ALJ remanded the matter to the SRT for reconsideration in light of the additional medical evidence presented at the fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">Unhappy with that disposition, appellant took an appeal to the Board of Review (the \u201cBoard\u201d) of the Department of Mental Health and Hygiene (the \u201cDepartment\u201d), which affirmed the ALJ. Mr. S. then sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. On December 6, 2004, that court dismissed the appeal as moot because, in the interim, appellant had reapplied for Medical Assistance benefits and was found eligible as of October 1, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">On appeal, Mr. S. poses one question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Was it error for the Administrative Law Judge to fail to make a Medical Assistance eligibility determination, based upon the testimony and evidence submitted at the hearing, and instead remand the case to the local agency?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Appellee concedes that the ALJ erred. However, BCDSS has moved to dismiss this appeal on the grounds of mootness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall deny the motion to dismiss and reverse the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">REGULATORY FRAMEWORK</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">To understand the issue presented in this case, it is helpful to begin with a brief review of the Medical Assistance program.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Medicaid, also known as Medical Assistance,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is jointly funded by the federal and state governments, and provides medical services to low income persons who cannot afford to pay for their own medical care. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396; Md.Code (2005 RepLVol.), \u00a7 15-103(a)(2) of the Health-General Article (\u201cH.G.\u201d).

Gaylord Fuel Corp., </em>276 Md. 367, 374, 347 A.2d 826 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Mr. S. was born in 1956. He suffers from a variety of health problems, including an injury to his right ankle, a burn to his left hand, hypertension, diabetes, arthritis, and depression. Mr. S. is also unable to use his left hand due to a condition called \u201ccontracture,\u201d which renders his hand immobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">In January 2001, appellant left his employment because of the burn to his hand. In November 2001, Mr. S. broke his ankle and again left the workforce. Lacking health insurance or any income stream, Mr. S. was unable to obtain physical therapy for his ankle and hand, nor could he pay for medical care needed for his diabetes and hypertension.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">On October 1, 2002, Mr. S. applied for Medicaid under the Aged, Disabled and Blind category as a household of one. To complete his application, Mr. S. submitted to BCDSS a Medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>cal Report Form 402B and a Medical Assistance Program Vocational, Educational and Social Data Form 4204. Form 402B was completed on February 20, 2003, by Dr. Deepak Seth, Mr. S.\u2019s treating physician since August 2001. Dr. Seth diagnosed Mr. S. with \u201chypertension,\u201d \u201ccontracture flexion of [the] hand,\u201d and \u201cperipheral neuropathy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The Form 402B indicated that Mr. S. was taking blood pressure medication that caused \u201cweakness\u201d and \u201cdizziness.\u201d With regard to \u201cthe patient\u2019s ability to perform during an 8-hour workday with normal breaks,\u201d Dr. Seth indicated the following physical limitations: Mr. S. could sit for four hours; stand for one hour; walk for one hour; and could \u201cnever\u201d climb, carry, bend, or squat. In response to the query whether Mr. S. could use his hands \u201cfor repetitive action,\u201d Dr. Seth checked the \u201cNo\u201d column on the form for each of the three specified hand actions: \u201csimple grasping,\u201d \u201cpushing and fine,\u201d or \u201cmanipulation.\u201d The form also asked: \u201cBased on your evaluation has your patient\u2019s medical condition lasted or can it be expected to last at least 12 months?\u201d Dr. Seth checked the \u201cYes\u201d box. Notably, Dr. Seth also checked the \u201cYes\u201d box in answer to the following inquiry: \u201cDoes the patient\u2019s medical condition prevent them from working?\u201d He specified the duration of Mr. S\u2019s inability to work as lasting from February 21, 2003, to February 20, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">On or about May 5, 2003, BCDSS notified Mr. S. that the SRT found him ineligible for Medicaid benefits, because it determined that he did not have a disability. According to the SRT, appellant was capable of employment as an appointment clerk, telephone operator, or receptionist. Mr. S. filed an appeal on June 23, 2003, which led to the evidentiary fair hearing conducted by the ALJ on August 19, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">At the hearing, Mr. S. testified regarding his ankle fracture, hypertension, hand injury, peripheral nerve problems, diabetes, and severe pain that interferes with his sleep and activities. He also testified that, because of his ankle injury, he is only able to walk a few steps at a time and sometimes uses a walker. He introduced his Form 402B and Form 4204, as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>as medical records documenting his clinical depression. A representative of BCDSS testified that the agency had received updated information and that the SRT was reconsidering Mr. S.\u2019s eligibility. However, BCDSS did not offer any medical evidence to contradict Mr. S.\u2019s claim of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">On September 22, 2003, the ALJ issued his decision, in which he made general findings of fact but failed to make any findings of fact regarding the import of the medical evidence. The ALJ noted, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">The Appellant has provided additional information to the local department which has not yet been considered by the SRT, including: (a) updated medical report forms (Form 402B); (b) updated vocational, educational and social data (Form 4204); (c) medical progress notes from July 8, 2003 through August 18, 2003; and (d) emergency room records from July 18, 2003.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">According to the ALJ, the SRT has the statutory authority to review and consider the updated medical evidence. Instead of resolving the question of appellant\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid based on a disability, the ALJ remanded the case to enable SRT to consider the medical evidence submitted at the hearing. The ALJ reasoned that \u201c[t]he members of the SRT are the proper persons to make disability determinations, and they must be given an opportunity to review all medical information submitted by an applicant.\u201d Further, the ALJ said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-7\">These COMAR regulations provide that the SRT <em>shall </em>review \u201cthe medical report and other evidence\u201d and determine whether an individual is disabled. (Emphasis added [by ALJ]). This review <em>shall </em>be conducted by a team \u201ccomposed of a medical or psychological consultant and other individual who is qualified to interpret and evaluate medical reports and other evidence relating to the individual\u2019s physical or mental impairments ...\u201d (Emphasis added [by ALJ]). This scheme clearly anticipates that a SRT team comprised of qualified individuals review the medical records of a person applying for [medical assistance].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>The medical records submitted to the local department by the Appellant at the hearing have not been reviewed by the SRT. The regulations mandate that a SRT team members [sic] be given the opportunity to \u201cinterpret and evaluate\u201d those records as required by the above-cited COMAR regulation. COMAR 10.09.24.05E(2)(c). Testimony was also allowed regarding the Appellant\u2019s limitations, but these limitations are best considered by the SRT, which is charged with making a disability decision in this case. This is particularly true when the SRT has not been given all of the data from which a decision can be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-4\">... In his closing argument, the local department\u2019s representative argued that the case be remanded to the SRT for review of the new information presented. After reviewing the law in this case, I agree with the local department that this matter must be remanded to the SRT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">On or about September 30, 2003, the SRT found that Mr. S. was not disabled. According to appellant, he \u201cwas without access to critical medical care from October 2002 to October 2003.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">On October 2, 2003, Mr. S. noted his appeal of the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Board. In the meantime, on October 23, 2003, Mr. S. also submitted a new application for Medicaid. In December of 2003, BCDSS notified Mr. S. that he was found eligible for benefits, retroactive to October 1, 2003. The record indicates that appellant has continued to receive Medicaid benefits since October of 2003. Although appellant\u2019s benefits were not made retroactive to the date of his first application for Medicaid, his unpaid bills apparently were \u201cwritten off as charity care____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">With regard to the initial denial of Medicaid benefits, the Board held a hearing on February 26, 2004. Mr. S. argued that the ALJ\u2019s remand to the SRT violated federal law. On March 9, 2004, the Board ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">That the decision of the Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative Hearings to Remand be AFFIRMED and the Board hereby recommends that the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>be remanded to the SRT consistent with the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">On April 7, 2004, Mr. S. sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. At the hearing on September 14, 2004, the agency agreed with appellant that the ALJ erred by failing to decide the merits of whether appellant was disabled and by remanding to the SRT. However, appellee claimed that, given the subsequent award of benefits to Mr. S., the matter had become moot. Mr. S. disagreed. The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: ... Your honor, this case involves an issue of great public importance which affects many people in Maryland. Because of the prolonged appeal procedure involved in this kind of case this problem of case review is unlikely to reach the court as a live case, a ease in which needed Medical Assistance benefits have not been granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">Albert [S.] is before this court because he suffered a number of disabling conditions without access to needed medical care. For over a year after the date that he applied for Medical Assistance he was unable to receive the medical treatment that he desperately needed and was forced to wait additional months in getting access to the needed insurance to treat his diabetes, hypertension, contracted left hand and injured right ankle because the administrative law judge failed to make a final decision in his Medical Assistance appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">This hearing took place over a year ago. We are now in court over a year later on an appeal of this particular case. The Department has argued, what is there to be gained at this point because, after all, my client has Medical Assistance, and it doesn\u2019t matter at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">I suggest to you, Your Honor, that this case is of extreme importance because it is a situation that is repeated time and time again, and it is one that is of great public importance and does meet the criteria set forth in the Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Court of Appeals case that sets forth factors that one can look to to overcome the mootness issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">... Your Honor, at this time I\u2019m asking that the court acknowledge that, first of all, federal law requires that the administrative law judge render a decision on Mr. [S.\u2019s] application rather than remand the case for a new eligibility determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">Number two, I\u2019m asking that Your Honor find that Mary-land is required to comply with federal law in administering the Medical Assistance program. Federal provisions assure a public benefits applicant a final decision resulting from a fair hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">I\u2019m also asking that Your Honor find that there was sufficient evidence before the administrative law judge to render a decision on Mr. [S.\u2019s] application, and, finally, because of the important public interest at stake and the likelihood of reoccurrence, the court should rule on the merits of this case even though Mr. Mr. S. was eventually granted Medical Assistance benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-9\">... Both the federal regulations and COMAR state that there must be a final decision within 90 days of the appeal, and a final decision is not a remand to the State Review Team or any other body for a review of the initial application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-10\">[THE COURT]: What authority do you have for that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-11\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: 42 C.F.R. 431.244(a).... It requires a hearing decision to be based exclusively on evidence introduced at the hearing. Also, 42 C.F.R. 431.232(c). There is a Maryland decision which states that an ALJ should not simply review the decision of the local department, and that is found at <em>Halle Company </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number><em>[Com,panies] v. Crofton Civic Association, </em>339 Md. 131 [661 A.2d 682]. These are all cites from Page Seven of my initial memorandum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-4\">[THE COURT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: In that case there is a holding that de novo appeals are wholly original proceedings; not a review of the action of the lower decision maker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">I think that one of the most important forms of guidance comes from the State Medicaid Manual.... The State Medicaid Manual guides the procedures that Maryland must follow as it administers this partnership program between the federal government and the state government. It specifies, quote, remanding the case to a local unit for further consideration is not a substitute for definitive and final administrative action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">And, Your Honor, it\u2019s my position that the case cannot be remanded for a decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">Counsel for appellant conceded that there are limited circumstances when a remand to SRT would be appropriate. He asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\">The only circumstances which we would concede might require a remand is if the Administrative Law Judge found that there was contradictory medical evidence or insufficient medical evidence and there needed to be further development of medical evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-10\">It is certainly possible that the Administrative Law Judge might want to remand a case for a consultative examination, if that is warranted, and I believe that is a position that the Department agrees with. There are some limited circumstances in which you might remand a case for that specific development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-11\">However, that was not the case in Mr. [S.\u2019s] presentation, There was no evidence or no indication throughout the course of the hearing or anything reflected in the decision of the administrative law judge that the reason that the case was remanded was for further medical development. The ALJ took the position that he didn\u2019t have the authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>make a decision, and that the State Review Team would have to review the information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The following exchange helps to illuminate the issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-5\">[THE COURT]: Let me interrupt you one second. When was the first application? When did Mr. [S.] file the first application for benefits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: His first application that I\u2019m aware of was made on October the 1st, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">[THE COURT]: The second one was October 23rd, '03? [COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">[THE COURT]: So, when he was approved the second time, that\u2019s not retroactive, I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-9\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: No, it is not, although it is my understanding in talking to my client recently that the bill that was in question, the Bayview bill, has either been written off as charity care or is not being pursued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-10\">[THE COURT]: <em>He isn\u2019t on the hook for anything in the intervening period of time?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-11\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: <em>Not to my knowledge, </em>but the reason I\u2019m here today though, Your Honor, is because I have a very large Medical Assistance practice, and we find time and time again that <em>the administrative law judges do not take a fresh look. Do not provide the de novo review which federal law requires.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-12\"><em>They are simply remanding the cases back to the State Review Team for a redetermination, </em>and this causes great delay, usually, a month or two or more and then the client is faced with the possibility of having to appeal once again, which is usually another several months. So you\u2019re talking about a five month delay potentially in a case that is remanded to the State Review Team.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-13\">Administrative law judges are in a position to review medical evidence. It\u2019s simply a question of looking at the medical evidence, applying the facts of the situation to the standard which they should be familiar with. It\u2019s the Social Security Sequential Evaluation Standard. Lawyers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>paralegals do this all the time. It does not require a doctor to review medical evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">And, clearly, the Administrative Law Judge in this instance, if he had listened to the testimony and been willing to consider it and to go through that five step sequential evaluation, which is described in my memorandum, <em>he should have come to the conclusion that my client was disabled, and, as a result, my client would have been able to receive Medical Assistance for his problem.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">[THE COURT]: Okay. All right. I think I get the gist of your argument. Let me ask you a question. You\u2019re asking me to remand it back to the ALJ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: No, Your Honor. Actually, I\u2019m asking you to find that based on the record that he is disabled. He was disabled for that period of time of October 2002 through September of 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">[THE COURT]: <em>If I find he\u2019s disabled, that really doesn\u2019t get to your main issue, which is whether the ALJ can do what he or she did.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-10\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: <em>You\u2019re correct. The most important, I believe, decision to be 'made by Your Honor is whether or not an ALJ must make a final decision </em>\u2014 go <em>through a de novo review where evidence is considered by the administrative law judge and a final decision made by that individual. The most important issue here is the federal and state obligation of the administrative law judge to consider the evidence before him or her. </em>[THE COURT]: In other words, you want me to rule that the ALJ should have made a final decision and then I should make a final decision\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-11\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-12\">[THE COURT]: \u2014 as to disability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-13\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Yes.

Your Honor, I believe the longitudinal record and the memorandum of law that the Department filed in this case will indicate that <em>the Department does not disagree in principle with just about everything that counsel for appellant has brought before the court today.

In its Memorandum and Order of Court, it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">Petitioner alleges that he was denied a fair hearing required by federal and state law when the ALJ remanded Petitioner\u2019s case back to the SRT for consideration of additional evidence rather than rendering a final administrative decision. At the hearing of September 14, 2004 held before this court, [appellee] conceded that the ALJ ought to have rendered a decision rather than remand this particular case to the SRT for consideration of new medical evidence not previously considered. [Appellee] also conceded that Maryland law mirrors the federal scheme with respect to the procedures that hearing judges must follow in adjudicating medical assistance cases. Presumably, this concession implies that the fair hearing procedures under 42 CFR 431.232 and COMAR 10.01.04.01 et seq. are equivalent, and that the ALJ ought to have held a de novo hearing, and heard the additional evidence, rather than remand it to the SRT for additional consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">There is no longer an actual controversy between the parties because the positions of the [appellee] and the [appellant] are the same in that <em>both parties have agreed </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number><em>that the ALJ was required, to render a final decision on the merits rather than remanding the case. </em>In addition, the Petitioner has since been found to be eligible to receive medical assistance benefits and has received all the benefits for which he originally applied. For these two reasons, the case has become moot since there is no longer an effective remedy that this court can provide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">Despite being moot, Petitioner urges the court to adjudicate this appeal on the merits citing <em>J.L./Matthews, Inc. v. Maryland,[-]National Capital Park and Planning Commission, </em>368 Md. 71, 96-97 [792 A.2d 288] (2002) quoting <em>Lloyd v. Board of Supervisors of Elections, </em>206 Md. 36, 43 [111 A.2d 379] (1954). The factors set forth in <em>J.L./Matthews, </em>when applied to the case <em>sub judice, </em>do not concur with sufficient weight to warrant an adjudication on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">Preliminarily, appellee urges us to dismiss the appeal as moot, because appellant has no financial exposure, he now receives Medicaid, and \u201c[t]he Department and Mr. S. agree that the administrative law judge erred when he failed to decide Mr. S.\u2019s eligibility after a fair hearing in September 2003.\u201d According to appellee, because the \u201cparties agree on the regulations and their interpretation ... there is no legal question affecting the public\u2019s interest for the Court to decide.\u201d Further, appellee insists that appellant has not shown that \u201cthe issue is likely to recur frequently for other Medicaid applicants or recipients.\u201d Appellee adds: \u201cBecause the Department agrees with Mr. [S.] on the sole issue in this case, there is no controversy before this Court. Accordingly, the circuit court\u2019s decision dismissing the case should be affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>Appellant urges us to reach the merits, claiming that this case \u201cinvolves a recurring issue of great public importance that evades review but that affects many public benefits recipients in Maryland.\u201d Further, he contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-4\">This is not an isolated case. Despite the fact that the Department has conceded the illegality of the practice, ALJs in Maryland routinely remand Medical Assistance disability cases to the SRT and local departments, rather than rendering a decision on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">We agree with appellant that the substantive issue, while moot, is worthy of our consideration because of its public importance and because the issue could evade judicial review. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">It is well established that a controversy generally is not justiciable if it has become moot. <em>Stevenson v. Lanham, </em>127 Md.App. 597, 612, 736 A.2d 363 (1999). The Court of Appeals noted long ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">The American doctrine of judicial review may be considered as a correlative to the doctrine of the separation of powers, and must always be exercised with due regard to the legislative prerogative. There are a number of subordinate rules that tend to limit the scope of review, among the most important of which are the presumption of constitutionality and the rule that <em>courts will not decide moot or abstract questions, </em>or, in the absence of constitutional mandate, render advisory opinions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-8\"><em>Hammond, v. Lancaster, </em>194 Md. 462, 471, 71 A.2d 474 (1950) (citation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">\u201cA case is moot when there is no longer an existing controversy between the parties at the time it is before the court so that the court cannot provide an effective remedy.\u201d <em>Coburn, v. Coburn, </em>342 Md. 244, 250, 674 A.2d 951 (1996); <em>see Hill v. Scartascini, </em>134 Md.App. 1, 4, 758 A.2d 1087 (2000). As a general proposition, \u201cappeals which present nothing else for decision are dismissed as a matter of course.\u201d <em>In re Riddlemoser, </em>317 Md. 496, 502, 564 A.2d 812 (1989). This is because any decision as to such an issue would amount to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>academic undertaking; appellate courts \u201cdo not sit to give opinions on abstract propositions or moot questions.\u201d <em>Id. See generally Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Levitsky, </em>353 Md. 188, 200, 725 A.2d 1027 (1999); <em>Mercy Hosp., Inc. v. Jackson, </em>306 Md. 556, 562, 510 A.2d 562 (1986); <em>Atty.

Indeed, \u201con rare occasions, we reach issues that are otherwise moot.\u201d <em>Beeman v. Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>105 Md.App. 147, 158, 658 A.2d 1172 (1995); <em>see J.L. Matthews, Inc. v. Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n., </em>368 Md. 71, 96-97, 792 A.2d 288 (2002); <em>In Re Justin D., </em>357 Md. 431, 444-45, 745 A.2d 408 (2000); <em>State v. Parker, </em>334 Md. 576, 584, 640 A.2d 1104 (1994); <em>Bond v. Slavin, </em>157 Md.App. 340, 354, 851 A.2d 598 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">In <em>Lloyd v. Bd. of Supervisors of Elections, </em>206 Md. 36, 43, 111 A.2d 379 (1954), the Court articulated the standard by which moot cases may be addressed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">[Ojnly where the urgency of establishing a rule of future conduct in matters of important public concern is imperative and manifest, will there be justified a departure from the general rule and practice of not deciding academic questions .... [I]f the public interest clearly will be hurt if the question is not immediately decided, if the matter involved is likely to recur frequently, and its recurrence will involve a relationship between the government and its citizens, or a duty of government, and upon any recurrence, the same difficulty which prevented the appeal at hand from being heard in time is likely again to prevent a decision, then the Court may find justification for deciding the issues raised by a question which has become moot, particularly if all of these factors concur with sufficient weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>This test was applied by the Court of Appeals in <em>In Re: Joshua R., 357 </em>Md. 431, 745 A.2d 408 (2000). In that case, the juvenile court entered written orders regarding parental visitation that could have been read as delegating to the Department of Social Services the authority to determine whether to allow visitation and, if so, when, where, and how it was to occur. <em>Id. at 434, 745 </em>A.2d 408. Because these orders were superseded, and were no longer in effect when they were appealed, the Court concluded that the matter was moot. <em>Id. </em>at 444, 745 A.2d 408. Nevertheless, the Court elected to reach the merits of the issue because of the frequency with which such orders are entered, the likelihood that they would evade review by becoming moot before the Court would have an opportunity to consider them, and the important public concern. The Court reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 444, 745 A.2d 408:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\">[I]t is common practice for the juvenile court in Montgomery County to enter orders of this kind, so the issue presented by appellants is a recurring and important one. With periodic six-month review, orders of this kind that are appealed will almost always be replaced by subsequent orders before this Court will have the opportunity to review them. We have recognized a very limited exception to the mootness doctrine in this kind of situation....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\"><em>In Re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055/CAD, </em>344 Md. 458, 687 A.2d 681 (1997), is also instructive. In that case, the Court resolved a moot question concerning the trial court\u2019s authority to consider a belatedly filed objection to a petition to terminate parental rights. <em>Id. </em>at 465, 687 A.2d 681. The Court underscored that while it has the authority to address moot questions, it exercises \u201cthat authority \u2018only in rare circumstances which demonstrate the most compelling circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 687 A.2d 681 (citation omitted). However, the Court chose to address the contention because the matter was \u201cobviously of considerable public importance,\u201d it was likely to recur due to the large number of parental termination cases filed each year, and it presented \u201can important and dramatic conflict between the government\u201d and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>citizens\u2019 fundamental rights as parents. <em>Id. </em>at 488-89, 687 A.2d 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">We are also guided by the case of <em>Katsenelenbogen v. Katsenelenbogen, </em>365 Md. 122, 775 A.2d 1249 (2001), which helps to illuminate the \u201cpublic interest\u201d exception. That case arose from a domestic violence dispute. The circuit court entered a protective order, which this Court vacated on appeal; we remanded the matter for further consideration of whether the order was appropriate. <em>Katsenelenbogen v. Kat-senelenbogen, </em>135 Md.App. 317, 762 A.2d 198 (2000). By the time the case reached the Court of Appeals, it had become moot, because the protective order had expired by its own terms. <em>Katsenelenbogen, </em>365 Md. at 125, 775 A.2d 1249. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals recognized that the case concerned a matter of public importance that warranted the Court\u2019s consideration, despite the mootness. <em>Id. </em>In particular, the Court expressed concern that this Court\u2019s decision could \u201cbe construed as weakening the State\u2019s effort to respond aggressively to incidents of violence in the home and frustrating the important objectives of the State\u2019s domestic violence law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Ordinarily, then, a case that has become moot \u201cwill be dismissed without a decision on the merits of the controversy unless it presents \u2018unresolved issues in matters of important public concern that, if decided, will establish a rule for future conduct,\u2019 or the issue presented is \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stevenson v. Lanham, </em>127 Md.App. at 612, 736 A.2d 363 (citations omitted). This is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">According to appellee, AL Js do not \u201croutinely\u201d and improperly remand these determinations. From this record, however, we cannot determine the frequency with which ALJs remand the Medicaid disability cases. Notably, while the Department seems to suggest that any error here was an isolated occurrence, it was the agency\u2019s own lawyer who, at the fair hearing, encouraged the ALJ to remand to the SRT for further consideration. Nor have we uncovered any reported opinion in this State that addresses the issue presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Clearly, in addressing the issue, our opinion will help to educate counsel as well as the ALJs.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">In addition, this case obviously involves \u201ca relationship between government and its citizens, or a duty of govern-ment____\u201d <em>Lloyd, </em>206 Md. at 43, 111 A.2d 379. To be sure, the public importance of the issue cannot be overstated. Noting the impact of the procedural error upon indigent applicants, the amici emphasize as \u201cmanifold\u201d the \u201cimportance of the fair hearing decision-maker reaching a decision on the merits.... \u201d Amici assert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-7\">This practice of \u201cremanding\u201d causes real harm to indigent individuals with disabilities. While applications are delayed for many months, these vulnerable individuals may have to delay or forego necessary medical care, incur financial debt, and sacrifice other necessities like food and rent to try to pay for medical care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">The amici further elucidate the hardship caused by unlawful and undue delay that results when the ALJ fails to render a decision. They state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\">Any undue delay in the processing of Medicaid applications or in the resolution of disputes over Medicaid eligibility is irresponsible to individual applicants, to the Medicaid program, and even to society as a whole. The provision of early Medicaid services prevents higher costs associated with untreated chronic conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-11\">Applicants for benefits like Medicaid are unavoidably in [a] desperate situation.... [A]n <em>applicant, </em>like Mr. S., must simply wait, perhaps months, for the determination of whether the benefits can <em>begin. </em>Therefore, timely and accurate decisions on applications, and prompt resolution of disputes over eligibility for benefits, are essential to prevent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>unnecessary harm. In the instant case Mr. S.\u2019s original application for Medicaid was denied by the local agency and he appealed the decision. Instead of resolving the dispute over eligibility, the ALJ \u201cremanded\u201d the case to the local agency which again ... denied the application for a second time. Mr. [S.j was then forced to file yet another application which the local agency was required to process, for the third time, to determine whether he met the disability standard. <em>He was determined eligible during the last evaluation but went without medical coverage for an entire year while this process unfolded. The fair hearing process and subsequent judicial review a,re designed to be the 'mechanism by which the accuracy of agency decisions are checked, and if need be, promptly corrected.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Because there is no reported case in Maryland that elucidates the issue presented here, and because the matter is one of obvious importance to many members of society, such as Mr. S., we believe it is appropriate for us to reach the merits, to ensure that Medicaid applicants receive prompt and proper administrative review of SRT determinations when sufficient medical evidence is presented to an ALJ. We turn to address the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">States participating with the federal government in the Medicaid program are required to provide applicants who have been denied benefits an opportunity for a fair hearing and a final decision of the matter. <em>See </em>S.G. \u00a7 10-222; 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 481.200(a), 431.220(a)(1), 431.244, 431.245. These provisions include the opportunity to present and cross-examine witnesses and the right to a decision that includes findings of fact and conclusions of law. COMAR 10.01.04.03, .06, and .08. Federal and state regulations further require that, upon consideration of all of the evidence presented at a fair hearing, the ALJ must render a final decision as to a person\u2019s eligibili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>ty for Medicaid. S.G. \u00a7 10-221(b)(l); COMAR 10.01.04.08, .08A, &amp; .08C1; COMAR 10.01.04.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">There is no dispute here as to the adequacy or sufficiency of the evidence in regard to appellant\u2019s disability. The ALJ stated that the SRT \u201care the proper persons to make disability determinations.\u201d COMAR 10.09.24.05E(2). Apparently, the ALJ did not know that, once an applicant contests the determination of the SRT, it is the ALJ\u2019s responsibility to render a final decision in the matter, assuming the sufficiency of the evidence. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 431.200(a), 431.220(a)(1), 431.244, &amp; 431.245; COMAR 10.01.04.02, .08A, &amp; .08C1.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) is the federal agency that oversees the Medicaid program and provides guidance to the states on the regulatory requirements for hearings. Formerly known as the Health Care Financing Administration, CMS publishes a State Medicaid Manual, which \u201cis an official medium by which [CMS] issues mandatory, advisory, and optional Medicaid policies and procedures to the Medicaid State agencies.\u201d CMS State Medicaid Manual, Publication # 45 (\u201cCMS-PUB45\u201d). CMS\u2019s interpretation of its regulations is accorded \u201ccontrolling weight unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>State v. Shalala, </em>42 F.3d 595, 598 (10th Cir.1994). It is CMS\u2019s general policy that \u201c[a] conclusive decision in the name of the State Agency shall be made by the hearing authority,\u201d and that \u201c[r]emanding the case to a local unit for further consideration is not a substitute for \u2018definitive and final administrative action.\u2019 \u201d CMS-PUB45.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Furthermore, the Department\u2019s Medicaid fair hearing regulations require an ALJ to issue a final judgment that is \u201cfinal and binding upon the Department and the delegate agency.\u201d COMAR 10.01.04.08C(1). Appellee concedes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">In accordance with CMS\u2019s interpretation of the federal fair hearing regulations, the Department interprets its own fair hearing regulations as proscribing administrative law judges from remanding cases to county departments for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>pose of reconsidering questions of disability and Medicaid eligibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Accordingly, we agree with the parties that the ALJ erred at the fair hearing review by remanding to the SRT, because sufficient medical evidence was presented to the ALJ with respect to the alleged disability. Given the sufficiency of the medical evidence, it was the ALJ\u2019s obligation to render a decision on the merits of appellant\u2019s application for Medicaid based on a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">APPELLEE\u2019S MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL IS DENIED.
