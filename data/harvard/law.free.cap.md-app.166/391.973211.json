Moustafa (Mr. Moustafa), appellant, and Mariam M. Moustafa (Mrs. Moustafa), appellee, are before this Court for the second time. In an unreported opinion filed on June 7, 2004, this Court held \u201cthat the circuit court erred in failing to make separate awards of child support and alimony <em>pendente lite </em>and, therefore, we shall reverse and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\u201d <em>Moustafa v. Moustafa, </em>No. 2848, September Term, 2002, 157 Md.App. 714 <em>(.Moustafa </em>I). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The Background section of that opinion includes the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-4\">The parties were originally married in Cairo, Egypt on June 10, 1976. They came to the United States in 1978. They have two children, Sharon, born May 5, 1981, and Karim, born July 18, 1989. Both children reside with appellee in the family home on Shady Grove Lane in Montgomery County. Appellant has ownership interests in a number of businesses in the United States and in Egypt including, but not limited to, Eagle Manufacturing and Trading, Inc., M &amp; M Construction Company, and United Technology Group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">On September 16, 1985, a divorce decree was issued to the parties by the Arab Republic of Egypt at that nation\u2019s consulate in Washington, D.C. The foreign decree was adopted and enrolled by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on March 6, 1987.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">On November 18, 1985, appellant married Faten Zawawi. According to appellee, appellant told her that his marriage to Zawawi was solely to allow him to become a United States citizen, and that he would later divorce her and return to appellee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">Appellee asserts that she and appellant were remarried in Egypt on June 14, 1986. Appellant denies that the parties were remarried. Appellee maintains that prior to their second marriage, appellant showed her a document that he represented to be a divorce decree reflecting his divorce from Zawawi. It is undisputed, however, that appellant did not actually obtain a divorce from Zawawi until February 28, 1989.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The further proceedings ordered by this Court concluded with a judgment entered by the Honorable DeLawrence Beard that, among other things, \u201cannulled\u201d the parties\u2019 June 14, 1986 marriage, and required that appellant pay to appellee (1) a monetary award, (2) \u201cindefinite and permanent\u201d alimony, (3) child support, and (4) counsel fees. The judgment also provided that appellant\u2019s alimony and support obligations were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>\u201caccounting from June 17, 2002,\u201d the date on which appellee filed her complaint for divorce and/or annulment. In an OPINION that accompanied the judgment, Judge Beard stated the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">The parties divorced on September 16, 1985, in a Muslim proceeding that was enrolled in Montgomery County in 1987 (Civil Case No. 21304). Subsequent to the parties\u2019 divorce in 1985, [Mrs. Moustafa] returned to Egypt to live. On November 19, 1985, [Mr. Moustafa] married Ms. Faten Zawawi. In 1986, while on a visit to Egypt, the parties were lawfully married a second time on June 14, 1986. [Mr. Moustafa] did not obtain a divorce from Ms. Zawawi until April 28, 1989. At the time that the parties were married on June 14, 1986, [Mr. Moustafa] was still married to Faten Zawawi. In an Egyptian proceeding in November 2002, [Mr. Moustafa], after [Mrs. Moustafa] filed for divorce in this Court, renounced the validity of the 1986 marriage contract with [Mrs. Moustafa],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">There is no dispute that [Mr. Moustafa] was married to Faten Zawawi at the time the parties were married on June 14,1986. As a result of [Mr. Moustafa]\u2019s bigamy, this Court must grant an annulment to [Mrs. Moustafa].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">The Defendant claims that he obtained a divorce from [Mrs. Moustafa] in Egypt on November 4, 2002. Such a divorce is not entitled to comity by this Court which will not proceed to the adjudication of a matter involving conflicting rights and interests until all persons directly concerned in the event have been actually or constructively notified of the pendency of the proceeding and given reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">In the present case, [Mrs. Moustafa] was neither notified nor participated in the Egyptian divorce proceeding. Absent any knowledge or opportunity to participate in the proceeding, [Mrs. Moustafa] was not afforded due process and the Decree shall not be recognized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>This Court\u2019s authority to grant an annulment to [Mrs. Moustafa] does not affect the Court\u2019s authority to award [Mrs. Moustafa] relief to include, but not be limited to custody, child support, alimony, monetary award or attorneys\u2019 fees. In <em>Ledvinka [v. Ledvinka, </em>154 Md.App. 420, 840 A.2d 173 (2003)], the Court recognized this Court\u2019s authority to resolve custody, child support, and attorneys\u2019 fees when granting an annulment. The monetary award statute, Family Law Article, Section 8-203, also confirms that in a proceeding for an \u201cannulment\u201d, the Court shall determine which property is marital property. Similarly, under Section 11-101, the Court may award alimony under (a)(2)(i) when there is an annulment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\">The Defendant is currently employed with M &amp; M Construction Company, earning approximately $16,000 per month. For approximately ten (10) years prior to 1901, [Mrs. Moustafa] worked at a print shop where she operated a press and did photography. Since 1991, [Mrs. Moustafa] has not worked outside the home, and thus generates no income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">The parties\u2019 most recent marriage has lasted eighteen (18) years. Overall, the parties have been married since 1976, or twenty-eight (28) years, but for brief separation and divorce of approximately one (1) year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">[Mrs. Moustafa] has had breast cancer and currently has an abdominal condition for which she is presently undergoing treatment. [Mrs. Moustafa] has also been diagnosed as clinically depressed. [Mr. Moustafa] suffers from hypertension and a left hand palsy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">The Court finds that [Mr. Moustafa] dissipated marital assets in the amount of sixty-eight thousand five hundred ($68,500.00) dollars by writing checks to his brother, Saleh Moustafa, and his business, M &amp; M Construction. [Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Moustafa] dissipated marital assets in the amount of one hundred sixty thousand seven hundred fifty-six ($160,756.00) dollars when he executed a Note to his brother, Saleh Moustafa, and recorded it as a Deed of Trust on the former marital home. [Mr. Moustafa] dissipated marital assets in the amount of seventy-four thousand five hundred ($74,-500.00) dollars by transferring money by wire to his current ... wife, Rania Kamal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">Further, the Court finds that [Mr. Moustafa]\u2019s withdrawing all of the monies in his IRA account in direct violation of Judge Dugan\u2019s Order dated June 21, 2002 constitutes dissipation of property. The IRA account is valued at approximately thirty-six thousand ($86,000.00) dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">Here, [Mr. Moustafa]\u2019s wiring monies to Ms. Karnal, his new wife, writing checks to his brother, Saleh, and withdrawing all of his IRA monies all constitute an intentional dissipation of assets. Such dissipation is included in calculating the monetary award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">In this case, [Mrs. Moustafa] had substantial justification for prosecuting the annulment and for expending the sum of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. In considering the respective financial positions of the parties, the Court recognizes that [Mrs. Moustafa] does not have any ability to make the payment toward these fees. By contrast, [Mr. Moustafa] had a substantial ability to pay the fees when considering [Mr. Moustafa]\u2019s most recent bank statements which reflect over one hundred thousand ($100,000.00) dollars per month being received by [Mr. Moustafa] in the several months prior to trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Appellant now argues to us that (in the words of his brief) he is entitled to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">(1) a reversal of the annulment^]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-11\">(2) a remand for a determination of whether the parties were married in 1986[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-12\">(3) a reversal of the order to pay the arrearage based upon the vacated order[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>(4) a reversal of the award of permanent alimony and the amount of alimony based on an erroneous calculation of Appellant\u2019s current salary and ability to pay, the inclusion of expenses in the Appellee\u2019s financial statement for a daughter that [appellant] had no obligation to support^] and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\">(5) a reversal of the order including Appellant\u2019s promissory note to his brother as a dissipated sum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In support of these arguments, appellant presents four questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">I. IF IT FINDS THAT A MARRIAGE OCCURRED, DOES A MARYLAND COURT, HAVING PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTIES, HAVE AUTHORITY TO VOID A BIGAMOUS MARRIAGE WITHOUT ANY SHOWING THAT IT WAS INVALID IN THE ISLAMIC NATION WHERE IT WAS ENTERED?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">II. MAY A TRIAL COURT ASSESS AN ARREARAGE IN \u201cSUPPORT\u201d PAYMENTS BASED UPON AN ORDER PREVIOUSLY VACATED IN AN INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">III. IS THE BROAD DISCRETION OF THE TRIAL COURT, ANTICIPATING THE FUTURE, SUFFICIENT FOR IT TO DECLARE, IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY EXPERT TESTIMONY, THAT A PERMANENT ALIMONY AWARD IS WARRANTED?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">IV. MAY A COURT FIND A DISSIPATION OF MARITAL PROPERTY WITHOUT EVIDENCE OF INTENT?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">We reject the proposition that Judge Beard should have speculated that, under Egyptian law, a man can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>married to more than one woman at the same point in time. In <em>Maple v. Maple, </em>566 P.2d 1229 (Utah 1977), while rejecting Mr. Maple\u2019s \u201ccontention that since the marriage was annulled he should have no further obligation to the [appellee],\u201d the Supreme Court of Utah stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">[Appellant\u2019s] counsel represents that he has gone to a great deal of trouble to determine and show that under the law of Thailand, a marriage with one already married is a nullity. Rule 9, Utah Rules of Evidence provides that this can be done by obtaining a copy of the law and presenting it to the court. But we do not see any difficulty here from failing to do so. The rule is that unless the law of a foreign jurisdiction is proved to be otherwise, it will be presumed to be the same as the law of the forum state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1230 (footnotes omitted). We agree with that analysis, which is entirely consistent with Maryland law. <em>See Hosain v. Malik, </em>108 Md.App. 284, 302-03, 671 A.2d 988 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">If appellant wanted Judge Beard to apply Egyptian law to the \u201cannulment\u201d issue, appellant was required by Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 10-505 (2004) to (1) provide notice of his intent to rely upon that law, and (2) prove what that law is. Moreover, even if appellant had complied with these foundational requirements, the Court of Appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">Although foreign judgments are entitled to a degree of deference and respect under the doctrine of comity, courts will nonetheless deny recognition and enforcement to those foreign judgments which are inconsistent with the public policies of the forum state. <em>Malik v. Malik, </em>99 Md.App. 521, 534, 638 A.2d 1184, 1190 (1994) (\u201cwhere [a foreign] judgment is ... against public policy ... it will not be given any effect by our courts\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-9\"><em>Telnikoff v. Matusevitch, </em>347 Md. 561, 574, 702 A.2d 230 (1997). For these reasons, Judge Beard did not err or abuse his discretion in applying \u201cthe law of the forum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">It is clear from the record of the case at bar that appellant\u2019s second question is both hypothetical and moot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>because (1) as noted by Judge Beard, Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law \u00a7 12-101(a) (2004) provides that appellant\u2019s support obligations can be \u201cback dated\u201d to June 17, 2002, the date on which appellee filed her complaint, and (2) in <em>Moustafa </em>I, this Court expressly rejected \u201cappellant\u2019s claim that the parties\u2019 second marriage was void <em>ab initio </em>because of his intentional bigamy and, therefore appellee is disqualified from receiving alimony <em>pendente lite.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Emphasizing that appellee presented \u201cno expert testimony,\u201d appellant argues that Judge Beard was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d in finding that appellee suffered from \u201cclinical\u201d depression. This erroneous finding, according to appellant, requires that we vacate the alimony award and remand for further proceedings on the issues of (1) whether appellee is entitled to \u201cindefinite\u201d alimony, and (2) the amount of whatever type of alimony is awarded. There is no merit in this argument. The record shows that, in applying Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(c)(1)\u2014(2) (2004), Judge Beard was not clearly erroneous in finding that there would be an \u201cunconscionable disparity\u201d in the parties\u2019 standards of living unless appellee were awarded indefinite alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Appellant also argues that the evidence was insufficient to support Judge Beard\u2019s finding that appellant had a monthly income of $16,000.00. It is well settled that disbelief of a party\u2019s testimony does not constitute affirmative evidence to the contrary, and that a court \u201cmay not find a specific amount of imputed or undisclosed actual income without supporting evidence.\u201d <em>Long v. Long, </em>141 Md.App. 841, 349, 785 A.2d 818 (2001). As we pointed out during oral argument, however, Judge Beard was entitled to (1) accept all, part, or none of the testimony of any witness, and (2) draw reasonable inferences from the evidence accepted as true. The case at bar is simply not one in which the court\u2019s income calculation is based solely upon disbelief of a party\u2019s testimony as to his or her actual income. From our review of the documentary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>evidence presented to Judge Beard, we are persuaded that his calculation of appellant\u2019s income was not erroneous \u2014 \u201cclearly\u201d or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The answer to appellant\u2019s fourth question is obviously, \u201cno.\u201d As the above quoted portion of Judge Beard\u2019s OPINION makes clear, however, the record contains overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d to transfer funds \u201cfor the principal purpose of reducing the funds available for equitable distribution.\u201d <em>Jeffcoat v. Jeffcoat, </em>102 Md.App. 301, 311, 649 A.2d 1137 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
