On November 3, 2003, the charges against both appellants were called for a \u201cjoint\u201d trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> each appellant elected a jury trial, and a jury was selected and sworn. On November 4, 2003, the circuit court granted the State\u2019s motion for a mistrial, finding a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d to do so. This ruling was based upon the following sequence of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The State\u2019s witnesses included Sabrina Rogers (Rogers), who had made pretrial (photographic) identifications of appellants and Benson, positively identifying them as the persons who committed the crimes at issue. Prior to trial, the circuit court (1) suppressed Rogers\u2019 extrajudicial identification of Earl on the ground that the identification procedure was \u201cimpermissively suggestive,\u201d and (2) prohibited the State from asking Rogers to make an in-court identification of Earl, on the ground that the State failed to establish that Rogers in-court identification \u201chad a source independent of the illegal pre-trial ... viewing.\u201d <em>See Smith v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 59, 68, 250 A.2d 285 (1969). The record shows that the following transpired on November 4, 2003:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">THE COURT: Okay. Are we ready to bring the jury in? [PROSECUTOR]: One other matter, Your Honor, that it appears to me to be a bit problematic. That is the court has excluded Ms. Rodger\u2019s [sic] identification of Gary Earl.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>THE COURT: Out-of-court and in-court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... It is my assumption that defense counsel [for Hubbard] will, in cross-examination of Sabrina Rodgers [sic], bring to the attention of the jury that there were numerous identifications made by Ms. Rodgers [sic] of persons other than his client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">While that\u2019s f\u00edne for [Hubbard\u2019s counsel], the situation is that I would want to try to rehabilitate, if we get to that point of those questions being asked, rehabilitate Ms. Rodgers [sic] by showing that, in fact, she had identified another person who is a defendant in this case, that being Mr. Earl. And, of course, that\u2019s obviously very prejudicial toward Mr. Earl. And I\u2019m bringing it to the court\u2019s attention now because, again, obviously, in a joint trial, evidence can be used or heard as against one defendant while it may not be admissible against another defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">[EARL\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, that would require some sort of curative instruction from you and I don\u2019t know how you do that and get that through these people\u2019s minds. [PROSECUTOR]: And I agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">[EARL\u2019S COUNSEL]: That\u2019s fundamentally unfair to Mr. Earl.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">THE COURT: Yeah, I agree, I don\u2019t know how that can be done and cured. And while it\u2019s certainly true that if Mr. Earl in his defense or in his cross-examination of Ms. Rodgers [sic] opens that door, then he opens that door, but I\u2019m not going to permit the [S]tate to open the door or the defendant Hubbard to open that door. I\u2019m going to order nobody ask her any questions about identifying Gary Earl, because to do otherwise completely undoes the suppression ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">THE COURT: ... Now, the alternative, let me say, because we have not yet heard a witness, although we did swear the jury, might be to sever these trials, but I\u2019m not sure whether we get that or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>[HUBBARD\u2019S COUNSEL]: I think, Your Honor, that\u2019s the only, that\u2019s the only alterative, because for the court to tell Mr. Hubbard that he can\u2019t bring to the jury\u2019s attention that identifications were made and seven rather than six were made by this witness, which is, in fact, the truth, and that is an exculpatory piece of evidence to my client, to prevent me from being able to bring that to the jury\u2019s attention is denying my client\u2019s right of confrontation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">THE COURT: Is there a practical significance between six and seven?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">[HUBBARD\u2019S COUNSEL]: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">THE COURT: I mean you can specifically identify the named individuals in all but Gary Earl. Can you do it without naming the other defendant as the person she identified?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">[HUBBARD\u2019S COUNSEL]: Oh, sure. I could say to the witness isn\u2019t it, in fact, true and list every name except Earl and then just refer to the identification as Earl and that you also named another person that is not Kevin Hubbard. Now, there may be an implication there that could be Mr. Earl, but I can do it that way and not use Mr. Earl\u2019s name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">Whether or not the court thinks that is, in fact, violating Mr. Earl\u2019s rights because of the granting of the suppression, if I were Mr. Earl I would say, yeah, that does. And I think the only cure for this, the only way to protect Mr. Earl\u2019s rights and Mr. Hubbard\u2019s rights is to sever these cases, because the prosecution is asking that if I ask questions which I think I\u2019d be entitled to ask, that it intends to try to bring out this basically what would be a violation of what the court\u2019s suppression order is, I think that \u2014 I think it\u2019s irreconcilable, Your Honor. Frankly, Your Honor, I think the court, as far as my client is concerned, would be unjustified telling me that I can\u2019t bring to the jury\u2019s attention that all seven identifications were made of three people at the time in some form. By the same token, I think it can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>be reasonably argued that if I do that, there could be implication that Mr. Earl was identified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">[EARL\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I\u2019ve already said I don\u2019t want it to come in. I don\u2019t want it to be any part of this case. I don\u2019t think you can cure that with an instruction to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">After some additional discussion, the circuit court asked for each party\u2019s \u201cposition in regard to a mistrial,\u201d at which point (1) the prosecutor stated, \u201cat this point I think that a mistrial is the appropriate undertaking,\u201d (2) Earl\u2019s counsel stated that, \u201c[Earl] would prefer that the court not grant a mistrial,\u201d and (3) Hubbard\u2019s counsel stated, \u201c[w]e\u2019re not asking for a mistrial either, Your Honor.... That is not to say that I don\u2019t know what alternative the court has at this juncture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Ultimately, the circuit court announced the following ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">[T]his jury has now had opening statements having to do with two defendants, has been told various things about the evidence from the [S]tate, [which] intends to proceed against two defendants. Severing one of them and continuing with the other one at this point seems like a very confusing way for the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">[I]f I have one paramount duty that\u2019s more important than any others, it is to safeguard the rights of parties before the court, defendants and the [S]tate, actually.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">... I agree that it\u2019s difficult to see how I can fashion a remedy, but upon further reflection, it seems to me that any remedy that I fashion has got to be prejudicial to somebody, prejudicial to one of the defendants or the other or maybe both of them, and/or prejudicial to the [S]tate for that matter....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-11\">Upon further consideration of [the prosecutor\u2019s] argument, I believe that this is a manifest necessity and I will, therefore, declare a mistrial in this matter and grant severance on my own motion of all three of these eases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Thereafter, each appellant moved for dismissal of all the charges as to which \u201cjeopardy\u201d had attached. The circuit court denied those motions, and these appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In the case at bar, the same circuit court judge (1) declared the mistrial, and (2) denied appellants\u2019 motions for dismissal on the ground of double jeopardy. Although there is no requirement that such a motion be presented to the trial judge who declared the mistrial, the standard for determining whether there was a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d to do so is the same for (1) the trial judge who declared the mistrial, (2) a trial judge other than the one who declared the mistrial, and (3) the appellate court. This standard is the same whether the mistrial was declared during a court trial or during a jury trial, although \u201can event which would necessitate a mistrial where the trial is before a jury, might not require a mistrial in a non-jury trial.\u201d <em>Cornish v. State, </em>272 Md. 312, 322, 322 A.2d 880 (1974). The defendant who has moved to dismiss the charges must prove that the declaration of a mistrial constituted an \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Unlike the <em>de novo </em>standard of review applied to warrantless searches, consent searches, and confessions, the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard is analogous to the standard applied by the suppression hearing court when reviewing the sufficiency of an affidavit presented in support of a search warrant signed by another judge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To be sure, the trial judge\u2019s discretion is not altogether unbridled. In <em>United States v. Perez, </em>9 Wheat. 579, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824), the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">[T]he law has invested Courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ation, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. They are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject; and it is impossible to define all the circumstances, which would render it proper to interfere. To be sure, the power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In <em>McCorkle v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 31, 619 A.2d 186 (1993), this Court quoted with approval the following summarization found in <em>Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">\n<em>A trial judge properly exercises his discretion to declare a mistrial if an impartial verdict cannot be reached, or if a verdict of conviction could be reached but would have to be reversed on appeal due to an obvious procedural error in the trial.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">410 U.S. at 464, 93 S.Ct. 1066 (emphasis in <em>McCorkle, </em>95 Md.App. at 44-45, 619 A.2d 186). The <em>Somerville </em>Court also stated that \u201c[t]he broad discretion reserved to the trial judge in such circumstances has been consistently reiterated in decision of this Court.\u201d 410 U.S. at 462, 93 S.Ct. 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">In their treatise on MARYLAND CRIMINAL LAW: PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Chief Judge Gilbert and Judge Moylan provide the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">When the mistrial has been declared by the judge <em>sua sponte </em>or has been granted by the judge at the request of the State without the acquiescence of the defendant, the manifest necessity requirement applies. The hung jury, inflammatory publicity contaminating the jury in either direction, prolonged sickness of judge or counsel, the movements of an army in time of war \u2014 all of these have been held to constitute manifest necessity. The animating principle clearly is that since we are protecting the right of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>defendant to have the tribunal held together until a verdict is reached, all alternatives less drastic than the declaration of a mistrial should at least be considered before the more drastic step is taken. Consideration at least should be given to such alternatives as a jury of less than twelve, if one of the jurors is suddenly unavailable and no alternate juror is present; postponement, in case of sickness of brief duration; curative instructions, in case of improper comment or improper introduction of evidence. The Supreme Court has dealt with this problem on a number of occasions and has, generally speaking, been liberal in finding that there was manifest necessity for the declaration of a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Gilbert &amp; Moylan, \u00a7 37.7, at 447 (footnote, citing seven Supreme Court cases, omitted). We shall therefore apply the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard as we review the issue of whether there was a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In <em>Gray v. State, </em>388 Md. 366, 879 A.2d 1064 (2005), the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">We will only reverse a trial court\u2019s discretionary act if we find that the court has abused its discretion. As noted by this Court in <em>Dehn v. Edgecombe, </em>384 Md. 606, 865 A.2d 603 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">\u201c \u2018Abuse of discretion\u2019 is one of those very general, amorphous terms that appellate courts use and apply with great frequency but which they have defined in many different ways.... [A] ruling reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling. The decision under consideration has to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable. That kind of distance can arise in a number of ways, among which are that the ruling either does not logically follow from the findings upon which it supposedly rests or has no reasonable relationship to its announced objective. That, we think, is included within the notion of \u2018untenable grounds,\u2019 \u2018violative of fact and logic,\u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\u2018against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dehn v. Edgecombe, </em>384 Md. at 628, 865 A.2d at 616 quoting <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 13-14, 648 A.2d 1025, 1031-1032 (1994).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 383-84, 879 A.2d 1064.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In <em>Hart v. Miller, </em>65 Md.App. 620, 501 A.2d 872 (1985), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">Discretion signifies choice. Consideration of the various elements of the problem does not preordain a single permissible conclusion.... Failure to exercise choice in a situation calling for choice is an abuse of discretion, because it assumes the existence of a rule that admits of but one answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 627, 501 A.2d 872 (citations omitted). In <em>Metheny v. State, </em>359 Md. 576, 755 A.2d 1088 (2000), the Court of Appeals stated: \u201cThere is an abuse of discretion <em>\u2018where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court\u2019.... In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 8598, </em>347 Md. 295, 312, 701 A.2d 110, 118 (1997) (citations omitted)(emphasis added).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604, 755 A.2d 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">When applying the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard of review, this Court is required to affirm a discretionary ruling of the circuit court even though each appellate judge on the argument panel would have ruled differently if he or she had been serving as the trial judge in the case being reviewed. For example, in <em>Thodos v. Bland, </em>75 Md.App. 700, 542 A.2d 1307 (1988), although each member of the panel \u201cwould have unhesitatingly granted\u201d the appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the panel nonetheless affirmed the judgment that followed the denial of that motion. This Court was required to do so because the panel was \u201cunable to rationalize a basis for finding that the trial judge abused his discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 717, 542 A.2d 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">If any of the judges on this panel were serving as the trial judge in the case at bar, he would not have granted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>mistrial. One member of the panel is persuaded that, because the State had no right to \u201crehabilitate\u201d Rogers by establishing that she had made an impermissively suggestive extrajudicial identification of Earl, the circuit court should simply have prevented the prosecutor from inquiring about this identification during Rogers\u2019 redirect examination (unless, of course, Earl\u2019s counsel had \u201copened the door\u201d to such testimony). One member of the panel is persuaded that the circuit court should have \u201csevered\u201d the cases rather than declare a mistrial as to both appellants. Under the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard of review, however, it is of no consequence that a member of this panel would have taken a different approach to the problem presented in the case at bar. To paraphrase what this Court stated in <em>Ramia v. </em>State, 57 Md.App. 654, 658, 471 A.2d 1064 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">A close question of [\u201cmanifest necessity\u201d] might be submitted to twenty fair and knowledgeable judges with ten finding one way and ten finding the opposite way and none of them being unreasonable or clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In the words of the circuit court, it was faced with a \u201cHobson\u2019s choice.\u201d The record shows that the circuit court expressly considered (1) the issue of whether a manifest necessity existed under the circumstances, (2) the various potential alternatives to the declaration of a mistrial, (3) each defendant\u2019s interest in having \u201cthe tribunal held together,\u201d and (4) each defendant\u2019s potential exposure to unfair prejudice resulting from whatever relief would be granted to the other defendant. Under these circumstances, it simply was not \u201cwell removed from any center mark\u201d to conclude that there was a manifest necessity for a mistrial because (1) Hubbard\u2019s right of confrontation was on a collision course with Earl\u2019s right to the exclusion of evidence that he had been identified by Rogers as one of the perpetrators, and (2) in light of what they had been told in opening statements, the jurors might well be unable to focus upon the case against the remaining defendant without being somehow affected by learning that they would not be called upon to decide the charges against the defendant whose case was severed. For these reasons, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>are persuaded that neither appellant is entitled to a dismissal on the ground of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">DENIALS OF MOTIONS TO DISMISS AFFIRMED; CASES REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; EACH APPELLANT TO PAY 50% OF THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-8\">.
