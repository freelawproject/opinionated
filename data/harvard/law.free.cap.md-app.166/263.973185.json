Aggrieved at the financial aspects of the judgment, John Richards has noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Appellant has presented for our review three assignments of error, which, as recast, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">I. Whether the circuit court erred in its determination of the monetary award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">II. Whether the circuit court erred in reserving alimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">III. Whether the circuit court erred in its award of counsel fees to appellee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">Finding neither error nor abuse of discretion, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AcHE\">The Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">Appellant and appellee were married on September 21, 1986. The judgment of divorce was entered on April 14, 2004. No children were born of the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">During the marriage, John Richards was employed by the federal government, earning, at the time of this litigation, approximately $100,000 per year. His health is unremarkable. Donna Richards, 60 years of age at the time of trial, also worked for the federal government during the marriage. Her health, in contrast to appellant\u2019s, is fragile. In April 1990, she suffered an on-the-job injury and has been rated as disabled. In addition to her physical disability, she has a history of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>emotional instability. Unable to work since the injury, she receives benefits from Social Security, private disability insurance,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and worker\u2019s compensation. She is eligible to receive Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System (FERS) benefits. The current benefits provide her with a total monthly income of approximately $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The Property</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\n<em>Mrs. Goldberg</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">This litigation brings into play certain property and assets of appellee\u2019s mother, Celia Goldberg. In 1994, Mrs. Goldberg established a revocable trust into which she placed most of her assets. Donna Richards is a co-trustee. Mrs. Goldberg also established two bank accounts: an interest-bearing checking account at the Bank of America in Florida, and a savings account at the Torrington Savings Bank in Connecticut. In creating the accounts, Mrs. Goldberg named both John and Donna Richards as joint tenants with rights of survivorship.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">In 1998, Mrs. Goldberg entered an assisted living home. As her health deteriorated, appellant and appellee assumed a larger role in managing her financial affairs. In 1998, they consolidated her various banking and brokerage accounts, held in the trust, into one Schwab One Account. Appellee, as co-trustee, had check signing authority over this account. During Mrs. Goldberg\u2019s lifetime, checks were made payable to appellant on various occasions from the account.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Many checks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>from that account, payable to John Richards, were deposited into the parties\u2019 joint checking account.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Mrs. Goldberg died in 2000. In accord with her will, Donna Richards qualified as the executor. By way of disposition, the will created a testamentary trust, of which Donna Richards and her brother, Mrs. Goldberg\u2019s only other heir, were named as co-trustees. The will was silent as to John Richards. Her United States Estate Tax return designated as \u201cjoint\u201d the two bank accounts as to which appellant and appellee were the survivors.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\n<em>The Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Appellant states in his brief that, during the marriage, he and appellee \u201cco-mingled and merged all of their financial assets so that most of the assets were joint.\u201d Appellee concedes the point and further claims that appellant \u201cwielded total control\u201d over the parties\u2019 finances.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Shortly after the death of Mrs. Goldberg, the parties opened a joint Schwab One Account with the rights of survivorship. The initial deposit of $110,000 was made with funds from Mrs. Goldberg\u2019s Bank of America and Torrington accounts (respectively, $85,000 and $25,000). On the same day, appellee opened an individual Schwab One Account. Her initial deposit of $34,838.63 came from inherited funds. Appellee designated appellant as her attorney in fact with authority to draw from the account. On numerous occasions, checks payable to appellant were drawn on the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">In 2001, the parties purchased real estate in Reno, Nevada, the source of funds being the joint Schwab One Account. Appellant testified that those funds came through Mrs. Goldberg\u2019s estate. Appellant also claims that he contributed $40,232.40 from his premarital Schwab Account into the joint account. The circuit court determined the Nevada property to be marital.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>In 2002, appellant removed about $100,000 from the joint Schwab One Account \u2014 one-half of the account balance at the time. At the time of trial, appellant had approximately $30,000 of that amount remaining in his individual Schwab One Account. The circuit court found those funds to be appellee\u2019s non-marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">We shall address additional facts as necessary for context.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Suit was filed by appellant on February 6, 2003. Appellee filed a counter-complaint for absolute divorce, seeking alimony, a monetary award, and other relief, including counsel fees. Soon thereafter, the parties filed a joint statement concerning marital property, pursuant to Md. Rule 9-207.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Trial was held on March 29 and 30, 2004, and judgment was entered on April 14, 2004. Relevant to the issues in this appeal, the court ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">ORDERED that [appellee\u2019s] request for an award of alimony is hereby reserved, and it is further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">ORDERED that the real property located in Reno, Nevada is determined to be marital property, and said property shall be sold and the net proceeds of sale divided equally between the parties, and it is further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-12\">ORDERED that [appellant] shall pay to [appellee] the sum of $105,000 as an adjustment of the equities of the parties in the Reno, Nevada real property, and it is further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-13\">ORDERED that the Schwab One account titled in [appellant\u2019s] name is determined to be [appellee\u2019s] non-marital property, with a value of $30,000, and it is further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-14\">ORDERED that a monetary award is hereby granted in favor of [appellee], and against [appellant] in the amount of $207,290 as an adjustment of the equities of the parties in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>and to the marital property listed on Schedule A, the Reno, Nevada real property, and the Schwab One account, and it is further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">ORDERED that a judgment is hereby entered in favor of [appellee] and against [appellant] in the amount of $207,290, and it is further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">ORDERED that [appellant] shall pay to [appellee] as a contribution toward her attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with this proceeding the sum of $17,000, and it is further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">ORDERED that a judgment is hereby entered in favor of [the law firm representing appellee] in the amount of $17,000[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">Appellant filed his timely Notice of Appeal on May 7, 2004.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">\n<em>I. Whether the circuit court erred in its determination of the monetary award.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">We hold, for three reasons, that the circuit court appropriately granted appellee a monetary award in the amount of $207,290. First, the court correctly found that the $30,000 contained in appellant\u2019s individual Schwab One Account was appellee\u2019s non-marital property. Second, the court exercised proper discretion when it adjusted the parties\u2019 equities in the Nevada property and other marital property. Finally, the court articulated its consideration of the requisite statutory factors in granting a monetary award.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">In our review of the monetary award, we shall apply two standards of review. First, we utilize the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard to the court\u2019s determination of what is, and what is not, marital property because \u201c[o]rdinarily, it is a question of fact as to whether all or a portion of an asset is marital or non-marital property.\u201d <em>Innerbichler v. Innerbi-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>chler, </em>132 Md.App. 207, 229, 752 A.2d 291 (2000); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 8-131(c). Factual findings that are supported by substantial evidence are not clearly erroneous. <em>Collins v. Collins, </em>144 Md.App. 395, 409, 798 A.2d 1155 (2002). Second, as to the court\u2019s decision to grant a monetary award, and the amount thereof, we apply an abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gallagher v. Gallagher, </em>118 Md.App. 567, 576, 703 A.2d 850 (1997). Within that context, \u201cwe may not substitute our judgment for that of the fact finder, even if we might have reached a different result.\u201d <em>Innerbichler, supra, </em>132 Md.App. at 230, 752 A.2d 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The court granted appellee a monetary award in the amount of $207,290. That amount is composed of: (1) $30,000 (the monies in appellant\u2019s individual Schwab One Account, which the court determined to be non-marital property of appellee); (2) $105,000 (the \u201cadjustment of the equities\u201d of the parties in the Nevada Property); and (3) a marital property adjustment in the amount of $72,290. Appellant challenges two aspects of the monetary award: the $30,000 Schwab One Account and the adjustment of equities in the Nevada real estate. We discuss the pertinent law and proceed to appellant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Monetary Award</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">When a party seeks a monetary award, the court must follow a three step procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">First, for each disputed item of property, the court must determine whether it is marital or non-marital. Second, the court must determine the value of all marital property. Third, the court must determine if the division of marital property according to title will be unfair; if so, the court may make an award to rectify the inequity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-9\"><em>Collins, supra, </em>144 Md.App. at 409, 798 A.2d 1155 (internal citations omitted) (citing <em>Doser v. Doser, </em>106 Md.App. 329, 349-50, 664 A.2d 453 (1995)); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule \u00a7\u00a7 8-203, 8-204, 8-205. Appellant\u2019s challenges on appeal require us only to examine the first and third step of this procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>As to the first step, classification of the property as marital or non-marital, we observe that section 8 \u2014 201(e)(1) of the Family Law Article of the Maryland Annotated Code defines \u201cmarital property\u201d as \u201cproperty, however titled, acquired by 1 or both parties during the marriage.\u201d This includes \u201cany interest in real property held by the parties as tenants by the entirety unless the real property is excluded by valid agreement.\u201d \u00a7 8 \u2014 201(e)(2). Pursuant to section 8 \u2014 201(e)(3), however, marital property does not include property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">(i) acquired before the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">(ii) acquired by inheritance or gift from a third party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">(iii) excluded by valid agreement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">(iv) directly traceable to any of these sources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">After a court has determined the nature of property and the value thereof, it must proceed to the third step of the procedure: rectifying the inequities, if any. In addressing step three, the court shall consider section 8-205 of the Family Law Article of the Maryland Annotated Code.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">(a) <em>Grant of Award. </em>\u2014 Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, after the court determines which property is marital property, and the value of the marital property, the court may ... grant a monetary award ... as an adjustment of the equities and rights of the parties concerning marital property, whether or not alimony is awarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">(b) <em>Factors in determining amount and method of payment or terms of transfer. </em>\u2014 The court shall determine the amount and the method of payment of a monetary award ... after considering each of the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\">(1) the contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-13\">(2) the value of all property interests of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-14\">(3) the economic circumstances of each party at the time the award is to be made;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-15\">(4) the circumstances that contributed to the estrangement of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>(5) the duration of the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">(6) the age of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">(7) the physical and mental condition of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">(8) how and when specific marital property or interest in the pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan, was acquired, including the effort expended by each party in accumulating the marital property or the interest in the pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan, or both;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">(9) the contribution by either party of property described in \u00a7 8 \u2014 201(e)(3) of this subtitle to the acquisition of real property held by the parties as tenants by the entirety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">(10) any award of alimony and any award or other provision that the court has made with respect to family use personal property or the family home; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">(11) any other factor that the court considers necessary or appropriate to consider in order to arrive at a fair and equitable monetary award or transfer of an interest in the pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law \u00a7 8-205(a)-(b) (Repl.Vol.1999 &amp; Supp.2004) (alterations added). The court shall articulate that it has considered all the factors when granting (or denying) a monetary award request. <em>See Imagnu v. Wodajo, </em>85 Md.App. 208, 582 A.2d 590 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">As we have noted, the monetary award to appellee was an effort to achieve an \u201cadjustment of the equities,\u201d relating to appellant\u2019s individual Schwab One Account and the Nevada real estate. We address each item in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">\n<em>Appellant\u2019s Individual Schwab One Account</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b296-14\">The evolution of appellant\u2019s individual Schwab One Account is as follows. Mrs. Goldberg established two bank accounts (Bank of America and Torrington). As her health deteriorated, Mrs. Goldberg sought the assistance of the parties in managing her financial affairs. In what the circuit court found to be an accommodation to facilitate their care of her, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Mrs. Goldberg added the names of appellant and appellee as joint tenants of the two accounts, with the right of survivor-ship.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following the death of Mrs. Goldberg, creating their entitlement to the proceeds of the accounts, the parties consolidated the accounts into a joint Schwab One Account. The parties were joint owners of the consolidated account.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Later, for some reason not fully clear from the record, the parties placed the funds remaining in the consolidated account into a second joint Schwab One Account. Appellant acknowledges that these funds originated from Mrs. Goldberg\u2019s consolidated account. In addition, appellant made one deposit to that account of non-marital funds in the amount of about $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">In October 2002, the funds in the joint Schwab One Account approximated $200,000. Appellant, prior to the divorce, withdrew one-half of that balance and placed it into an individual Schwab One Account titled in his name only. At the time of trial, $30,000 remained in appellant\u2019s sole account.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The court determined the $30,000 to be appellee\u2019s non-marital property, even though it was in an account titled only to appellant. Implicit in the court\u2019s conclusion, and supported by the record, is the finding that the $30,000 was the residue of Mrs. Goldberg\u2019s funds, from the accommodation bank accounts. The evidence supports that finding because (1) Mrs. Goldberg did not make a gift to appellant; and (2) appellant did not inherit from Mrs. Goldberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Appellant contends that \u201c[a]ny remaining assets of Appellant after splitting the remainder of the Joint Schwab One account cannot be traced to any non-marital source.\u201d In support of this contention, appellant asserts that \u201cdirect tracing of Appellee\u2019s inheritance and gifts from her mother was not possible due to the commingling of assets in the joint Schwab One account. In addition, Appellee did not meet her burden of proof regarding the jointly titled bank accounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>being gifts solely to her and not to her and appellant, either individually or jointly.\u201d Appellant\u2019s contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The trial court was able to trace the evolution of the $30,000 balance, which arose substantially from Mrs. Goldberg\u2019s accounts. The fact of appellant\u2019s one-time contribution to the account, although substantial, does not defeat the court\u2019s ability to trace.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, in <em>Noffsinger v. Noffsinger, </em>95 Md.App. 265, 620 A.2d 415 (1993), this Court has said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arn\">the mere fact that non-marital funds rested in the same account as marital funds does not compel the conclusion that the funds commingled. <em>See e.g. Melrod [v. Melrod </em>], 83 Md.App. [180], at 188, 574 A.2d 1 [ (1990) ] (only when the spouse chooses to commingle marital and nonmarital funds to the point that direct tracing is impossible does his or her property lose its nonmarital status).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">95 Md.App., at 284, 620 A.2d 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">In <em>Noffsinger, </em>Judge Bloom also pointed out that \u201c[T]he party seeking to demonstrate that particular property acquired during the marriage is nonmarital must trace the property to a nonmarital source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283, 620 A.2d 415. In the matter before us, the trial court was satisfied, as are we, that appellant did not meet his tracing burden. Because we do not find the trial court\u2019s factual findings on the tracing issue to have been clearly erroneous, we will not disturb the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Appellant also suggests that the court\u2019s marital property determination is undermined by the fact that Mrs. Goldberg made gifts to him of the funds at issue. The evidence does not support his assertion. He produced no evidence to show gifts from his mother-in-law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In Maryland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>one who asserts the status of donee bears the burden to demonstrate \u201c(1) donative intent [on the part of the donor]; (2) actual delivery by donor; and (3) acceptance by the donee.\u201d <em>Fantle v. Fantle, </em>140 Md.App. 678, 689, 782 A.2d 377 (2001) (alterations added) (citing <em>Dorsey v. Dorsey, </em>302 Md. 312, 318, 487 A.2d 1181 (1985)). Appellant is not able to satisfy any of those elements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\n<em>Adjustment of the Equities in the Nevada Property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ak_\">Appellant also takes exception to the circuit court\u2019s adjustment of the equities in the Nevada real property. In support of his argument that the property was improperly included in the monetary award calculation, appellant claims that the funds used to acquire it were marital, that is, from the parties\u2019 joint Schwab One Account. He adds that the joint Schwab One Account was built with the funds from Mrs. Goldberg\u2019s two accounts, appellee\u2019s inherited funds, and contributions from each party\u2019s individual Schwab One Accounts. As a result, he posits, the funds are commingled, and direct tracing is impos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>sible. Appellant, moreover, suggests that the court\u2019s adjustment reveals its intent to award appellant the <em>full </em>value of the Nevada property, despite its marital classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">We affirm the circuit court\u2019s determination that the Nevada property is marital property. This determination is supported by the record. The property was acquired during the marriage of the parties, essentially by the use of funds from their joint Schwab One Account.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That account consisted <em>substantially </em>of appellee\u2019s inherited funds; thus, a <em>substantial </em>amount of appellee\u2019s funds were contributed to the purchase of the property. After ordering the Nevada property sold, and the proceeds equally apportioned, the court made an equitable adjustment in the amount of $105,000 to reflect the contribution of appellee\u2019s inherited funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We find no abuse of the court\u2019s discretion in the equitable adjustment, and recall that Maryland law requires \u201cequitable\u201d not \u201cequal\u201d division of property once it is determined to be marital in nature. <em>See Alston v. Alston, </em>331 Md. 496, 508, 629 A.2d 70 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\n<em>Statutory Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">In his third, and final, attack on the monetary award, appellant argues that the circuit court failed to consider all of the enumerated factors in section 8-205 of the Family Law Article of the Maryland Annotated Code. Our review of the record discloses no such failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">The circuit court, with reference to the parties\u2019 Rule 9-207 joint statement, appropriately followed the three step process in arriving at the monetary award. The court first determined the nature of all property, marital or non-marital, and then determined the property value. Finally, the court entered a monetary award as an adjustment of the equities of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the parties. We find neither error nor abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s process or ultimate finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\n<em>II. Whether the circuit court erred in reserving alimony.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Among Donna Richards\u2019s prayers for relief in her counter complaint was a claim for indefinite alimony. The circuit court, rather than awarding alimony, reserved on appellee\u2019s request. The reservation, appellant argues, was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Specifically, appellant contends that appellee, presently self-sufficient, will not experience future negative financial circumstances. He points to appellee\u2019s entitlement to Social Security, worker\u2019s compensation, disability benefits, and, later, permanent retirement benefits. He asserts that \u201cappellee ... was left with substantial assets which, even if equally divided, leaves her in the same or better position than appellant going into retirement. No need for alimony could have been foreseeable.\u201d Finally, appellant argues that the court\u2019s reservation of alimony is unsupported by the evidence. We find no merit in appellant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">In reserving on appellee\u2019s request for alimony, the circuit court stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">THE COURT: ... And her income, including all of the checks she\u2019s presently receiving, is substantially less that what Mr. Richards\u2019 income is.

We can argue his expenses (inaudible) she\u2019s living a lavish lifestyle, she\u2019s not. But she is going to have some funds available to her to meet her needs. And at the present time she\u2019s doing okay, but if her worker\u2019s compensation ends and the disability is going to end in five years\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>[APPELLANT]: One component, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">THE COURT: She\u2019ll be left with social security and whatever retirement she has\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">[APPELLANT]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">THE COURT: \u2014 earned which at that point may not be enough to meet her needs, I don\u2019t know. And the whole idea of reserving alimony is still possible, but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s done a lot anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">But I would have to make a finding that if this was simply about incomes, the income of the [appellant] and the income of the [appellee], based on the length of their marriage and all of the factors in the alimony statute, I would award [appellee] alimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">She certainly qualifies for alimony if you just apply the principles of income and expense. But considering all of the factors which in (inaudible) include a fact that [appellant], I mean I guess relatively soon, he\u2019s going to retire\u2014 [APPELLANT]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">THE COURT: \u2014 himself, so his income will be what his retirement is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">[APPELLANT]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-12\">THE COURT: And at the present time [appellee] is doing okay by her worker\u2019s compensation, and I don\u2019t really know how to fashion an order to accommodate a reduction in the event her reduction from his retirement equal [sic] to what she is receiving from worker\u2019s compensation, I\u2019m not sure, I don\u2019t think you can do that either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-13\">But, I think its appropriate under these circumstances to reserve the issue of alimony for some future date</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">The Court of Appeals has stated that \u201c[t]he circuit courts have ... inherent power ... to reserve as to alimony.\u201d <em>Turrisi v. Sanzaro, </em>308 Md. 515, 526, 520 A.2d 1080 (1987) (alteration added). Indeed, \u201c[t]he Alimony act [Title 11 of the Family Law Article to the Maryland Annotated Code] has not abolished the inherent power of an equity court to reserve jurisdiction as to alimony when it awards a divorce.\u201d <em>Turrisi, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>supra, </em>308 Md. at 528, 520 A.2d 1080. This power, as observed by the Court, is a \u201cdiscretionary\u201d one. <em>Turrisi, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Nonetheless, the court should not exercise this discretionary power in every case before it. <em>Collins, supra, </em>144 Md.App. 395, 430, 798 A.2d 1155. Specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">Reserving jurisdiction over the issue of alimony is not an abuse of discretion when the facts at trial \u201cshow that a highly probable basis for awarding [either rehabilitative or indefinite alimony] will exist in the immediate future.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-7\"><em>Francz v. Francz, </em>157 Md.App. 676, 694, 853 A.2d 839 (2004) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Turrisi, supra, </em>308 Md. at 530, 520 A.2d 1080). Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">it is improper for a court to reserve deciding the issue of alimony \u201csimply because there may be some vague future expectation of circumstances that might show a basis for alimony\u201d, or \u201cthe possibility that the [alimony] claimant might become aged, infirm, or disabled, or that standards of living could conceivably be unconscionably disparate at some unknown future date.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\"><em>Francz, supra, </em>157 Md.App. at 694, 853 A.2d 839 (quoting <em>Turrisi, supra, </em>308 Md. at 529, 520 A.2d 1080.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">The authority to award alimony to a divorcing spouse is provided in Title 11 of the Family Law Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, \u00a7\u00a7 11-101 <em>et seq. </em>(the Alimony Act). Section ll-106(a)-(c) sets forth the procedure for the determination of amount and duration of an award of alimony. While section 11-106(a) grants discretion to the court to determine the amount and duration of an alimony award, section 11-106(b) specifies certain statutory factors which the court must consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">(b) <em>Required Considerations. </em>\u2014 In making the determination, the court shall consider all the factors necessary for a fair and equitable award, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-12\">(1) the ability of the party seeking alimony to be wholly or partly self-supporting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>(2) the time necessary for the party seeking alimony to gain sufficient education or training to enable that party to find suitable employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">(3) the standard of living that the parties established during their marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">(4) the duration of the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">(5) the contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">(6) the circumstances that contributed to the estrangement of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">(7) the age of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-10\">(8) the physical and mental condition of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-11\">(9) the ability of the party from whom alimony is sought to meet that party\u2019s needs while meeting the needs of the party seeking alimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-12\">(10) any agreement between the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-13\">(11) the financial needs and financial resources of each party, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-14\">(i) all income and assets, including property that does not produce income;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-15\">(ii) any award made under \u00a7\u00a7 8-205 and 8-208 of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-16\">(iii) the nature and amount of the financial obligations of each party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-17\">(iv) the right of each party to receive entitlement benefits; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-18\">(12) whether the award would cause a spouse who is a resident of a related institution as defined in \u00a7 19-301 of the Health-General Article and from whom alimony is sought to become eligible for medical assistance earlier than would otherwise occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-19\">The court may make an award of rehabilitative or indefinite alimony. In addressing whether the latter award is appropriate, section ll-106(c) prescribes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-1\">(c) <em>Award for indefinite period. </em>\u2014 The court may award alimony for an indefinite period, if the court finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>(1) due to age, illness, infirmity, or disability, the party seeking alimony cannot be expected to make substantial progress toward becoming self-supporting; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">(2) even after the party seeking alimony will have made as much progress toward becoming self-supporting as can reasonably be expected, the respective standards of living of the parties will be unconscionably disparate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">As we recall the record on the issue of alimony, we recall that appellant is in good health and fully and gainfully employed. Appellee, in contrast, is 60 years of age, physically disabled, with a history of emotional illness as well, and unable to be employed. The state of her health, in the future, is uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">We are satisfied that the evidence before the circuit court established more than \u201csome vague future circumstance\u201d or \u201cthe possibility that [appellee] might become aged, infirm, or disabled.\u201d Indeed, the evidence is sufficient to \u201cshow that a highly probable basis for awarding [alimony] will exist in the immediate future.\u201d We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\n<em>III. Whether the circuit court erred in its awarding of counsel fees to appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Lastly, appellant contends that the circuit court erred in ordering him to contribute $17,000 toward appellee\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees. Specifically, he asserts that the court failed to consider the financial resources of each party or their financial needs, as required by Fam. Law \u00a7 8-214. Moreover, appellant contends that the court failed to take into account, in considering counsel fees, the \u201clarge\u201d monetary award; that appellee is in a financial position to afford her own attorney\u2019s fees; that appellee failed to meet her burden of proof to support her claim for fees; and that appellee offered no credible evidence as to the reasonableness of the fees. Indeed, appellant contends that there is nothing in the record that reflects any consideration by the court as to the reasonableness of the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, appellee testified as to the fees incurred in defending the divorce action, and in prosecuting her counter-complaint. Her counsel\u2019s fee statements were introduced and reviewed by the court. Moreover, the court was in the best position to observe the quality and quantity of legal services provided to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Section 8-214 of the Family Law Article provides for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees in divorce actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">\u00a7 8-214. Award of reasonable and necessary expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">(a) <em>Definition. </em>In this section, \u201creasonable and necessary expense\u201d includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">(1) suit money;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">(2) counsel fees; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">(3) costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-11\">(b) <em>Award authorized. </em>At any point in the proceeding under this subtitle, the court may order either party to pay to the other party an amount for the reasonable and necessary expense of prosecuting for the reasonable and necessary expenses of prosecuting or defending the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-12\">(c) <em>Considerations by court. </em>Before ordering the payment, the court shall consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-13\">(1) the financial resources and financial needs of both parties; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-14\">(2) whether there was substantial justification for prosecuting or defending the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-15\">(d) <em>Lack of substantial justification and good cause. </em>Upon a finding by the court that there was an absence of substantial justification of a party for prosecuting or defending the proceeding, and absent a finding by the court of good cause to the contrary, the court shall</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-16\">award to the other party the reasonable and necessary expense for prosecuting or defending the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-17\">(f) <em>Counsel fees. </em>As to any amount awarded for counsel fees, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>(1) order that the amount awarded be paid directly to the lawyer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">(2) enter judgment in favor of the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law Art. \u00a7 8-214(a)-(f) (1999 Repl. Vol &amp; 2004 Supp.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">An award of attorney\u2019s fees rests in the court\u2019s sound discretion. We will not disturb an award absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>McCleary v. McCleary, </em>150 Md.App. 448, 466, 822 A.2d 460 (2002). In awarding counsel fees, the circuit court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">THE COURT: Okay, and as far as the requests for attorney\u2019s fees are concerned, I have considered the provisions of Family Law Article 8-214.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">Excuse me ... and with regard to attorney\u2019s fees, I believe under all the circumstances in this case, particularly the finding I\u2019ve made that the assertion made by [appellant] that the funds previously belonging to Mrs. Goldberg had been gifted to him were not justified, that it would be reasonable and appropriate under all of these circumstances, considering the result and the amount of effort made and the hours spent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">And then a fee of $17,000 will be (inaudible) judgement [sic] in favor of your law firm, [counsel for appellee] against [appellant] for that amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">We are satisfied that the trial court adequately followed the guidelines set forth in section 8-214. Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED; COSTS ASSESSED TO APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\">. This benefit, currently $947.00 each month, will cease when appellee reaches the age of 65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-10\">. The record demonstrates numerous checks made payable to appellant through the Bank of America accounts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b290-11\">. Of course, the parties disagree as to the reasons for these checks. Appellant asserts they were \"reimbursements\u201d for his services to Mrs. Goldberg\u2019s estate and for other expenses relating to the care of Mrs. Goldberg. Appellee asserts that appellant was simply milking an inheritance away from her, as is evident, she claims, through his dominant stance over the parties\u2019 financial matters. The record demonstrates that numerous checks were made payable to appellant from Mrs. Goldberg\u2019s consolidated Schwab One Account. (8/20/00, $10,000; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>2/19/01, $2,993.55; 3/4/01, $5,505.82; 4/8/01, $2,610.69; 4/8/01, $11,523.50; 5/2/01, $4,380.25; 6/17/01, $9,505.33; 6/17/01, $266.56; 7/17/01, $1,710.97; 8/15/01, $4,417.30; 8/28/01, $1,553.90.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b297-9\">. Indeed, the circuit court found that Mrs. Goldberg took this action for the sake of convenience in the management of her affairs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b298-9\">. We also note here that, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, the circuit court did consider this contribution when granting appellee the monetary award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b298-10\">. Appellant argues that appellee had the burden to establish that the funds from her mother were in fact gifted to her. First, the record refutes this argument as appellee is named as one of the primary heirs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>in Mrs. Goldberg\u2019s will. Second, Mrs. Goldberg, at no time, mentions appellant in her will. Appellant relies solely on the assertion that because he was listed with the right of survivorship over the accounts he automatically is entitled to his marital share of those accounts. We believe that had Mrs. Goldberg intended these accounts, or any portion thereof, to pass to appellant, she would have accounted for that in her Will.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\">. The concept of a gift is even more strained when John Richards's admitted poor relationship with Mrs. Goldberg is taken into account. He had been quoted as referring to Mrs. Goldberg as \u201ca Jewish bitch\u201d and a \u201chorrible person.\u201d On cross-examination, the following discussion ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">Q.

Nope, not at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-12\">Q. This is the woman you got all this money from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-13\">A.
