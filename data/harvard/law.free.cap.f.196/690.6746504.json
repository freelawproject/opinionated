This provision confers an authority on the Commission which may be exercised on its own motion or on the motion of other parties. It confers an authority, instead of a remedy. The remedy of railroad companies for errors of the Commission is conferred on them by section 6 of the act of 19.07 authorizing suits against it within thirty days after its entry of a final order in a court of competent jurisdiction in any county of the state in which they operate. Special provisions which are 'not applicable to the present case are made in section 3. It is nowhere provided that a party shall ask for a rehearing by the Commission previous to the institution of a suit against it, and error could not be predicated on the failure of a party to ask for such rehearing. Nothing of that sort was really decided in Railway v. Commission (Ind.) 95 N. 10. 364. The original \u201chearing\u201d was by the favor of the Commission. While the provisions of section 6 are broad enough to authorize suits in the federal courts, their jurisdiction is not derived from these provisions and exists independently of them. Reagan v.

Nothing in the pleadings or evidence in the present case has indicated a desire or willingness on the part of the Commission to reconsider its order concerning locomotive headlights. On the contrary, it has produced evidence for the purpose of showing that its order is entirely sufficient and proper. But, after the evidence was closed and upon the argument, it was urged on behalf of the Commission that the complainant should not have a decree because it had not asked for a rehearing, and the rule of comity is invoked in support of that contention. If comity requires that a party shall ask for a rehearing by the Commission before the institution of a suit in a federal court of equity, it may also require that a party shall seek access to such a court only through the highest court of the state upon a writ of error from the Supreme Court of the United States and be thereby deprived of the constitutional and legal right to a hearing upon the merits in a federal court of original jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b708-5\">As a conclusion of law from these facts, I find and report that it was not the duty of the complainant to ask for a rehearing by the Commission before the institution of the present suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b708-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> 2. The order of the Commission requires that all locomotive engines used in the transportation of trains over railroads in the state of Indiana shall be equipped \u201cwith headlights of not less than fifteen hundred (1500) candle power,\u201d and provides that it shall not apply to locomotives r\u00e9gularly used in the switching of cars or trains. \u201cCandle power\u201d-is a term which is used in the measurement of light, and has a definite and certain meaning. The unit of measurement is a standard candle or lamp constructed in accordance with specific requirements which are generally accepted and understood by all persons who are acquainted with the science of photometry. An equivalent of such candle or lamp, or a substitute for it, is furnished by an incandescent light of one candle power which is used as a secondary standard in photometric tests and measurements. As indicated by the origin and definition of the term, it applies exclusively to the initial source of light\u2014 the power or intensity of it without extraneous aid of any sort. ' Locomotive headlights have an initial source of light, and they also have reflectors which gather and concentrate the rays of light that would otherwise be emitted from the source in all directions, and throw them forward upon the track and right of way. They serve as markers to indicate the head of a locomotive, and they illuminate the track and right of way in front of it. The term in one sense defines itself, for a locomotive headlight is a light at the head of a locomotive, and every light illuminates all objects within its range. If the words of the order are given their literal meaning, it requires all locomotives in the state, except such as are used in the switching of cars or trains, to be equipped with lights of not less than 1500 candle power at the head of them, which, with the aid of reflectors, would make an illumination like that of a naval searchlight.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b708-7\">It is contended by the solicitor for the Commission that such a headlight with an illumination which is far in excess of what is regarded as necessary could not have been intended by its order. But a locomotive headlight is a combination of an initial source of light with a reflector, both of which are essential and inseparable parts of it, and it may he described in the words of the solicitor for the Commission as an articulated whole. Such a combination, however, has not any candle power of its own as distinguished from the candle power of the initial source of light. It is not denied that the headlights in present use upon the locomotives of the complainant satisfy all the requirements of a marker and furnish some degree of illumination upon the track and right of way. AVhile the Commission admits that it is possible to have an excessive amount of illumination, it contends that the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>amount of illumination is insufficient for the protection ol' persons and property. The controversy between the parties is rather over the degree, and not the kind of illumination that should be furnished by a locomotive headlight.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b709-4\">Comparison of a source of light of unknown intensity with a known standard of light is made by the interposition of a photometric screen between the lights upon which their radiance is equalized, and the distance between the screen and each of the lights is then measured. The intensities of the lights are to one another as the squares of their respective distances from the screen in feet. The candle power of a source of light being ascertained, it is a constant quantity as long as the source of light is kept in proper condition, but the illumination from it diminishes according to the square of the distance in feet at which the illumination is measured. By the application of this rule and without the aid of a photometer the amount of illumination furnished by a source of light of known candle power at a given distance in any direction from <em>it is the </em>candle power <em>of the </em>source divided by the square of tlie distance in feet; the quotient being in foot candles or candle feet. Reflectors are not involved in (he production of a source of light. Radiation from the source is controlled by <em>them. The </em>shape <em>and </em>position, size, and quality of a reflector regulate the direction and spread and amount of illumination in front of the locomotive. Illumination upon a surface or screen is an effect of the source, and, while the source is measured in candle power, its effect at a given distance, with or without the aid of a reflector, is measurable in foot candles or candle feet, which, being multiplied by the square of the distance from the surface or screen, gives the <em>measurement </em>in apparent or equivalent candle power, or in the number of standard candles which would be necessary to produce the same amount of light at the given distance. There is <em>but one </em>light in a locomotive headlight, <em>and it </em>has a candle power of Its own. Placing a reflector behind it does not create another light, with a different candle power. The candle power of that original light without a reflector and the apparent or equivalent candle power of the illumination from it at any point of distance are necessarily the same, but the apparent or equivalent candle power of the illumination from a headlight varies at every point of distance according to the dimensions and use of the reflector. These variations are a demonstration of the fact that light thrown out by a reflector is wholly devoid of that constancy which is Hie primary and indispensable requisite of all candle power as a standard of measurement. The apparent or equivalent candle power of such a light is not an index of its candle power, because it evidently has none.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b709-5\">The difficulty of giving an intelligible meaning to the order of the Commission is not overcome by a substitution of \u201capparent or equivalent candle power\u201d for \u201ccandle power\u201d where these words occur in the order. Nothing in the order indicates the point at which the measurement should he made. Suggestions that the measurement should he made at any or every point on the axis of the beam, or at a point immediately in front of the case, or at the point of greatest illumination, indicate <em>only </em>that the point of measurement contemplated, by the order is absolutely indeterminable.

On other issues that have been considered in the hearing before me, I find and report as follows: General charge and supervision of railroads in the state of Indiana was given the Commission by the acts of 1905 and 1907. The act of 1909 authorizes and directs the Commission to make an investigation of the condition and efficiency of locomotive headlights used upon the railroads of the state for the purpose of ascertaining whether they are adequate for the protection of persons and property, and. if inadequate, to require a substitution of practicable and efficient' headlights upon such railroads. Substitution could not be required by the Commission if the head-, lights then in use were adequate for the protection of persons and property, and, if inadequate, the Commission was authorized and directed to require and enforce the substitution of the most practicable and efficient headlights for the promotion of these ends. Action by the Commission was unnecessary if persons and property were adequately protected by the headlights then in use, and, if action was necessary, it could be taken only under the limitations of the statute. In other words, the Legislature fixed a standard of practicability and efficiency for headlights. If the headlights then in use met the requirements of that standard, action by the Commission was not required. If action by the Commission was required, it was limited by the requirements of that standard. Buttfield v. Stranahan, 192 U. S. 470, 24 Sup. Ct. 349, 48 L. Ed. 525; Union Bridge Co. v. United States, 204 U. S. 364, 27 Sup. Ct. 367, 51 L. Ed. 523. The Commission acted in the present case merely as an administrative agency for giving effect to the will of the Legislature under limitations prescribed by the Legislature in the expression of its will. Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 12 Sup. Ct. 495, 36 L. Ed. 294.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b710-14\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> 4. The act of the Legislature was an exercise of the police power. It is not a regulation which applies to a particular locality, and it does not bear directly upon interstate commerce or invade a domain which has been already occupied by Congress under the provisions of the federal Constitution concerning such commerce. While Congress might occupy the ground which is covered by the legislation of the state and exclude such legislation, it has not enacted any laws on the subject, and by its failure to enact them has left the state free to enact laws which bear indirectly upon interstate commerce, as in the present case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b710-15\">It has not been contended before me that the act of 1909 or the order of the Commission under it is inconsistent with any power granted by the Constitution of the United States, or a violation of any right secured by that instrument. But it has been urged with great earnestness that the act and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>order are unreasonable, and that the reasonableness of The net and order is reviews ble by a court bavins jurisdiction of the parties and the subject-matter. Tlie order of the Commission, if within the powers which are conferred upon it. is entitled to the same respect as an act of the Legislature. Railroad v. Commission, 172 Inti. 113, 123, 87 N. E. 966. In a. rate ease it was held that the \u201cpresumption is that the rates fixed by the Commission are reasonable, and the burden of proof is upon the railroad company to show <em>the </em>contrary,\u201d and that rule applies to any order of a railroad commission. Railroad v. Minnesota, 186 TJ. S. 257, 264 , 22 Sup. Ct. 900, 903 (46 L. Ed. 1151). Neither (he wisdom nor the policy nor the expediency of the order of the Commission is reviewable by the courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b711-3\">It appears from the evidence that electric and acetylene headlights make a greater illumination over a greater distance on the track of a railroad than the oil headlights which are now used by the complainant; that enginemen behind electric and acetylene headlights are able to see farther ahead of the locomotive; that objects and obstructions on the track are sooner discernible by the enginemen; that they can reduce speed and lessen the force of an impact or collision where it cannot bo wholly avoided; that lives and property may be saved and personal injuries averted by the discovery of objects and obstructions on the track before they are discoverable with an oil headlight; that oil headlights have a more limited range of illumination; that electric or acetylene headlights can be seen at a greater distance from crossings by the public generally. It also appears from the evidence that trains are operated at night by signal lights of different colors at stations and along the tracks and rights of way; that the block system of manual and automatic signals is required by the Commission and used upon many railroads of the state; that classification signals of different colors are carried upon the sides of locomotives indicating the character of trains which follow them; that the safety of persons and property depends upon the correct reading of all signal lights; that headlights of a higher power than an oil headlight dazzle and blind enginemen in opposition to them; that signal lights are dimmed and obscured by the intense radiance which is thrown around them; that they are frequently made to give out by way of reflection false or phantom lights which do not correctly represent their real color or condition; that trains running at a high rate of speed cannot be stopped within the range of illumination from any headlight, and cannot make their schedule time if there is a frequent reduction of speed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b711-4\">The decision of the Supreme Court in Railroad v. Arkansas, 219 U. S. 453, 3:1 Sup. Ct. 275, 55 L. Ed. 290, which has been recently approved in a similar case from Indiana, in both of which statutes for the regulation of the size of \u201ccrews\u201d on passenger or freight trains were upheld, contains a statement of the rules which apply to the present case. 219 fj. S. 465, 466, 31 Sup. Ct. 278, 279 (55 L. Ed. 290). It was originally a proceeding against the railroad by the state for a violation of the Arkansas statute. The defense was as follows: \u2022\u2018Defendant states that its said train was equipped with automatic couplers and air brakes, so that the cars thereof could he coupled and uncoupled without the necessity of brakemen going between the cars, and could be stopped by the application of the air brakes by the engineer of said train without the intervention or assistance of the conductor or brakeman, as required by act of Congress and the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission made thereunder; that it had employed on said train a conductor and two brakemen, and that the employment of another brakeman on said, train was unnecessary, because there were no duties connected with the running and operating of said train to he performed by a third brakeman, and said act, in attempting to require the defendant <em>to </em>employ three brakemen on said train, attempted to require the defendant to expend a large amount of money for a useless and unnecessary purpose and to deprive the defendant of its property without due process of law, and is therefore a violation of and in conflict with section 1 of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\u201d There was a judgment for the state in the trial court which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Arkansas. 86 Ark. 412, 111 S. W. 456. The case went to the Supreme Court of tiie United States on the federal questions that were in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>volved in it. The whole case was not before the Supreme Court as it would have been if it had gone from a Circuit Court. Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 22 L. Ed. 429; Savings Society v. Dormitzer, 192 U. S. 125, 127, 128, 24 Sup. Ct. 221, 48 L. Ed. 373. Nevertheless the reasonableness of the statute which had been upheld by the Supreme Court of Arkansas was fully considered, and the judgment of that court was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States. What it says on that subject, even if not decisive of the present ease, has an important bearing upon it. The main controversy in the Arkansas ease was over the question whether the additional and apparently superfluous trainmen required by the statute were necessary for the safe operation of trains. If unnecessary, the statutory requirement would have been arbitrary and unreasonable. But, whether necessary and reasonable or not, the Supreme Court said that it is not \u201cso unreasonable as to justify the court in adjudging that it is merely an arbitrary exercise of power, and not germane to the objects which evidently the state Legislature had in view. It is a means employed by the state to accomplish an object which it is entitled to accomplish, and such means, even if deemed unwise, are not to be condemned or disregarded by the courts, if they have a real relation to that object.\u201d 1 Again, it says that, until Congress has established regulations on the subject, \u201cthe statutes of the state, not in their nature arbitrary, and which really relate to the rights and duties of all within the jurisdiction, must control.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b712-4\">The Railroad Commission of Indiana, under the authority and direction of the Legislature, made an investigation of locomotive headlights then in use, and found them inadequate for the protection of persons and property. It found that the oil headlights which were used by the complainant are defective because they do not throw sufficient light upon the track and illuminate it far enough ahead of the locomotives to meet the legislative requirements. It was not bound by the previous use of a headlight. It could enlarge the functions of a headlight, if necessary. It decided that headlights of a higher power were required and made an order to that effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b712-5\">There is much conflict in the testimony as to the difference in illuminative power of the various kinds of headlights in common use, but it is sufficiently established that the electric or acetylene headlights which are used on railroads in and out of the state have greater illuminative power than the oil headlights in common use. There is further conflict in the testimony as to the degree of peril and danger involved in the use of the different kinds of headlights. But, according to the decisions of the Supreme Court, it is for the Commission to weigh and determine all of these matters; provided always that it reaches a conclusion which is within constitutional and statutory limitations and is germane to the objects that the Legislature had in view, and has a real and substantial relation to those objects, and is not a purely arbitrary exercise of power. It is not for a court to review the facts upon which the order is founded any further than is necessary to ascertain whether the order is within the constitutional and statutory powers of the Commission. \u201cPower to make the order, and not the mere expediency or wisdom of having made it, is the question.\u201d Commission v. Railroad, 215 U. S. 452, 470, 30 Sup. Ct. 155, 160 (54 L.

If the ComMssion, after having investigated the subject, is of the opinion that ih more light upon the track there is greater safety, and gives expression and effect to that opinion by an order for headlights of a higher power than such as are now in use, it cannot be said that the order is wholly unconnected with the protection of persons and property which is the avowed purpose of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b712-7\">As a conclusion of law from th\u00e9se facts, I find and report that the act of 1909 is not a delegation of legislative power, and that the order of the Commission is not an arbitrary and-unreasonable exercise of power within the decisions of the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b712-8\">Calhoun, Lyford' &amp; Sheean, of Chicago, Ill., F.
