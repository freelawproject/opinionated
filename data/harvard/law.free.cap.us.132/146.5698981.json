The question was objected to by the defendant, and ruled out by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-5\">lie further testified that on April 19, 1882, when leaving Hot Springs on his return to Chicago, he went to the baggage-office and requested the baggage-master to check his baggage, and, on his asking to see the ticket, showed it to him, and he thereupon punched the ticket, checked the baggage, and gave him the checks for <em>it; </em>and also that the gateman asked to see the ticket, and he showed it to him, and then passed through the gate, and took his seat in the cars. This testimony was objected to by the defendant, on the ground that no statement or action of the baggage-master, or of the gateman, would constitute a waiver of any of the written conditions of the contract; and it was admitted by the court, subject to the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The plaintiff then testified that soon after leaving' Hot Springs the conductor, in taking the tickets of passengers, came to him, and, upon being shown his ticket, said it was not good, because he had failed-to have it stamped at Hot Springs; the plaintiff replied that the baggage-master, when checking his baggage, had said nothing to him about it, and he did not know it was necessary ; the conductor answered that he must either go back to Hot Springs and have the ticket stamped, or else pay full fare, but did not demand any specific sum of fare, or tell him what the fare was, and. upon his refusing to pay another fare or to leave the train, forcibly put him off at the next station, notwithstanding he resisted as much as he could, and in so doing injured him in body and health.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>On motion of the defendant, upon the grounds, among others, that this was an action of assumpsit for breach of contract, and that the plaintiff failed to produce to the conductor a ticket or voucher which entitled him to be carried on the train, and that until the plaintiff identified himself at the office at Hot Springs and had the ticket stamped and signed by the agent there, he had no subsisting contract between himself and the defendant for a return passage to Chicago, the court declined to permit the plaintiff to testify to the consequent injury to his business and to his ability to earn money, excluded all evidence offered as to the. force used in removing him from the train, and as to his expulsion from the train, (although corresponding to allegations inserted in the declaration,) and directed a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-4\">The plaintiff excepted to the rulings of the court, and, after verdict and judgment for the defendant, sued out this writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b173-5\"><em>Mr. Charles Carroll </em>Bonney, for plaintiff in error, submitted on his brief,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8lY\">citing : <em>State </em>v.

The only contract between the parties was an express one, signed by the plaintiff himself as well as by the defendant\u2019s agent at Chicago, and contained in a ticket for a passag'e to Hot Springs and back. The plaintiff, having assented to that contract by accepting and signing it, was bound by the conditions expressed in it, whether he did or did not read them or know what they were. The question, when he first knew that the ticket required him to have it stamped at Hot Springs, was therefore rightly excluded as immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">By the express conditions of the plaintiff\u2019s contract, he had no right to a return passage under his ticket, unless it bore the signature and stamp of the defendant\u2019s agent at Hot Springs ; and no agent or employe of the defendant was authorized to alter, modify or waive any condition of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Neither the action of the baggage-master in punching the ticket and checking the plaintiff\u2019s baggage, nor that of the gateman in admitting him to the train, therefore, could bind the defendant to carry him, or estop it to deny his right to be carried.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The plaintiff did net have his ticket stamped at Hot Springs, or make any attempt to do so, but insisted on the right to make the return trip under the unstamped .ticket, and without paying further fare. As he absolutely declined to pay any such fare, the fact that the conductor did not inform him of its amount is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">The unstamped ticket giving him no right to a return passage, and he not having paid, but absolutely refusing to pay, the usual fare, there was no contract in force between him and the defendant to carry him back from Hot Springs.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>There being no such contract in force, there could be no breach of it; and no breach of contract being shown, this action of assumpsit, sounding in contract only, and not in tort, cannot be maintained; to recover any damages, direct or consequential, for the plaintiff\u2019s expulsion from the defendant\u2019s train. The plaintiff, therefore, hag not.been prejudiced by the exclusion of the evidence concerning the circumstances attending his expulsion and the consequent injuri\u00e9s.to him or his business.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\">The case is substantially governed by the judgment of this court in <em>Mosher </em>v. <em>St. Louis, Iron Mountain &amp; Southern Railway, </em>127 U. S. 390, and our conclusion in the case at bar is in accord with the general current of decision in. the courts of the several States. See, besides the cases cited at the end of that judgment, the following: <em>Churchill </em>v. <em>Chicago db Alton Railroad, </em>67 Illinois, 390; <em>Petrie </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Railroad, </em>13 Vroom, 449; <em>Pennington </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, Wilmington &amp; Baltimore Railroad, </em>62 Maryland, 95 ; <em>Rawitzky </em>v. <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad, </em>40 La. Ann. 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Nor was anything inconsistent with this conclusion decided in either of the English cases relied on by the learned counsel for'the plaintiff. Each of those cases turned upon the validity and effect of a by-law made by the railway company, not of a contract signed by the plaintiff; and otherwise essentially differed from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">In <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Great Northern Railway, </em>L. R. 1 Q. B. 7, the by-law required every passenger to obtain a ticket before entering the train, and to show and deliver up his ticket whenever demanded.' The plaintiff took a ticket for himself, as well as tickets for three horses and three boys attending them, by a particular train, which was afterwards divided into two, in the first of which the plaintiff travelled, taking all the tickets with him; and when the second train was about to start, the boys were asked to produce their tickets, and, being unable- to do so, were prevented by the company\u2019s servants from proceeding with the- horses. An action by the plaintiff against the company for not carrying -his servants was sustained, because the company contracted with him only, and delivered all the tickets to him; and Lord Chief Justice Cock-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>burn, with whom the other judges concurred, said : \u201c It is unnecessary to determine'whether, if the company had given the tickets to the boys, and the boys had not .produced their tickets, it would have been competent for the company to have turned them ou,t of the carriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">In <em>Butler </em>v. Manchester, <em>Sheffield &amp; Lincolnshire </em>Railway, 21 Q. B. D. 207, the ticket referred to conditions published by the company, containing a similar by-law, which further provided that any passenger travelling without a ticket, or not showing or delivering it up when requested, should pay the fare from the station whence the train originally started. The plaintiff, having lost his ticket, was unable to produce it when demanded, and, refusing to pay such fare, was forcibly removed from the train by the defendant\u2019s servants. The Court of Appeal, reversing a judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, held the company, liable, because the plaintiff was lawfully on the train under a contract of the company to carry him, and no right to expel him forcibly could be -inferred from the provisions of the by-law in question, requiring him to show his ticket or pay the fare; and each of the judges cautiously abstained from expressing a decided opinion upon the question whether a by-law could, have been so framed as to justify the course taken by the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
