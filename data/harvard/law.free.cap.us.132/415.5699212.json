The deed recited the prior proceedings ,in bankruptcy, the order of sale- and its confirmation, and the order for a deed, and conveyed all the right, title and interest of the bankrupt, which he had on the 31st of August, 1878, and of the assignee, subject to all unpaid taxes and to all liens and incumbrances, unless by the terms of sale expressly excepted, to the real estate described in the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-7\">Bobertson, on the 4th of December, 1880, filed his petition for a discharge in bankruptcy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-8\">Taylor and Bruce, on the 22d of December, 1880, directed the marshal to release the levy made February 15, 1878, and to return the execution of January 29, 1878, unsatisfied.

No deed appears to have been made under this sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-4\">No proceedings having been taken in this suit since the demurrer to the original bill was sustained, an order was made, on the 6th of July, 1881, after an interval of more than three years and three months, giving leave to the plaintiffs to amend their bill and also.to file a supplemental bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-5\">On the 17th of September, 1881, they filed an. amended and supplemental bill, dismissing the original bill as to all the real estate.except that situated at the corner of West Madison and Sheldon streets, 73 feet by 116 feet, with-the buildings thereon erected. This new bill recited the contents of the original bill, and stated that, on a demurrer thereto, the court held that all the property and estate of Eobertson, so far as it could be discovered, must first be exhausted, before the court could interfere, in equity to compel the discovery and relief sought, and required the plaintiffs to wait until all such visible property and estate- was so sold and exhausted. It set- forth the con-. tents of the trust deed from Grow to Gallup ; that Peabody was the successor in trust of Gallup ; that the deed was made to secure the payment of an indebtedness of $35,000 to Greene; that Peabody had been in possession .of the premises, and receiving the rents and profits, amounting to more than sufficient to pay all the interest on. the debt, and the taxes, insurance and expenses of carrying the property; that, in pursuance of a fraudulent scheme to place the property beyond the \u25a0reach of the plaintiffs, Eobertson, on the 23d of July, 1877, which was two days after the verdict was returned in-their suit against Eobertson and seven days prior to the rendering of their judgment, executed a second deed of trust to Peabody, to secure an alleged additional indebtedness of Eobertson of $35,000; that, for the purpose of making it appear that the trust deed had been made before the verdict was rendered, it and the note were dated, back to April 2, 1877; that, for the purpose of preventing the plaintiffs from learning who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the real holder of the note and the interest coupons, or whether the deed was a <em>bona fide </em>lien in addition to the first lien, the note was made payable to the order of Bobertson and endorsed by him in blank; that said trust deed was only a renewal of the former trust deed from Grow to Gallup, and was made to secure to Greene said debt to him, and was not an additional incumbrance on the property; that said first mortgage should have been released of record so that the plaintiffs might ascertain from the record the true amount iff the encumbrance, but it was withheld, making it appear that the property was subject to $70,000 incumbrance, instead of only $35,000 ; and that Bobertson prayed an appeal from said judg-, ment to the Supreme Court of the United States,'which appeal was not perfected, but on account of its pendency the plaintiffs were unable to issue an execution on their judgment until October-15, 1877. The new bill then recited the mortgage to Templeton, and averred that it ought to be cancelled of record. It then set forth the making of the lease to McAllister for two years from September 1, 1877, at a rent of $300 a month, and the reduction of the rent to $30 a month from January 1, 1878, and averred that this was done for the purpose of lessening the income -from the property, so that it would be insufficient to pay the -taxes, insurance and expenses, and the interest on the loan ; and that the plaintiffs used due diligence to reach the estate of Bobertson, but were- unable to realize anything therefrom by execution. It then set forth the turning over by Bobertson to Peabody, as agent and trustee for Greene, of all the leases, rents and profits of the premises; and alleged that this was done in pursuance of the fraudulent scheme aforesaid, and- under an arrangement substantially as follows : Bobertson was to go through bankruptcy and obtain a discharge; Greene and Peabody were to carry the property and collect the income from it, but by reason of such reduction of the rent the income would be insufficient to carry -it; Peabody was thereupon to declare a forfeiture for non-payment of interest, and sell the property under the deed of trust, and thus cut out the lien of the plaintiffs\u2019 judgment, and also prevent the property from coming to the hands of -the assignee in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>bankruptcy, but Robertson, or his agent, said McAllister, was to be allowed to redeem from such sale, after Robertson had procured his discharge, upon paying the amount actually due according to the terms of the loan, and the expenses incurred in carrying the property, less the amount received from the rents and profits thereof, the same as if no sale had been made; the release of the trust deed to Gallup was to be withheld from record, so as to prevent any outside bidder and the plaintiffs from bidding at the sale; such arrangement was made with Robertson and McAllister, his agent, and Peabody, as agent for Greene, began to collect the rents of the premises under the leases, and they were, if judiciously and honestly applied, more than sufficient to carry the property and pay the interest on the loan, but they were, not applied to that purpose. The new bil\u00ed further set forth that, immediately on the making of such arrangement, Robertson filed his petition in bankruptcy, and very soon afterwards lefi; the United States and had since remained continuously absent therefrom; so that he could not be examined; that Peabody proceeded to declare a forfeiture ' of the trust deed for non-payment of interest on the loan, and, on October 7,1878, pretended to sell the premises, and executed a deed thereof to Greene for a pretended bid at the sale of $30,000; that after the sale an agreement was made by Robertson, either in person or by his agent McAllister, with . Greene, and Peabody, as the agent of Greene, whereby Greene was to' hold the property and collect the rents and apply them to carrying the property, and to allow Robertson or McAllister to redeem on payment of the amount of the incumbrance and interest, and the cost of carrying the property, less the amount of rents received, the same .as if no sale had been made; that the notice of sale was insufficient and defective; that the release of the trust-deed to Gallup was purposely withheld from record; that the plaintiffs had no actual notice of the sale, but it was concealed from them and -they did not learn of it until long afterwards ; and that the deed of June 17, 1880, by the assignee in bankruptcy, on his sale, -was made to Lorin \u2022 Grant Pratt as trustee for the plaintiffs. It then set forth the purchase of the property by the- plaintiffs for $5000, .at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>marshal\u2019s sale; that Greene died after the pretended purchase by him of the premises at' the sale by Peabody; that on his death whatever right, title, or interest he had in and to the premises passed to and became vested in Mehitable B. Greene, his widow; William W. Crapo and Charles W. Clifford, as trustees of Robert B. Greene, Susan G. Page, Horatio N. Greene, and Francis B. Greene; and said Robert B. Greene, Susan G. Page, Horatio N. Greene, and Francis B. Greene, as the heirs at law or devisees of said David R. Greene, and was still so held by and vested in them; that such heirs at law or devisees are citizens of Massachusetts and of full age.; and that E. A.Cummings, a citizen of Illinois, is the agent for the property, and collecting the rents for the heirs or devisees of Greene.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\">The new bill made as defendants the five persons who were defendants to the original bill, and also the widow, and the heirs or devisees above named of Greene, and their trustees, and Cummings, their agent. . Its prayer was that the mortgage to Templeton might be declared void; that the deed from Peabody to Greene might be set- aside as against the rights of the plaintiffs ; that Greene, during his lifetime, and his heirs or devisees, and Cummings as their agent, might be decreed to be mortgagees in possession; that they and Peabody make full answer in the premises; th\u00e1t an account be taken; and that the plaintiffs be allowed to redeem on paying the amount found to be due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\">All the defendants, except Robertson and Templeton, entered an appearance in the suit on the 21st of November, 1881:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-7\">The plaintiffs, on the 15th of December, 1881, consented to the discharge of Robertson in bankruptcy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-8\">On the 31st of December, 1881, all of the defendants who so appeared, except McAllister, put in an answer to the original bill and the' amended and supplemental bill, denying all the allegations imputing fraud to-the said defendants or to Greene in his lifetime, and claiming that the foreclosure proceedings by Gr\u00e9ene and Peabody were had in go.od faith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-9\">On the 6th of February, 1882, a replication to this answer was filed, and on the 6th of June, 1882, the cause was referred to a master, to take proofs and report them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-10\">After some proofs had been taken on the part of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>tiffs, and on the 4th of January, 1883, the plaintiffs filed an amendment to their amended and supplemental bill, which averred that Peabody, in order to conceal the time of the sale from the' plaintiffs, caused the notice of sale to be published in \u201cThe Chicago Weekly Journal,\u201d a newspaper which was not read in the city of Chicago and had no circulation in said city or in Cook County; that the premises sold were composed of three separate lots'; that the north 44 feet of the property was separated from the south portion, fronting on West Madison. Street, by an alley, or court 12 feet wide; that such north 44 feet were divided into two lots of 22 feet each, on each of which stood a brick dwelling-house 22 feet wide and fronting on Sheldon Street, which were used for private dwelling-houses, and were entirely distinct from the hotel part of the premises; that Peabody sold the property in bulk to Greene, at half its value, when it was his duty to have sold it in Separate, lots; and that, if he had so offered it; the part of it used for a hotel, and fronting on Madison Street, south of the alley or cpurt, would have brought more than sufficient to pay off the debt, interest and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-4\">On the 6th of January, 1883, the defendants answered this amendment, denying its allegations; and, on the 29 th of January, 1883, they amended their answer by averring that, as to so much of the bill, amended bill, and supplement, as alleged any agreement between Greene and Robertson for the redemption or repurchase of the premises by Robertson, such supposed agreement was not in writing, signed by Greene or by any person by him authorized in writing, .according to the statute of Illinois in such case made and provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-5\">On the 27th of October, 1883, the master reported the proofs to the court, and the cause was heard before Judge Blodgett, in November, 1883; and, on the 14th of April, 1884; he filed an opinion, which is reported in 21 Fed.

The amendment set up such laches as an equitable bar and defence to so much of the bill as rested upon such pretended equities, and averred that, by the bankruptcy act, the plaintiffs, by reason of such lapse of time and of the said facts, were barred from claiming any relief by reason of such pretended equities, and set up said bar and limitation of two years. The amendment to the answer also denied the allegations contained in th\u00e9 amendment so filed by the plaintiffs to the amended and supplemental bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-5\">The master, on the 12th of April, 1886, filed a supplemental report, bringing down the account to the 1st of April, 1886, and finding to be due to the defendants on that day $45,342.86.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-6\">The case was brought to a hearing before Judge Blodgett, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>and he filed his opinion on the 24th of May, 1886 ( 27 Fed.

It was undoubtedly the intention of Congress, in enacting the bankrupt law, that the assignee\u2019s sale and deed to the purchaser \u2014 in a case of this kind \u2014 should transfer to him the whole title of the assignee, including all objections to the trustee\u2019s voidable sale, together with the right of redemption from the trust deed. The mere fact that he advertised to sell, subject to a prior lien, could no more waive any . right which he was selling to the purchaser, than an administrator would by advertising, the equity of redemption to land of his decedent, subject to a prior lien or mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-4\">III.

Justice Blatchford,</author>\n<p id=\"Am_\">after stating! the case as above reported, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>The plaintiffs claim a right to redeem from the sale to Greene, made by Peabody as trustee, or from the trust deed und[er which that sale was made, on. payment of the mortgage debt, (1) as owners of Robertson\u2019s equity of redemption by virtue of their purchase from the assignee in bankruptcy; and (2) as judgment creditors of Robertson, having a lien on the property by virtue of their judgment, prior in time to the sale, by Peabody as trustee, and by their purchase of the property at the sale under the execution issued on their judgm'ent. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">They rest their claim under their purchase from the assignee in bankruptcy, first, on the ground that the sale by Peabody as trustee was made after the commencement of the proceedings in bankruptcy, and after the adjudication thereon, before an assignee was appointed, and without leave of the bankruptcy court, and was void as against such assignee' and those claiming under him, that the property was still subject to the right of redemption by the assignee, and that such' right has been conveyed by him to the plaintiffs^ second, on the ground that there was a collusive agreement made with Robertson, by Peabody as agent for Greene, giving to Robertson the right to redeem from, the sale by Peabody, and that such right of redemption passed from Robertson to his assignee in bankruptcy, and from the latter to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The claim of the plaintiffs to redeem, as judgment creditors of Robertson, is based on' the allegation that they were led by the wrongful conduct of the defendants to believe that the property was subject to the deed of trust to Gallup, as well as to that to Peabody; that they were not allowed an opportunity to pay off the incumbrance before the sale by Peabody, although they were ready and willing to do so; that, by rea-. son of the collusive agreement referred to, the sale by Peabody was part of a scheme to hinder them in collecting their judgment, by cutting off their lien on Robertson\u2019s equity of redemption, and giving the property back to him, after ho should have been discharged in bankruptcy from the judgment ; that the sale by Peabody was not properly advertised; that the plaintiffs had no notice of such sale prior to its being-made ; that such notice was intentionally withheld from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>them; that the sale by Peabody, with the prior incumbrance of the trust deed to Gallup apparently standing against the property, when such incumbrance had been paid, was made with a view to prevent competition in bidding at the sale; that the property was sold in bulk, and not offered for sale in parcels.; and that'it was sold for an inadequate price.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u25a0 But we do not find it necessary to consider any of these questions, because we are of opinion that the right of action of the. plaintiffs, under their title derived from the assignee in bankruptcy, was barred by the two years\u2019 limitation enacted by the bankruptcy statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Section 5057 of the Revised Statutes provides as follows: \u201c No suit, either at law or in equity, shall be maintainable in any court between an assignee in bankruptcy and a person claiming an adverse interest, touching any property or rights of .property transferable to or vested in such assignee, unless brought within two years from the time when the cause of action accrued fer or against such assignee.\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">It is contended for the plaintiffs that the limitation provided by section 5057 applies only to the case of a contest between an assignee in bankruptcy and a person claiming an interest adversely to such assignee, touching property of the bankrupt, in a suit to which the assignee is a party; that when the assignee transferred his rights to Pratt, who acted for the plaintiffs, on the 17th of June, 1880, under the sale to Pratt made on the 24th of April, 1880, the statute ceased to run, and the interest which thus passed from the assignee then ceased to be within the terms of the bankruptcy statute of limitation, and became subject to the ordinary statute of limitation, and that the two years\u2019 limitatiQn ha'd not run on the 24th of April, 1880, or on the 17th of June, 1880, the register\u2019s deed to the assignee in bankruptcy having been made on the 24th of July, 1879. '</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">But we are of opinion that the right which passed to the assignee, to; file a bill to redeem, began to exist on the 24th of' July, 1879; that, as the bankruptcy statute of limitation began then to run against such -right in the hands of the assignee, it continued to run .after such right passed .to the. plaintiffs, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the assignee\u2019s deed to Pratt on their behalf, of June IT, 1880, made in pursuance of the sale of April 24, 1880; that the two years\u2019 statute of limitation bars the right asserted by the plaintiffs in their bill, in like manner as it would have barred the right of the assignee to redeem, if he had never made any. sale or conveyance to Pratt, and if he were now the plaintiff in this suit; that the suit cannot be regarded as having been brought against the widow, heirs and representatives of David E. Greene until the supplemental bill was filed, on the 17th of September, '1881, when, for the first time, the sale by Peabcdy, as trustee, to Greene, was drawn in question -in this suit; and that, as more than two years elapsed between July' 24, 1879, and September 17, 1881, the two years\u2019 bar of the statute is complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">That the two years\u2019 bar of the statute applies in favor of a purchaser from an assignee in bankruptcy has been decided by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"AnI\">In <em>Gifford </em>v. Helms, 98 U. S. 248, the assignee in bankruptcy was appointed in May, 1868, and sold all the assets of the bankrupt to the plaintiff in May, 1871. Afterwards the plaintiff brought suit to set aside an alleged fraudulent conveyance which had been made- by the bankrupt in June, ,1867. It was held that, as .the right of action on the part of the assignee in bankruptcy was barred in May, 1871, it was barred as against the plaintiff. This could not have been held if the two years\u2019 statute of limitation had been regarded as one applying only in a suit brought by the assignee. It was said by the court, that if the conveyance sought to be impeached was made in fraud of creditors, the equities in controversy were vested in. the assignee in bankruptcy when he was appointed', and his right of action commenced at the time the assignment was made to him, and he might have pursued such right at any time thereafter; that, as' the plaintiff claimed as purchaser from the assignee, he did not acquire, under the sale made- to him by the assignee, any greater rights than those possessed by the latter; that those rights were acquired by the assignee in May, 1868 ; that throughout the period intervening between that date and May, 1871, the equities in controversy- were held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>by the defendant adversely to the supposed right of the assignee ; and that the right, if any, of the assignee, was barred by the two years\u2019 statute of limitation, before the purchase by the plaintiff;</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">In <em>Wisner </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>122 U. S. 214, it was held that an assignee in bankruptcy cannot transfer to a purchaser the bankrupt\u2019s adverse interest in real estate in the possession of another claiming title to it, if two years have elapsed from the time when the cause of action therefor accrued to the assignee ; and that the right of the purchaser in such case is as fully barred by the bankruptcy statute of limitation as is that of the assignee. In that case, the suit was brought by a person who had purchased property of the estate from the assignee in' bankruptcy, and received a conveyance thereof, more than spven years after the title of the assignee accrued. The defendants pleaded the two years\u2019 bankruptcy statute of limitations. At the time of the appointment of the assignee the property sued for was held adversely by the defendants. The court held that the assignee could not, after two years from the time of his appointment had expired, himself bring an action to recover the property, or, by selling the lands to a third person after such time had expired, enable the latter to maintain an action therefor; and it quotes with approval the remark made in <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>( supra,) that the purchaser from the assignee did not acquire by his purchase any greater rights than those possessed by the latter. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">These cases show that a conveyance by the assignee in bankruptcy cannot prevent the operation of the bar of the statute against the grantee, when it has already run against the assignee, or bring into action a new period of limitation, dating -from the time of the conveyance. Nor can it interrupt the running of the statute against the claim or right, when it has once commenced to run as against the assignee. The purchaser takes the right <em>eum onere, </em>subject to the continuance of the running of the statute, and subject to the fact that a part of the two years has already run as against the claim or right,.while it was in the hands of the assignee, and to the consequence that when sufficient additional time shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>have run against it, in the hands of the purchaser, to make up the entire two years, the claim or right will be wholly barred. No initiation of a new period of limitation, under any statute, begins to run in favor of the purchaser at the time of his purchase, whether the two years wholly elapsed, or only a part thereof elapsed, while the claim was owned by the assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">But the plaintiffs seek to take the case out of the bar of the statute, by alleging that they were ignorant of their rights, and did not discover the facts relating to the sale by Peabody as trustee, and the other matters set up in their supplemental bill, until the 24th of April, 1880, which vras within two years of September 17, 1881'; and that the sale by Peabody was kept secret by the defendants, as far as possible, although the plaintiffs used diligence to discover the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Even if the allegations in the supplemental bill and in the amendments thereto be regarded as sufficiently charging a fraudulent concealment by the defendants of the facts of the case, from the assignee in bankruptcy, or from Pratt, or from the plaintiffs, we do not think the evidence establishes any such fraudulent' concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">With the petition in bankruptcy, filed August 31,1878,-there was filed a schedule naming the creditors of Robertson holding securities, giving the name of David R. Greene as one of such creditors, his place of residence, the date of the contracting of his debt, its amount, a statement that the security was a trust deed on property in Chicago, a description of such property, the street and number where it was situated,{ and the name-of Peabody as trustee. It also disclosed the f\u00e1ct that the only incumbrance on the property was the trust deed to Peabody, thus excluding the idea that the trust deed to Gallqp was in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Here was information, accessible to the assignee in bankruptcy when, he was appointed, information which he was bound to take notice of, information equally accessible to the plaintiffs, being in a public record; which information referred the assignee and the plaintiffs to David R. Greene for full particulars as to the property in question, and the transactions in regard to the trust deed. The petition in bankruptcy was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>filed thirty-seven days before the sale of the property to Greene by Peabody as trustee. 'Moreover, in the petition of the plaintiffs, filed in the bankruptcy court October 5, 1878, two days before the sale by Peabody, and sworn to by the agents of the plaintiffs, the contents of the schedules in bankruptcy of Robertson are referred to, and it is stated that among the assets set forth in such schedules is the property in question, identifying it. This shows that information was actually had by such agent, at that time, of the facts before set forth as contained in one of such schedules, as to the particulars of the trust deed to Peabody, and as to who was the holder of the note secured by it and where he resided. That petition was filed more than nine months before the assignee in bankruptcy was appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The rights of the plaintiffs must depend wholly upon such right of redemption as existed in Robertson, and passed to his assignee in bankruptcy, and from the latter to the plaintiffs. That being extinguished, no other right exists, and the plaintiffs have no right to redeem through any separate title acquired under their judgment against Robertson. They did not become, by the recovery of their judgment, or by anything done under it, the successors of Robertson.in respect of any right of redemption, but they must follow and acquire their only title to such right, through the assignee in bankruptcy. Moreover, whatever right to redeem they could have acquired by virtue of their judgment was waived by them by their petition of March 25, 1880, to the bankruptcy court, and by their procuring the property in question to be- sold by the assignee in bankruptcy, and its proceeds to be applied on their judgment. At their own suggestion the equity of redemption, which was sold by the assignee, was thus put beyond their reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\"><em>The result of these views is that the decree of the Circuit Court must he </em>reversed, <em>and the case he remanded to that court with a direction to enter a decree dismissing the hill, with costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
