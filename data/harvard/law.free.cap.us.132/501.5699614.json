This view is enforced' by the addition of the phrase \u201c on the best <em>terms </em>possible.\u201d In the following cases, wherein the assignee had authority to fix the <em>\u201c </em>terms \u201d of sale, it was held that a sale on credit was implied. <em>Sumner </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>2 Black, 532; <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>1 Wisconsin, 286; <em>S. C. </em>60 Am. Dec. 381; <em>Keep </em>v. <em>Sanderson, </em>12 Wisconsin, 352; <em>Beus </em>v. <em>Shaughnessy, </em>2 Utah, 492; <em>Moir </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>14 Barb. 39; <em>Schufeldt </em>v. <em>Abernethy, </em>2 Duer, 533.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-4\">In the case at bar, the court below held that the assignment authorized a sale on credit, and that for that reason it was void against non-consenting creditors. <em>Muller </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>19 Fed. Rep. 719. In fact it appears to be a settled rule in most of the States that an authority to the assignor to sell upon credit renders the deed of assignment void on its face. In addition to the above cited cases see <em>McLeary </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>7 Nebraska, 21; <em>Collier </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>47 Arkansas, 367; <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Bowe, </em>105 N. Y. 171. The ground of the ruling is that an authority to sell on credit tends to hinder or delay creditors, and is obnoxious to the statute of 13 Eliz., which is substantially in force in most of the States. See <em>Jaffrey </em>v. <em>McGehee, </em>107 U. S. 365; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>22 Wall. 513; <em>Means </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>128 U. S. 273.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-5\">Under the statutes of Texas, and the decisions of her courts, a deed of assignment authorizing a sale upon credit is voidable by non-consenting creditors. When the assignment in question was made, there were two statutes in force which governed it, namely, the statute against fraudulent conveyances, substantially the statute of 13 Eliz., in force from an early day (Rev. Stats. 1879, Art. 2465, p. 363) and the act regulating assignments for the benefit of -creditors, approved March 24, 1879 (Id. App. p. 5). The act of 1879 is silent as to the time, terms and manner of sale; and where the statute is silent, the assignee must be governed by the deed of assign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ment. <em>Ogden </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>21 N. Y. 23; <em>S. </em>C. 78 Am. Dec. 122; <em>In re Lewis, </em>81 N. Y. 421; <em>Adler </em>v. <em>Ecker, </em>1 McCrary, 256; <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>1 Met. (Mass.) 79; <em>Collier </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>47 Arkansas, 367. <em>Wert </em>v. <em>Schneider, </em>64 Texas, 327, arose under the act of 1879. On the authority of this case we contend that the court would have held the assignment void on its face if it had found there authority to sell on credit. See <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Welborne, </em>58 Texas, 157; <em>Donoho </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>58 Texas, 164; <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>61 Texas, 518; <em>Keller </em>v. <em>Smalley, </em>63 Texas, 512. See also <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Bowe, ubi supra; Eicks </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>53 Texas, 581, 590 ; <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Peet, </em>22 Texas, 708; <em>S. C. </em>75 Am. Dec. 806; <em>Carlton </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>22 Texas, 724; <em>Nace </em>v. <em>Britton, </em>61 Texas, 572. These Texas rulings were made under the statute against fraudulent conveyances, which is in force as to deeds of assignment under the act of 1879. <em>La Belle Wagon Works </em>v. <em>Tidball, </em>59 Texas, 291. Tn view of the state of the law in Texas and other States, a Federal Court may hold this assignment void on its face, where the rights of non-resident creditors are involved. <em>Schoolfield </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>11 Fed. Rep. 297; <em>Heelan </em>v. <em>Hoagland, </em>10 Nebraska, 511; <em>Bonns </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>20 Nebraska, 566; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>1 Gray, 239; <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>21 Maine, 280; <em>S. C. </em>38 Am. Dec. 259 ; <em>Raleigh </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>37 Arkansas, 150; <em>Churchill </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>41 Wisconsin, 611. This case is distinguishable from <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Norton. </em>The contention there related to paying over to the debtor the surplus remaining after paying consenting creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-5\">II. The deed of assignment is void as against non-consenting creditors, for the reason that it is not made to one assignee as required by the statute.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b529-6\">Mr Justice Lamar,</author>\n<p id=\"A06\">after stating the case as above reported, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The validity of the above deed in view of matters apparent on its face constitutes the only question for consideration. We think that question is determined by the principle laid down, in <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>125 U. S. 77; which reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the judgment on the authority of which the one now under, review was rendered by the court below. That case involved, as does this, the validity of an assignment under the Texas statute just referred to, which was sought to be set aside .on account of a provision in the deed alleged to be not in conformity with that statute. The assignments in the two cases are very similar; the main difference being, that' the one in the Cunningham case contains two provisions, neither of which occurs in the instrument under consideration. The first of these provisions reserves to the assignor the surplus of the property assigned after the payment of all the debts of the consenting creditors. The second expressly authorizes the assignee to sell such property on credit, according to his discretion. This last provision, however, was not called to the attention of the court in that case. The main contention was, that the deed in controversy was rendered void by the clause directing the assignee to pay over to the assignor the surplus after paying in full all the creditors who should accede to the deed. This court decided that the said clause did not affect the validity of the assignment, but was itself alone invalidated by reason of its being in violation of the statute. The decision was based upon the general construction of the whole act taken together, in view of the main object designed to' be sub-served by it, and of the decisions of the Supreme Court of Texas upon many of its express provisions, in which line of decisions the court indicated its full concurrence. That policy the court declares to have been the appropriation of the entire estate of an insolvent debtor to the payment of his debts, and as a means thereto to favor assignments, and to give them such ^ construction that they may stand rather than fall; that its manifest purpose was to provide a mode by which an .insolvent debtor, desiring to do so, may make an assignment simple and yet effective to pass all his property to an assignee for the benefit of such of his creditors as will accept a proportionate share of the said property, and discharge him from their claims; that it further manifests the \u25a0 intention to transfer to the assignee all the property of the debtor for distribution among all the creditors; that no act of the assignee or of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>assignor after the assignment is made, or preceding it, but in contemplation of it, however fraudulent that act may be, shall divest the right of the creditors to have the trust administered for their benefit in accordance with the spirit of the statute; and that, therefore, the provision reserving the surplus to the debtor after payment of the debts to the consenting creditors, even though conceded to be not in conformity with the requirements of the statute, and therefore itself void, does not vitiate the assignment or prevent its execution for the benefit of the creditors, as provided in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">These- principles apply with controlling force to the assignment in the case at bar. The ingenious argument of the counsel has failed to point- out \u00e1ny distinguishing features in the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The first ground- upon which this deed is assailed is the following clause thereinr \u201cThe said Fred. Muller and A. Jacobs are hereby authorized and directed to take possession at once of all. the property above conveyed, and convert the same into cash as soon and upon the best terms possible for the best interest of our creditors; \u201d which language the court below and the counsel for the defendants claim is an authority to the assignee to sell upon credit. We do not think that such is a correct or fair interpretation of the clause, taking the whole instrument together and construing it with- reference to the purpose manifest in all its other provisions. A positive direction to \u201c convert \u201d the property assigned \u201c into cash as soon and upon the best terms possible for the best interest of our creditors,\u201d can hardly be construed into a discretionary authority to sell on credit, without 'doing violence to the well-established rule that the power to sell on credit will not be inferred from language susceptible of a different construction. Burrill on Assignments, \u00a7 224. '</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">But even if we concede that the construction contended for be correct, and that the .clause thus construed is in contravention of the statute, it will not; as this court has decided, operate to annul the assignment in which all the creditors may have an interest. In <em>Kellogg &amp; Co. </em>v. Muller, 68 Texas, 182, 184, this very point we are now considering, was presented and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>decided by the court in the following language: \u201c The first exception to the deed is that it authorized the assignee to sell the property assigned on a credit, and is, therefore, void. The provision to which we are cited\" in support of the exception, is as follows: \u2018That so soon as said inventory is\" complete, the said Frederick Muller, as such trustee aforesaid, shall thereafter, with all reasonable dispatch, proceed to sell and dispose of said goods, wares and merchandise and furniture, and collect said book .accounts and bills receivable, converting the same into cash or its equivalent.\u2019 It may be doubted if this can be construed to empower the assignee, to sell for anything but money. . . . But, however this may be, even if a badge of fraud, it is not sufficient to authorize the court to hold the deed void upon its face; \u201d citing <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Peet, </em>22 Texas, 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In the assignment <em>before </em>us all the property conveyed by it is in terms devoted to the payment of the creditors of the insolvent debtor. The judgment of the court below adjudging it to be void upon, its face, because it permitted a sale on\" credit, was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The second objection, that the deed was not made to one. assignee, does not require any extended comment. Under the common law an insolvent debtor was permitted to make an assignment to a single individual or to several. Burrill on Assignments, \u00a7 91. It is true the act of March 24,1879, speaks only of an <em>assignee ; </em>but the statutory rule of construction in force in Texas is: \u201c The singular and plural number shall each include the other, unless otherwise expressly provided.\u201d Bev. Stafc. of Texas (1879), Art. 3138, subdivision 4. Under this rule, and keeping in mind the policy of the statute of 1879, regulating assignments, we do not think the deed of assignment in this case void for the second reason assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">\u2022 <em>For the reasons given the decree of the court below is reversed and the case remanded, with directions to take such further proceedings\u25a0 as shall not be inconsistent with this opinion.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
