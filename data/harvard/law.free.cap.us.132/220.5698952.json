The petition further alleged that, in June, 1881, the defendant directed Yane to construct two lines westwardly from Hammond in the direction of Chicago, Illinois; that he proceeded to erect and construct such two lines to a point about ten miles east of the courthouse in Chicago; that the defendant had failed to pay the freights on the wire and materials; that Yane, at its request, had furnished money to pay such freights and also money to purchase necessary materials used- in making the line; that the defendant had committed other breaches of its agreement with Yane, and in consequence owed him a large sum of money; that he had executed the work in all things as directed by the defendant; that when he had completed the six lines to Lake Station, in Lake County, Indiana, the defendant owed him about $16,000; that he then disconnected the six wires from their westerly connections, and held physical possession of them, for his own protection; that while he so held them, in their disconnected condition, the \u25a0 receivers, Newcombe and Smith, entered into the following agreement with him, in consideration that he would allow the linep to be connected with other lines running westerly into Chicago:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\u201c Chicago, III., <em>Nov. 19th, </em>1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-4\">\u201cIt is hereby agreed and understood that the telegraph wires on the poles of the Bankers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 Telegraph Company in the State of Indiana, which were strung by J.

A replication w'as put in to this answer, and on the 16th of May, 1885, the petition of Yane was referred to a master to take evidence and report the same with his findings thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-5\">On the 30th of January, 1886, the master, having taken the evidence produced by the parties, filed his report, containing the following statements:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\">\u201cMr. Yane, the petitioner, was employed by the telegraph company to put on arms and .insulators and to string additional wires on the poles of the company from Freeport Junction, Ohio, to Lake Station, Indiana, a distance of 248 miles, for $45 per mile. The company agreed to furnish and deliver to Yane, at the nearest accessible railway stations, all the neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>sary material for the work.

The amount owing to him on this account is six hundred dollars' ($600).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-5\">\u201c He also strung two wires from Hammond to the junction of the Chicago Board of Trade lines, 28 miles, at $20 per mile, for which there is due him five hundred and sixty dollars ($560).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-6\">\u201c During the progress of the work the company failed to furnish the material as it. was required, so that the men working for Vane were without employment a portion of the time. Vane asked for instructions and was directed by the company to keep his men together during the delay thus caused, it being the understanding that the company would pay their board while they were waiting. The master is of the opinion that it is to be fairly inferred from the evidence that the company would pay for the time thus lost, Vane being required to pay his men as if they were at work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-7\">\u201cVane also made some advances for freight on material shipped to him, but which he could not obtain possession of until the freight was paid.

November .12, 1884, the work was practically done, but the connections were not made. Mr. Aane kept possession of the wires by refusing to allow connections to be made, and turned the ends of the wires down into the ground. He retained such possession, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>until November 20, 1884, when he delivered possession to the receivers, with an agreement that such delivery was not to impair any rights or liens he might thus have by virtue of such possession. He had such possession when the order allowing the issue of receivers\u2019 certificates was made, and also when the certificates were issued, November 11, 1884. I report and find that, by perfecting his claim for a lien under the statute, Mr. Yane waived the right he had, if any, to assert his common. law lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-4\">\u201cIn addition there is due to Yane from the receivers, for work done for them, $1898.33. The work was done after the certificates were authorized by'the order of November 3,1884, but before the' issue of the certificates issued by subsequent orders. I report and find that for the sum last named Yane should be postponed as to the issue of .$150,000 of certificates, but that he should be preferred as to those which were subsequently issued.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-5\">In February, 1886, the receivers filed exceptions to' the report of the master, because of his allowance to Yane of a lien for the $13,771.12, on the ground that he was an employ\u00e9 of the defendant, within the meaning of section 5286, The exceptions claimed that Yane was a contractor in his agreement with the defendant, and not its employ\u00e9 ; that the item of $600 for putting in cross-arms was not covered by his notice of lien nor by the contract under which the labor was performed; and that -he had no lien for that service; and they made a like claim in regard to the item of $1951.12.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-6\">Yane filed' exceptions to the report because the master had found that he was not entitled to a lien for the $13,771.12, paramount to the holders of receivers\u2019 certificates-and all other mortgage liens; and had not found that Yane was entitled to a paramount lien over all such otherTiens for the entire amount of $15,069.62 ; and had deducted the $500 from the $14,271.12, and not from, the $1298.50; and had not awarded a lien for the $1298.50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-7\">The case was heard on these exceptions by Judge Woods, holding' the Circuit Court. His opinion, delivered in April, 1886, 27 Fed. Hep. 536, recites the material findings of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>master, and then says : \u201c In the opinion of the court, the petitioner had no lien at common law or in equity, and was not an employ\u00e9 of the telegraph company within the meaning of the statute referred to by the master. That statute provides that the employ\u00e9s of any corporation doing business in this State . . . \u25a0 shall be entitled to have and hold a first and prior lien upon the corporate property, . . . and the earnings thereof, for all work and labor done .... by such employ\u00e9s for such corporation. To be entitled to the benefits of this-'Statute, and others of like character since enacted, I think it clear that the employ\u00e9 must have been a servant, bound in some degree at least, to the duties of a servant, aiid not, like the petitioner, a mere contractor, bound only to produce or cause to be produced a certain, result, \u2014 a result of labor, to be sure, \u2014 but free to dispose of his own time and personal efforts according to his pleasure, without responsibility to the other party. In respect to the sums found due the petitioner, the report is confirmed, but, to the allowance of a lien, exceptions sustained.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-6\">In pursuance of this decision, the court made an order overruling the exceptions of Vane, and sustaining so much of the exceptions of the receivers as related to the claim for a lien in favor of Vane, but confirming the report as to amounts found to be due to Vane, The order adjudged that Vane had no lien upon the property of the defendant for the $15,069.62; that that sum was a general floating debt of the defendant, not entitled to any priority; but that the $1898.33 was \u00e1 valid debt of the receivers, payable out of any funds in their hands as such-, available for payment of the debts of the trust. Vane appealed to this court from so much of the decree as disallowed his claim for a lien for the $15,069.62, and from the overruling of his exceptions and the sustaining of the exceptions of the receivers.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-7\"><em>Mr. Addison C.

Thus the federal and state courts are in accord in this matter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-4\">The history of a remedial act may be inquired into, in. order to ascertain the purpose for which it was enacted. Platt v. <em>Union Pacific Railroad, </em>99 U. S. 48, 60; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Union Pacific Railroad, </em>91 U. S. 72, 79 ; <em>Maryland v. Railroad Company, </em>22 Wall. 105, 113; <em>Railway Co. v. Prescott, </em>16 Wall. 603, 609. Looking at the various laws enacted in Indiana before 1877, we find that all persons engaged in constructing any building (act of 1853), railroad (1873), boat (1863), or any article of personal property; agistors, attorneys, bailees, warehousemen, etc., were protected by the State. The financial distress of that time fell heavily upon the workingmen, and particularly those whose labor was not secured by statute. Labor incorporated into a telegraph line is as much entitled to protection as if done on a building, railroad or boat, or in a law suit. And in morals, those operating a railroad or factory, seem, to many at least, to have as much claim to protection as those engaged in constructing or repairing the plant itself. Labor creates wealth. And for its encouragement and assurance its value is made a charge on that which it creates. The chief purpose of such statutes is to prevent those persons whose labor is indispensable to the continuance of a corporation from abandoning it, apd thus suspending its operations whenever they become alarmed by fear of losing their pay. <em>Lehigh, Coal &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Central Railroad, </em>2 Stewart (29 N. J. Eq.) 252; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Watson Manufacturing Co., </em>3 Stewart (30 N. J.

Ses. 204), it was used as embracing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>president, directors, cashier, secretary, treasurer, teller, clerk, bookkeeper, agent and others in the employ of any corporation or person in business. In subsequent criminal statutes it still holds the same place broadened to embrace many other persons. Rev. Stats. 1881, \u00a7\u00a7 1944, 1946, 1948, 3645.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-5\">It'is evident the word was not used in any limited sense in this act; although, if Yane had appropriated the wire before it was strung, he might have been guilty of embezzlement. See <em>Ritter v. State, </em>111 Indiana, 324. The word has recently come to us from a foreign tongue, but receives a broader meaning here than it has in its natural home. Its brevity has led to its adoption into our tongue as it comprehends many classes of persons which otherwise we must name, respectively. A half a century ago it was styled an equivocal word. Bayley, J., in <em>Ripley </em>v. <em>Scaife, </em>5 B. <em>&amp; </em>C. 167. But it is now,in such general use that it is not subject to criticism, and it receives as broad a definition as its common use will warrant. <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Cushing, </em>49 Wisconsin, 169; <em>Grainger </em>v. <em>Aynsley, </em>6 Q.

Lastly, we insist that the arrangement of November 19, 1884, fixed a lien on the property. Yane\u2019s accounts had been stated; his mechanic\u2019s liens had been filed, and of course known to Doolittle and the receivers. It was known to every one connected with the management of the line that Yane was holding possession of the six wires for his pay. Yane told Doolittle so, and the agreement -made by the receivers recites it.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>The receivers wanted the use of 'the wires. They had no money. This is shown by the insolvency of the company, and the acts of the receivers soon after in inducing the- courts to issue receivers\u2019 certificates. This agreement was written by Doolittle, the Chicago counsel for the. receivers. It was made to induce Vane to yield up possession. They knew he believed it recognized his claim on the wires. It was made in the presence of that assertion. The words are: \u201c It is' expressly understood that such use of said wires shall not be construed in any way or to any extent as impairing or interfering with the lien of said Vane thereon.\u201d Vane was induced to alter his position by this contract. It. is too late, it is believed, in a court of conscience or elsewhere, to interpolate into the contract words so as to make -it read: \u201cBy surrendering possession, Vane\u2019s lien shall not be destroyed, if he has any.\u201d <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 Cr. &amp; Mees. 842; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Board of Missions, </em>102 N.

Ingersoll, </em>for appellees, submitted on his brief.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b257-6\">Mr. Justice Blatchford,</author>\n<p id=\"AEv\">after, stating the case as above report ed, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">It is contended for Vane that he has a lien under section 1 of the act of 1877. (Section 5286 of the Devised Statutes.) That section gives a first and prior lien upon the corporate property of any corporation doing business in Indiana, whether organized under the laws of that State or otherwise, and upon the' earnings of such corporation, to its employ\u00e9s, fbr all work and labor done and performed by them for the corporation, from the date of their, employment by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">It seems clear to us that Vane was a contractor with the company, and not an employ\u00e9 within the meaning of the statute. <em>We </em>think the distinction pointed out by the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Court is a sound one, namely, that to be an employe within the meaning of the statute Yane \u201cmust have been a servant, bound in some degree at least to the duties of a servant, and not,\u201d as he was, \u201c a mere contractor, bound only to produce or cause to be produced a certain result, \u25a0 \u2014 \u25a0 a result of labor, to be sure, \u2014 but free to dispose of his own time and personal efforts according to his pleasure, without responsibility to the other party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">It is'to be noted that the statute gives a lien to employes of the corporation only \"for Work and labor done and performed by them for the corporation. It does not give a lien .for the value of materials furnished, nor for advances of money made. It is confined to work and labor done and performed, and to work and labor done and performed by employ\u00e9s of\u2019 the corporation, and to work and labor done and performed by employ\u00e9s of the corporation for the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In this respect there is a marked difference between the provisions of section 5286 and the provisions of section 15 of the act, of March 8, <em>1879, </em>(Laws of 1879, 22; \u00a7 5471 of the Revised Statutes of 1881,) which gives a lien, in coal mines, on the mine \u201cand all machinery and fixtures connected therewith, including scales, coal-bank cars, and everything used in and \u00a1about the mine\u201d to \u201cthe miners and other persons employed and working in and about the mines, and the owners of the land or other persons interested in the rental or royalty on the coal mined therein,\u201d \u201c for work and labor performed within two months, and the owner of the land, for royalty on coal taken out from under his land, for any length of time not exceeding two months.\u201d This miners\u2019 statute gives a lien to all persons \u201c employed and working in and about the mines,\u201d for work and labor performed by them, without stating'that they must be etnploy\u00e9s of the owners of the mine, or of the persons working it, or of the persons owning the machinery and fixtures, and without stating that they may not be persons working in and about the mine employed by contractors doing work under contract for the owners of the mine or for the owners of the machinery and fixtures.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The general mechanics\u2019 lien law of Indiana (\u00a7 5293 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Revised Statutes of 1881), subsequently re-enacted by the act of March 6, \u00cd883, Laws of 1883, 140, provided that \u201c mechanics, and all persons performing labor or furnishing materials for the construction or repair, or who may have furnished any engine or other machinery for any mill, distillery, or other manufactory, may have a lien separately or. jointly upon the building which they may have constructed or \u2018repaired, or upon any buildings, mill, distillery, or other manufactory for which they may have furnished materials of any description, and on the interest of the owner in the lot or land on which it stands, to the\u2018extent of the value of any labor done or materials furnished, or for both.\u201d This mechanics\u2019 lien statute gives a lien upon a building to all persons who perform labor or furnish materials for the construction or repair of the building, even though they do it under a contract, and is not confined to ehiploy\u00e9s of the owner of the building; and it also gives a lien upon a manufactory to persons who may have furnished machinery or materials for the manufactory, even though they may have done so under contract with the owner of the manufactory or under contract with the contractor with such owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The Supreme Court of Indiana, in <em>Colter </em>v. Frese, 45 Indiana, 96, in 1873, in construing that statute, which was section 647 of the then existing Revised Statutes, held that a person who furnished materials, not to the owner, but to the contractor, for the erection of a new building, could acquire and. enforce a lien on the building, and on the interest of the owner of the land on which the building stood, to the extent of the value of the materials furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">In view of these provisions of other lien statutes of Indiana, the limited language of section 5286 is very marked, and justifies the interpretation that the provisions of that section are to be confined to a special class of persons. It is a rule of interpretation recognized by the Supreme Court of Indiana, in <em>Stout </em>v. <em>Board of </em>Commissioners, 107 Indiana, 343, 348, that \u201c in cases of doubt or uncertainty, acts <em>in pari </em>materia, passed either before or after, and whether repealed or still in force, may be referred to in order to discern the intent of the legislature in the use of particular terms, or. in the enactment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>particular provisions, and, within the reason of the same rule, contemporaneous legislation, not precisely <em>in pari </em>materia., may be referred to for the same purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The view above taken of the statute under consideration is supported by adjudged cases. In <em>Aikin </em>v. <em>Wasson, </em>24 N. Y. 482, in 1862, it was held that a contractor for the construction of part of a railroad was not a laborer or servant, within the provision- of the general railroad act of New York, making stockholders of a railroad corporation personally liable \u201cfor all the debts due or owing to any of its laborers and servants, for services performed for sueh corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Am\">In <em>Munger </em>v. Lenroot, 32 Wisconsin, 541, in 1873, under a statute which gave a lien on logs or timber, for the amount due for his labor or services, to any person who did or performed any work or services in cutting, felling, hauling, driving, running, rafting, booming, cribbing, or towing Such logs dr timber, it was held that such person was entitled to such lien, not only when employed by the owner of the logs or of the land from which they-were cut, but also when'employed by a contractor under such owner. The court was of the opinion that the legislature intended to give the lien absolutely to the laborer, regardless of the question whether he had rendered the services under a contract with the general owner or not. This decision was based upon the special language of the statute, in not excluding a person employed by a contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">In <em>Wakefield </em>v. Fargo, 90 N. Y. 213, in 1882, it was held that a person employed by a corporation, at a yearly salary, as a bookkeeper and general manager, wa's not a laborer, servant, or apprentice, within the provisions of a statute of Ne\\y 'York making the stockholders of the corporation \u201cliable for all debts that may be due and owing to -their laborers, servants and apprentices for services performed for such corporation.\u201d The view taken by .the court was that the services referred, to were menial or manual services; that he who perfonned them must be of a class who usually looked- to' the reward of a day\u2019s labor or service for immediate or present support, from whom \u2018the .'company did not expect credit, and to whom its future ability to pay was of no consequence, one who was .responsible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>no independent action, but who did a day\u2019s work or a stated job under the direction of a superior; that the word \u201c servant \u201d must be limited- by the more specific words \u201c laborer \u201d and \u201capprentice,\u201d with which it was associated, and be held to comprehend only persons performing the same kind of service that was due from laborers and'apprentices; and that a general manager was not <em>ejusdem generis </em>with an apprentice or laborer.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In <em>Gurney v. Atlantic &amp; Great Western Railway, </em>58 N. Y. 358, in 1874, a case relied on by the appellant, a receiver of a railroad company was directed by an order of court to pay out of moneys in his hands \u201c arrearages owing to the laborers and employes\u201d of the company \u201cfor labor and services actually done in connection with\u201d the company\u2019s road. Claim was made by a counsellor-at-law for professional services as counsel for the railroad company, rendered prior to the appointment of the receiver. The question raised was whether the language of the order covered employes who had not been in the stated and. regular employment of the company. . The court held that, in view of the special language of the order, it included the claim for the professional services. It appeared that the order was made as the result of negotiations in regard to which the counsel under whose advice the order was obtained testified that the word \u201cemploy\u00e9s\u201d was used in the negotiations \u201cnot in any particular or strict sense, but according to its ordinary \u2022 and general meaning, as including, attorney\u2019s compensation as well as that of other persons employed by the corporation.\u201d' The decision appears to have gone upon the ground that the person who made the claim had rendered \u201c services \u201d in connection with the railroad, and was consequently an employ\u00e9 within the meaning of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\"><em>We </em>are, therefore, of opinion that Vane had no lien Under the act of March, 1877, \u00a7 5286 of- the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">It is further contended that Vane had a lien by virtue of the general mechanics\u2019 lien law, before referred to, which was re-enacted by the act of March 6, 1883, Laws of 1883, 140; Elliott\u2019s Supplement of 18S9, \u00a7\u00a7 1688 and 1690, in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">\u201c Section 1. <em>Be it-enacted by the General Assembly of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>State of </em>Indiana, That mechanics, and all persons performing labor or furnishing material or machinery for erecting, altering, repairing, or removing any house, mill, manufactory, or other building, bridge, reservoir, system of water-works, or other structure, may have a lien, separately or jointly, upon the house, mill, manufactory, or other building, bridge, .reservoir, system of water-works or other structure, which they may have erected, altered, repaired, or removed, or for which they may have furnished material or machinery of any description, and on the interest of the owner of the lot or land on which it stands, or with which it is connected, to the extent of the value of any labor done or materials or machinery furnished, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">\u201c Sko. 3. Any person wishing to acquire such lien upon any property, whether his claim be due or not, shall file in the recorder\u2019s office of the county, at any time within sixty days after the performing of such labor or furnishing such materials or machinery, notice of his intention to hold a lien upon such property for the amount of his claim, specifically setting forth therein the amount claimed, and giving a substantial description of such lot or land on which the house, mill, manufactory, or other building, bridge, reservoir, system, of water-works, or other structure may stand or be connected with, or to which it may be removed. Any description of the lot or land in a notice of lien will be sufficient, if from such description or any reference therein, the lot of land can be identified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In regard to this it is sufficient to say that the notice of lien filed by Yane in September, ISSd, did not comply with section 3 of the statute, in regal\u2019d to a description of the \u201clot or land \u201d on which the structure stood upon which he claimed a lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u2022 A common law lien and an equitable lien are also claimed. As to the common law lien the master reported \u201cthat, by perfecting his claim for a lien under the statute, Mr. Yane waived the right he had, if any, to assert his common law lien.\u201d We concur in this view, as to the personal property and earnings of the corporation. As to the poles and wires they were real estate, on which there could be no lien, at common law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>In addition to this, Vane gave up any right he had to a common law lien as to the wires, by giving up possession of them on November 19,1884. The lien referred to in the paper of that date, signed by the receivers, as a lien claimed by Vane, was the statutory lien which he had attempted to secure by his notice dated September 15, 1884. Nor do we see any ground for saying that he had or retained an equitable lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u25a0 It is also claimed that the instrument of November 19,1884, fixed a lien upon the property. We do not so unde- stand it. It conferred nci new right upon Vane. I-t only refers to such lien, if any, as existed, \u25a0 \u2014 to'a lien claimed by him. Where it speaks of \u201c the lien of the said Vane,\u201d it refers to what it had before spoken of as the lien claimed by him. The purport of the paper is simply that the use of the wires by the receivers shall not be construed as impairing or interfering with the lien claimed by Vane, that is, with any lien which existed under the statute under which he had given and filed his notices, dated September 15, 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
