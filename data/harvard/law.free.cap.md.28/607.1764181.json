But the question of admissibility was not then before the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-6\">' The plaintiff\u2019s eighth prayer should have been granted .by the Court below, and any argument which successfully demonstrates the soundness of the legal propositions enunciated in this prayer, leads irresistibly to the conclusion, that the fourth, fifth, sixth, fifteenth, sixteenth and eighteenth prayers of the plaintiff should not have been rejected. The facts of cohabitation and recognition are not denied by the defendant; for his own witnesses, as well as those of the plaintiff, proved these facts; and upon the hypothesis that the jury believed what was not disputed, the legal effect of the whole of the defendant\u2019s evidence is brought under consideration by the eighth prayer of the plaintiff. That it is competent for the Court to pronounce upon the legal sufficiency of the whole evidence, is a principle too clearly established by the decisions of this Court to be successfully controverted. <em>Clark\u2019s Adm\u2019r vs. Marriott\u2019s Adm\u2019r, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>334; <em>Cole vs. Hebb, </em>7 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>20.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-7\">What then is the legal effect resulting from the proof of cohabitation and recognition ? That marriage and legitimacy are established, unless negatived by legally sufficient proof to the contrary. In the whole range of authorities, English and American, there are no adverse decisions, except in cases of bigamy and actions for criminal conversation. When parties live together as man and wife, the law presumes the existence of the marriage relation. The maxim <em>odiosa et inhonesta non sunt in lege presumenda </em>is strictly applicable in such cases. The law presumes against vice and immorality; and when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>two persons of opposite sexes are found living together in the intimate relations which subsist in lawful wedlock, it will not presume an illicit connection. It presumes marriage and not concubinage; for as every person is presumed to be innocent until proved to be guilty, so every man is presumed to be moral, and every woman virtuous, until the contrary is made to appear by competent proof. As the law will not presume an illicit intercourse in such cases, neither will it permit a jury to so presumo; for such presumption would be against the law, and the jury are sworn to find a verdict in accordance with the law. Now, with the exception of an alleged declaration of John Boone to George Eeed, which was excluded by. the instructions of the Court contained in the plaintiff\u2019s seventh prayer, there being no proof that such declaration was solemnly and deliberately made, the whole of the defendant\u2019s evidence is hearsay. It is unnecessary to cite authorities to show that, in the very nature of things, from hearsay evidence nothing but a presumption can arise. Now, as the law will not presume an illicit connection, any evidence which merely raised a presumption of an illicit intercourse, is legally insufficient to overthrow the proof of legitimacy arising from the facts of cohabitation and recognition; and the Court should so have instructed the jury \u2014 more especially after having told them in the plaintiff\u2019s third and seventh prayer, that the evidence must be \u201c strong, distinct, satisfactory and conclusive,\u201d in order to rebut the proof of marriage established by the facts aforesaid. \u201cIt is an established maxim that the presumption is always in favor of marriage. <em>Semper presumitur pro matrimonii. Ferrie vs. The Public Adm\u2019r, </em>4 <em>Bradf., </em>84, <em>&amp;c.; Taylor vs. Taylor, </em>2 <em>Lee, </em>124; <em>Best on Presumption, </em>57, 58; <em>Hubback on Succession, </em>248, 250.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-5\">The Court below evidently erred in rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, fifteenth, sixteenth and eighteenth prayers, and in granting the two prayers of the defendant. Having first granted the plaintiff\u2019s third and seventh prayers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>in the instructions given in the defendant\u2019s first prayer, the Court below virtually told the jury that the declarations of John Boone, not \u201cshown-to have been solemnly and deliberately made,\u201d as required by the tenor of the instructions given in the plaintiff\u2019s seventh prayer, were, together with the reputation of the neighborhood and family, \u201c strong, distinct, satisfactory and conclusive evidence.\u201d Is it such ? Why, when wholly uncontradicted, such evidence can merely raise a presumption,- and yet the jury are told that if they believe the facts that John Boone and the mother of Stephen lived together as man and wife until separated by death; that after her death, John Boone spoke of her as his wife to several witnesses; that she was buried in the family burial ground of the Boone family; that John Boone and his and her two children were buried, in conformity with his request, by her side; that John Boone made a \u201cdaily assertion\u201d that Stephen was his legitimate son by acknowledging and bringing him up as such, and in his last will and testament, the most solemn act of his whole life, calling him \u201c my son Stephen Parlett Boone,\u201d and that there was a belief in the family that John Boone and the said mother were married, as well as a belief that they were not; the jury are told that if they believe all these facts, a mere presumption arising from the weakest kind of evidence ever admitted in a Court of justice, affords <em>conducive </em>proof against the proof of legitimacy established by the facts aforesaid. If the jury believed \u201c the other facts and circumstance's \u201d referred to in the defendant\u2019s first prayer they must have found that there was a belief among a portion of the family that John Boone and the mother of Stephen were married. As there was a belief of a portion of the family that the parties were married, and a belief of another portion of the same family to the contrary, there was no <em>reputation </em>in the family; only conflicting opinions. The reputation of any particular family is the <em>general belief of the whole </em>family.\u2014 Hence, the defendant has failed to prove general reputation in the family; and as the alledged declaration of Boone to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Eeed, and the hearsay of the neighborhood in relation to a former husband being alive during the cohabitation between the parents of Stephen, can have no legal effect as evidence; the only evidence adduced adverse to the proof of legitimacy, are the opinions of certain persons connected with the family, that the parties were not married. Kow, the parties might have been married and these persons have been ignorant of the fact. So the defendant, having failed to prove the general reputation of the family, has only succeeded in establishing the fact that there were certain members of the Boone family who had no personal knowledge of the marriage. This is the whole of his evidence when carefully analyzed. Now, ignorance of the fact of a marriage certainly does not afford <em>\u201c </em>strong, distinct, satisfactory and conclusive proof\u201d that there was no marriage.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b635-5\"><em>Arthur W.

These last are essentially <em>hearsay, </em>that is, testimony by one person as to what another person has said. The rule with regard to them is well established which confines them to the family. But <em>general repute </em>is a <em>fact, </em>and may be proved by any person who is djrectly cognizant of it, and therefore can speak of his own knowledge. Mr. Starkie shows the grounds of the distinction very clearly. 2 <em>Stark. Evid., tit.

See <em>Hamick vs. Bronson, </em>5 <em>Day, </em>290; <em>Sneed vs. Ewing, et ux., </em>5 <em>J. J. Marshall, </em>491. So, Hubback, who takes great pains to show that declarations of deceased persons, to be admissible, must have proceeded from persons connected with the family, states distinctly that <em>general reputation </em>is competent evidence of a <em>marriage, </em>and also' that it is competent evidence to negative marriage and prove <em>illegitimacy. Hubback Evidence of Succession, </em>243, 649; see <em>Craufurd vs. Blackburn, </em>17 <em>Md. Rep., </em>55, and <em>Blackburn vs. Craufurd, </em>3 <em>Wallace, </em>175. It is to be observed that the evidence of general repute offered by the defendant, did not stand alone, but was offered in connection with evidence of the acts and conduct of the principal parties. Its admissibility under such circumstances, <em>seems never </em>to have been questioned.\u2014 <em>Bishop on Marr. and Divorce, sec. </em>438. That portion of it which is most strenuously objected to on behalf of the plaintiff \u2014 all indeed that seems to be made matter of serious objection \u2014 that is to say, the portion relating to' the nature of the intercourse between Boone and Betsy Parlett, and the illegitimacy of Stephen Parlett Boone and Eleanor Parlett Boone, was in answer to similar though more slight evidence of general reputation introduced on the part of the plaintiff. The evidence went to qualify, explain and complete the evidence \u2022 offered on the. other side. In the language of Judge Taney,.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>it was part of the <em>res gestee. Jewell vs. Jewell, </em>1 <em>Howard, </em>232. Is not neighborhood reputation a part of the <em>res gestee </em>?</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b637-5\">It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to invoke the principle asserted under the first point to justify the several rulings of the Court contained in the first three bills of exception. The particular passages excepted to, were so connected with other evidence as to be unobjectionable under the circumstances, or were permitted to be read in the first instance in the exercise of a judicial discretion as to the order and conduct of the trial, which could not without great practical inconvenience be open to review. It is manifest that aided as the jury were by the instructions, the plaintiff could have sustained no injury by the course which was pursued. <em>Anderson vs. Garrett, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>131.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b637-6\">The right of the Court to do what constitutes the ground of the fourth exception seems indisputable.

And the instructions given at the instance of the defendant, left the case to the jury quite as favorably for the plaintiff as he had a right to require.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b637-8\">Brent, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AMC\">delivered the opinion of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Although the record in this case is very voluminous, and the number of exceptions taken and prayers asked in the Court below is unusually large; there is in reality, as was conceded in the argument on both sides, but one important question submitted for the decision of this Court. Is general reputation admissible evidence in regard to marriage ? This kind of evidence is not to be confounded with <em>hearsay </em>evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>dence. Though generally treated of by the text writers under that head, and though composed of the speech of third persons not under oath, it is considered original evidence, and not hearsay; the immediate subject of inquiry being the concurrence of many voices, which raises the presumption, that the fact, in which they concur, is true. 1 <em>Taylor\u2019s Ev., </em>508. It must rest upon competent Knowledge, and is' therefore admitted in regard to matters only of public or general interest, the law presuming that upon such matters the public is enabled to speak knowingly and truly. In <em>Hubback\u2019s Ev. of Suc., </em>243, <em>(mar. p.) </em>it is said: \u201c reputation of marriage may be proved by the testimony of living witnesses, speaking to the existence of that reputation.\u201d tn the case of <em>Evans vs. Morgan, </em>2 <em>Crompton &amp; Jervis, </em>453, where the question of marriage was directly in issue, the testimony was held to be admissible. In reviewing this case Hubback properly states the ground of its admissibility, where <em>marriage </em>is the subject of inquiry. He says, on page 244, \u201cit appears from this case and from the general tenor of the authorities, that reputation of marriage, <em>wnlike that of other matters of pedigree, </em>may proceed from persons who are' not members of the family. The reason of the distinction is to be found in the <em>public interest, </em>which is taken in the question of the existence of a marriage between two parties; the propriety of visiting or otherwise treating them in society as husband and wife, the liability of the man for the debts of the woman, the power of the latter to act <em>suo jure, </em>and their competency to enter into new matrimonial engagements, being matters which interest not their relations alone, but every one, who, by coming in contact with them, may have occasion to regulate his conduct accordingly as he understands them to be married or not.\u201d The admissibility of this evidence is also recognized in 2 <em>Starkie on Ev., </em>843, 844, and in 3 <em>Phillips on Ev., </em>598. In the 1 <em>vol. of Greenleaf\u2019s Ev., sec. </em>107, referred to by the counsel, for the appellants, the language used by the author is not understood as adverse to its admissibility in a case like the present. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>doubt is expressed in regard to <em>\u201c </em>ordinary eases, where pedigree is not in question.\u201d In the recent and very able work of Taylor on the Law of Evidence, the testimony is regarded as proper, and the ground of its admissibility is stated with much force and clearness. In <em>section </em>517, <em>vol. </em>1, it is said, \u201c thus it has frequently been decided that, except in petitions for damages by reason of adultery and in indictments for bigamy, where strict proof of marriage is required, <em>general reputation </em>is admissible to establish the fact of parties being married. In most of the cases, the marriage has been proved by evidence of certain specific facts, such as the parties being received into society as man and wife, being visited by respectable families in the neighborhood, attending church and public places together, and otherwise demeaning themselves in public, and addressing each other as persons actually married. Still, though some of these circumstances are receivable, as amounting to acts of admission by the parties themselves, those, which are merely evidence of the <em>treatment </em>of the parties by third persons, cannot be admissible on any principle that would not equally include the declarations of strangers. The acts, like the words, merely show the opinion entertained by persons not called as witnesses; and though it may be said, that what a person does is usually better evidence of his opinion than what he says, yet this is an observation which goes rather to the weight than the admissibility of the evidence. Accordingly evidence of general reputation in the neighborhood, even when unsupported by facts, will be receivable in proof of marriage.\u201d In <em>Doe vs. Fleming, </em>4 <em>Bing., </em>266, the evidence was admitted in an action of ejectment by a party seeking to recover as heir-at-law. Park, J., remarked, \u201c the general rule is, that reputation is sufficient evidence of marriage, and a party, who seeks to impugn a principle so well established, ought, at least, to furnish cases in support of his position; \u201d and Best, C. J., added, \u201c the rule has never been doubted.\u201d In <em>Goodman vs. Goodman, </em>4 <em>Jur., N. S., </em>1224, (1858,) the principle, so emphatically announced in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>this case, is fully recognized and affirmed by the Vice Chancellor. He says, \u201c on the question of reputation of marriage the law was well settled in the case of <em>Doe vs. Flemming, </em>4 <em>Bing., </em>266.\u201d In <em>Lessee of Banert et ux. vs. Day, </em>3 <em>Wash. C. C. Rep., </em>243, the evidence was admitted, and it was held that it was no objection that the witness, who deposed to the general reputation, was not a member of the family. The doctrine is also recognized in <em>Sellman vs. Bowen, </em>8 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>54; <em>Ex parte Taylor, </em>9 <em>Paige, </em>617; <em>Clayton vs. Wardell, </em>4 <em>Comstock, </em>230. In <em>Spedden vs. Patrick, </em>2 <em>Swabey &amp; Tristram, </em>170, <em>(Jur. Dig. of </em>1861, p. 83,) the rule is correctly laid down, and as there stated is in accordance with our own views. It is there said that \u201c evidence by a witness of reputation of marriage is admissible so long as it appears to be a general reputation; so soon as it appe'ars, however, on cross-examination or otherwise, that the witness is speaking from information given him by some individual, even of the existence of a general reputation, such evidence is merely hearsay, and as such is inadmissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The cases relied upon by the appellants\u2019 counsel have been carefully examined, and they are not in conflict with the authorities above cited. They are either cases in which the question of <em>marriage </em>is not directly in issue, or in which the proof offered was inadmissible upon the ground of its being merely hearsay. In <em>Stein vs. Bowman, et al., </em>13 <em>Peters, </em>209, so strongly urged in the argument on behalf of the appellants, the testimony rejected by the Court, was that of a witness, who was introduced to prove that he had <em>heard, </em>in Hanover, Germany, \u201cfrom many old persons of whom he inquired, that the plaintiff was the brother of Nicholas Stone, deceased.\u201d It will be readily perceived that the question there presented, and to which the reasoning of the Court is confined, was wholly different from the one involved in this case. The evidence was clearly <em>hearsay, </em>and the Court regarding it as such held it to be inadmissible \u2014 not coming within the lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>ited rule admitting from necessity, hearsay evidence in cases of pedigree.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">After a very patient examination of the numerous authorities cited in the argument of this case, we have concluded that general reputation in regard to marriage may be proved by the testimony of a witness speaking from his own knowledge of the existence of .such general reputation, except in cases of adultery or bigamy, in which strict proof is required. In reference to the position that general reputation, even if admissible to prove marriage, is not admissible to negative a presumption of marriage from cohabitation, it may be said, that the evidence is not admitted upon the ground that the public has an interest in proving a marriage, but upon the ground of a public interest in the question of a marriage between two parties. It is admissible as a fact, to show whether or not a marriage exists. When a question is propounded to a witness its legality cannot be made to dejrend upon the affirmative or negative character of his answer. It must, therefore, follow, as argued by the appellants\u2019 counsel, \u201c if such evidence is competent to prove marriage, it is competent in disproof of marriage.\u201d Upon these views of the law this case will be decided; \u2014 and there is therefore no error in the Court below in admitting the testimony, objected to by the appellants, in the second and third exceptions. The evidence offered in the first exception and ruled out by the Court, was afterwards admitted under the agreement of counsel, which the appellants repudiated in their first oifer, and they have had the benefit of it <em>before </em>the jury. They have therefore sustained no injury, and the question raised by this exception having become a more abstraction, tire ruling below even if it appeared to be erroneous, will not be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">We do not perceive anything in the fourth exception which can entitle the appellants to a reversal. The testimony, to the admission of which they had only reserved an exception, was by permission of the Court withdrawn by the defendant before the bill of exceptions embodying it was presented, before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>prayers were submitted, and before the counsel of either party had gone before the jury. The exception is to the permission of the Court allowing the testimony to be withdrawn. Under the law, as above announced, it is probable that the testimony was admissible, but whether admissible or not, it being withdrawn and 'the jury directed not to consider it in making up their verdict, we cannot see that any harm resulted to the appellants, or any error was committed requiring the intervention of this Court in their behalf. The fifth exception was abandoned at the argument. The sixth exception presents for consideration the prayers offered on both sides. The first prayer of the defendant correctly lays down the law in the case, and is sustained by the views we have expressed in regard to the admissibility of evidence of general reputation. The evidence of a previous marriage of Elizabeth Parlett to one Parlett, and his surviving her, upon which the Second prayer of the defendant is based, was admitted without objection. The evidence relied upon by the appellants to establish a marriage between Boone and Elizabeth Parlett, raised a presumption only of such marriage, and did not amount to strict proof. The province of the jury was to determine upon the facts before them, whether or not such a marriage had really existed. If Elizabeth was the wife of Parlett, and he survived her, she could not have contracted a valid marriage with Boone. This prayer was therefore properly granted, and the fifth, sixth, fifteenth, sixteenth and eighteenth prayers of the plaintiff, presenting substantially the converse, were properly refused. The fourth prayer of the plaintiff extends the law to its utmost verge, even where there is strict proof of marriage, but is not applicable to a case like the present, in which a presumption only of marriage is raised by the proof. The eighth prayer, in view of all the evidence in the case, could not have been granted, arid there being no evidence in the record upon which the seventeenth prayer is based, it is unnecessary to examine the question sought to be raised by it. The law was most liberally stated for the appellants by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Court below in granting, with the consent of the defendant, their first, second, third, seventh, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth prayers. The instructions granted fully covered the law in the case, and the judgment below must be affirmed.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b643-6\">(Decided 8th May, 1868.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
