If the jury believe from the evidexico that the said John Higgins affixed his mark to the paper writixig, propounded as his last will, and that in doing so, he was assisted by the witness Stephen, by the request, or with the assent of said Higgins, and that thereupon the said Higgins was asked if he acknowledged the same to be his mark, or words to that effect, to which he assented, and that thereupon he was asked by the said Stephen, whether he wished the witnesses Gallaxxt, Scott axxd himself to attest it as his last will axxd testaxxxexxt, or words to that effect, to which he assexxtcd, and thereupon said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>witnesses did attest the same, by subscribing their names thereto, by his request, in his presence, and in the presence of each other, said paper writing was then delivered by said Stephen to the testator, and that the testator then handed said paper writing to his wife, and requested her to take care of it; then the said paper writing was duly executed, provided the jury shall further find that at such execution, the testator was of sound and disposing mind, and mentally capable of executing a valid deed or contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-5\">2d. That the presumption of law is in favor of the sanity of the testator, and of his capacity to make a will, and the burden of proof is on the caveators to establish, a want of testamentary capacity, in order to justify the jury in setting aside the will on that ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-6\">3d. The law concedes to a man of sound mind, the right to dispose of his property in any manner he may deem proper, consistent with its policy, arid it is no valid objection to a will that the testator gave his property to his wife, or to strangers to his blood, provided ho was mentally competent, and was free from undue influences at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-7\">4th. It is not sufficient to avoid a will and testament, that its dispositions are imprudent and not to be accounted for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-8\">5th. Withdrawn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-9\">6th. If the jury believe from all the evidence in the cause, that the only influence ever possessed or exercised by Mary Higgins, his wife, over the testator, her husband, was that of a kind and affectionate wife,, gained by her virtues, affection and kindly offices and attentions, then the existence of such an influence so possessed, acquired and exerted, is of itself no ground for setting aside the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-10\">7th. Every person of twenty-one years of age, is presumed to be of sound mind and competent to make a will, and this presumption extends throughout his life, no matter to what age he may live; the <em>onus </em>of establishing incapacity is on the parties who assail the will; extreme old age does not of itself disqualify a person for making a will; the law looks only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>to the competency of the understanding, and neither age nor sickness, nor extreme distress, nor debility of body, will affect the capacity to make a will if sufficient intelligence remain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-5\">8th. Should the-jury find the due execution by John Higgins, of the paper writing described in the issues in this cause, and further find that the said John Higgins was of sound mind, and capable of executing a valid deed or contract, at the execution of such paper writing, then that, in order to set aside said paper writing upon the ground of undue influence, the jury must be satisfied from all the evidence in the case, not only that such influence existed, but that it was exerted for the purpose of procuring the execution of said paper writing, and that the same was obtained by means of the undue influences so exerted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-6\">9th. That the undue influence which will avoid a will, must be an unlawful influence, on account of the manner and motive of its exertion, and must be exerted to such a degree as to amount to force or coercion, destroying free agency; it must not be the influence of affection or attachment, nor the mere desire of gratifying the wishes of another, for that would be a very stong ground in favor of a testatmentary act; and there must be satisfactory proof that the will was obtained by this coercion, or by importunities which could not be resisted, so that the motive was tantamount to force or fear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-7\">10th. Should the jury believe from the evidence in the cause, that the supposed testator, John Higgins, was of sound and disposing mind, and capable of making a valid deed or contract, at the time of executing and acknowledging the paper writing in the issue mentioned, purporting to be his last will and testament, and that he did execute and acknowledge the said paper writing as his last will and testament, they should find for the caveatees on the first and second issues, notwithstanding the jury might believe he was incapable of making a valid deed or contract, at any prior or subsequent time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>11th. That if the jury find from the evidence in the cause, that John Higgins was, at the time of executing the will referred to iu this case, of sound and disposing mind, and capable of making a valid deed or contract, then he was in the possession of that description of mental capacity, which is required by the testamentary act of this State, and that the meaning of the words, \u201csound and disposing mind and capable of making a valid deed or contract\u201d in respect to the disposition of his property by last will and testament, is, that he must have had sufficient capacity at the time of executing the said will, to make a disposition of his estate with judgment and understanding in reference to the amount and situation of his property, and the relative claims of the different persons who should have been the objects of his bounty. But the meaning of the words judgment and understanding, is not that the jury should reject the will because they may believe that it is in its provisions unjust and injudicious, although the provisions of the will may be considered by them, in deciding the question as to the capacity or incapacity of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-5\">12th. That from the whole evidence in the case, it is competent for the jury to find the due execution of the will in issue, and a sufficient testamentary capacity in the testator, although one of the subscribing witnesses may have testified against the due execution of the will aforesaid, and against the testamentary capacity of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-6\">13th. That the influence which will avoid the will must be exerted to such a degree, as to amount to force or coercion, destroying free agency, it must not be the influence of affection or attachment, nor the mere desire of gratifying the wishes of another, for that would be a very strong ground in favor of a testamentary act, and there must be satisfactory proof that the will was obtained by this coercion or by importunities which could not be resisted, so that the motive was tantamount to force or fear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-7\">The third, eighth and tenth prayers, were admitted by consent, the ninth was rejected, and the Court granted the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>prayers, and instructed the jury accordingly; to this ruling of the Court, the caveators excepted. And the verdict being . in favor of the caveatees, the caveators appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b138-5\">The cause was argued before Bartol, C.

Pratt </em>for the appellants, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-7\">1st. That there was error in the ruling of the Court, which constituted the first exception. Because on cross-examination, the question was proper in order to test the <em>accuracy of the recollection of the witness, </em>and to contradict the evidence given by the witness on his examination in chief, that \u201che drew the will from a memorandum placed in his hands by Mrs. Higgins, at the suggestion of Mr. Higgins. 1 <em>Greenl. Ev., sec. </em>446. The question was also- admissible in determining the <em>genuineness </em>of the memorandum. The validity of the will must depend upon the establishment of the memorandum, from which it was prepared. Was it the memorandum of Higgins ? If the will were not drawn from the memoran-, dum, furnished by Higgins, it was not his will. The drawer of the will, Stephen, upon cross-examination admitted that in preparing the will, he did not pursue the memorandum exclusively.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-8\">2d. That the Court erred in permitting the witness Stephen to give his reasons for making in the will, a change from the memorandum in reference to the devise of the land to Mrs. Eerrall.' Having stated that he neither consulted nor talked with Higgins about the Eerrall land, but that he, the witness, put the clause in, the reasons which governed him were altogether <em>irrelevant. </em>The case of <em>Burckmyer &amp; Adams vs. Whiteford, </em>6 <em>Gill, </em>13, does not sustain the ruling of the Court. In that case the witness had made no answer to the question, which showed that his reasons were <em>irrelevant. </em>Suppose the witness in that case, had, in reply to the question, <em>first </em>stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>that the act of erasure was <em>unauthorized, </em>would it have been competent for him to go further, and state <em>his reasons </em>for doing an unauthorized act?</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-5\">3d. That the Court committed error in not permitting the witness Scott, (who had attested the will), upon cross-examination to explain why he objected to witnessing the will, he having stated in his examination in chief that he had so objected. The propriety of the question is sustained by the case of <em>Burckmyer &amp; Adams vs. Whiteford, </em>6 <em>Gill, </em>13. The witness might have stated, in reply to the question, facts pertinent to the issues. The ground of his objection might have been, that Higgins was too near death to comprehend the nature of the act of signing the will; or that fraud was being used or duress was employed to procure the execution or signing of the paper. 1 <em>Greenl.

The question, the' refusal to permit which to be answered, is the ground <em>of </em>the fourth exception, was proper; it was not put to the witness as an <em>expert. </em>Where a witness has had opportunities of knowing and observing the conversation, conduct and manners of a person whpse sanity is in question, it has been held that the witness may depose not only to particular facts, but as to his opinion or belief as to the sanity of the party, founded on such actual observation. <em>Clary vs. Clary, </em>2 <em>Iredell, </em>78; 1 <em>Greenl.

If the facts upon which an expert bases his opinion are incorrect, this can be shown in order to destroy the force and effect of his opinion; 1 <em>Greenl.

The modification of this prayer, while it correctly defines \u201c credible witnesses \u201d as competent witnesses at the time of attestation or execution, (2 <em>Greenl. Ev., sec. 691; Shaffer\u2019s Lessee vs. Corbett, 3 H. &amp; McH., </em>513,) makes <em>infancy </em>a reason of incompetency. We have been unable to find any case which renders the mere fact of infancy a ground of incompetency in a subscribing witness. The fifth prayer of the caveators was also correct and needed no modification. <em>Code of Public Gen\u2019l Laws, Art. </em>93, <em>section </em>301; <em>Cramer vs. Crumbaugh, </em>3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>491; 2 <em>Greenl. Ev., secs. </em>675, 676, <em>and notes. </em>The finding of the facts stated in the modification of this prayer, did not warrant the jury in finding a <em>sufficient </em>request, unless they found another fact not embraced in the prayer: that at the time \u201che said he did, or assented by a nod \u201d <em>he Imew the instrument to be his will. </em>The modification singles out the testimony of only one witness, Mrs. Higgins, and predicates an instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>on that alone, without reference to the. evidence of other witnesses \u2014 this is error; it is also erroneous in that it permits the jury to find a sufficient request to the attestation, although they find that the will was not signed by the testator, or by any other person by his express direction, and in his presence. There can be no sufficient attestation if the will have never been properly signed or executed. 2 <em>Greenl.

In support of the eleventh prayer1 it is insisted, that where the capacity of the testator is impeached, the <em>onus probandi </em>is on the party propounding the will. Testamentary capacity is defined by statute. To establish a will, therefore, there must be proof both of capacity and of the fact of execution. <em>Code, Pub.

The first prayer of the eaveatees was improperly granted, because it does not require the jury to find that the said paper writing was either signed by the said John Higgins, or by some other person in his presence, and by his express directions. It also assumes that .a mere <em>subsequent assent </em>on the part of the testator, without a previous express direction, is equivalent to an express direction, which is error in a case where the signature is made by another person. It is further erroneous because it does not require the jury to find that Stephen, Scott and Gallant, at the time of the attestation, were credible, <em>i. e., </em>competent witnesses. Unless attested by three or four credible or competent witnesses, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>paper writing was utterly void and of none effect. <em>Collins vs. Nicols, </em>1 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>399; <em>Code, Pub.

The second prayer was improperly granted, if the authorities referred to, sustain the eleventh prayer of the caveators. See authorities referred to in support of the eleventh prayer of the caveators. The fourth prayer ought not to have been granted, because it was a mere abstract proposition of law, and too general. <em>Hurn\u2019s Lessee vs. Soper, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>276; <em>Coale vs. Harrington, </em>7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>147; <em>Penn vs. Flack and Cooley, </em>3 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>369. The sixth prayer is erroneous, because it asserts that an influence gained by the virtues, affection and kindly offices of a wife, cannot be exerted over a testator, so as to invalidate a will. If the influence gained in this way, was so overcoming and powerful, that the testator was unable to resist the same in making a disposition of his property, and deprived him <em>offree agency, </em>such an influence would be sufficient to set aside a will. <em>Davis vs. Calvert, 5 Gill &amp; John., </em>302. The seventh prayer is excepted to, because it is a mere declaration of general principles, and does not apply them to the facts in the caso; and because it announces principles of law inconsistent with the eleventh prayer of the caveators, which is supported by the cases cited. The thirteenth prayer is erroneous, because it denies that the influence of affection may not be exerted to such an extent as to invalidate a will or testament. <em>Davis vs. Calvert, </em>5 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>302.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b142-5\"><em>James Bevell </em>and <em>Bobt.

Thereupon, it was insisted on the part of the caveators, that the witness should give the reasons why he objected at first; but the Court as we think, very properly refused the demand. The reasons of the witness were not asked for by ns, nor were they pertinent to the issue. 1 <em>Greenl. Ev., sec. </em>443; <em>Bootle vs. Blundel, </em>19 <em>Vesey, </em>502, 508.

Issues involving execution, testamentary capacity, fraud and undue influence, were sent up for trial to the Circuit Court for that county. Upon application by the caveatees the case was afterwards removed to the Circuit Court for Anno Arundel county, and it now comes before us upon the several exceptions, taken by the caveators at the trial, to the rulings of that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The first exception alleges error in the Court in refusing to allow a witness, upon cross-examination, to testify in regard to the difference between the contents of a memorandum and the will in controversy. It is necessary in deciding upon the admissibility of this evidence to refer to a part of the testimony previously given by this witness. He was the attorney who drew the will; and upon his examination in chief had stated, that it \u201cwas drawn from a memorandum placed in his hands by Mrs. Higgins, to whom, at the suggestion of Mr. Higgins, he applied for it.\u201d Upon cross-examination, the caveators asked him to produce this memorandum. This he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>did, and handed it over to them. Upon further cross-examination he testified to certain discrepancies between it and the will, and to the fact \u201cthat in drawing the will he did not pursue the memorandum exclusively.\u201d He was then asked, \u201cif the memorandum differed from the will in any other respects?\u201d Upon objection being made _ by the counsel for the caveatees, the Court refused to permit the question to be answered. It has been argued that the evidence was admissible upon three grounds \u2014 to test the accuracy of the recollection of the witness, to contradict him, and to prove the <em>genuineness </em>of the memorandum. The last ground is wholly untenable, and is too clearly in violation of the rules of evidence to be seriously entertained. As a general proposition, a party has the undoubted right, upon cross-examination, to test the accuracy of the recollection of a witness, and to show that his statements are contradictory. But this cannot be done in violation of other equally well settled rules. The memorandum referred to, had not been given in evidence to the jury, and it is apparent that the witness could not have answered the question, put to him by the caveators, without proving by <em>parol </em>a part, if not all, of its contents. It is no reason in favor of the admissibility of this evidence, that the witness had been permitted to speak, without .objection, of some of the differences between this memorandum and the will. The fact that illegal testimony has been permitted to go to the jury, without objection, cannot be urged as a ground for allowing other testimony, inadmissible under the rules of evidence, to be given when objection is made. This memorandum being in Court, its contents could not be proved by parol for any purpose. TYhat is in writing must be proved by the writing itself. In the <em>Queen\u2019s case, </em>2 <em>Bro. &amp; Bing., </em>288, (6 <em>E. C. L. Reps., </em>115,) the following question was submitted to the Judges, \u201cwhether, when a witness is cross-examined, and upon the production of a letter to the witness under cross-examination, the witness admits that he wrote that letter, the witness can be examined in the Court below, whether he did or did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>not in such letter make statements, sncli as the counsel shall, by questions addressed to the witness, inquire are or are not made therein?\u201d They unanimously determined that the evidence was inadmissible. Abbott, C. J., in delivering their opinion, remarks, \u201cthe Judges do not conceive that they are presuming to offer any new rule of evidence, now for the first time introduced by them; but, that they found their opinion upon what, in their judgment, is a rule of evidence as old as any part of the common law of England, namely, that the contents of a written instrument, if it be in existence, are to be proved by that instrument itself, and not by parol evidence.\u201d The offer in this case is clearly within the prohibition of the rule, for the question could not have been answered without proving by parol, the contents of the memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The case of <em>Burckmyer &amp; Adams vs. Whiteford, </em>6 <em>Gill, </em>13, if any authority is needed, disposes of the second exception. The witness was asked, \u201cwhy he made in the will the change from the memorandum, in reference to the devise of the lands to Mrs. Eerrall'?\u201d His reasons for doing so are certainly responsive to the question. Upon his proceeding, however, to give them, the very party asking the question, objected. It is now argued that they were inadmissible, because the necessary inference of their being irrelevant was raised by the witness stating \u201che did not consult Higgins or talk with him upon the subject.\u201d The reasons given by the witness are not in the record, nor is it necessary that we should know what they were, in determining the point as it is presented. Looking, however, to the preceding testimony, the inference is in favor of their relevancy, or at least it cannot be assumed they were necessarily irrelevant. A third party, at the request of Higgins, may have directed the alteration to be made. That it was done by his authority, and for reasons satisfactory to him, cannot be doubted. The devise, as it is found in the will, was approved by Higgins, for this witness states, that after preparing the will, \u201c he read it to the testator <em>verbatim et literatim, </em>who ratified it.\u201d We do not, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>fore, perceive that there was any error, or injustice done to the appellants, in permitting the witness to answer a question put to him by themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">It has been repeatedly settled by the decisions of this Court, that a judgment will not he reversed, where it appeal's from the record, the appellants have not been injured by the rulings of the Court below, although such rulings may be erroneous. For this purpose, it is proper to look to the whole record, and not, as was argued in this case, to that part only of the record, which precedes and includes the particular exception under consideration. \"We think it unnecessary, and do not mean to express any opinion upon the question presented by the third exception. The error there complained of, even conceding the ruling of the Court to be wrong, does no injury to the appellants. The testimony, sought to be elicited by them, is afterwards given by the witness, Scott, and is found in the evidence contained in the seventh exception. He there assigns his reasons for objecting to sign the will in controversy, as one of the attesting witnesses, and the appellants have had the benefit of those reasons before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The fourth exception is taken to the refusal of the Court below to allow a witness to give in evidence his opinion of the \u201c physical capacity \u201d of the testator to hold conversations testified to by another witness, the witness under examination not being present. It is properly said in <em>Phillips vs. Kingfield, </em>1 <em>Appleton\u2019s R., </em>379, that \u201cthe opinions of a witness are not legal testimony except in special (\u00a1ases; such for example, as experts in some profession or art, those of the witnesses to a will, and in our practice, opinions on the value of property. In other cases, the witness is not to substitute his opinion for that of the jury ; nor are they to rely upon any such opinion instead of exercising their own judgment, taking into consideration the whole testimony.\u201d The Courts of Maryland have gone a step further, and allowed witnesses to express their opinion upon the menial condition of a testator, whose will is controverted, unless it be a more naked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>opinion, unaccompanied by the facts and circumstances upon which it is founded. It is not claimed that the witness in this case is an expert, nor is he brought within any of the other exceptions to the rules. We have failed to find a single authority in which testimony of this character has been admitted. The rule has already been sufficiently relaxed, and we think the doctrine of admitting the opinions of witnesses has been carried quite as far, as is consistent with a proper administration of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The fifth exception having been abandoned by the appellants, the next question arises upon the sixth exception. The witness was asked, for the purpose of laying a foundation to contradict her, \u201c if she had ever had a conversation with the witness Scott, in reference to the memorandum from which the will was drawn?\u201d Having answered in the negative, Scott was afterwards called, and the question, set out in this exception, put to him by the caveators. The Court, upon objection made, refused to permit him to answer it; and in this refusal the appellants allege there is error. In <em>Whiteford vs. Burckmyer, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>139, the rule is laid down, that \u201cthe witness, whom it is intended to impeach, should have a full and fair opportunity to recollect, by calling his attention to dates, names and other attendant circumstances connected with the matter, about which he is charged to have made different statements.\u201d In the present case the memorandum spoken of, had been written nine months before the date of the will in controversy, and to have given the witness \u201ca full and fair opportunity to recollect,\u201d her attention should have been called to something more than the name of the party. The question embraced a long period of time; and justice to the witness required that her attention should have been directed, at least with a reasonable degree of certainty, to dates and other attendant. circumstances. The question put to her was of the most general character; and for the purpose for which it was asked, is liable to another fatal objection. She was not asked whether she had made certain statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>about this memorandum to the witness Scott, but simply if she had ever conversed with him about it. Where the object is to lay a proper foundation to discredit a witness by proof of any thing he may have said, it is not alone sufficient to direct \u201chis attention to dates, names and other attendant circumstances ;\u201d he must also be asked <em>\u201c </em>whether or no he has said or declared that, which is intended to be proved.\u201d\u2014 2 <em>Brod. &amp; Bing., </em>313. In this view of the law, we think a proper foundation was not laid for the introduction of the testimony offered, and that the Court was right in rejecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The seventh exception also presents a matter of evidence. The question asked by the caveators was irregular. The caveatees had closed their case, and the caveators, at that stage of the trial, were entitled <em>strictly </em>to offer rebutting evidence only. The evidence offered was not of that character. It certainly could not have had the effect to contradict the witness whose testimony it was designed to impeach. He had made no statement that Scott had testified to rational or irrational conversations on the part of the testator. If the testimony had already been given, it was only asking the witness to repeat what he had before said; and if it had not, it wras testimony properly adrnissible upon his examination in chief. In either event the Court had the right to reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We do not concur in the views, urged by the counsel for the appellants, in reference to the right and power of the Court, of its own motion, to modify a prayer. To deny this right -would be undertaking-1^ change a practice long established in this State, having its foundation in reason, and well calculated to advance a proper administration of justice. The right to modify a prayer, and error in the modification made, present totally different questions. In the cases referred to by the appellants\u2019 counsel, (6 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>399; 1 <em>Gill, </em>280,) the prayers granted by the Court below were not reversed because the Court had no right to modify them, but because as granted they were erroneous. In <em>Keener vs. Harrod &amp; Brooke, </em>2 <em>Md. Rep., </em>74, this question was reviewed, and we regard it as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>finally settled by that case. The Court say, \u201chowever, as a general rule, it may be proper to grant or refuse prayers in the terms in which they are presented, the Court may reject them all and instruct the jury in their own words, or grant the prayers with such explanations or qualifications as may be necessary to a proper understanding of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The next question to be considered is, were the modifications of the caveators\u2019 third and fifth prayers correct, or in other words, did the prayers as granted truly state the law of the case? The term \u201ccredible witnesses,\u201d found in the third prayer, is now settled beyond dispute, as conceded in the appellants\u2019 brief, to mean \u201ccompetent witnesses at the time of attestation.\u201d 2 <em>Greenl. Ev., sec. </em>691; 3 <em>Har. &amp; McH., </em>513. In giving therefore to the word \u201ccredible\u201d in the connection in which it is used in the prayer, its technical and legal signification, the Court correctly stated the law, and gave to the jury such explanation of its meaning as was doubtless \u201cnecessary to a proper understanding of the case.\u201d The restrictions, in the prayer as modified, upon the competency of attesting witnesses, \u201cby reason of infancy, insanity, or mental imbecility, or any other cause,\u201d even if erroneous, could not have resulted in injury to the appellants, for the restrictions apply to the appellees and not to them. The argument, that this prayer submits to the jury questions proper only for the Court, is fully met by the Act of 1862, ch. 154. This law provides that an instruction shall not be reversed \u201cbecause of a question of law having been thereby submitted to the jury, unless it appears from the record, that such objection was taken at the trial.\u201d This objection must appear affirmatively upon the record, and is not to be left as a matter of inference. This record is silent as to any such objection \u201ctaken at the trial,\u201d and it cannot, therefore, be now urged before this Court.\u2014 <em>Lane, Adm\u2019x of Horine vs. Lantz, </em>27 <em>Md. Rep. </em>\u2014; <em>Morrison &amp; Kildow vs. Hammond\u2019s Lessee, </em>27 <em>Md. Rep. </em>\u2014. The facts stated by the Court below, in the modification of the fifth prayer, are sufficient in law, if found by the jury, to constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>a legal request by the testator for the subscribing witnesses to attest his will. The testamentary law of this State does not require that a testator should ask them to attest it. His assent, either express or implied, is sufficient; provided \u201c the act be done with his knowledge, and not in a clandestine and fraudulent way. <em>Sec. </em>301, <em>Art. </em>93, <em>of the Code of Pub. Gen\u2019l Laws, </em>referring to the attestation of wills, is in these words: \u201cand shall be attested and subscribed in the presence of the said devisor by three or four credible witnesses.\u201d If the prayer had been granted by the Court, without the qualification annexed, the instruction might have misled the jury, in supposing that the law required the testator to <em>ask </em>the witnesses to sign his will \u2014 the word <em>request </em>being ordinarily understood in that sense. The Court was therefore right in stating facts, in its modification of the prayer, which, if found by the jury, were sufficient to establish in law the attestation of this will. 5 <em>Har. &amp; Johns., </em>480; 3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>501; 8 <em>Md. Rep., </em>23; In <em>White vs. British Museum, </em>6 <em>Bing., </em>310, Tindal, C. J., says, that \u201c in the execution of wills as well as of deeds, the maxim will hold good, <em>\u2018non quod dictum sed quod factum est, inspicitur.\u2019 \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The question as to the <em>onus probandi, </em>where the issue is <em>testamentary capacity, </em>has been a great deal discussed by both Judges and text-writers, and has furnished an occasion for the display of much learning and ingenuity. The numerous decisions upon the subject, in this country, are by no means uniform, and many of them are in direct conflict, so that any attempt to reconcile them would be hopeless. They all, however, agree upon the general proposition, that sanity is presumed by law. But, in some of the States, it is held, that this general presumption does not apply to last wills and testaments \u2014 they forming an exception to the rule \u2014 and that therefore a party propounding a will must not only prove execution, but must also offer positive proof of capacity. 22 <em>Maine Rep., </em>438; 24 <em>Maine Rep., </em>162; 2 <em>Gray, </em>524. A different rule, however, is recognized in most of the American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Courts, and it is sustained by reason and the Aveight of authority. 5 <em>Johns. R., </em>144; 2 <em>Green\u2019s Ch. R., </em>580; 7 <em>Pick., </em>94; 4 <em>Wash. C. C. R., </em>269; 1 <em>Redfield on Wills, Ch. 3, Sec. </em>IV, <em>sec. </em>5. If the presumption of Lav is in favor of sanity, Ave can discover no satisfactory reason Avhy it should not be applied to Avills, as Avell as to any other instrument of Avriting. The argument draAvn from the fact, that the statute requires the testator to be \u201c of sound and disposing mind,\u201d if a good one, would apply Avith equal force to the other requirements of the statute. The testator, in terms as affirmative as those in reference to capacity, is required to be of a certain age fixed by the statute. Yet no Court has ever required a party, propounding a Avill, to prove the age of the testator, until the question Avas raised upon proof by the contestants. \"Why the one should be permitted to rest undisturbed upon the doctrine of presumption, and not the other, to say the least, does not seem to be in accordance Avith sound reason. In <em>Swinburne, </em>44, <em>pt. </em>2, <em>sec. </em>3, it is. said, \u201cevery person is presumed to be of perfect mind and memory unless the contrary is proved. If it be asked wherefore, then, is that usual clause (of perfect mind and memory) so duly observed in every testament,\u2019 if he that doth prefer the will be not charged with the proof thereof? It may be answered that that which is notorious is to be alleged, not proved. And so this being accounted notorious (because where the contrary appeareth not, the laAV presurncth it) it need not\u2019 be proved.\u201d This doctrine is recognised to its full extent, and affirmed in the cases last above referred to; and the rule is distinctly laid doAvn as a logical conclusion from the presumption in favor of sanity, that \u201cthe burthen of proof lies upon the person Avho asserts unsoundness of mind; unless a previous state of insanity has been established, in Avhich case, the burthen is shifted to him Avho claims under the will.\u201d In referring to the doctrine laid down in 2 <em>Southard, </em>454, that \u201c <em>after probate, </em>the sanity of the testator AAras always to be presumed in favor of the will, the insanity to be proved by him that alleges it,\u201d the Court say in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>Sloan vs. Maxwell, 2 Green\u2019s Ch. R., </em>580, by the words <em>after probate, </em>we are to understand after proof of <em>formal execution.\u201d </em>These authorities rest upon sound reasoning. They, also, harmonise with the ancient rule of presumption in favor of sanity, and thereby escape the fallacy \u201cof requiring a party to give positive proof of the existence of a fact, which the law presumes, in the absence of all proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The practice in this State has been in conformity to these views of the law. The caveators have always taken the position of plaintiffs, and have had the right to open and close the case. <em>Brooke vs. Townshend, and others, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>24, is conclusive upon this question of practice. In the Court below the caveatees claimed the right of opening and concluding the argument before the jury. The question coming before this Court upon appeal, Mr. Justice Maxitut, in delivering the opinion, says, \u201cthe issues in dispute and .transmitted to the County Court for the determination of a jury, are predicated on an affirmation of facts, introduced for the purpose of impeaching the will, by the caveators on the one side, and a negation of those facts by the caveatee in his answer. And it appears to us to be perfectly clear, that in a case thus situated, the caveators are to be regarded as the assailants of the will, as the <em>actors </em>who originated this proceeding, and who were therefore entitled to be placed upon the record in the attitude of plaintiffs.\u201d This ease also decides, that the <em>factum </em>of the will being conceded by the pleadings, the will must be placed, by the caveators, in evidence before the jury. The Court refrained from expressing any opinion upon the \u201cpresumption of its validity,\u201d as they considered the question a mere abstract one, in the form in which it was presented by the exception. But the reasoning of the Judge, and the rulings upon the first two exceptions can lead to no other conclusion, than one in favor of the presumption of mental capacity, after the <em>factum </em>or execution of a will is admitted, or proved, if put in issue by the pleadings. That the law may be consistent in all its parts, the true doctrine must be, that whenever satisfactory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>proof establishes the doing of an act, especially if it conform to the formalities required by law, it must be considered, in the absence of opposing proof, as done by a reasonable and sane man. The very general language used in <em>Cramer vs. </em>Crumbaugh, 3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>501, cannot be taken to control and alter this principle. It is true that it is said in that cas\u00e9, upon the authority of <em>Mr. Baron Parke, </em>1 <em>Curteis, </em>637, (6 <em>Eng. Eccl. Rep., </em>417,) that the party propounding a will, has . the <em>onus </em>imposed on him and he must discharge it \u201cby proof of capacity and the fact of execution.\u201d But the <em>quo modo </em>of proof must be in harmony with other recognised rules and principles. If capacity be established by evidence of a fact from which it is to be presumed,- \u201cproof of capacity\u201d has in reality been given; and the <em>onus </em>cast upon the party propounding a will. is discharged by proof of execution, because that being proved,, the presumption of capacity folloivs. Believing, after a very careful examination, that we are correct in our view of the law upon this question, we are of opinion that there was no error in rejecting the eleventh prayer of the caveators, and in granting the second prayer of the caveatees.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b156-8\">(Decided 5th February, 1868.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"AWW\">The remaining questions, arising upon the various prayers of the caveatees, which have been excepted to, are readily disposed of by reference <em>to </em>adjudicated cases. The first prayer is fully sustained by the case of <em>Mason vs. Harrison, </em>5 <em>Har. &amp; Johns., </em>480, and conforms to the views already expressed upon the modification of the caveators\u2019 fifth prayer. The fourth, sixth, seventh, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth prayers, as applicable to the evidence in the record of this case, contain familiar principles of law,'so firmly established by numerous and uniform decisions, that it is now too late to call them into question. 1 <em>Hagg., </em>577; 3 <em>Ser. &amp; Rawle, </em>269; 3 <em>Wharton, </em>137; 22 <em>Wendell, </em>540; 1 <em>Green\u2019s Ch.
