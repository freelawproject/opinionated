The declaration charged that the defendants, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>building a wall on the bank of the stream in Baltimore county, at a point on said stream above said mill, and the dam therewith connected, where the water of the stream was accustomed to escape in freshets, caused the stream when swollen by rain, to wash away and destroy the plaintiff\u2019s mill-dam, so that his mill could not be worked for a long space of time, to the great damage of the plaintiff, <em>&amp;c. </em>Upon the application of the <em>plaintiff\\ </em>the case was removed to the Circuit Court for Howard county, where it was tried at the September Term, 1862, and judgment rendered for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-5\">The dam in question was erected by the plaintiff, in the year 1854, at a place where no dam had been before. A former dam of the same mill, built by the father of George Ellicott, in 1827, had existed much higher up the stream, and had been suffered to decay. The new one was placed about a hundred yards lower down, close to the mill, and below a bend in the river, for the purpose qf securing a flow of water towards the right bank or Howard county side of the Patapsco, the mill being on that side. The road in question running along the left or Baltimore county bank of the Patapsco, had been used as a public road ever since the year 1827 or 1828, when the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Company removed part of a large rock, known as Buzzard\u2019s rock, which had previously obstructed all passage of vehicles down that side of the river. In 1836, in order that said road might be thoroughly opened and thereafter kept in repair, it was condemned and opened as a public county road, by proceedings founded on an application of Jonathan Ellicott <em>&amp; </em>Sons, and a number of other citizens; and since that time, the road has been regularly worked and mended by Supervisors of Roads of Baltimore county. The erection of the said dam on the present site, so much further down than the old one, raised the water opposite the mill, and between the new and old sites of the dam, some five or six feet, and to within a few inches of the surface of the road, and caused it to encroach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>considerably upon the original road bed. William. Marr, who at the fcjrae the dam was building, was supervisor of the road, thinking that the erection of the dam on the side of the road, was calculated to injure the road at that place, so represented to the plaintiff, who said: \u201c Not so much as that rock there, (pointing to one in the road a little lower down,) and if you will attend to that rock, I will attend to the dam and make it all right.\u201d The road was low at the dam, but the plaintiff never raised the road. The rock was afterwards taken out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-5\">Neither the plaintiff nor Ellicott, his lessor, however, did any thing for the protection of the road, and the consequence was that whenever a freshet occurred, the road was injured, and on one occasion was rendered impassable at this point. Some effort appears to have been made to hold George Ellicott responsible for the erection of the dam, by presentment to the Grand Jury. Ellicott himself, when remonstrated with for the encroachments upon the road, remarked to the road authorities, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you widen it, and make a good road?\u201d The road was accordingly widened under the direction of the supervisor. The supervisor, under the necessity of the case, attempted to remedy the evil by erecting a rabble wall. On the 12th of June, 1858, a freshet, which also displaced the corner of the dam, washed away the rubble wall, and totally-destroyed the road, making it impassable even on horseback. A special appropriation of money was made by the County Commissioners; and Columbus E. Shipley, the then supervisor, caused a more substantial wall to be erected along the road, in the same place as the original wall, and inside of tiie original edge of the road. This wall, which was considerably below the site of the old dam built in 1827, and somewhat above the dam built in 1854, was an open dry wall. It was raised to the height of about three feet, and was intended to be raised higher, but, complaint being made by George Ellicott, nothing more was done. In May, 1860, a heavy freshet carried way a portion of the dam, next the Howard county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>side. The dam, as constructed in 1854, was run into the road bed some distance and fastened to the rock. A freshet, which occurred the same year, shortly after it was erected, broke it away, the rock to which it was attached proving to be shelly. This was before the wall in question was built. In repairing the dam, at that time, care was taken to run it still further into the rock beneath the road, and it was bolted to the solid part of the rock. After the end of the dam was broken aWay or displaced, in 1858, it was raised higher, and carried further into the road. According to the testimony, <em>the wall was necessary for the protection of the road, </em>and was made necessary by the erection of the dam in 1854. As to the influence of the wall upon the coui\u2019se of the river, and upon the mill-dam, the testimony was conflicting. Ellicott and Matthews, (who was a millwright employed by the plaintiff,) were of opinion that the wall, by obstructing the \u25a0water on that side, turned it more towards the Howard county shore, and caused a greater pressure on the dam. On the other hand, several witnesses thought that as the natural inclination of the stream was towards the Howard county bank, an open wall on the other side, which merely occupied the space of a small quantity of water, neither affected the course of the river, nor appreciably increased the volume of water thrown upon the dam; while it operated a positive benefit to the dam, by preventing the washing of the Baltimore county end. It was proved that the native rock upon which the dam abutted \u2014 a part of the great hill which forms the northern limit of the valley \u2014 was three feet higher than the breast of the dam, so that it was impossible that there should be any escape at the side under any circumstances, until after the water had attained that depth in the dam. And this natural barrier, being higher than the greatest artificial elevation in the road, the water would be just as much obstructed, though no wall or filling was there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-5\">Four exceptions were taken by the plaintiff at the trial below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number><em>.First Exception: </em>TJjie defendants offered to read in evidence the Act of 1831, eh. 27, entitled \u201cAn Act to provide for building a bridge over the Patapsco Falls, at or near the Thistle Factory;\u201d' and to prove that George Ellicott was one of the commissioners named in that Act, and acted as such commissioner in building the bridge mentioned in that Act, and that he saw the draft, of the Act before it was passed, and approved of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-5\">The plaintiff objected to the reading of the Act to the jury, but the Court overruled the objection and allowed the same to be read.

The plaintiff objected to the reading of the proceedings in evidence, \u201cbecause the same were not in conformity with law, or because such proceedings, on their face, were inadmissible to show that said l-oad was ever laid out as a public road.\u201d The Court overruled the objection, and allowed the said proceedings to be read in evidence; thereupon the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-7\"><em>Third Exception: </em>The County Commissioners, after receiving a communication from George Ellicott, complaining of the wall, it seems, appointed a committee to examine and report to them on the subject. This committee, which consisted of John C. Holland, William Reddington and John R. Harvey, made a report to the County Commissioners, which was offered in evidence by the plaintiff. After all the other evidence was in, the plaintiff claimed to' rely upon certain opinions expressed in that report by the committee to the effect, that but for said stone wall, the water when high could escape around the abutment of the dam, and also that said wall would injure or damage said dam or mill property. The Court refused to allow it to be read for such purposes, but did allow it to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>used before the jury for the purpose of showing that said stone wall was erected under the authority of the defendants.

And if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>jury find that the defendants caused said road to be walled up, and changed in 1859, ai said place, as the same had never been walled up or used previously, and if the jury further find that said road as walled up and changed, did prevent that naiimil overflow of said road, which had always previously existed in freshets, and that thereby the waters-of the Patapsco river were obstructed in their natural escape and flow at that place in freshets, and the same were forced over the dam of the plaintiff with such increased force as to destroy the dam, as stated in the evidence, then the defendants cannot justify the destruction of said dam by the means aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-5\">The defendants then offered the four following prayers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-6\">3.

Shipley, road supervisor of said district, for the purpose of repairing and improving said road, and in the manner and under regulations directed by the County Commissioners of Baltimore county, and that said wall was constructed with ordinary care, and was a benefit to said road, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action for any consequential injury occasioned to the plaintiff by the erection of said wall, even if the jury should find such injury to have been \u25a0done him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-8\">3. If the jury shall believe from the evidence that the wall mentioned in the declaration of the plaintiff, and in the testimony of the witnesses, was not built by the authority of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Commissioners of Baltimore county, or that it was not built in the manner and under the regulations, directed by the said commissioners, then in either case the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-5\">4th.

Here is abundant evidence proving that the new wall was actually built on top of our dam, and the grade of the road elevated, and its width enlarged, thus causing as much of an excess in the means adopted as if the defendants, in an action for assault and battery, had exceeded the limits of the right of personal defence, and become in turn the assailant. 1 <em>Chit.

And inasmuch as it was not disputed that the road had been in fact used as a public road for more than twenty years, the introduction of the condemnation proceedings could not prejudice the plaintiff ; such continuous use being sufficient to entitle it to be regarded to all intents and purposes as a public road. <em>Day vs. Allender, </em>22 <em>Md.

Even if the opinions or statements in question could be evidence of the truth or soundness of them, their effect would be overcome by the equally distinct representation, in another part of the same report, that <em>\u201c </em>the wall was necessary to protect the road from being overflowed at times,\u201d showing a perfect justification in law for the erection of the wall.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-5\">The road existed before the dam, and the erection of the dam made the wall necessary to save the road from the injurious consequences of it; upon these facts, nothing can be clearer, it is submitted, than that it Avas not only the right, but the imperative duty of the County Commissioners, to make the improvement. Therefore, the defendants\u2019 fourth prayer,- which presents this proposition, was rightly granted, and the prayers of the plaintiff, which are all inconsistent with it, were rightly refused. <em>Angell on Water-Courses, sec. </em>332. The plaintiff cannot take advantage of his own wrong.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-6\">A much broader proposition might be contended for. Even had the dam been ancient, nothing done to the public highway in the way of reasonable improvement, could afford \u2022 ground for an action to recover consequential damages. The public authorities have the clear right to alter the grade of public highways, and there can be no action for damages which may result from the exercise of this right. <em>Ely vs. City of Rochester, </em>26 <em>Barb., </em>133; <em>Benedict vs. Goit, </em>3 <em>Barb., </em>459; <em>Radcliff\u2019s Ex\u2019rs vs. Mayor, &amp;c. of Brooklyn, </em>4 <em>Comst., 195; Goszler vs. The Corporation of Georgetown, 6 Wheat., </em>593; <em>Graves &amp; White vs. Otis, 2 Hill, N.

These will be considered in their regular order.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><em>First Exception. </em>The Act of 3831, \u00aeh. 27, authorizing the building of a bridge across the Patapsco, at Ilehester, which recognized the road in question as a public road, was admissible in evidence; when accompanied by proof showing that George Ellieott, .under whom the plaintiff claimed title, was cognizant of the application to the Legislature for the passage of the law, knew and approved of its provisions and acted under it as one of the commissioners. This testimony was evidence of an admission by Ellieott that the road was a public road, and it also showed a recognition of that fact by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\"><em>Second Exception. </em>There is no valid objection to the admissibility in evidence of the record of proceedings in 1835, for the condemnation of the road. The jurisdiction of the County Commissioners plainly appears on the face of the proceedings, Act <em>of </em>1825, <em>ch. </em>219, <em>and its supplements; </em>(2 <em>Dorsey\u2019s </em>Laws, 1709, <em>&amp;c.) </em>The alleged irregularities in the action of the special commissioners, even if such existed, would not render the proceedings void, when collaterally called in question.. These irregularities are supposed to consist in the omission of the commissioners \u201cto value and ascertain the damages that may be sustained by each and every person through whose lands the road may pass,\u201d as provided by the sixth section. Such an objection might have been made by parties interested at any time before the final ratification of the return, as prescribed by the seventh section; but could not afterwards be made even by a party interested. Where no damages have been awarded, and the return has been finally ratified without objection, the presumption is that no damages were suffered or claimed by the proprietors. It is very clear upon principle and authority that after the final ratification, the proceedings cannot be collaterally impeached, either on the ground that no damages or insufficient damages have been valued and ascertained by the commissioners. The same oh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>servations may be made with, regard to all the other supposed irregularities in the proceedings of the special commissioners, relied on by the appellant as fatal to their validity. It appears that these commissioners made their return on the 7th day of July, 1835, the record recites that afterwards, on the 6th day of October, 1835, on motion of the petitioners, leave was granted them to withdraw the return of the special commissioners for the purpose of amending the same, and after-wards, on the 3d day of November, 1835, the petitioners returned the report and plat of said special commissioners as the same had been by them amended, which was accordingly filed, &amp;c. The objection has been urged that there was no authority to allow the return to be withdrawn and amended by the petitioners, and that such an irregularity renders the whole proceedings void. But it appears that the amended return was made and signed by the special commissioners, not by the petitioners, and in the face of this fact appearing on the record, the recital that it was amended and filed by the petitioners, must be treated and considered as a \u25a0 mere clerical error or misprision. It was within the discretion of the County Commissioners to allow the return to be amended by the special commissioners, and as the record shows that the amended return was their act, no valid objection can be made to their proceedings, after they have been finally ratified, because of the recital in the record, to which we have referred. Another objection has been urged that the description and dimensions of the road are not stated with precision in the commissioners\u2019 return; the courses and distances in length alone being given, \u2014 this is not strictly correct. The commission directs that the road shall be located of the width of thirty-two feet; the return states that the road as located is of that width, except in certain places designated, where it was not practicable to construct it of the whole width. This departure from the directions of the commission is cured by the order of ratification. Eor these reasons we think there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>was no error in the decision of the Circuit Court in the second exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\"><em>Third Exception. </em>The opinions of the three persons appointed by the County Commissioners to examine the wall complained of, as to its probable effect upon the property of the appellant, was not admissible evidence for the purpose of proving the facts for which it was offered, and there was no error in its rejection. Those parties might have been called to the stand and examined as exports, but their opinions and views unsupported by oath were clearly inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\"><em>Fourth Exception. </em>This exception was taken to the rejection of the three prayers of the plaintiff, and the granting of the fourth prayer of the defendants. The questions presented by these prayers may be more briefly disposed of by examining' first the defendants\u2019 fourth prayer, the granting of which determined the case in favor of the defendants, and if it correctly state the law, it follows that there could be no error in rejecting the prayers of the plaintiff, which assert legal propositions contrary to and inconsistent with it. The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was the alleged damage and injury suffered by him, in consequence of the increased flow of water upon his mill-dam, caused by the erection of a wall by the defendants upon the public road contiguous to and above the dam. The fourth prayer asserts the proposition that if the erection of the plaintiffs mill-dam in 1854, rendered it necessary that the wall complained of should be built, <em>in order to the preservation of the road </em>at that place, then the County Commissioners had the authority and right to cause the wall to be built, and if it were constructed with ordinary care, and was useful and beneficial to the road, they are not responsible to the plaintiff for any injury he may have suffered thereby. The law easts upon the defendants not only the right but the duty to protect the public roads from injury, and keep them in proper r-epair for the use of the public; individual rights must be held and enjoyed in subordination to those of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>If by reasonable or necessary improvements to a highway, a party suffers consequential damage, it is <em>damnum absque' injuria, </em>and no right of action accrues to him. This principle has been established by an unbroken current of decisions. <em>Ely vs. City of </em>Rochester, 26 <em>Barb., </em>133; <em>Radcliff\u2019s Ex\u2019rs vs. Mayor, &amp;c. of Brooklyn, </em>4 <em>Comst., </em>195; <em>Smith vs. Corporation of Washington, </em>20 <em>How., </em>135. In this case the defence of the appellees, as stated in their fourth prayer, is fortified by the fact that the act of the plaintiff in constructing his dam in 1854, whereby the waters were raised and the public road overflowed, rendered the erection of the wall necessary for the preservation of the road, so that the injury complained of appears to have been indirectly the consequence of the plaintiff\u2019s wrongful act; in such case he would have no right to maintain an action even against private individuals. For these reasons we think there was no error in granting the defendants\u2019 fourth prayer. The first prayer of the plaintiff asserts the proposition that if the road, as it had been laid out and used, was subject to be overflowed at that place, it was not lawful for the defendants to cause any obstruction to be placed at that point, so as to prevent the natural overflow of the road, as it had been used to be overflowed, before the erection of the mill-dam by the plaintiff. This proposition is erroneous. As we have said, the duty of the County Commissioners was to keep the highway in good order and condition for the use of the public. And this duty required them to adopt the necessary means to prevent it from being overflowed by water. They would not be justified in the neglect of this duty, merely because the natural flow of water had been allowed for any indifferent period to submerge the highway, to the inconvenience and detriment of the public. The second prayer is equally objectionable, it assumes that the effect of the erection by the plaintiff of his mill-dam, caused an increased overflow of the road, and denies to the defendants the right to erect the wall, even if necessary for the protection of the road, if thereby the water power of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the plaintiff was endangered and was actually injured.. This is inconsistent with the principles wo have before announced. The plaintiff could not lawfully claim the right to cause the public highway to be overflowed, nor deny to the defendants the use of the means necessary for its preservation. The third prayer is liable to the same objections as the first and second, and was also properly rejected.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b541-6\">(Decided 20th April, 1868 )</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\n<em>Judgynent affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
