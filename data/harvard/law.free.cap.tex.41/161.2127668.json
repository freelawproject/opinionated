(Pas. Dig., art. 2411.) It describes the animal \u201cby its specific designation in the statute,\u201d and it does not appear that greater certainty of description was practicable. (See Dignowitty <em>v. </em>State, 17 Tex., 521.) The description would support a common-law indictment for larceny. (Whart. Prec., p. 190, note <em>a; </em>Bishop\u2019s Cr. Prac., vol. 2, sec. 700.) Where the ownership of the animal is unknown, it is sufficient to allege that fact. (State <em>v. </em>Faucett, 15 Tex., 585.) It is not defective in alleging the want of the owner\u2019s consent, or the intent to defraud. (State <em>v. </em>Hall., 27 Tex., 338.) We have not had the benefit of brief or argument by appellee, and have been unable to see any good reason for quashing the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
