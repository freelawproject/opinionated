Tried below before the Hon.

McFarlin inquired, \u201c What money?\u201d to which McElroy answered, \u201c The money you owe me for those hogs;\u201d that McFarlin \u00a1eft his reaper, and starting toward witness said, \u201c Gro slow, go slow\u2014you always insult me when you name that hog question;\u201d that witness retreated with a walking-stick in his hand, the accused folloxving with an open pocket-knife. It sedms from this witness\u2019s testimony that he encountered an ant bed in his retreat, and their attacks from below so excited the sympathies of his first pursuer that he suspended his demonstrations until McElroy could rid himself of his new assailants. After this they \u201ctalked the matter over,\u201d and \u201cmade friends.\u201d A few minutes after this, upon defendant\u2019s hogs entering the field, some conversation ensued, when, according to McElroy\u2019s statement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>defendant, without provocation, stabbed him with the small blade of a knife. E. McFarlin, a son of defendant, testified that McElroy had a stout stick drawn upon defendant within striking distance at the time and before the knife was used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-5\">Ko instructions were given on the law of self-defense.

The evidence showed that the accused inflicted a serious wound on McElroy, by striking him with the small blade of his knife; but the testimony of McElroy and of the sons of defendant was in conflict, as to whether he was not himself attempting to strike the accused with a good-sized walking-stick at the time the knife was used. In this state of the evidence, the court instructed the jury, amongst other things, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-9\">\u201c If you believe that defendant stabbed McElroy without McElroy striking him with the stick, you will find him guilty of an aggravated assault.\u201d As there was no evidence whatever that McElroy actually struck defendant, this charge left the jury no alternative but to convict. The bill of exceptions and assignment of errors are sufficient to present this part of the charge for revision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>As the case will be remanded for this error in the charge, it is deemed necessary to notice but one of the various rulings of the court in excluding testimony, also assigned as error. The prosecutor, McElroy, had testified that he went into defendant\u2019s field, where defendant was at work, and where the difficulty occurred, with no expectation of a difficulty, and no ill-feeling towards him. On cross-examination, defendant\u2019s counsel proposed to ask him \u201cIf, on the morning of and before the difficulty, he did not say, in the presence of his family, that he was going to see McElroy, and if he did not get back by 11 o\u2019clock, they might know he had blood; \u201d which question was excluded by the court. We think the question was proper. It was competent to show, if such were the fact, that the witness bad made statements inconsistent with his evidence on the trial; and, in view of the conflict of testimony, it was important to defendant to make such proof, if he could. It was also proper to ask the witness himself in regard to such statements, to give him opportunity to admit and explain them. (1 Green!., \u00a7 462, and note.)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The objection to the indictment, that it does not allege the assault and battery to have been made with intent to injure, is not well taken. (State <em>v. </em>Allen, 30 Tex., 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">' The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
