Reasonable doubt in criminal cases.\u2014It is error to charge the jury \u201cthat such doubt must not be a mere possible doubt, but it must be a doubt sustained by the evidence, upon a review of all the facts and circumstances of the case, such as a reasonable man would act upon in any of the important concerns of life.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b570-11\">2. Theft\u2014Trespass.\u2014In a trial for theft, when the evidence shows a public taking and a claim of right in the property by the accused, the jury should be instructed that any reasonable doubt as to the honest or felonious intent should be given in favor of the accused.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b570-13\">3. Oath of jury in State cases.\u2014Record must show that the jury was sworn in criminal cases.

Art. 563 of the code (Pas. Dig., art. 3029) prescribes the oath in all criminal eases. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The oath administered to the jury in this case is \u201c well and truly to try the issue joined between the State of Texas, plaintiff, and Buck Bray, charged, with the theft of a cow.\u201d1 The statement that the jury were duly sworn, or sworn according to law, would import that the oath required by the code had been administered. The recital of the oath administered in this case shows affirmatively that the form required has not been followed.
