Worth &amp; Denver City Railway.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqp\">Independent of the Act of 1903 of the Texas Legislature, commonly known as the antitrust statute, the contract between the defendant railway company and the Pullman Company was a valid and binding contract, not against public policy, and not at all in restraint of trade or commerce.

Railway Co., 81 S. W. Rep., 111.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-15\">The contract between the Pullman Company and the railway company is not in conflict with the Act of 1903, and the making or carrying out of said contract would not violate any of the provisions of said law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The agreement between the Pullman Company and the railway company does not create a trust, a monopoly nor a conspiracy in restraint of trade as prohibited by the Act. of 1903.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-5\">In order for a trust to be created under the Act of 1903 there must be a <em>combination </em>of capital, skill or acts, and the contract between the defendant companies does not create a combination. A combination is a union,\u2014a joining of two or more factors into one result; a blending by which the original separate identity is merged into a result in which each of the original factors or parties have a common and not a separate interest. A contract may create a combination if it brings about a union of interest, but if it does not, and if each party is contracting at arm\u2019s length and seeking to secure the best results, and if after the contract is made the interest of each party in the performance of the contract is separate, no combination will be created and no trust formed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-6\">A monopoly under the Act of 1903 is a combination or consolidation of two or more corporations so as to bring them under the same control and create a trust as defined in said Act, or when one corporation acquires control of the stock of another so as to lessen or destroy competition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-7\">A conspiracy in restraint of trade, under said Act of 1903, results when parties engaged in buying and selling agree to refuse to buy or sell to some other person, or when they boycott some other person.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-8\">Before any contract will create a trust, it must be mutual and obligate each party thereto to grant to the other party rights that are exclusive. If the Pullman Company had obligated itself not to furnish cars to any other railway company and the railway company had bound itself to lease cars from no other company than the Pullman Company, the contract might be injurious to the public and unreasonable; but, in the absence of such mutual covenants, the obligation is unilateral and fails to create any combination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-9\">It is not contended that the railway company can not lawfully lease cars from the Pullman Company. If, by reason of the Act of 1903, the exclusive feature of the contract became unlawful, the contract will be treated as divisible, and those provisions thereof which are not in conflict with the law will be binding, and those in conflict will be held to have been annulled.

Plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was complete upon such pleading and proof and it was not incumbent upon plaintiff to show specifically that the exclusive provisions of the contract complained of had been enforced by showing that there were other competing sleeping car companies, or that other sleeping car companies applied to the railroad company to be allowed to furnish .sleeping cars to it, nor is it any excuse to say that the contract did not bind the Pullman Company not to lease sleeping ears to other railroads.

The statement and questions are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">\u201cThe Court of Civil Appeals of the Third Supreme Judicial District certifies that the above styled and numbered cause is now pending and undecided in this court, wherein -the State of Texas was plaintiff in the court below, in a suit against the defendants, the Fort Worth &amp; Denver City Railway Company and the Pullman Palace Car Company, to recover penalties for a violation of the antitrust laws of 1899, and the antitrust statute of 1903.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">\u201cThe case was tried before the court without a jury, and the trial court concluded that there had been no violation of the antitrust law of 1899, but that there was a violation of the antitrust statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>1903, and assessed a penalty against each of the defendant corporations in the sum of $18,550.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u201cThe findings of fact of the trial court, which we adopt and approve, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u201c \u2018First.

Is the contract in. question, as set out in the findings of fact, executed between the Railway Company and the Pullman Company, in view of the facts as stated, in violation of any provision of the first section of the antitrust statute of March 31, 1903, page 119 of the Session Laws of the 28th Legislature?</p>\n<p id=\"b64-14\">\u201cII. Does such contract, in view of the facts, constitute a monopoly within the meaning of section 2 of said antitrust statute, or is its tendency to create a monopoly within the meaning of that section ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-15\">The acts forbidden by the law of 1903 are so numerous that we will not undertake an examination of each one separately in this opinion. We have carefully examined the entire Act and each specification in reference to its application to the facts of this case and we are of the opinion that the following are the only provisions of the Act which have a semblance of applicability to this contract:</p>\n<p id=\"b64-17\">First. To fix or maintain any standard or figure whereby the cost of transportation shall be in any manner affected or established.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-18\">Second. To make any contract by which they shall agree to keep the cost of transportation at a fixed or graded figure, or by which they shall in any manner affect or maintain the cost of transportation or by which they shall agree to pool, combine or unite any interest they may have in connection with any charge for transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-19\">Third. To create or carry out restrictions in the free pursuit of any business authorized or permitted by the laws of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-20\">Without so deciding, we will, for the purposes of this opinion, assume that the facts of the case show a combination between the corporations named, and that the word \u201ctransportation\u201d as it occurs in the Act embraces carriage of both passengers and freight. The first inquiry that we shall address ourselves to is, do the facts and the contract set out in the statement upon which the questions are submitted, show that the law has been violated by the corporations through any interference with transportation of passengers. The only reference in the contract to any charges to be made by either company is the stipulation that the Pullman Company should not charge passengers in its cars on the line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>of the Ft. Worth &amp; Denver City Railroad Company more than it charged on the lines of competing railroads. The contract did not require that the charges should be maintained as they were then fixed, nor did it fix any standard of charges by which either company should be governed. No pooling or combining of rates between the said companies was provided for, but each was at liberty to prescribe its own charges and to change them at its pleasure. Neither corporation was entitled to receive any part of the charges made by the other; in fact, there was no semblance of a pooling or combination of rates, nor is there anything in the contract by which it would be possible to hold that the making, maintaining or charging of rates by either company, or by any other company, corporation or person, would be in the least affected, or could possibly be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"AnX\">Counsel for the State contend that the provisions of the contract by which the mileage to be paid by the railroad company for the use of the sleeping cars was to be regulated by the average amount received from each sleeping car, so that in case the collection on each car should exceed $6000 a year, no mileage should be paid by the railroad company, had a tendency to increase the rates charged on the sleeping cars in order to reach the maximum revenue of each car. Certainly this could not have been an inducement to the Pullman Company to increase its charges, because by increasing its rates and the revenue from each car, it would lose the mileage to be paid by the railroad company; for although its increased revenue might be greater than the mileage, yet the loss of the mileage could not have been an inducement for the increase of the rates. The railroad company would be benefited by the increased revenue of the other company by a reduction or release from mileage, but it had no power over the charges of the Pullman Company. It is manifest that the contract did not in any way affect or tend to affect transportation or charges therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Did the contract \"create or carry out restrictions in the free pursuit of a business authorized or permitted by the laws of this State?\u201d The antitrust Act does not create a new business for any person, nor does it give a new right in the property of others, but the object of the law was to prevent interference with business authorized and carried on in accordance with the laws of the State. It is therefore pertinent to inquire what business interest was in any way affected by this contract ? The two companies unquestionably had the right to contract that the one should furnish the sleeping cars and maintain them, thereby furnishing accommodations to the passengers of the other, and to collect fares therefor. So far the contract is in conformity to law. This action rests alone upon the alleged illegality of the provision of the contract which grants to the Pullman Company the exclusive right to furnish sleeping cars for use on all lines of road owned or controlled by the Ft. Worth and Denver City Company, and all roads which it might thereafter acquire or operate. Waiving the fact that at the time the law of 1903 was enacted there was no other persons or company engaged in the like business in Texas, we come to the question, did the railroad company have the lawful right to make a contract with the Pullman Company, whereby it excluded all other companies, for fifteen years, from furnishing to the Railroad Company sleeping cars for use on all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>of its lines ? That question suggests this, did all sleeping car companies have a right to demand of the railroad company to haul their coaches on its railroad ? If yea, the contract restricted the free pursuit of a lawful business and constitutes a trust under the Act of 1903, otherwise the law has not been violated by the agreement.' The effect of this contract was that the railroad company rented from the sleeping car company its coaches, agreeing to haul them over its lines of road, the sleeping car company furnishing sleeping accommodations and other conveniences to such passengers of the railroad as should desire them. The demand of the traveling public for sleeping cars and like conveniences imposes upon railroads an obligation as potent as a rule of law; the demand must be complied with, which the carrier may do either by furnishing its own coaches or by contracting with another corporation as in this case. In order to justify a sleeping car company in furnishing such accommodations the railroad may give the exclusive right, because it is necessary to permanent and reliable service which is in the interest of the public. This contract in no way interfered with the right of any other sleeping car company, if any existed, to build or furnish its cars to other railroads. Neither the Pullman nor any other corporation or person had a right to have sleeping cars attached to the passenger trains of the Ft. Worth &amp; Denver City Eailroad Company, therefore, to exclude them did not restrict \u201cthe free pursuit of any business authorized or permitted by law,\u201d because such business was not authorized to be pursued on a railroad without the consent of the owner, and, since no such, business right existed, it could not be restricted. Lewis v. Railroad Co., 10 Texas Ct. Rep., 423; Kates v. Atlanta Baggage and Cab Co., 107 Ga., 636; Express Cases, 117 U. S., 26; Chicago, St. L. &amp; N. O. Ry. Co. v. Pullman So. Car Co., 139 U. S., 79; Fluker v. Georgia Ry. &amp; B. Co., 81 Ga., 461; Barney v. O. B. &amp; H. Steamboat Co., 67 N. Y., 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Lewis v. Eailroad Company, above cited, was decided by the Court of Civil Appeals of the Second District in this State and an application for writ of error was refused by this court. In that case the facts showed that the railroad company had granted an exclusive privilege to one person to go upon its trains and solicit of passengers baggage to be hauled from the train to different parts of the city. Lewis was engaged in the same business at Mineral Wells and insisted that he had the right to have a solicitor upon the trains of that railroad with like privilege. The railroad company brought an action to enjoin him from so doing. The injunction was granted and at the trial was perpetuated by the trial court, which judgment was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals. It was contended that the contract between the railroad company and the person authorized to solicit on its train was a restriction upon a business authorized and permitted by the laws of this State. In a well considered opinion by Judge Speer, the Court of Civil Appeals held that-while Lewis had the right to pursue that business, he could not prosecute it on the train of the railroad company without its consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In Kates v. Baggage Company, before cited, the Supreme Court of Georgia, in an elaborate and able opinion, held the railroad company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>had the right to make a contract with one person, whereby it excluded all others from \u201cthe business\u201d of soliciting baggage on its trains.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Express Cases (117 U. S., 1), consisted of three separate suits by express companies against three different railroads, to compel the latter to furnish the same facilities for carrying express matter on the respective railroads that the express companies had enjoyed under contracts which each railroad company had terminated. The issue is clearly stated in this language: \u201cThe exact question, then, is whether these express companies can now demand as a right what they have heretofore had only as by permission. That depends, as is conceded, on whether all railroad companies are now by law charged with the duty of carrying all express companies in the way that express carriers when taken are usually carried, just as they are with the duty of carrying all passengers and freights when offered in the way that passengers and freight are carried.\u201d Practically the same question is presented in this case. Upon a thorough examination of this issue the Supreme Court of the United States held that express companies had no such rights, and that a railroad company had the right to make contracts whereby it would limit the number of persons or companies who might pursue such a business on its train.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">In Railroad Company v. Pullman Car Company, before cited, a contract almost identical in terms with this was the basis of the action; two cars of the Pullman Company having been destroyed, it brought suit upon the contract to recover for their value, to which the railroad company pleaded that the contract by which it gave the exclusive right to the Pullman Company to furnish sleeping cars for use upon the railroad was void, because it was contrary to public policy and was in restraint of trade. In answer to the contention that the contract was in restraint of trade, the Supreme Court of the United States said: \u201cThe stipulation, therefore, that the plaintiff, not being in default, should have the exclusive right for fifteen years to furnish drawing-room and sleeping cars for the defendant\u2019s use, and that the defendant should not, during that period, contract for cars of that kind with any other party, rightfully construed is not unreasonable, and, properly performed, will promote the convenience of the public in that it enables the defendant to have on its lines, at all times, and as the requirements of travel demand drawing-room and sleeping cars for use by passengers. It is a stipulation that does not interfere in any degree with its right and duty to disregard the contract whenever the plaintiff fails in furnishing cars that are adequately safe and sufficient in number for the travel on defendant\u2019s lines. The suggestion that the agreement is void, upon grounds of public policy, or because it is in general restraint of trade, can not, for the reasons stated, be sustained.\u201d That case is analogous to this and supports our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Section <em>2 </em>of the antitrust law of 1905 defines a monopoly as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">\u201cSec. <em>2. </em>That a monopoly is a combination or consolidation of two or more corporations when effected in either of the following methods:</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">\u201c1. When the direction of the affairs of two or more corporations is in any manner brought under the same management or control for the purpose of producing, or where such common management or control tends to create a trust as defined in the first section of this Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>\u201c2. . </em>Where any corporation acquires the shares or certificates of stock or bonds, franchise or other rights, or the physical properties, or any part thereof, of any other corporation or corporations, for the purpose of preventing or lessening, or where the effect of such acquisition tends to affect or lessen competition, whether such acquisition is accomplished directly or through the instrumentality of trustees or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The direction of the \u201caffairs\u201d of neither of the corporations to this contract is brought under the control of the other; nor are the affairs of both corporations brought under the management of another corporation or person. If either of these corporations acquired the shares or certificates of stock or bonds of the other by this contract, nor does the contract transfer to either company any \u201cfranchise, or other rights, or the physical properties\u201d of the other company. The agreement by the railroad company to haul the cars of the Pullman Company did not transfer to the latter any of the franchise of the former by which it was authorized to operate trains over the road. On the contrary, the railroad company in the performance of the contract exercised its franchise. The sleeping cars were the only physical \u201cproperties\u201d which were involved, or in any way dealt with in this transaction, and they were not acquired by the railroad company, but remained the'property of the Pullman Company. The control which the railroad company acquired over the sleeping cars did not tend to affect or lessen competition either in transportation by the railroad company or in the business of the sleeping ear company. We conclude, therefore, that the contract between the two corporations \u201cdid not constitute a monopoly within the meaning of section 2 of the antitrust statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">We answer both questions propounded in the negative.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
