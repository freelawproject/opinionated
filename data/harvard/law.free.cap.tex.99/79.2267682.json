Appellant agreed to pay as rent for the'use of said building the sum of $2,100.00 in quarterly installments of $175.00 each. It was stipulated in the lease \u201cthat said premises shall be used for the saloon business.\u201d After the execution and delivery of the lease and before the term thereof began an election was ordered by the Commissioner\u2019s Court of Ellis County, under what is known as our \u201clocal op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>tion\u201d statute, and held throughout the county, to determine whether or not the sale of intoxicating liquors should be prohibited in that county. The election resulted in favor of prohibition and local option became effective in said county on October 11, 1902. Appellant claimed that the stipulation in the lease that the demised premises should be used for the saloon business constituted an express covenant that said premises should be used for no other purpose, and that, inasmuch as such use became illegal by the adoption of local option in Ellis County, it was absolved from liability for the agreed rent. Talcing this view of the matter appellant notified appellee that it could not carry out the agreement, refused to occupy the leased building or to pay the rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\">Appellee insisted on the validity of the lease contract, tendered the building and demanded payment of the rent in accordance with the terms of the contract, which being refused this suit was brought to recover the first installment thereof. Judgment' having been rendered for appellee, appellant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">We think it must be conceded that the stipulation in the lease that the premises should be used for the saloon business amounted to a covenant on the part of appellant to use them for no other purpose. The particular use to which the building was to be put having been specified, a restriction against other uses will be implied and the lease need not contain an express covenant imposing such restriction. In such case the lessor may invoke the preventive powers of a court of equity to restrain the lessee from making any use of the premises inconsistent with the terms'of the contract. DeForest v. Byrne, 1 Hilton (N. Y.), 43; 18 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law, 635, Title Leases, subtitle, \u201cExpress restriction upon the use;\u201d 1 Taylor on Landlord and Tenant, 494; Spalding Hotel Co. v. Emerson, 72 N. W. Rep. (Minn.), 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Having restricted the use of the building to the \u201csaloon business\u201d or sale of intoxicating liquors, the question is presented: Was the lease contract terminated and appellant absolved from liability for the rents therein agreed to be paid, by reason of the adoption of local option in Ellis County? In so far as we are advised this question has not been passed upon by any of the courts of this state. The general rule has been broadly stated to be, that where the performance becomes impossible subsequent to the making of the contract the promisor is not thereby discharged. But to this general rule there is a well established exception viz: that where the performance becomes impossible by a change in the law the promisor is discharged. The facts, however, in our opinion do not bring the case at bar within the exception. Hor does it become necessary to apply the general rule stated in all its rigor to justify the conclusion we have reached. For the purposes of this case it may be asserted that when a party voluntarily undertakes and by contract binds himself to do an act or thing, without qualification, and performance thereof becomes impossible by some contingency which should have been anticipated and provided against in the contract, the nonperformance will not be excused. In such case the party\u2019s failure to exempt himself from responsibility in the event of the happening of the contingency will be attributable to his own folly and he will be held to make good his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Applying these latter principles, we think that the prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors in Ellis County under our local option statute furnishes appellant no legal excuse for its failure to pay the rent sought to be recovered in this action. The stipulated use to which the demised premises were to be put was entirely legal when the lease contract was executed. That such use might become illegal was a probability well known to appellant at that time. The statute authorizing and under which the sale of intoxicating liquors was prohibited in Ellis County had been enacted and was an existing law at the time the lease was made. It was only necessary for the people to pursue the course pointed out by its provisions in order to put the law in operation in that county and avail themselves of its benefits. This event appellant must have known was likely to occur, and that if it did the performance of the stipulation in the lease under discussion would be prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Appellee had no interest in the business to be conducted in the leased building and appellant knew that by a vote of the people under the existing statute referred to, the \u201csaloon business,\u201d which included the sale of intoxicating liquors, might be prohibited before the beginning of the lease term. This was a probable contingency which an ordinarily prudent man should have foreseen and provided for in his contract, and having failed to so do he took the risk upon himself and must abide the consequences. In the English case of Newby v. Sharpe, 8 Ch. Div., 39, the defendant let the basement of a store to the plaintiff \u201cwith full and undisturbed right and liberty to store cartridges therein and covenanted to keep the premises in proper repair and condition so as to be available for storing cartridges, and also covenanted for quiet enjoyment.\u201d Plaintiff took possession of the demised premises and stored cartridges in them. Other parts of the store were at that time let to other persons for storing gunpowder. Soon afterwards the Explosive Act, 1875, passed, making it illegal to store cartridges and gunpowder in the same building, and prescribing heavy penalties for a violation thereof. Upon the passage of this act, the defendant lessor, removed the cartridges which had been placed in the store to another building and notified plaintiff that in order to protect himself from liability he could be compelled to notify the authorities if he, plaintiff, stored other cartridges in the leased premises. This course was pursued by defendant solely to avoid subjecting himself to the penalties of said act, and at all times he stated to plaintiff that the rented premises were at his disposal. Plaintiff, the lessee, however, claimed an eviction and sued to restrain defendant from obstructing the storing of his cartridges and for damages. It was held that plaintiff could not recover and that judgment must be entered for defendant; the court, among other things, malting the following observation: \u201cAt the time when the lease was granted, both parties were aware that there was pending in Parliament a bill to make further regulations as to the storing of explosive substances, and if plaintiff intended to be guaranteed by defendant against any effect which such regulations might have on his use of the demised property he ought to have insisted upon having stipulations for that purpose inserted in the lease. He did not do so but chose to take the risk.\u201d We think it is manifest from the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>in the above case that the pendency of the bill in Parliament and the knowledge of that fact by the \u201cplaintiff\u201d when he procured a lease of the premises, exercised controlling influence with the court in the conclusion reached. The facts in the ease at bar present stronger reasons for the enforcement of the contract sued on than those in the case from which the above quotation is made. Here the law, by which the intended use of the rented property was prohibited had been actually passed by the Legislature, was a valid and subsisting statute, and such statute and the action taken under it resulting in the prohibition of appellant\u2019s business in Ellis County were presumably in contemplation of the parties when the lease in question was made.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b104-7\"><em>J.

Accordingly performance is excused by a supervening impossibility, caused by operation of a change in the law. Tay v. Ecker, 6 Civ. App., 191; Cyclopedia Law and Procedure, vol. 9, pp. 629 and 630; Beach on the Modern Law of Contracts, vol. 1, pp. 279 and 225; Anson on Contracts, p. 427; Bishop on Contracts, p. 574; Wharton on Contracts, pp. 488 and 305; Addison on Contracts, pp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>482 and 327; Gates v.

Spurgin, 5 Sneed (Tenn.), 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Appellant\u2019s proposition that the performance of a contract is excused by a supervening impossibility caused by the operation of a change in the law, is correct; but it is believed there has been no such change in the law since the lease in question was executed as would authorize the application of that principle in this case. We see no valid reason for not apptying in this case the fundamental maxim, that \u201cas a party binds himself so shall he be bound.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Believing that the proper judgment was rendered in the court below the same is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Opinion delivered January 7, 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>If the court is without power to enforce the contract as a whole, it will not attempt to enforce one part of it.

App., 1895) 33 S. W. Rep., 585; Kottwitz v. Alexander, 34 Texas, 689; Rayner Cattle Co. v. Bedford, 91 Texas, 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The rights and duties of the parties who signed the contract sued upon are to be tested solely by the terms of the contract, and it is not the law that the court should presume that some duty rested on one of the parties which is not embraced in the contract.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b105-7\"><em>G. C. Groce, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"AV2\">By the lease agreement in controversy appellee granted to appellant an estate for years, commencing in futuro, in the property to which the lease applied, and even if the use \u00f3f the property was restricted to a particular business, the restriction was for appellee\u2019s benefit, and could be waived by him; furthermore the stipulated use was legal when the contract was made, while both parties knew that it might be prohibited before the expiration, or even the beginning, of the lease term, and if appellant was unwilling to take the chance of such prohibition, it should have protected itself by express agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Appellee was not interested in the business to be carried on on the leased premises, nor was it, from a legal standpoint, anything to him whether such business should, or should not, be actually carried on on such premises. Both parties knew when the lease was made that the contemplated business might be prohibited even before the beginning of the lease term, and appellant saw fit to take the chance of such prohibition. The prohibition of the use to which rented, or hired, property is to be put does not render the contract of rental, or hire, illegal, when the lessor or hirer is not interested in the use. Tweedie Trading Co. v. Jas. P. McDonald Co., 114 Fed. Rep., 985.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">While appellant\u2019s second proposition that performance of a contract, illegal when made, or made so by subsequent law, is excused, is correct, it has no application to this case. Here the contract in question was entirely legal when made, as was also the use to which the leased premises were to be put; the contract has never been made illegal, but by force of laws existing when it was made, and which, presumably were in contemplation of the parties, and by appropriate action under such laws, the contemplated use of the rented premises was prohibited, which was a risk assumed by appellant in the absence of a stipulation to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Assuming that the stipulation that the leased premises should be used for the saloon business amounted to an implied covenant against any other use, this would be at most only a covenant, and not a. condition of the lease. There was no stipulation of forfeiture for breach of such covenant, and none would be implied. Johnson v. Gurley, 5 Texas, 222.</p>\n<author id=\"b105-11\">BROWN, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Am\">This is a certified question from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Court of Civil Appeals of the Fifth Supreme Judicial District. The statement and questions are as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\">\u201cThe judgment of the court below, in the above entitled cause, was affirmed on a former day by the present term of this court, but Upon further consideration of the case on appellant\u2019s motion for a rehearing, we deem it advisable to present to the Supreme Court of the state of Texas, for adjudication, the following issues of law arising upon the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u201cStatement :</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u201cOn the 9th day of June, 1902, appellee, by written contract, leased to appellant, who was engaged in the manufacture of ice and sale of ice and beer and intoxicating liquors, a certain building in Waxahachie, Ellis County, Texas, for the term of three years, to begin June 1, 1903. Appellant agreed to pay as rent for the use of said building, the sum of $2,100 in quarterly installments of $175 each. Said contract is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u201c 'The State of Texas, County of Ellis.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u201c 'This lease, made on the \u2014day of-, 189\u2014, between B. A.

Keenan.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Houston Ice and Brewing Co.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">\u201cAt the time of the making of the foregoing lease appellant took an assignment from appellee of his rights as landlord of an unexpired lease, which had been granted to one Jake Cohen, the unexpired term of which was, at that time, fourteen months from April 1, 190.2. After the execution and delivery of the lease and before the term thereof began an election was ordered by the Commissioner\u2019s Court of Ellis County, under .what.is known as our \u201clocal option statute,\u201d and held throughout the county, to determine whether or not the sale of intoxicating liquors should be prohibited in that county. The election resulted in favor of prohibition and local option became effective in said county on October 11, 1902, and has continuously remained in force since that date. Appellant claimed that the stipulation in the lease, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>that the demised premises should be used for the saloon business, constituted an express covenant that said premises should be used for no other purpose; that such use became illegal by the adoption of local option in Ellis County, and by reason thereof it was absolved from liability for the agreed rent. Taking this view of the matter appellant notified appellee that it could not carry out the agreement, and refused to occupy the leased building.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u201cAppellee insisted on the validity of the lease contract, at all times recognized defendant\u2019s rights thereunder, and tendered the building to appellant at the beginning of the lease term and demanded payment of the rent in accordance with the terms of the contract. Appellant refused to receive the building or to pay the rent and this suit was brought to recover the first installment thereof. A jury being waived the trial court filed <em>conclusions of fact and </em>found, <em>among other </em>things, in effect, that the lease to Jake Cohen of the building in question, was in writing, was dated June 1, 1900, and was for a term of three years, beginning on that date; that said Cohen\u2019s lease provided, \u201cthat said premises shall be used for mercantile and no other purpose,\u201d that it further provided as follows: \u201cIt is also agreed in the event of prohibition being carried in this town Jake Cohen is permitted to cancel this lease.\u201d These conclusions of fact found by the court are not attacked. Judgment having been <em>rendered for </em>appellee, appellant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u201cQuestion 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u201cDid the stipulation in the lease contract, That said premises shall be used for the saloon business\u2019 constitute a covenant on the part of appellant that it would use the land and premises for that particular purpose and operate as an implied restriction against other uses?</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u201cQuestion <em>2.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\"><em>\u201cWas </em>the lease contract rendered illegal, and appellant absolved from <em>liability for the rents therein </em>agreed to be paid by reason of the adoption of local option in Ellis County subsequent to the execution of said contract, prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors in said county ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">To both questions we answer: assuming that the stipulation referred to in the first question \u201cconstitutes a covenant\u201d nevertheless the contract of lease was not \u201crendered illegal,\u201d nor was appellant absolved from liability for rents \u201cby the adoption of local option in Ellis County.\u201d The opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals clearly states reasons which are satisfactory to this court and that opinion is adopted and directed to be published with these answers.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
