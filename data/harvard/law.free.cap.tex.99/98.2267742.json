Gulf, C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Harriett, 80 Texas, 81; Henry v. Sansom, 21 S. W., 69; Trinity &amp; S. Ry. Co. v.

St. Louis, A. &amp; T. Ry. v. Taylor, 5 Texas Civ., 671; Galveston, H. &amp; S. A. Ry. v. Kutac, 76 Texas, 478.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-6\">Third Proposition Under the Fifth Specification of Error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-7\">The eleventh paragraph of the general charge of the court,, recited in the above assignment of error, is erroneous, in that it assumes that the plaintiff was in a position of peril at some particular time before the collision which caused her injury, and that such peril existed at a place and a sufficient time before the collision, as that, had it been known to defendant\u2019s employes they could have prevented her injury. St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co. v. Sibley, 68 S. W., 516; Texas P. R. Y. Co. v. Berry, 72 S. W., 423; Texas Mid. Ry. Co. v. Booth, 80 S. W., 121.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-9\">Fourth Proposition Under the Fifth Assignment of Error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-10\">The eleventh paragraph of the court\u2019s charge to the jury is error, in that it assumes, that the car with which the vehicle <em>in </em>which she was riding came into collision was the sole cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury, when the proximate cause of her injury was a controverted fact and was a material issue both in the pleadings and in the evidence. Houston &amp; T. C. Ry. Co. v. Nixon, 52 Texas, 28; Galveston, H. &amp; S. A. Ry. Co. v. Davidson, 61 Texas, 205; Flanagan v. Boggess, 46 Texas, 334; Western U. Tel. Co. v.

Davidson, 43 Texas, 39.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-13\">Fifth Proposition Under the Fifth Assignment of Error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-14\">The eleventh paragraph of <em>the </em>general charge recited in the above assignment of error, is erroneous, in that the evidence adduced on the trial did not justify, nor authorize the issue of \u201cdiscovered peril\u201d as thereby submitted. Willis v. Whitsitt, 67 Texas, 676; Texas &amp; P. Ry. v. Hightower, 12 Texas Civ. App., 44; Texas &amp; P. Ry. v. Berchfield, 12 Texas Civ. App., 145; Galveston, etc., Ry. Co. v. Silegman, 23 S. W. R., 300.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-15\"><em>Templeton &amp; Harding </em>and <em>G. C. Groce, </em>for defendant m error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b122-16\">WILLIAMS, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AaK\">A carriage in which defendant in error was riding with her father and three other ladies along a public street of Waxahachie, was struck at a crossing upon plaintiff in, error\u2019s track by one of its cars which was kicked by its servants across the street with no engine attached and without any signals of bell or whistle, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>defendant in error received the injuries to recover for which this suit was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Many grounds for the reversal of the judgment which she recovered were urged in the Court of Civil Appeals and are presented in the application for writ of error. We were of the opinion in granting the application that all of them were properly disposed of by the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals, except those in which the eleventh paragraph of the charge to the jury was attacked. We discovered what we thought to be errors in that part of the charge and therefore granted the writ; but on further examination of the briefs in the Court of Civil Appeals and the application, we find that none of the propositions in either are addressed to the matter which we regarded as erroneous. The whole of the eleventh paragraph is assigned as error, but it is lengthy and embraces a number of distinct rules, so that the mere assignment does not point out the particular in which it is claimed to be wrong. Propositions were therefore essential, under the rules, to bring to the attention of the court, the particular complaints made of it, and those inserted in the briefs did not point out to the Court of Civil Appeals the view of the charge in which we were inclined to think it erroneous; and, in this, the application follows the briefs. It would be improper for this court to decide the case upon points not properly raised. There was no error in the charge in the particulars complained of and we shall not undertake to determine whether or not, in others, it was erroneous. We may say, however, that we should hesitate to hold, under the facts of this case, that the judgment should be reversed, even if it should be found that this part of the charge was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
