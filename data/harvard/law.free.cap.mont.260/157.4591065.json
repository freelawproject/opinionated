Reardon presiding. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court determined that the claimant, Danny Beery (Beery), was not entitled to receive domiciliary care benefits, nor was he entitled to his costs, attorney\u2019s fees, or a penalty. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>In his brief, Beery raises issues concerning equitable estoppel, waiver, breach of contract, judicial estoppel, attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and statutory penalties. For reasons discussed below, however, the only issue before this Court is whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in concluding that CNA was not equitably estopped from contesting Beery\u2019s entitlement to domiciliary care benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">On November 4, 1984, Beery suffered an industrial injury while working for Grace Drilling. He fell approximately twenty-five feet from an oil rig, suffering multiple fractures to his left leg, first, second and third degree bums, and a closed head injury that initially went undetected. Respondent CNA Insurance Company (CNA) served as Grace Drilling\u2019s insurer under Plan II of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Beery is currently receiving permanent total disability benefits. Those benefits are not contested or at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In February 1989, CNA petitioned the district court to have a limited guardian and conservator appointed to represent Beery and manage his affairs regarding his workers\u2019 compensation claim. The district court appointed Beery\u2019s son, Jess, for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Because Beery does not contest the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s ultimate determination that he is not entitled to domiciliary care benefits under the five part test adopted in <em>Carlson v. Cain </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 129, 700 P.2d 607, an extensive discussion of the medical evidence is not necessary. A summary of the three medical panel evaluations Beery underwent provides sufficient background for an understanding of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In May 1987, the Yellowstone Valley Medical Evaluation Panel found that Beery demonstrated significant organic brain syndrome and that his intellect, thinking ability, judgment, affect, and potential were \u201cmarkedly impaired.\u201d The panel expressed concerns about Beery\u2019s competency to manage his own affairs but found him self-sufficient. It suggested psychological retesting in six to twelve months.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">In November 1987, the same panel found that there had been \u201cno significant change\u201d in the test results from the May evaluation; therefore, the panel anticipated that Beery\u2019s condition had stabilized. The panel felt that although Beery did not require constant supervision he would need \u201cat least once daily assistance and supervision.\u201d It did not feel that he needed an attendant to help him perform independently the activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, feeding and meeting basic bodily needs. The panel did feel that Beery would need assistance in handling his financial and legal affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>At CNA\u2019s request, a Kalispell medical panel evaluated Beery in April 1991. The members of this panel conducted their own evaluations and reviewed Beery\u2019s extensive medical records and the results of the two previous medical panel evaluations. They also reviewed surveillance reports and video tapes of Beery that showed him driving his truck on numerous occasions and operating a tractor on his farm. The panel concluded that Beery did not need a personal attendant or domiciliary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Prior to receiving the Kalispell report, CNAhad been paying Beery domiciliary care benefits. In a letter dated September 25,1987, James Putman, CNA\u2019s adjuster, stated that CNA would initiate payments \u201cpending further evaluation as to the necessity and extent of your client\u2019s domiciliary requirements... [and] as a compromise in an effort to avoid premature litigation ....\u201d In a letter dated March 17, 1988, Putman agreed to pay $616 per week for Beery\u2019s past care and to continue at that rate in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">On April 30, 1988, the parties entered an agreement entitled \u201cCompromise, Settlement And Release Of Claim For Payment For Domiciliary Care Previously Provided.\u201d That settlement covered the period from November 24, 1984 through April 16, 1988. The parties stated that they desired to \u201cresolv[e] such claim without further cost, time, litigation or expense,\u201d and the settlement was made \u201cwithout any admissions on anyone\u2019s part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">After entering that settlement, CNA continued to pay benefits at the rate of $616 per week. Then, based on the report of the Kalispell panel, CNA terminated all payments for domiciliary care on August 12,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Beery responded to the termination of benefits by petitioning the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for a hearing, praying that domiciliary care benefits be reinstated. The parties stated the issues in the pretrial order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">1. Whether the claimant has been since August 12, 1991, and currently is entitled to receive domiciliary care paid for by the Defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">2. Is the claimant entitled to a penalty, reasonable costs and attorney fees pursuant to Montana law?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">The parties\u2019 \u201cStatement of Contentions\u201d in the pretrial order merely reiterated the issues stated above. Beery raised the issues of waiver, breach of contract, and judicial estoppel for the first time in his proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and judgment. Beery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>raised and briefed the issue of equitable estoppel for the first time in his reply to CNA\u2019s proposed findings, conclusions, and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded that Beery had failed to support his need for domiciliary care by medical evidence as required by <em>Carlson. </em>The court also concluded that CNA was not equitably estopped from terminating benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In reviewing a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, we determine whether substantial credible evidence supports its findings. <em>Richardson v. Columbia Falls Aluminum Co. </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 41, 43, 808 P.2d 500, 501. In reviewing conclusions of law we determine whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Stanley Structures v. Scribner </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 236, 239, 833 P.2d 166, 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not address the issues of waiver, breach of contract, or judicial estoppel, presumably because these were not raised in the petition or the pretrial order. Under Rule 16(e), M.R.Civ.P., the pretrial order \u201ccontrols] the subsequent course of the action unless modified by a subsequent order.\u201d The pretrial order \u201cshould be liberally construed to permit any issues at trial that are \u2018embraced within its language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell v. Richards </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 215, 217, 741 P.2d 788, 790 (citations omitted). However, the limited statement of issues in the pretrial order in this case cannot be construed so liberally as to embrace the issues of waiver, judicial estoppel and breach of contract. The threshold question in determining entitlement to domiciliary care benefits is whether the five part test of <em>Carlson </em>is met. Furthermore, we said in <em>Montana Deaconess Medical Center v. Doherty </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 243, 246, 786 P.2d 669, 671, that \u201c[w]e may on appeal review only those issues decided by the District Court....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">We distinguish this case from <em>Akhtar v. Van De Wetering </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 205, 642 P.2d 149, where we found that there was sufficient indication that due process was an issue at the trial level to consider it on appeal. There, we relied on the fact that due process was referred to extensively in the appellant\u2019s trial brief and proposed conclusions of law and the district court made a specific finding regarding due process. 642 P.2d at 152. In the present case, Beery did not argue these issues before the hearing, but only interjected them into his proposed findings and conclusions. As the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not address these issues, we will not address them either.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Beery does not contest the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusion that he failed to meet the five part test of <em>Carlson </em>for entitlement to domiciliary care benefits. Because he did not raise or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>argue this issue in his brief, the issue is deemed waived and we need not address it. <em>Teesdale v. Anschutz Drilling Co. </em>(1960), 138 Mont. 427, 431, 357 P.2d 4, 7; <em>Hagerty v. Hall </em>(1959), 135 Mont. 276, 283, 340 P.2d 147, 151. See also <em>Schaubel v. Iversen </em>(1993), [257 Mont. 164], 848 P.2d 489, 50 St.Rep. 213 (issue of whether district court erred in determining that appellants had failed to establish prima facie case of negligence was waived because not raised or argued in their brief). \u201cThis Court will not endeavor to review a matter when appellant has directed no argument toward it.\u201d <em>Sands v. Nestegard </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 421, 428, 646 P.2d 1189, 1193.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Furthermore, because we hold that CNA properly terminated domiciliary care benefits, Beery is not entitled to attorneys fees, costs or a penalty. See \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-611 and 39-71-2907, MCA (1983). <em>Equitable Estoppel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Beery raised and briefed the issue of equitable estoppel in his reply to CNA\u2019s proposed findings, conclusions and judgment. He explained that he raised the issue then for the first time because \u201cit was not until receipt of the Defendant\u2019s Proposed Findings, Conclusions, and Judgment that the Claimant realized that the Defendant was going to ask this Court to reheve it from the obligation to pay for domiciliary care which it willingly undertook in 1988 by revealing that it really didn\u2019t mean what it said when the contract was negotiated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court addressed the issue of equitable estoppel, concluding that Beery failed to meet the first of six elements required for the doctrine to apply. We have stated the elements as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">\u201c1. There must be conduct \u2014 acts, language, or silence \u2014 amounting to a representation or a concealment of material facts. 2. These facts must be known to the party estopped at the time of his said conduct, or at least the circumstances must be such that knowledge of them is necessarily imputed to him. 3. The truth concerning these facts must be unknown to the other party claiming the benefit of the estoppel, at the time when it was acted upon by him. 4. The conduct must be done with the intention, or at least with the expectation, that it will be acted upon by the other party, or under such circumstances that it is both natural and probable that it will be so acted upon. ... 5. The conduct must be relied upon by the other party, and, thus relying, he must be led to act upon it. 6. He must in fact act upon it in such a manner as to change his position for the worse....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>Mellem v. Kalispell Laundry &amp; Dry Cleaners </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 439, 442, 774 P.2d 390, 392 (quoting <em>Davis v. Jones </em>(1983), 203 Mont. 464, 467, 661 P.2d 859, 861). We reaffirmed and readopted these as the six essential elements in <em>Dagel v. City of Great Falls </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 224, 819 P.2d 186. However, \u201c[e]stoppel is not favored and will only be sustained upon clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Dagel, </em>819 P.2d at 193 (quoting <em>Kenneth D. Collins Agency v. Hagerott </em>(1984), 211 Mont. 303, 310, 684 P.2d 487, 490).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">We also pointed out in <em>Dagel </em>that \u00a7 26-1-601, MCA, should be considered in an equitable estoppel case. 819 P.2d at 193. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">List of conclusive presumptions. The following presumptions are conclusive:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">(1) the truth of a declaration, act, or omission of a party, as against that party in any litigation arising out of such declaration, act, or omission, whenever he has, by such declaration, act, or omission, intentionally led another to believe a particular thing true and to act upon such belief!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">In the present case, CNA\u2019s adjuster, Putman, sent a letter to Beery\u2019s lawyer on January 7,1988, stating among other things, \u201cFor the record, the insurer does <em>not </em>contest your client\u2019s entitlement to domiciliary care, the full extent and value of which is yet to be determined.\u201d Beery relies solely on this statement to argue that \u201cit must be conclusively presumed that Danny is entitled to compensated domiciliary care.\u201d We disagree. The statement is qualified as to both extent and value. CNA made no representation that Beery would always be entitled to domiciliary care benefits. The extent of care Beery required certainly could change over time. The medical evidence from the Kalispell panel was that Beery did not require domiciliary care in April of 1991. Therefore, this statement did not establish conclusively that Beery was and would always be entitled to domiciliary care. This is distinguishable from <em>Dagel </em>where the defendant made an affirmative, unqualified statement that the plaintiff was not covered by a contract or grievance procedure. 819 P.2d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">As for equitable estoppel, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that Beery failed to meet the first of the six elements \u2014 a representation or concealment of material fact. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court reviewed the parties\u2019 entire correspondence, concluding that it showed CNA\u2019s reservations about Beery\u2019s entitlement to domiciliary care benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Specifically, the court relied on the document dated April 30,1988, entitled \u201cCompromise, Settlement And Release Of Claim For Payment For Domiciliary Care Previously Provided.\u201d In that document the parties compromised and settled Beery\u2019s claim for domiciliary care for the period November 24, 1984, to April 16, 1988. They acknowledged that the purpose of the agreement was to resolve any claim Beery had for domiciliary care during that period to avoid further cost, time, litigation, or expense. They also stated that it was made \u201cwithout any admissions on anyone\u2019s part.\u201d Based on this, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded that Beery could not argue that he was never advised that CNA acknowledged his entitlement to domiciliary care only for the purpose of settlement and to avoid litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Beery argues to this Court that the language in the April 1988 settlement referred only to the specific time period stated therein \u2014 November 24, 1984 to April 16,1988 \u2014 and no other. However, it was entered into three months after the January 7, 1988, letter on which Beery solely relies and covered any benefits he received during that period. The fact that those three months of payments were made only in the spirit of compromise and \u201cwithout any admissions\u201d supports the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings and conclusions that no representation or concealment occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court also concluded that the fact that the document of April 16 did not mention domiciliary care after that date could not be construed to mean that CNA admitted Beery was entitled to benefits after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The correspondence between the parties indicates CNA\u2019s reservations about Beery\u2019s need for domiciliary care. It also indicates CNA\u2019s willingness to initiate and pay benefits without admitting liability for the reasons stated above. In the September 25,1987, letter to Beery\u2019s counsel indicating that CNA would initiate benefits, Putman stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhT\">[T]his correspondence will serve to confirm the insurer\u2019s agreement to initiate biweekly domiciliary payments... pending further evaluation as to the necessity and extent of your client\u2019s domiciliary requirements. This agreement is intended as a compromise in an effort to avoid premature litigation and is not to be construed as an admission of liability [or] waiver of any future rights of defense. ... [I]t is my understanding that you agree that the payment of these benefits are in lieu of further investigation of your client\u2019s cognitive impairment and the extent of cognitive deficit through further medical panel evaluation ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>After receiving the November 1987 medical panel report, Putman sent Beery\u2019s counsel a letter on December 10,1987, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">In addressing your concerns regarding the issue of your domiciliary care, I will remain flexible on this issue as well. However, prior to any final determinations in this regard, I believe it would be appropriate to see what changes result from the recommended treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">To this point, CNAhad made no representation or concealed anything from Beery. The January 7, 1988, letter on which Beery relies followed. In that letter, Putman prefaced the specific statement Beery relies on by stating, \u201cIn conclusion, my correspondence of December 10, 1987 clearly references the insure[r]\u2019s position regarding the domiciliary care issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The statement Beery relies on cannot be read in a vacuum. It must be read in light of the other correspondence between the parties and the agreement of April 16, 1988. It must also be read in light of the prefacing statement and the qualifying language in the statement itself. When read in this manner, it does not amount to the \u201cexpress[] representation], without qualification\u201d that Beery argues CNA made.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Furthermore, even if the first element of equitable estoppel were satisfied, Beery could not satisfy the sixth element, which requires that he be put in a worse position than he would have been had there not been a representation or concealment. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court specifically concluded that Beery failed to satisfy the requirements that 1) the preponderance of credible medical evidence demonstrate a need for home nursing care, with a description of that care; 2) the services be performed under the direction of a physician; and 3) the services be of the type normally rendered by trained attendants and not within the scope of normal household duties. Beery argues that because he relied on Putman\u2019s statement he made no further attempt after January 1988 to establish the five elements of the <em>Carlson </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">However, Beery had a full opportunity to develop this evidence for the hearing. The record before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court contained the depositions of Beery\u2019s wife and two sons and the depositions of some of the doctors from the medical panels that evaluated Beery. It also contained the extensive medical records and reports and the surveillance tapes produced by the insurer\u2019s investigator. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded that the evidence showed Beery was not entitled to domiciliary care. Because he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>full opportunity before the hearing to develop his case to show that domiciliary care was medically necessary, Beery cannot claim he was put in a worse position than he would have been. See <em>Berglund and Berglund, Inc. v. Contributions Bureau </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 49, 784 P.2d 933 (equitable estoppel not applicable where plaintiff could not show by clear and convincing evidence that he relied on misrepresentation to his detriment).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">We hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly concluded that CNA was not equitably estopped from contesting Berry\u2019s entitlement to domiciliary care benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b190-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
