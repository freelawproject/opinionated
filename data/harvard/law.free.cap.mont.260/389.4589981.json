We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The procedural facts relevant to this appeal are set forth in <em>State v. McGuire, </em>No. 92-534 ([50 St.Rep. 1122], 860 P.2d 148), <em>(McGuire I). </em>Subsequent to sentencing in Flathead County, McGuire was sentenced on the Gallatin County theft and burglary convictions to concurrent terms of ten and twenty years imprisonment, respectively, with five years suspended. The District Court\u2019s sentence contained no reference to the Flathead County sentence and did not expressly provide that it would run concurrently with that previously imposed sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in sentencing McGuire on the Gallatin County charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">McGuire correctly notes that the court in Flathead County expressly made its sentence consecutive to the one to be imposed in Gallatin County. He also correctly argues that, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-401(1)(a), MCA, his Gallatin County sentence is consecutive to the Flathead County sentence because it was not expressly ordered to run concurrently. On that basis, McGuire contends that the sentences are ambiguous because they run consecutively to each other and neither has a definite commencement date.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">While McGuire argues that the Gallatin County sentence was invalid and illegal, any ambiguity resulting from the combined effects of the Flathead and Gallatin County sentences was removed by our decision in <em>McGuire I. </em>There, we determined that the court in Flathead County exceeded its sentencing authority under \u00a7 46-18-401, MCA, by ordering its sentence to be served consecutively to one not yet imposed. We modified that sentence and judgment, striking the portion providing for consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">McGuire concedes that \u00a7 46-18-401(1)(a), MCA, authorizes the District Court in Gallatin County to make its sentence consecutive to the one imposed by the court in Flathead County. Under that statute, the court imposing the second sentence has the discretion to make the sentences concurrent; failure to expressly do so results in consecutive sentences. <em>McGuire I, </em>860 P.2d at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>It is clear that the District Court in Gallatin County had the statutory authority, but no affirmative duty, to merge its sentence with the one imposed in Flathead County; it declined to do so. McGuire asserts no actual error by the District Court in Gallatin County in exercising its discretion under, or in otherwise applying, \u00a7 46-18-401(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">We hold that the District Court did not err in sentencing McGuire on the Gallatin County charges. The effect of <em>McGuire I </em>and this case is that the Gallatin County sentence will run consecutive to the sentence imposed in Flathead County, as modified by this Court in <em>McGuire I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b415-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HARRISON, TRIEWEILER and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
