(MCI) from the order of the District Court of the First Judicial District, Lewis and Clark County, which granted defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss appellant\u2019s Petition for Judicial Review. The District Court denied judicial review of the Public Service Commission\u2019s order on the grounds that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the petition. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">The sole issue for our review is whether Rule 6(e), M.R.Civ.P., applies to petitions in district courts for judicial review of administrative decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">After several proceedings in this administrative action, the Montana Public Service Commission (Commission) issued its Order No. 5548c on May 18, 1992, which denied MCI\u2019s motion for reconsideration of a Commission ruling. The Commission mailed a copy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>order to MCI on May 19, 1992. MCI did not receive the copy of the order until May 21,1992. On June 19,1992, MCI filed its Petition for Judicial Review.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\">The Commission moved to dismiss MCI\u2019s petition on the grounds that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the petition, claiming that the petition was filed 31 days after service. The District Court granted the Commission\u2019s motion to dismiss and MCI now appeals this dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Did the District Court err in dismissing appellant\u2019s petition for judicial review because it was not timely filed?</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Section 2-4-702, MCA, provides that a person may institute proceedings for judicial review of an administrative decision after all administrative remedies have been exhausted. This section, part of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA), further provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">(2)(a) Proceedings for review shall be instituted by filing a petition in district court <em>within 30 days after service </em>of the final decision of the agency...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Section 2-4-702(2)(a), MCA (emphasis supplied). Noting that this indeed produced a harsh result and that the court would rather see every dispute decided after both sides are \u201cfully and fairly allowed to present their evidence and arguments to a court,\u201d the District Court nevertheless determined that service was complete when the Commission mailed a copy of the order to MCI on May 19, 1992 and that MCI\u2019s petition for judicial review was filed one day too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">An appeal filed after the time prescribed by statute is ineffective for any purpose and thus fails to confer jurisdiction upon the district court to review an administrative agency\u2019s decision. <em>State ex rel. Albrecht v. District Court </em>(1952), 126 Mont. 178, 182, 246 P.2d 1035, 1037. The timely filing of a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Albrecht, </em>126 Mont, at 180, 246 P.2d at 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">MCI contends that Rule 6(e), M.R.Civ.R, applies to this administrative proceeding and that by applying Rule 6(e), its petition for judicial review was filed on the 28th day after service and was timely filed. Rule 6(e), M.R.Civ.P, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">Rule 6(e). Additional time after service by mail. Whenever a party has the right or is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper upon the party and the notice or paper is served upon the party by mail, <em>3 days shall be added to the prescribed period. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>The Commission argues that Rule 6(e) does not apply because its effect is to extend the jurisdiction of the district court beyond thirty days, which is not allowed by Rule 82, M.R.Civ.P. Rule 82, M.R.Civ.P., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">Rule 82. Jurisdiction and venue unaffected. Except as provided in Rule 4 these rules shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the district courts of Montana or the venue of actions therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The Commission argues that service of notice was complete on the day it mailed a copy of the order to MCI.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The Commission relies on numerous cases from federal courts and other states to support its argument that Rule 6(e) does not apply in an appeal from an administrative agency decision to the district court. We have reviewed these cases and found them unpersuasive because they address the applicability of Rule 6(e) in cases where statutes define service as either the date of mailing or the date of receipt of notice. <em>See, e.g., Ramsdell v. Ohio Civil Rights Comm\u2019n </em>(Ohio 1990), 563 N.E.2d 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The district court\u2019s jurisdiction is controlled by the period of time prescribed by the legislature and is limited to the time provided by the applicable statute. The right to an appeal of an administrative agency\u2019s ruling is created by statute and is limited by the provisions of the statute as to the time within which the right must be asserted. <em>Zeller v. Folsom </em>(N.D.N.Y. 1956), 150 F. Supp. 615, 617. Where the time for filing an appeal is dictated by the statute which confers the right to appeal, Rule 6(e) cannot be applied to extend the time for filing as this would be an extension of the court\u2019s jurisdiction. In this case, the time to appeal is not dictated by any statute which prescribes that service is complete when placed in the mail as the Commission contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The 3-day extension applies only where the time period for doing an act runs from the time of service of notice. This 3-day period is computed separately and determines the date when the 30-day time for appeal begins to run. The Wyoming Supreme Court quoted the rationale for the 3-day extension in Rule 6(e) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">[TJhe rule clearly is intended to protect parties who are served notice by mail from suffering a systematic diminution of their time to respond through the application of Rule 5(b), which provides that service is complete upon mailing, not receipt; the additional three days provided by Rule 6(e) to the party being served represent a reasonable transmission time, and a fair compromise be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>tween the harshness of measuring strictly from the date of mailing and the indefiniteness of attempting to measure from the date of receipt, which in many cases would be unverifiable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><em>Sellers v. Employment Sec. Comm\u2019n of Wyo. </em>(Wyo. 1988), 760 P.2d 394, 397 (quoting 4AC. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d \u00a7 1171 at 514-15 (1987)). As in <em>Sellers, </em>the appeal period in this case is triggered by sending notice in the mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Neither MAPA nor the Commission rules define \u201cservice.\u201d Section 2-4-106, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">Service. Except where a statute expressly provides to the contrary, service in all agency proceedings subject to the provisions of this chapter and in proceedings for judicial review thereof shall be as prescribed for civil actions in the district courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The Commission argues that \u00a7 2-4-106, MCA, merely provides for the manner of service to be the same as civil actions in the district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">We have previously stated that \u201cservice\u201d under MAPA is governed by the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure unless a statute expressly provides otherwise. <em>Rierson v. State </em>(1980), 188 Mont. 522, 527, 614 P.2d 1020, 1023 (citing \u00a7 2-4-106, MCA). This is consistent with the <em>Ramsdell </em>case cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Our treatment of workers\u2019 compensation appeals to this Court provides further persuasion for treating administrative agency appeals to district courts in a manner similar to other proceedings. In a workers\u2019 compensation case which challenged the timeliness of an appeal to the district court, this Court noted that proceedings in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court are governed by MAPA and, therefore, \u00a7 2-4-623, MCA, applies to require service by mail or personally. <em>Dumont v. Wickens Bros. Constr. Co. </em>(1979), 183 Mont. 190, 200, 598 P.2d 1099, 1105. We further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">[A] person who appeals from a final decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court should in all fundamental fairness be given the same benefit of that provision of Rule 5, M.R.App.Civ.P., which states that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">\u201c... except that in cases where service of notice of entry of judgement is required by Rule 77(d) of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure the time shall be 30 days from the service of notice of entry of judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-11\">This would mean, as is already the case where Rule 77(d), M.R.Civ.P., is applicable, that when service of the notice of the final decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is made as mandated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>by section 2-4-623 MCA and that service was made by mail, the provisions of Rule 21(c) M.R.App.Civ.P., are automatically put into play adding three days to the prescribed 30-day time limit for filing the notice of appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">... Rule 21(c) comes into play adding three days to the prescribed period and the 33rd and final day for filing the notice of appeal was November 2, 1978. Thus, claimant\u2019s appeal was timely \u2014 not one day late as respondent claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\"><em>Dumont v. Wickens Bros. Constr. Co. </em>(1979), 183 Mont. 190, 200, 598 P.2d 1099, 1105.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The appeal <em>in Dumont </em>was from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court directly to the Montana Supreme Court and thus was governed by the Rules of Appellate Procedure. Rule 21(c), M.R.App.R, is the equivalent of Rule 6(e), M.R.Civ.P. The provision in \u00a7 2-4-623, MCA, requiring notice either personally or by mail is identical to Rule 77(d), M.R.Civ.P., insofar as requiring notice of decisions in workers\u2019 compensation cases. In <em>Dumont, </em>this Court interpreted \u00a7 2-4-623, MCA, as requiring that 3 days be added to the prescribed 30-day time limit for filing a notice of appeal in the Supreme Court for an appeal from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">We conclude that there is a need for uniformity and fairness in the application of rules relating to the time when an appeal begins to run. The 30-day appeal period cannot begin to run until the effective date of service. Section 2-4-106, MCA, of MAPA does not define \u201cservice\u201d but it provides that service in agency proceedings be as prescribed for civil actions in the district courts. Because MAPA uses the term \u201cservice\u201d but does not define when service is effective, \u00a7 2-4-106, MCA, requires that Rule 6(e) be applied to define when service by mail is complete for administrative decisions. We conclude that service was not effective upon MCI until May 22, 1992, three days after mailing notice of the Commission\u2019s order. We further conclude that the 30-day period allowed for filing a petition for judicial review began to run on May 23,1992, the day following service by mail, that the petition was filed within thirty days and that the District Court had jurisdiction to hear this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">We hold the District Court erred in dismissing appellant\u2019s petition for judicial review for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b204-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
