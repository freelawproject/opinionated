The restraining order was made returnable on a date fixed, and was served on Messrs. Church &amp; Church, members of the bar, presumably on the supposition that they were the solicitors representing the defendants in the prosecution of the applications in the Patent Office. The subpoena was returned by the United States marshal \u201cnot found;\u201d and thereafter Messrs. Church &amp; Church entered an appearance in the cause in the lower court in the following language:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-6\">\u201cThe clerk will please enter our special appearance herein for the defendants, Arthur Manchester and Harris Spooner, for the purpose (1) of moving to quash the subpoena issued against said defendants on the 16th day of December, 1912; and (2) of moving to vacate and set aside the order of the 16th of December, 1912, directing a restraining order against the said defendants, and for no other purpose.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-7\">At the same time Messrs.

The defendants thereupon filed an application in this court for the allowance of a special appeal from such order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-5\"><em>Messrs.
