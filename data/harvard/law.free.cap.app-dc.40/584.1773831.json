Ferres from a decision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the Commissioner of Patents denying an application for a: patent having the three following claims:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">1. A box or box lid comprising the body portion A having the extensions B hinged thereto, said portion A and extensions-B being made of double-faced corrugated paper board, and wood veneer strips secured to such extensions on the inner\u2019 sides thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">2. A box or box lid comprising the body portion A having-the extensions B hinged thereto, said portion A and extensions B being made of double-faced corrugated paper board, strengthening strips D secured to the inner sides of such extensions and made of different and stiffer material' than said board, and. tapes C for holding the extensions together at their corners.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">3. A box or box lid comprising the body portion A having-the extensions B hinged thereto, said portion A and extensions B being made of double-faced corrugated paper board, tapes-C for holding the extension together at their corners, wood veneer strips D secured to the inner sides of such extensions and staples \u201cd\u201d extending through said extensions and strips- and in addition at the corners through the tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">As stated by the Commissioner: \u201cThe structure covered by the appealed claims is a box or cover for the same, consisting-of a bottom having side pieces hinged thereto and folded up so-as to form the sides of the box, the corners being reinforced by tapes glued thereto and the sides being reinforced by strips of\u2019 wooden veneer, secured thereto by staples.\u201d The material of the box is known as corrugated or cellular paper board. Patent-ability was denied on references to a number of other patents,. American and British.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">The corrugated paper board is an old and well-known material used for boxes and protective wrappings. Ferres himself has a patent, issued April 15, 1902, for a shipping package consisting of a box made of heavy corrugated paper board, protected on the outside by wooden slabs forming a crate. Maunsell-Smyth has a patent, September 27, 1904, for boxes made-of corrugated paper board, folded in a peculiar fashion. A patent to Forsyth, August 8, 1893, shows a box of stiff paper-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>-cardboard, the sides of which are reinforced by strips of like material. Heston\u2019s patent, June 19, 1883, shows the box and box lid or cover with the corner adhesive tapes. The appli\u25a0cant\u2019s contention that there is a patentable \u25a0 difference between his wooden veneer strips used for reinforcing, and the cardboard strips of Forsyth, used for the same purpose, was con\u2022\u25a0sidered by each tribunal of the Office and denied. The Primary Examiner said: \u201cSo far as invention is concerned, it is immaterial whether these stiffening strips are of pasteboard, card'board or of wood veneer; all of these materials being well known .in the paper box art, and the use of any one or all of them wherever desired involves nothing more than a mere selection \u25a0or choice.\u201d We concur in this conclusion, and do not find it necessary to discuss the cases cited relating to invention claimed in a substitution of materials. Conceding that invention may be found in a new structure involving a readjustment of materials by which new and useful results are obtained, or in the \u00a1 substitution of one material by another possessing an additional quality, which produces a new and useful result; yet the facts \u2022 of this case do not call for the application of the principle. Grant that the Forsyth strips of cardboard are not so strong as the wood strips of the applicant, still they are intended to .answer and do answer the same general purpose. While Forsyth\u2019s strips are of ordinary cardboard, it would not involve invention to substitute strips made of compressed paper, \u2022which latter may be of greater strength and resistance than wood. A box maker desiring to secure greater strength for \u2018his boxes might reinforce them with metal strips secured to the sides of the box in the same way; but the selection would not \u25a0constitute invention. The selection of the one or the other material to answer a given purpose is a matter of choice, not invention. Claim 2 calls for the same construction, but the \u2022strips are not limited to wood veneer as in claim 1, calling instead for \u201cdifferent and stiffer material than said boards;\u201d \u25a0and adding thereto \u201ctapes for holding the extensions together \u2022at the comers.\u201d The additional feature of the tapes is found in Heston\u2019s patent. The additional element of claim 3, namely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>securing tbe strips by means of staples, is shown in another patent, and is, moreover, nothing more than an ordinary mechanical contrivance. The combination of old elements produces no new or different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">There was no error in refusing the patent, and the decision is affirmed. The decision will be certified to the Commissioner of Patents. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
