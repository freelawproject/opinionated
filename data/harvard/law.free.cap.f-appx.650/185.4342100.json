Pesina asserts that the district court: (1) impermissibly participated in plea discussions in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1); (2) improperly assessed criminal history points on the basis of his 2002 Kansas state sentence for attempted aggravated burglary; and (3) improperly applied the 16-level drug trafficking offense enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based on his 2008 Kansas convictions for selling cocaine,</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">As Pesina concedes, he is asserting for the first time on appeal that that the district court violated Rule 11(e)(1) by participating in plea discussions. Plain error review thus applies. <em>See United States v. Davila, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2139, 186 L.Ed.2d 139 (2013) (rejecting argument that improper court participation in plea discussions requires automatic vacatur of plea rather than applying harmless or plain error review).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">At the docket call, the district court repeatedly emphasized his belief that Pesi-na would face a harsher sentence if he went to trial instead of entering a guilty plea. The following exchange is representative of the district court\u2019s comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-11\">THE COURT: ... I hope Mr. Pesina understands that by going to trial he is likely \u2014 well, not likely \u2014 he\u2019s certain to face a larger sentence than if he did not go to trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-14\">MR. GOULD: I\u2019ve tried to make that clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-15\">THE COURT: I mean, it is a certainty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4T\">Although they were likely well-intentioned, we are concerned that these statements reflect certainty about the outcome of the trial that could have pressured Pesina to plead guilty. <em>See United States v. Pena, </em>720 F.3d 561, 573 (5th Cir. 2013) (explaining that regardless of the district court\u2019s objectivity, it is the defendant\u2019s perception that determines whether he felt coerced to enter a plea). But Pesina did not plead guilty. In spite of the district court\u2019s comments he still went to trial. And he raises no argument that the district court\u2019s pretrial comments led to an unfair trial. That requires him to show that the pretrial comments amounted to a predetermination of his sentence that prejudiced him. <em>See United States v. Crowell, </em>60 F.3d 199, 205 (5th Cir. 1995) (holding that when a defendant who went to trial challenges court participation in plea negotiations, he must establish that the participation \u201caffected the court\u2019s impartiality in the conduct of the trial or sentencing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">Pesina cannot make that showing of an effect on his substantial rights. The district court sentenced Pesina to the low end of the Guideline range, which does not indicate impartiality or hostility. And unlike in <em>Crowell, </em>in which the district court rejected plea agreements because the statutory maximum sentences they allowed were too lenient, <em>id. </em>the pretrial comments in this case indicate no specific consideration of Pesina\u2019s conduct or sentence prior to the sentencing hearing. The district court made only a general observation about the relative sentences of those who plead guilty versus those who are convicted at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>trial. Of course, the observation is also a true one as the Guidelines provide for lower sentences when a defendant has accepted responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Pesina thus has not shown that any district court error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The comparison with <em>Crowell </em>reveals another reason why Pesina cannot overcome plain error review. The court participation in <em>Crowell </em>and other Rule 11(c)(1) cases came in the context of a plea negotiation. Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1) (\u201cAn attorney for the government and the defendant\u2019s attorney ... may discuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate in these discussions.\u201d). In contrast, there is no indication here that any plea agreement was being negotiated. Pesina thus cannot, establish any obvious error arising from court involvement in a defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty that is unconnected to any potential plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Reasor, </em>418 F.3d 466, 478-79 (5th Cir. 2005) (\u201cAs there was no ongoing plea negotiation, Rule ll\u2019s prohibition does not apply.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">That leaves the two sentencing issues Pesina raises. This court reviews for-clear error Pesina\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s determination' that his 2002 Kansas state sentence for attempted aggravated burglary, when aggregated with his 2007 Kansas state probation revocation sentence, qualified for three criminal history points. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1(a), 4A1.2(k); <em>United States v. Nava, </em>624 F.3d 226, 229 (5th Cir. 2010); <em>United States v. Martinez-Moncivais, </em>14 F.3d 1030, 1038 (5th Cir. 1994). The Kansas state sentencing documents appended to the Presentence Report (PSR) identified the imprisonment terms for each of Pesina\u2019s 2002 and 2007 sentences as 12 months. Because Pesina failed to offer any sworn testimony or other rebuttal evidence to counter the PSR\u2019s determination that his aggregated sentences exceeded 13 months, the district court was free to adopt the PSR\u2019s finding without further inquiry. <em>See United States v. Mir, </em>919 F.2d 940, 943 (5th Cir. 1990). Pesina\u2019s appellate challenge to this factual finding as clear error cannot rely on previously available information regarding Kansas\u2019 state sentencing processes that is presented for the first time in this appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir. 1999). The district court thus did not clearly err in determining Pesina\u2019s criminal history score. <em>See United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Pesina concedes that his final argument \u2014 that the district court erred in applying the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i) drug trafficking enhancement because the Kansas drug offense includes not just selling drugs but giving drugs as a gift \u2014is being raised for the first time on appeal. But the standard of review does not matter as this challenge is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>782 F.3d 198, 204-05 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 533, 193 L.Ed.2d 426 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b210-12\"> Pursuant to 5th CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th CIR.
