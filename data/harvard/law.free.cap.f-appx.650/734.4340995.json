He argues, for the first time on appeal, that his conviction for brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence should be vacated because, after <em>Johnson v. United States (Samuel Johnson), </em>576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), bank robbery is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d that can support the conviction. He also challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence, claiming that the district court erred in' considering rehabilitation when imposing a term of imprisonment and that his sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of his age and lack of criminal history. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Fox contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Samuel Johnson </em>invalidated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), one of two provisions defining what is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (criminalizing possession of a firearm during and in relation to, or in furtherance of, a crime of violence). <em>According </em>to Fox, \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B)\u2019s definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is unconstitutionally vague for the same reasons the Court in <em>Samuel Johnson </em>held the \u201cresidual clause\u201d of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), unconstitutionally vague. He also argues that bank robbery does not qualify under \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s other definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because it does not have as an element \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">We generally review constitutional challenges to a statute <em>de novo. United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir. 2009). Arguments raised for the first time on appeal in a criminal case, however, are reviewed for plain error only. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir. 2005). \u201cTo find plain error, there must be: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that has affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Hesser, </em>800 F.3d 1310, 1324 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting other sources). If those three conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to correct the error, \u201cbut only if the error seriously affectfs] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Because Fox did not raise his arguments to the district court, we review for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">\u201cAn error is plain if it is obvious and clear under current law[,]\u201d <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 948 (11th Cir. 2006), which is determined at the time the case is reviewed on appeal, <em>United States v. Pantle, </em>637 F.3d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir. 2011). The threshold for establishing a \u201cplain\u201d error is high. Unless the explicit language of a statute or rule specifically resolves an issue, there can be no plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>error without precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving the issue. <em>Hesser, </em>800 F.3d at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Fox was convicted of violating \u00a7 924(c), which states, in relevant part, that \u201cany person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence!,]\u201d be sentenced to a consecutive term of imprisonment of not less than five years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i). If the firearm was brandished, the consecutive term of imprisonment must be not less than seven years. <em>Id, </em>\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The statute defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as a felony that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">(A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">(B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-9\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">Fox compares subsection (B) above to the ACCA\u2019s \u201cresidual clause,\u201d one of three ways a prior conviction could qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of enhancing a defendant\u2019s sentence under the ACCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The residual clause provided that an offense was a violent felony if it \u201cotherwise involve[d] conduct that present[ed] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">The Supreme Court in <em>Samuel Johnson </em>held the residual clause unconstitutionally vague because it creates uncertainty about (1) how to evaluate the risks posed by the crime in an abstract \u201cordinary case,\u201d instead of based on concrete factors or statutory elements, and (2) how much risk it takes to qualify as a violent felony. 135 S.Ct. at 2557-58. The Court explained that the residual clause forced courts to interpret the requisite degree of risk in light of the enumerated crimes, which were \u201cfar from clear in respect to the degree of risk each posed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2558. The Court also observed that the vagueness of the residual clause was confirmed by the Court\u2019s own repeated failed attempts to craft a principled and objective standard out of the residual clause, as well as the fact that the clause proved nearly impossible to apply consistently in the lower courts. <em>Id, </em>at 2558-60:</p>\n<p id=\"b761-14\">Here, Fox has not shown plain error for two main reasons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, <em>Samuel Johnson </em>did not expressly invalidate the crime-of-violence definition in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) or even broadly condemn criminal laws using risk-based terms. <em>See </em>135 S.Ct. at 2561. Nor is it clear that <em>Samuel Johnson\u2019s </em>reasoning regarding the ACCA\u2019s residual clause applies with equal force to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B). Section 924(c)(3)(B)\u2019s definition of crime of violence may require gauging the riskiness of conduct by reference \u201cto an idealized ordinary case of the crime,\u201d <em>see United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number><em>Keelan, </em>786 F.3d 865, 871 (11th Cir. 2015) (holding that an identical \u2022 definition of crime of violence in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) is subject to the \u201cordinary case\u201d analysis when evaluating the riskiness of conduct), but it does not \u201clink[] a phrase such as \u2018substantial risk\u2019 to a confusing list of examples,\u201d as the residual clause does, <em>see Samuel Johnson, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2561. In addition, Fox has not shown that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) has been subject to the same kind of uncertainty in application as the residual clause. <em>See Samuel Johnson, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2559-60. There may be other relevant differences as well, but it is enough to note that the two provisions are not identical in language or application. Therefore, it is not clear or obvious that <em>Samuel Johnson </em>invalidated \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Second, Fox has not shown that bank robbery under \u00a7 2113 plainly does not qualify under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s other definition of the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d \u2014 a felony that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). Section 2113(a) provides that bank robbery must be committed \u201cby force and violence, or by intimidation.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). \u201cUnder section 2113(a), intimidation occurs when an ordinary person in the teller\u2019s position reasonably could infer a threat of bodily harm from the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelley, </em>412 F.3d 1240, 1244 (11th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">We have not expressly held that bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(a) qualifies as a crime of violence as defined by \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), but our precedent supports the government\u2019s position that it does qualify. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1244-45 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding that a Florida robbery statute with a similar intimidation element categorically qualified as a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines because it had as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>43 F.3d 568, 572-73 (11th Cir. 1994) (stating that \u201c[t]ak[ing] or attempting] to take by force and violence or by intimidation ... encompasses the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); Likewise, at least a few other circuit courts have concluded that \u00a7 2113(a) con-stitut\u00e9s a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Wright, </em>215 F.3d 1020, 1028 (9th Cir. 2000); <em>Royal v. Tombone, </em>141 F.3d 596, 602 (5th Cir. 1998); <em>United States v. Adkins, </em>937 F.2d 947, 950 n. 2 (4th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">In any case, because Fox has not cited to, and an independent review has not uncovered, any precedent holding that bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(a) is <em>not </em>a qualifying offense under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), he cannot show plain error. <em>See Hesser, </em>800 F.3d at 1325. We affirm his \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) brandishing conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Fox also challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence. We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In reviewing a sentence for reasonableness, we first determine whether the district court committed procedural error at sentencing before evaluating whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">Fox first argues that the district court procedurally erred at sentencing by con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>sidering rehabilitation when crafting his sentence of imprisonment. Fox arguably did not preserve this argument because he did not clearly \u201cinform the district court of the legal basis for the objection.\u201d <em>United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir. 2006). He merely objected in general terms that his sentence was \u201csubstantively and procedurally\u201d unreasonable. Regardless of our standard of review, however, Fox has not shown that resentencing is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">In <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that a sentencing court may not impose or lengthen a prison term in order to promote an offender\u2019s rehabilitation. 564 U.S. 319, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 2391, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011). Following <em>Tapia, </em>we held in <em>Vandergrift </em>that a <em>\u201cTapia </em>error occurs where the district court <em>considers </em>rehabilitation when crafting a sentence of imprisonment,\u201d not merely when it tailors the length of the sentence to permit completion of a rehabilitation program, or makes rehabilitation the dominant factor in reaching its sentencing determination. <em>United States v. Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d 1303, 1310 (11th Cir. 2014) (emphasis in original). \u201cBecause it is impermissible to consider rehabilitation, a court errs by relying on or considering rehabilitation in any way when sentencing a defendant to prison.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1311. \u201cThis is true regardless of how dominant the error was in the court\u2019s analysis and regardless of whether we can tell with certainty that the court relied on rehabilitation because the sentence was tailored to a rehabilitation program.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">However, \u201ca court commits no error by discussing the opportunities for rehabilitation within prison or the benefits of specific treatment or training programs. To the contrary, a court properly may address a person who is about to begin a prison term about these important matters.\u201d <em>Tapia, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2392; <em>see Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d at 1311 (stating that although a district court may discuss rehabilitation during the sentencing hearing, the court erred because \u201cprison\u2019s rehabilitative benefits were considered in the course of deciding whether or not Vandergrift should be sentenced to prison at all\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">After careful review, we do not believe that the district court erred in considering rehabilitation when crafting Fox\u2019s sentence of imprisonment. Fox cites the following comments from the district court when discussing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors (the emphasis is Fox\u2019s):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">In addition to reflecting the seriousness of the offense, a sentence should promote respect for the law, act as a deterrent, and protect the public. You are a danger to the public unless and until you receive and follow the advice and assistance of experts who can help you understand and address your psychological issues, your drug abuse issues, those tendencies that you have, your depression. .... When you get out of prison, your chances of finding a job are not gonna get any better. They\u2019ll be substantially less likely or worse and that depression will always be there or that potential for depression, go under those circumstances, your supervision will be a challenge to the United States Probation Office and that should be addressed in the sentence as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-18\">[....]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-19\">The bottom line in this case is however troubled you may be as an individual, however skewed your thinking may have been, you committed an offense, actually two offenses, that placed yourself and others in jeopardy and society cannot allow individuals like yourself to present that risk. So you need to address it while in custody and once you\u2019re out. As [the prosecutor] says, we could be talking about something much more serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>in terms of injury to others if that gun had discharged either intentionally or accidently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">While the district court did reference the need for Fox to address his mental-health issues, these comments do not show that the district court considered the need for rehabilitation in its decision to impose or lengthen his term of imprisonment. Rather, it appears that the district court was primarily responding to Fox\u2019s arguments related to his mental-health issues and drug addiction. Moreover, there is nothing improper about the court\u2019s discussion with Fox of his opportunities for rehabilitation while in prison or the benefits of treatment programs. <em>See Tapia, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2392.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">But even assuming that the district court committed <em>Tapia </em>error, Fox has not shown that remand for resentencing is warranted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While a sentence can be unreasonable if it \u201cwas substantially affected by [the court\u2019s] consideration of impermissible factors,\u201d \u201ca district court\u2019s consideration of an impermissible factor at sentencing is harmless if the record as a whole shows the error did not substantially affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1361-62 (11th Cir. 2006), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007); <em>see Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d at 1311 (stating that <em>Tapia </em>error is treated no differently than \u201cany other instance where a court considers an impermissible sentencing factor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Here, the record conclusively demonstrates that any rehabilitative considerations \u201cconstituted only a minor fragment of the court\u2019s reasoning;\u201d <em>See Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d at 1312 (quoting <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>698 F.3d 194, 200 (4th Cir. 2012)). The primary consideration of the district court was the seriousness of the offense, repeatedly emphasized by the court at sentencing, as well as, to a lesser extent, the danger Fox posed to the public. For example, near the end of the hearing, the district court summed up its sentence entirely in terms of the seriousness of the offense: \u201ca sentence of less than [ten years] would not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense.\u201d Based on the record as a whole, we have no doubt that the error, if any, was harmless under the circumstances. <em>See Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Fox next argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to serve the purposes of sentencing in light of Fox\u2019s age, lack of criminal history, and the court\u2019s <em>Tapia </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">In sentencing a defendant, the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and then impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d of sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). These purposes are retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and, when appropriate, rehabilitation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The weight given to specific \u00a7 3553(a) factors is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir. 2007). We may conclude that a district court abused its discretion if the court (1) fails to account for a factor due significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors by arriving at a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences based on the facts of the case. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189-90 (11th Cir. 2010) <em>(fin banc). </em>\u201c[W]e ordinarily expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Asante, </em>782 F.3d 639, 648 (11th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Here, Fox has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing him. Fox was sentenced to 36 months in prison for the bank-robbery offense, within the guideline range of 30 to 37 months, to be followed by a consecutive term of seven years in prison for the brandishing offense. Before sentencing him, the court thoughtfully weighed the \u00a7 3653(a) factors and considered Fox\u2019s arguments. The district court adequately explained the weight it gave to the seriousness of the offense based on Fox\u2019s use of a firearm during the bank robbery, which posed a serious risk to the victims and himself. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1323 (11th Cir. 2008) (attaching \u201cgreat weight\u201d to the seriousness of the offense did not render the sentence unreasonable). Despite his age and lack of criminal history, Fox has not shown that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in balancing the proper factors. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-11\">. The other two ways are the \"elements clause\u201d (a felony that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\"), and the \"enumerated crimes clause\u201d (a felony that \u201cis burglary, arson, or extortion, [or] involves use of explosives\u201d). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b761-15\">.
