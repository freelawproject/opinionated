This action is about alleged excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">This case arises from the fatal shooting of Wilson. On 2 March 2012, Sergeant Cook and another officer with the Pelham Police Department responded to a 911 call about a naked man who was seen running through a backyard. Shortly thereafter, Sergeant Cook radioed Officer Miller, an investigator with the Pelham Police Department, for assistance in locating the man and requested that Officer Miller bring the Department\u2019s four-wheeler.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">When Officer Miller arrived at the scene, the 911 caller told Officer Miller that a man had run naked through her backyard and into the woods behind her house. Given the man\u2019s reported behavior, Officer Miller suspected that the man might have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-14\">Officer Miller entered the woods on foot to locate the man. Several minutes later, Officer Miller heard someone behind him say \u201chey.\u201d Officer Miller turned around and saw a naked man \u2014 later identified as-Wilson \u2014 crouching down about 50 yards away.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-15\">Officer Miller asked Wilson if he was okay. Wilson responded immediately by asking Officer Miller whether he had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>gun, to which Officer Miller said \u201cyes.\u201d Wilson then asked Officer Miller if he wanted to use the gun, and Officer Miller said \u201cno.\u201d Wilson then said \u201cwell, you\u2019re going to have to, because you\u2019re going to have to kill me or I\u2019m going to kill you. And that\u2019s what I aim to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Wilson then stood up from his crouched position and began walking toward Officer Miller with his fists closed. Officer Miller saw that Wilson was holding something in his left hand. Officer Miller could tell that the object was no gun, but thought it could be a small knife,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Officer Miller began talking to Wilson in an effort to calm Wilson down. Officer Miller \u2014 who had been in radio contact with his fellow officers throughout the search\u2014 also began requesting back up and reporting that Wilson had threatened to kill him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Meanwhile, Wilson continued to approach Officer Miller. Officer Miller took his gun out of its holster and aimed it toward the ground as he started backing away from Wilson. In response to Officer Miller\u2019s continued efforts to calm Wilson down, Wilson said \u201cit\u2019s too late for that, you\u2019ve already told them where I\u2019m at, they\u2019re coming for me.\u201d Then, when Wilson got within six feet of Officer Miller, Wilson raised his arms and made a lunging motion toward Officer Miller. Officer Miller fired his gun, striking Wilson twice in the stomach. Wilson later died of his wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Plaintiffs filed this civil action against Officer Miller individually, alleging that Officer Miller used excessive force, in violation of the Fourth Amendment, when he shot Wilson. In a detailed written order, the district court granted Officer Miller\u2019s motion for summary judgment: a motion based on an assertion of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, viewing the evidence and all reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Skop v. City of Atlanta, </em>485 F.3d 1130, 1136 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">\u201cQualified immunity offers complete protection for government officials sued in their individual capacities if their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Vinyard v. Wilson, </em>311 F.3d 1340, 1346 (11th Cir. 2002) (quotation omitted). To avoid summary judgment based on qualified immunity, Plaintiffs must show both that Officer Miller violated a federal right and that the right was already clearly established \u2014 for the circumstances \u2014 when Officer Miller acted. <em>See id. </em>\u201cWhen properly applied, [qualified immunity] protects \u2018all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, </em>563 U.S. 731, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 2085, 179 L.Ed.2d 1149 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-13\">A federal right is \u201cclearly established\u201d when \u201cthe contours of [the] right are sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2083 (quotations and alterations omitted); <em>see also Jenkins by Hall v. Talladega City Bd. of Educ., </em>115 F.3d 821, 823 (11th Cir. 1997) (en banc) (\u201cFor the law to be clearly estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>lished to the point that qualified immunity does not apply, the law must have earlier been developed in such a concrete and factually defined context to make it obvious to all reasonable government actors, in the defendant\u2019s place, that \u2018what he is doing\u2019 violates federal law.\u201d). \u201cWe do not require a case directly on point, but existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question <em>beyond de</em>bate.\u201d <em>Mullenix v. Luna, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 305, 308, 193 L.Ed.2d 255 (2015) (emphasis added); <em>see also City &amp; County of San Francisco, Ca. v. Sheehan, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1765, 1774, 191 L.Ed.2d 856 (2015); <em>Plumhoff v. Rickard, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2012, 2023, 188 L.Ed.2d 1056 (2014); <em>Stanton v.

City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>7 F.3d 1552, 1557 (11th Cir. 1993) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">The Supreme Court has \u201crepeatedly told courts ... not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Mullenix, </em>136 S.Ct. at 308 (overruling the denial of qualified immunity); <em>Sheehan, </em>135 S.Ct. at 1775-76 (overruling the denial of qualified immunity and explaining that \u201c[qualified immunity is no immunity at all if \u2018clearly established\u2019 law can simply be defined as the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d); <em>Plumhoff, </em>134 S.Ct. at 2023 (overruling the denial of qualified immunity and commanding courts \u201cnot to define clearly established law at a high level of generality ... since doing so avoids the crucial question whether the official acted reasonably in the particular circumstances that he or she faced.\u201d); <em>al-Kidd, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2084 (overruling the denial of qualified immunity); <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987) (overruling the denial of qualified immunity: assertion of a general constitutional or statutory right is insufficient to defeat qualified immunity because \u201c[i]f the test of \u2018clearly established law\u2019 were to be applied at this level of generality, ... [plaintiffs would be able to convert the rule of qualified immunity ... into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply by alleging violation of extremely abstract rights.\u201d). Courts must instead determine \u201cwhether the violative nature of <em>particular </em>conduct is clearly established ... in the light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.\u201d <em>Mullenix, </em>136 S.Ct. at 308 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">\u201cAlthough suspects have a right to be free from force that is excessive, they are not protected against a use of force that is necessary in the situation at hand.\u201d <em>Jean-Baptiste v. Gutierrez, </em>627 F.3d 816, 821 (11th Cir. 2010) (quotation omitted). No precise or \u201crigid preconditions\u201d exist for determining when an officer\u2019s use of deadly force is excessive. <em>See Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 1777, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007). Instead, in deciding the merits of a claim of excessive force, the court must in each case determine whether \u2014 given all the facts and circumstances of a particular case \u2014 the force used was \u201creasonable\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1871-72, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-15\">\u201cIn determining the reasonableness of the force applied, we look at the fact pattern from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene with knowledge of the attendant circumstances and facts, and balance the risk of bodily harm to the suspect against the gravity of the threat the officer sought to eliminate.\u201d <em>McCullough v. Antolini, </em>559 F.3d 1201, 1206 (11th Cir. 2009). We consider, among other things, \u201cthe severity of the crime at issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>109 S.Ct. at 1872.</p>\n<p id=\"ABa\">We stress that \u201c[t]he \u2018reasonableness\u2019 of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And we must allow \u201cfor the fact that, police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments \u2014 in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving \u2014 about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe are loath to second-guess the decisions made by police officers in the field.\u201d <em>Vaughan v. Cox, </em>343 F.3d 1323, 1331 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Wilson,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> shows that Officer Miller violated no' constitutional right when he shot Wilson; Officer Miller\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable in the circumstances. Given Wilson\u2019s strange behavior, express threat to kill Officer Miller, possession of a concealed object, and Wilson\u2019s continued aggressive movement toward Officer Miller despite Officer Miller\u2019s backing away and taking his gun out of its holster, an objective officer in Officer Miller\u2019s situation could have believed reasonably that Wilson posed an immediate threat to Officer Miller\u2019s safety. Faced with a \u201ctense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving\u201d situation, Officer Miller made a splifc-second decision to shoot Wilson to avoid the risk of serious injury. In the light of these circumstances, we cannot say that Officer Miller\u2019s decision was unreasonable in the Fourth Amendment sense. <em>See McCormick v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>333 F.3d 1234, 1246 (11th Cir. 2003) (officer\u2019s use of deadly force was constitutionally reasonable because the officer could believe reasonably that the suspect posed \u201can imminent threat of violence to the officer\u201d when the suspect ignored the officer\u2019s commands and approached the officer with a stick held above his head).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">That we know now that Wilson in fact had no weapon cannot and does not change our conclusion. The reasonableness of force used is not judged \u201cwith 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u201d <em>See Graham, </em>109 S.Ct. at 1872. And an officer need not wait until he is attacked physically before determining reasonably that he is in imminent danger of serious injury. <em>Cf. Long v. Slaton, </em>508 F.3d 576, 583 (11th Cir. 2007) (concluding the use of deadly force was reasonable, even though other less-lethal means of preventing the suspect\u2019s escape may have existed, because \u201cthe police need not have taken that chance and hoped for the best.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">In addition, we obviously conclude that it was not clearly established \u2014 as a matter of law \u2014 at the time of the shooting in 2012 that Officer Miller (given the circumstances) acted unreasonably in the Fourth Amendment sense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, Officer Miller is personally entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Plaintiffs contend that Officer Miller is unentitled to qualified immunity because he failed to satisfy his burden of showing that he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority. In particular, Plaintiffs argue that Officer Miller was outside his jurisdiction when he searched for and encountered Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">For purposes of qualified immunity, an official acts within his discretionary authority if he \u201c(a) performfs] a legitimate job-related function ... (b) through means that [are] within his power to utilize.\u201d <em>Holloman v. Harland, </em>370 F.3d 1252, 1265 (11th Cir. 2004). Our inquiry is \u201cwhether the act complained of, if done for a proper purpose, would be within, or reasonably related to, the outer perimeter of an official\u2019s discretionary duties.\u201d <em>Harbert Int\u2019l v. James, </em>157 F.3d 1271, 1282 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Officer Miller was clearly performing a legitimate job-related function when he responded to Sergeant Cook\u2019s request for assistance in locating Wilson. Even if we assume that Officer Miller was outside his jurisdiction when he located Wilson,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Officer Miller was still acting \u201cthrough means that were within his power to utilize.\u201d Under Georgia law, police officers are authorized to make warrantless arrests for offenses committed in the officer\u2019s presence, <em>even if the officer is outside his jurisdiction. </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-4-20(a)(2)(A); <em>Taylor v. Waldo, </em>309 Ga.App. 108, 709 S.E.2d 278, 281 (2011); <em>Delong v. Domenici, </em>271 Ga. App. 757, 610 S.E.2d 695, 698 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">When Officer Miller first encountered Wilson, Wilson was committing an offense (public indecency, in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-6-8) within Officer Miller\u2019s presence. Officer Miller was thus authorized by Georgia law to conduct a warrantless arrest. Instead of arresting Wilson, however, Officer Miller acted within his discretion to first investigate the situation, including Wilson\u2019s condition. When Wilson threatened immediately to kill Officer Miller and approached Officer Miller in a threatening way, Officer Miller \u2014 still acting within his discretionary authority' \u2014 used deadly force to protect himself from what he perceived reasonably to be an imminent threat of serious physical injury. In the light of the circumstances of this case, Officer Miller was acting inside the scope of his discretionary authority when the shooting occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">For these reasons and given the facts of this case, Officer Miller is entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-9\">. Plaintiffs raise no challenge to the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Chief Nealie McCormick, the City of Pel-ham, and in favor of Officer Miller in his official capacity. These claims are abandoned. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b702-8\">. The object in Wilson\u2019s hand was, in fact, a roll of over sixty twenty-dollar bills.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"APcD\">. The record contains audio recordings of the 911 calls and radio transmissions made during the course of the incident. We agree with the district court\u2019s finding that the audio flies confirm portions of Officer Miller\u2019s testimony about his encounter with Wilson, including that Wilson threatened to kill Officer Miller. Plaintiffs have also never denied that Wilson expressly threatened to kill Officer Miller.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b704-6\">. We reject Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the district court failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to Wilson. The record demonstrates that the district court construed properly all genuinely disputed material facts in Wilson's favor. And nothing required the district court to accept as true Plaintiffs' speculative inferences and conclusions about the evidence, <em>See Mize v. Jefferson City Bd. of Educ., </em>93 F.3d 739, 742-43 (11th Cir. 1996) (inferences may be drawn in favor of the nonmoving'party <em>only </em>when they are reasonable and \u201chave a real basis in the record\u201d). \"[A]n inference is not reasonable if it is \u2018only a guess or a possibility,\u2019 for such an inference is not based on the evidence but is pure conjecture and speculation.\u201d <em>Daniels v. Twin Oaks Nursing Home, </em>692 F.2d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b704-11\">. Plaintiffs' reliance on our decision in <em>Samples on Behalf of Samples v. City of Atlanta, </em>846 F.2d 1328 (11th Cir. 1988), to show that. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Officer Miller violated clearly established law is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Too many important circumstances present in <em>Samples </em>are absent here. In <em>Samples, </em>plaintiff was shot five times, including once in the back. The Court in <em>Samples </em>also focused on the significant size difference between the 16-year old plaintiff and the officer, who outweighed plaintiff by nearly 100 pounds. No comparable size difference exists here. Although Wilson \u2014 a grown man \u2014 weighed about 40 pounds less than Officer Miller (145 lbs. v. 185 lbs.), Wilson was also 3 inches taller. In addition, unlike this case, the plaintiff in <em>Samples </em>made no express verbal threat to kill the officer and no lunging motion toward the officer. Given these important factual differences, <em>Samples </em>is far from obviously controlling and fails to place the constitutional question at issue in this case \"beyond debate\u201d such that Officer Miller \u2014 and every reasonable officer in his position \u2014 would have been on clear notice that the use of a firearm was unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b705-15\">. That the 911 caller's house is just outside Pelham\u2019s city limits is undisputed. The record, however, contains no evidence about whether the shooting occurred inside or outside Pel-ham\u2019s city limits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
