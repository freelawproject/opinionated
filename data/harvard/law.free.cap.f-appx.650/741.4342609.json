A federal jury found that Klayman had been defamed and awarded him $156,000 in compensatory damages and $25,000 in punitive damages, for a total award of $181,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-17\">After entry of judgment on the verdict, Judicial Watch filed an unopposed motion to deposit the judgment amount into the registry of the court, pursuant to Rule 67, Fed. R. Civ. P. According to Judicial Watch, Klayman\u2019s ex-wife had demanded that the judgment amount be paid to her instead of Klayman to satisfy a $325,000 judgment she had obtained against Klay-man in an unrelated proceeding. Klay-man\u2019s ex-wife had filed a creditor\u2019s bill in Ohio state court naming Klayman and Judicial Watch as defendants. Concerned about its liability to Klayman\u2019s ex-wife, Judicial Watch sought to deposit the amount of the judgment \u201cpending resolution of the dispute between Klayman and [his ex-wife] concerning the entitlement to the funds.\u201d The court granted the motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>and Judicial Watch deposited the funds on February 19, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In May 2015, Klayman moved to withdraw the funds under Rule 67(b), Fed. R. Civ. P., raising various arguments as to why he was entitled to the funds notwithstanding his ex-wife\u2019s demand. The district court denied Klayman\u2019s motion. In the same order, the court also vacated its pri- or order granting Judicial Watch\u2019s unopposed motion to deposit funds into the court\u2019s registry. The court found that \u201cthe question of who should receive the funds deposited by the Defendant and in what amounts may involve protracted proceedings and new claims and defenses by a new party having nothing to do with the underlying and long-concluded action.\u201d Consequently, the court ordered the money returned to Judicial Watch, noting that Judicial Watch may initiate a separate in-terpleader action to protect itself. Klay-man appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decisions allowing deposit into or withdrawal from the court\u2019s registry under Rule 67, Fed. R. Civ. P. <em>Zelaya/Capital Int\u2019l Judgment, LLC v. Zelaya, </em>769 F.3d 1296, 1300 (11th Cir. 2014). Under this deferential standard of review, we must affirm unless the district court \u201capplied the wrong law or its decision was manifestly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Rule 67 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that \u201c[i]f any part of the relief sought is a money judgment or the disposition of a sum of money ..., a party ... may deposit with the court all or part of the money.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 67(a). Any money paid into the court under Rule 67 \u201cmust be deposited and withdrawn in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2041 and 2042 and any like statute.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 67(b). Under \u00a7 2041,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">All moneys paid into any court of the United. States, or received by the officers thereof, in any case pending or adjudicated in such court, shall be forthwith deposited with the Treasurer of the United States or a designated depositary, in the name and to the credit of such court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\">This section shall not prevent the delivery of any such money to the rightful owners upon security, according to agreement of parties, under the direction of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2041. Section 2042 provides that \u201c[n]o money deposited under section 2041 of this title shall be withdrawn except by order of court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">The core purpose of Rule 67 is \u201cto relieve the depositor of responsibility for a fund in dispute, such as in an interpleader action.\u201d <em>Gulf States Utils. Co. v. Ala. Power Co., </em>824 F.2d 1465, 1474 (5th Cir. 1987); <em>see also Zelaya, </em>769 F.3d at 1302. An interpleader action typically proceeds in two stages. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Hovis, </em>553 F.3d 258, 262 (3d Cir. 2009). First, the court determines whether inter-pleader is proper and \u201cwhether to discharge the stakeholder from further liability to the claimants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, the court evaluates \u201cthe respective rights of the claimants to the interpleaded funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The law does not require a judgment debt- or to decide the validity of competing claims to the judgment amount. <em>Zelaya, </em>769 F.3d at 1302-03. Rather, once funds are deposited, it is the district court which \u201cshould determine ownership and make disbursement.\u201d <em>Gulf States Utils. Co., </em>824 F.2d at 1474.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion. We are not persuaded by Klayman\u2019s arguments that the court should have allowed him to withdraw the money. Judicial Watch deposited the funds because, it alleged, it faced competing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>claims for the judgment amount and wished to protect itself from multiple liability, In view of that purpose, it would not have made sense for the court to simply allow Klayman to withdraw the funds without protecting Judicial Watch from a po'tential claim from Klayman\u2019s ex-wife or determining \u201cthe respective rights of the claimants\u201d to the funds. <em>See Hovis, </em>553 F.3d at 262. Therefore, it was reasonable for the court to deny Klayman\u2019s motion to withdraw when the reasons for which the court allowed Judicial Watch to deposit the funds had not been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Furthermore, the district court rationally ordered the funds returned to Judicial Watch. While the district court initially allowed Judicial Watch, with Klayman\u2019s acquiescence, to deposit the judgment amount into the court\u2019s registry, the court later recognized that the dispute should not be handled post-judgment in a concluded case. Specifically, the court found that the dispute over the judgment funds \u201cmay involve protracted proceedings and new claims and defenses by a new party having nothing to do with the underlying and long-concluded action.\u201d In other words, the district court determined that the judgment amount should not have been deposited into the court\u2019s registry in the first place and that the nature of the dispute was more appropriate - for an interpleader action, if necessary. Because no interpleader action had been filed, the court reasonably ordered the money returned to Judicial Watch.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">By ordering the return of the deposited funds, the district court effectively returned the parties to the same positions they were in before the deposit occurred. Klayman still has a $181,000 judgment against Judicial Watch, and he may pursue whatever legal options are available to him to collect on that amount. <em>See, e.g., </em>Fed, R. Civ. P. 69. But Klayman has identified no authority under which the district court was required to allow him to withdraw the deposited funds, nor has he shown that the court made a clear error of judgment in denying his motion to withdraw and ordering the funds returned to Judicial Watch. <em>See Zelaya, </em>769 F.3d at 1300-01. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of his motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-11\">. Klayman named several individuals as defendants in his amended complaint, but these individuals were dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction early in the proceeding. Klay-man also raised other claims, but only the defamation claim was charged to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
