On petition for review, Zecena Osorio argues that the BIA erred in determining that he was properly charged as inadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), because he lawfully entered into the United States holding temporary-resident status, which meant that he had been admitted or paroled. Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny Zecena Osorio\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">We review .legal determinations of the BIA and the IJ de novo. <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir. 2010). We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment, unless the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir. 2007). When the BIA explicitly agrees with the findings of the IJ, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ as to those issues. <em>Ayala, </em>605 F.3d at 948. We defer to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (\u201cDHS\u2019s\u201d) \u201cinterpretation of its own regulations unless its interpretation is \u2018plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905, 911, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) provides for two bases for re-movability including grounds of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182 and grounds of deportability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227, which governs the removal of aliens admitted, to the United States. <em>Dormescar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>690 F.3d 1258, 1260-61 (11th Cir. 2012). Prior to the adoption of IIRIRA, \u201cthere was a fundamental distinction between excludable aliens,\u201d who sought admission but had not' yet achieved it, \u201cand deportable aliens,\u201d who had succeeded in either legally or illegally entering the country. <em>Id. </em>at 1260. Under IIRIRA, an alien may now be considered inadmissible for being in the United States without being admitted or paroled. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). When an alien is charged with inadmissibility, he has the burden of proving that he is \u201c \u2018clearly and beyond doubt\u2019 \u201d entitled to admission and that he is not inadmissible under any ground enumerated in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182. <em>Garces v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>611 F.3d 1337, 1345-46 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-13\">The distinction between inadmissibility and deportability turns on the alien\u2019s \u201cstatus\u201d rather than his physical location. <em>Poveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>692 F.3d 1168, 1174-75 (11th Cir. 2012). An alien in the United States who has been admitted is subject to deportability grounds for remov-ability, while an alien who has not been, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>regardless of his location, is subject to inadmissibility grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 1176. An \u201cadmission\u201d is defined as \u201cthe lawful entry of [an] alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">The Immigration Reform Control Act (\u201cIRCA\u201d) provides that an alien can adjust his status to that of \u201clawfully admitted for temporary residence\u201d if he can establish that he entered the United States before Januaiy 1, 1982, and has resided in the United States continuously since such date. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(a)(2)(A); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245a.2 (detailing the process to apply for temporary-resident status). An alien who is provided lawful temporary-resident status under IRCA can then have his status adjusted to \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence\u201d if he meets certain requirements, including the demonstration of certain basic citizenship skills. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(b). During the period of time that an alien receives lawful temporary-resident status, he is permitted to return to the United States after brief and casual trips abroad, which reflect an intention on the part of the alien to achieve lawful permanent-resident status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(b)(3)(A); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245a.2(m)(2) (providing that an alien whose application for temporary-resident status has been approved may be admitted to the United States as a returning temporary resident if certain conditions are met). The Attorney General shall terminate an alien\u2019s temporary-resident status if it appears that the alien in question was not eligible for such status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(b)(2). Termination of the status of an alien previously adjusted to lawful temporary resident \u201cshall act to return such alien to the unlawful status held prior to the adjustment.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245a.2(u)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">We held in the pre-IIRIRA context that the plain language of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(b)(3)(A), which allows temporary residents to travel abroad for brief and casual trips, does not affect the definition of \u201centry\u201d for purposes of determining whether a legalization applicant should be placed in exclusion or deportation proceedings. <em>See Assa\u2019ad, </em>332 F.3d at 1336, 1340-41 (concluding that it was appropriate for an alien who entered the United States while her legalization application was pending and without travel documents to be placed in exclusion rather than deportation proceedings when her parole was subsequently terminated). Moreover, we have noted that an alien holding permanent-resident status who returns from abroad is not regarded as seeking an \u201cadmission\u201d each time he reenters the United States. <em>Poveda, </em>692 F.3d at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">Accordingly, the BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Zecena Osorio\u2019s motion to terminate his removal proceedings. In particular, the BIA did not err in determining that Zecena Osorio was properly charged as inadmissible because he reverted back to his prior unlawful status of entry without inspection at the time that his status as a temporary resident was terminated under the plain language of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245a.2(u)(4). Moreover, Zecena Osorio\u2019s lawful reentry into the United States in 1996 is irrelevant to the determination of whether he is subject to charges of inadmissibility because he was able to lawfully reenter at the time based on his temporary-resident status, which was subsequently terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
