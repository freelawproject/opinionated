He claims that Los Zetas gang members engaged in extortion against him and his family members. Because Chagala-Domin-guez has not challenged the BIA\u2019s conclusion that his asylum claim was time-barred and that he was not entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture, such claims are abandoned. <em>Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-24\">Because the BIA agreed with the findings and conclusions of the IJ, we review both decisions. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593-94 (5th Cir. 2007). We review an immigration court\u2019s findings of fact for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>substantial evidence. <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir. 2009). We may not reverse an immigration court\u2019s factual findings unless \u201cthe evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537. Among the findings that we review for substantial evidence are the factual conclusions that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Chagala-Dominguez makes two arguments challenging the BIA\u2019s denial of his claim for withholding of removal: (1) that the IJ and the BIA ignored facts in the record which showed that he suffered past persecution; and (2) that the IJ erred in concluding that he did not belong to a particular social group composed of family members of truck drivers who are victims of organized crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">An applicant for withholding of removal must establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that his life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of a protected status, including membership in a particular social group. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Regarding Chagala-Dominguez\u2019s claim of past persecution, we do not recognize economic extortion as a form of persecution. <em>See Castillo-Enriquez v. Holder, </em>690 F.3d 667, 668 (5th Cir. 2012). Further, a claim of persecution cannot be based on mere threats without actual harm. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 188 (5th Cir. 2004); <em>Tesfamichael v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 109, 116 (5th Cir. 2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Chagala-Dominguez argues that he will more likely than not be persecuted based on his membership in the claimed social group of \u201cfamily members of truck drivers in Mexico who have been targeted by the Zetas\u201d if he returns to Mexico. Chagala-Dominguez has not established sufficient particularity and social visibility of this group, because, based on Chagala-Dominguez\u2019s own admissions, virtually all Mexicans face similar dangers. Chagala-Dominguez has failed to show that the Zetas targeted him and his family members on the basis of any particular identifying factors. <em>See Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 521-22 (5th Cir. 2012); <em>Roy, </em>389 F.3d at 138. Accordingly, we find that substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s findings. <em>See Roy, </em>389 F.3d at 138-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-16\"> Pursuant to 5th cir.
