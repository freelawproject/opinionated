We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b998-24\">Jones was charged with and convicted of one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Because Jones had six prior convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13, which prohibits the sale, manufacture, or delivery of, or possession with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver controlled substances, the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) states he was subject to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Based on his armed-career-criminal status, Jones had a total-offense level of 33 and a criminal-history category of VI, resulting in a Sentencing Guidelines range of 235 to 293 months of imprisonment. At sentencing, Jones objected to the ACCA enhancement, because his prior convictions were not presented at trial and proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt; the district judge overruled his objection. The judge varied downward from the Guidelines range and imposed a sentence of 211 months of imprisonment. We affirmed Jones\u2019s conviction and sentence on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>479 Fed. Appx. 874, 875 &amp; n. 1 (11th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">Thereafter, Jones filed a pro se \u00a7 2255 motion, raising a single claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Jones later moved to supplement his motion to include the additional claim that his prior convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13 did not constitute \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d under the ACCA or \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d under the career-offender guidelines. A magistrate judge granted Jones\u2019s motion to supplement and appointed counsel for him. Following the appointment of counsel, Jones filed a memorandum of law in support of his supplemental motion to vacate. He argued his convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) were not serious drug offenses for purposes of the ACCA, because the Florida statute lacked a mens rea element respecting the illicit nature of the substance; consequently, it was broader than the generic offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">The government responded Jones\u2019s argument was foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262 (11th Cir. 2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2827, 192 L.Ed.2d 864 (2015), which held convictions under \u00a7 893.13(1) qualified as \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d under the ACCA and \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d under the career-offender guidelines, because neither of those provisions required that predicate offenses contain a mens rea element respecting the illicit nature of the substance. <em>Id. </em>at 1267-68. Jones replied the decision in <em>Smith </em>was not yet final, because a petition for rehearing en banc was pending and noted the Supreme Court recently had granted certiorari in <em>McFadden v. United States, </em>576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2298, 192 L.Ed.2d 260 (2015), to resolve an analogous question concerning the mens rea element for convictions under the Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act (\u201cAnalogue Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-12\">A magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation (\u201cR&amp;R\u201d), recommending Jones\u2019s motion to vacate be denied. Concerning his ineffective-assistance claim, the magistrate judge concluded Jones had failed to establish prejudice and was entitled to no relief. Regarding his challenge to the use of his \u00a7 893.13 convictions as ACCA predicate offenses, the magistrate judge noted we recently had rejected Jones\u2019s argument in <em>Smith. </em>Consequently, Jones was precluded from arguing his \u00a7 893.13 convictions were not serious drug offenses. The magistrate judge concluded a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) was not warranted, because Jones had not demonstrated he had been denied a constitutional right or that reasonable jurists could debate the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-13\">Jones objected to the R&amp;R, reiterated the arguments raised in his reply, and asserted the magistrate judge had erred in recommending a COA not -issue. The district judge denied Jones\u2019s motion to vacate but disagreed with the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation regarding the issuance of a COA. The judge found a COA was warranted in view of the pending petition for certiorari in <em>Smith </em>and the grant of certio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>rari in McFadden; accordingly, the judge granted a COA regarding only Jones\u2019s ACCA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">On appeal, Jones argues we should reconsider <em>Smith, </em>because it was wrongly decided for a number of reasons. He also asserts the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>McFadden, </em>while not binding in this case, suggests his interpretation of the Guidelines is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">In reviewing the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review factual findings for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>Dell v. United States, </em>710 F.3d 1267, 1272 (11th Cir. 2013), We review de novo whether a prior conviction is a serious drug offense within the meaning of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>583 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir. 2009). Under the prior-panel-precedent rule, we are bound by the holding of a prior panel unless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by a decision of the Supreme Court or an en banc decision if our court. <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">The ACCA provides a person, who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and has three previous convictions for a serious drug offense, shall be subject to a mandatory-minimum sentence of 16 years of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C; \u00a7 924(e)(1). In relevant part, a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d is defined as \u201can offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ,for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). The career-offender guidelines provide a defendant is a career offender, if he has at least two prior felony convictions for a controlled-substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). A \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d is \u201can offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">Under Florida law, it is unlawful to \u201csell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, a controlled substance.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a). For offenses under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13 committed after 2002, \u201cknowledge of the illicit nature of a controlled substance is not an element of [the] offense.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.101(2). Therefore, a defendant may be convicted under \u00a7 893.i3(l)(a) even if he was unaware the substance he possessed was a controlled substance. <em>See id. </em>In <em>Smith, </em>we held convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) qualify as \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d for purposes of the ACCA and \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d for purposes of the career-offender guidelines, despite the lack of a mens rea element in \u00a7 893.13, because neither the ACCA definition of \u201cserious drug offense\u201d nor the Guidelines definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d includes a mens rea element regarding the illicit nature of the controlled substance. <em>Smith, </em>775 F.3d at 1267-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">In <em>McFadden, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the mens rea required for a conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), when the controlled substance at issue was a controlled-substance analogue. <em>McFadden, </em>576 U.S. at-, 135 S.Ct. at 2302. The Court held \u00a7 841(a)(1) required the government to prove the defendant knew he was dealing with a controlled substance, meaning he either knew the substance was controlled under the Controlled Substances Act or Analogue Act or knew the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>specific features of the substance that made it a controlled-substanee analogue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Our decision in <em>Smith </em>squarely forecloses Jones\u2019s argument that convictions under \u00a7 893.13(1) cannot constitute serious drug offenses or controlled substance offenses, because the statute lacks a mens rea element. <em>See Smith, </em>775 F.3d at 1267-68. <em>Smith </em>has not been overturned or abrogated by an en banc decision of our court or by the Supreme Court; therefore, it remains binding precedent. <em>Archer, </em>531 F.3d at 1352. Additionally, <em>McFadden </em>does not control the outcome of this case, because it did not address the mens rea requirement for serious drug offenses under the ACCA or controlled-substanee offenses under the career-offender guidelines. <em>See McFadden, </em>576 U.S. at-, 135 S.Ct. at 2302. The district judge did not err in denying Jones\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
