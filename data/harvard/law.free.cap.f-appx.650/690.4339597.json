(\u201cDrummond\u201d) seeks review of a Benefits Review Board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>(the \u201cBRB\u201d) decision affirming an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) order that granted benefits to a deceased coal mine worker, James Allred, and his surviving spouse, Barbara Allred, under the Black Lung Benefits Act (the \u201cBLBA\u201d), 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-944. Drummond raises only one argument in this appeal \u2014 that the ALJ applied the wrong legal test when it determined that Drummond failed to rebut a statutory presumption that James Allred\u2019s respiratory disability was due to pneumo-coniosis, commonly known as \u201cblack lung disease.\u201d Drummond failed to raise this argument before the BRB, thereby failing to exhaust the issue before the appropriate administrative agency. We therefore deny Drummond\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">James Allred was born in 1942. He worked as a coalminer for Drummond in Alabama from around 1976 until 1998, a span of over twenty-two years. Allred stopped working in the coal mines in 1998 after suffering a neck injury. According to his wife Barbara, Allred began having difficulty breathing in the early 1990s, which became progressively worse until his death in August 2010. Allred began using supplemental oxygen around 2006 and was hospitalized several times for acute exacer-bations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\u201cCOPD\u201d), pneumonia, and chronic bronchitis. In addition to his work in the coal mines, Allred was a long-time smoker. Allred smoked between one and one-and-a-half packs of cigarettes per day continuously starting around 1957 until his death, even as his health deteriorated. Drum-mond argued that Allred\u2019s disability was due to his smoking, not his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">Allred filed for black lung benefits<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with the Department of Labor in April 2010 while he was living in hospice care. While a decision was pending, Allred died in August 2010. His wife Barbara then filed her own claim for survivor benefits in October 2010,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and proceeded with James Allred\u2019s claim. In December, a claims examiner issued a Proposed Decision and Order denying Allred benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Barbara Allred, on James Allred\u2019s behalf, requested a formal hearing before an ALJ. The ALJ remanded that case back to the claims examiner and consolidated it with Barbara Allred\u2019s independent claim for survivor benefits. This time around, the claims examiner issued a Proposed Decision and Order awarding benefits to Mrs. Allred. Drum-mond requested a formal hearing before an ALJ on both claims, which was held on July 19, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">On July 16, 2014, the ALJ issued an order awarding benefits on both claims to Mrs. Allred. The ALJ found that Allred had engaged in coal mine employment for more than fifteen years and was \u201ctotally disabled\u201d at the time of his death due to a respiratory or pulmonary impairment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>a result of those findings, which Drum-mond conceded. Allred was entitled to a rebuttable presumption that his disability was due to pneumoconiosis. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.305(b)-(c). The ALJ found that Drummond failed to rebut the presumption, and as a result, awarded benefits to Mrs. Allred in both cases. Drummond appealed the decision to the BRB, which affirmed the ALJ. This petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The BLBA provides benefits to \u201ccoal miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis and to the surviving dependents of miners whose death was due to such disease.\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901(a). It defines \u201cpneumoconiosis\u201d as \u201ca chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae, including respiratory and pulmonary impairments, arising out of coal mine employment.\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(b). The BLBA has created a rebuttable presumption that a miner is disabled due to pneumoconiosis when he has worked for fifteen years in underground coal mines and is totally disabled from a respiratory or pulmonary condition. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(4). Therefore, if a coal miner has worked fifteen years in underground coal mines and is totally disabled due to respiratory or pulmonary condition, he is entitled to benefits unless the presumption can be overcome. The requirements that an employer must meet to rebut the presumption are provided for in the Department of Labor\u2019s regulations implementing the BLBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">In order to understand how the presumption is rebutted, it is necessary to lay out some key provisions of the regulatory framework. The regulations recognize two types of pneumoconiosis, \u201cclinical pneumo-coniosis\u201d and \u201clegal pneumoconiosis.\u201d Clinical pneumoconiosis consists of a cluster of diseases \u201ccharacterized by permanent deposition of substantial amounts of particulate matter in the lungs and the fibrotic reaction of the lung tissue to that deposition caused by dust exposure in coal mine employment.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a)(1). Legal pneumoconiosis is considerably broader. It consists of \u201cany chronic lung disease or impairment and its sequelae arising out of coal mine employment,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a)(2). For a disease or impairment to \u201carise[] out of coal mine employment,\u201d it must be \u201csignificantly related to, or substantially aggravated by, dust exposure in coal mine employment.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">The regulations provide two methods by which the presumption can be rebutted: 1) by \u201cestablishing both that the miner does not, or did not, have,\u201d either legal pneumo-coniosis or clinical pneumoconiosis or 2) by \u201c[e]stablishing that no part of the miner\u2019s respiratory or pulmonary disability was caused by pneumoconiosis.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.305(d)(l)(i), (ii).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Other Circuits have referred to this second method of rebutting the presumption as the \u201crule-out\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>standard, meaning that the employer must \u201crule out\u201d pneumoconiosis as having any causal connection to the miner\u2019s disability. <em>See, e.g., W. Va. CWP Fund v. Bender, </em>782 F.3d 129, 143 (4th Cir. 2015); <em>Antelope Coal Co./Rio Tinto Energy Am. v. Goodin, </em>743 F.3d 1331, 1336 (10th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Drummond did not contest that Allred was entitled to the presumption because he worked for over fifteen years in coal mines and was totally disabled. Nor does it contest that finding here. Instead, it argues that the ALJ applied the wrong legal standard as to the first method of rebutting the presumption \u2014 that Aired did not have clinical or legal pneumoconiosis. In the course of her opinion, the ALJ considered the opinions of several physicians, pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas tests, and X-rays. She concluded that Drummond failed to satisfy either method of rebuttal. However, when discussing the first method, she wrote \u201cI find that the Employer has failed to rebut the presumption by ruling out legal pneumoconiosis or by ruling out coal mine employment as a cause of the Miner\u2019s disability.\u201d Because \u201crule out\u201d has a special meaning in these eases, Drummond argues that the ALJ\u2019s statement indicates that she applied a higher standard to disprove the existence of legal pneumoconiosis than required under the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">To disprove legal pneumoconiosis, an employer would need to prove the inverse of the 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 -718.201(a)(2), which defines legal pneumoconiosis as \u201cany chronic lung disease or impairment and its seque-lae arising out of coal mine employment.\u201d Because no one contests that Aired had a chronic lung disease or impairment, only the \u201carising out of coal mine employment\u201d component of the definition is relevant here. To show that a disease did not \u201carise[ ] out of coal mine employment,\u201d the employer would need to show that it was not <em>\u201csignificantly </em>related to, or <em>substantially </em>aggravated by, dust exposure in coal mine employment.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(b) (emphasis added). Drummond argues that the opinion\u2019s use of the phrase \u201crule out legal pneumoconiosis\u201d means that Drum-mond could only have disproved legal pneumoconiosis by showing that Alred\u2019s impairment was not related to or aggravated by dust exposure in coal mines at all, which is more demanding than the plain language of the regulations requires. Had the ALJ provided the correct legal standard, Drummond claims it may have prevailed under the first method of rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">Drummond makes this argument for the first time in its brief to this court. It failed to present the argument to the BRB, and of course for that reason, the BRB did not address it. As we stated before regarding the BLBA, \u201c[ujnder general rules of appellate review, an appellate court should not overrule an administrative decision unless the administrative body erred against objections presented to it.\u201d <em>Dir., OWCP v. Drummond Coal Co., </em>831 F.2d 240, 243 (11th Cir. 1987) (quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Taft v. Ala. By-Products Corp., </em>733 F.2d 1518, 1523 (11th Cir. 1984)). The BRB\u2019s regulations' require petitions to \u201clist]) ] the specific issues to be considered on appeal.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.211(a); <em>Sims v. Apfel, </em>530 U.S. 103, 108, 120 S.Ct. 2080, 2084, 147 L.Ed.2d 80 (2000) (using the BRB as an example of an administrative agency that requires issues to be exhausted before it). Courts require administrative issue exhaustion, even in the absence of an explicit statutory command, \u2018\u201cas a general rule\u2019 because it is usually \u2018appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>priate under [an agency\u2019s] practice\u2019 for \u2018contestants in an adversary proceeding* before it to develop fully all issues there.\u201d <em>Sims, </em>530 U.S. at 109, 120 S.Ct. at 2084-85 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. L.A. Trucker Truck Lines, Inc., </em>344 U.S. 33, 33-37, 73 S. Ct. 67, 68-69, 97 L.Ed. 54 (1952)). The Supreme Court has instructed that \u201cthe desirability of a court imposing a requirement of issu\u00e9 exhaustion depends on the degree to which the analogy to normal adversarial litigation applies in a particular administrative proceeding.\u201d <em>Id., </em>120 S.Ct. at 2085. That is to say, if the administrative proceedings were adversarial and resembled court proceedings, then courts ought to apply an issue exhaustion requirement, lest courts encourage litigants to \u201cbypass\u201d agency requirements, like 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.211(a). <em>See id. </em>at 108, 120 S.Ct. at 2084.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Here, there can be no doubt that proceedings held before the BRB were adversarial. Drummond and Mrs. Allred both presented briefs addressing the merits of the ALJ\u2019s decision. Thus, we see no reason not to apply the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d here.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Although Drummond argued that the ALJ erred in her decision in its brief to the BRB, none of the arguments it made was the only one it makes to this court. In its brief to the BRB, Drummond made two principle arguments: 1) that the ALJ erred in crediting the evidence submitted on behalf of Allred and 2) that the ALJ applied the wrong legal standard as it relates to the <em>second method of rebuttal, </em>that \u201cno part of the miner\u2019s respiratory or pulmonary total disability was caused by pneu-moconiosis.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.305(d)(l)(ii). The first argument was purely factual; Drummond argued that the ALJ assigned too much weight to the evidence suggesting Aired was totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis. Drummond\u2019s second argument was that under \u00a7 718.305(d)(l)(ii), an employer does not need to \u201crule out\u201d pneu-moconiosis as a cause of a miner\u2019s disability, but rather, an employer need only show that the miner \u201cwould have been disabled regardless of the exposure to coal dust.\u201d In other words, Drummond argued to the BRB that there was no \u201crule out\u201d standard at all, not that the ALJ misapplied the rule out standard to the first method of rebuttal. The BRB addressed the argument Drummond made, sensibly concluding that plain language of \u00a7 718.305(d)(l)(ii) supported the \u201crule-out\u201d standard, and not Drummond\u2019s proposed alternative standard. It did not address the argument that the ALJ may have applied the wrong legal standard by using the phrase \u201crule-out\u201d to refer to the employer\u2019s rebuttal of legal pneumoconiosis. Nor does Drummond argue that the BRB itself applied an incorrect legal standard in its opinion affirming the ALJ. Because Drummond failed to exhaust this issue before the BRB, its claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-6\">.
