No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-21\">Briefly stated, Annon loaned $845,000 to Defendant BioNitrogen Holdings Corp. (\u201cBioNitrogen\u201d), pursuant to a written loan agreement. The loan was guaranteed by Defendants Bio-SNG Technologies International Corp., BioNitrogen Florida Hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>ings, LLC, BioNitrogen Plant FL Hendry, LLC, BioNitrogen Plant FL Hardee, LLC, BioNitrogen Biomass Sourcing, LLC, and B Group, LLC,. and secured in part by Bio-SNG\u2019s pledged securities in Defendant 4A Technologies, LLC. BioNi-trogen failed to repay the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">On 26 January 2015, Annon filed suit against Defendants, seeking to enforce the terms of the loan. After proper service, Defendants failed to respond to the complaint. The clerk of the court then entered default on 24 February (against all Defendants except 4A Technologies) and on 19 March (against 4A Technologies).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">On 8 May 2015, Defendants filed a motion (which they later amended) to set aside the clerk\u2019s entries of default. The district court denied Defendants\u2019 motion and later entered final default judgment against Defendants in excess of $1,188,000. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">We first address Defendants\u2019 assertion that the district court erred in concluding that it had subject-matter jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship. Defendants argue that insufficient evidence exists to support the district court\u2019s factual determination that Annon is a \u201ccitizen\u201d of Ontario, Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s jurisdictional factfindings about citizenship. Travaglio v. Am. Express Co., 735 F.3d 1266, 1269 (11th Cir.2013). \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous if the record lacks substantial evidence to support it.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">For purposes of establishing diversity jurisdiction, \u201ca corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of every State and foreign state by which it has been incorporated and of the State or foreign state where it has its principal place of business.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(b). The phrase \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d means \u201cthe place where a corporation\u2019s officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation\u2019s activities.\u201d Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 130 S.Ct. 1181, 1192, 175 L.Ed.2d 1029 (2010). In practice, a corporation\u2019s principal place of business \u201cshould normally be the place where the corporation maintains its headquarters.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-15\">Competent evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding that Annon is a \u201ccitizen\u201d of Ontario, Canada for purposes of diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction. In its well-pleaded complaint, Annon alleged both that it was organized under the laws of Ontario and that it had its principal place of business in Ontario.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These factual allegations are supported both by the Security Agreement (identifying Annon as \u201ca corporation organized and existing under the laws of Canada\u201d) and a sworn declaration by Annon\u2019s sole director and general manager (testifying that Annon\u2019s place of incorporation and principal place of business are both Ontario, Canada).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-16\">About Annon\u2019s principal place of business, the record evidences that Annon is affiliated with a single address: in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The record also demonstrates that Annon maintained a bank account with an Ontario branch of a Canadian bank and that Annon used this Ontario bank account to wire the pertinent loan proceeds to Defendants. Nothing in the record evidences that Annon\u2019s corporate activities were directed, controlled, or coordinated from a location other than from Ontario, Canada. On this record, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>district court committed no clear error in determining that Arm\u00f3n is a citizen of Ontario, Canada. Because Defendants are citizens of Florida, New Jersey, Delaware, and Texas, complete diversity exists and the district court exercised properly subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to set aside an entry of default. Jones v. Harrell, 858 F.2d 667, 669 (11th Cir.1988). We also review under an abuse-of-discretion standard the district court\u2019s entry of a default judgment. Sanderford v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 902 F.2d 897, 898 (11th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The district court may set aside an entry of default \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 55(c). In determining what constitutes \u201cgood cause,\u201d courts have considered, but are not limited to, factors such as whether the default was willful, whether the defaulting party would have a meritorious defense, and whether setting aside the default would result in prejudice to the non-defaulting party. See Compania Interamericana Export-Import, S.A. v. Compania Dominicana de Aviacion, 88 F.3d 948, 951 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">The district court abused no discretion in denying Defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the clerk\u2019s entries of default. First, Defendants deny that the default was willful and, instead, contend that the failure to answer the complaint was due solely to the mismanagement of litigation by Defendants\u2019 former CFO and President.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Contrary to Defendants\u2019 assertions of ignorance about the litigation, BioNitro-gen\u2019s CEO testified that he was aware of the suit and that Defendants\u2019 former CFO \u2014 together with Defendants\u2019 corporate counsel \u2014 was attempting to effect a settlement with Annon. Defendants\u2019 CEO also testified that he learned about the initial entry of default on 25 February and retained trial counsel to defend against Annon\u2019s suit. The CEO understood, however, that Annon would take no further action until 10 March, allowing the parties to continue settlement negotiations. Only after the parties failed to reach a settlement \u2014 and after another nine days elapsed \u2014 did the clerk enter default against the final Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">By Defendants\u2019 own account, Defendants\u2019 failure to file an answer was due to litigation strategy: to effect a settlement and avoid proceeding with the litigation. Because Defendants knew of Annon\u2019s complaint and of the clerk\u2019s initial entry of default and still failed to file a responsive pleading, the default can be deemed willful. See id. at 952 (\u201cwillfulness\u201d may be shown when a party fails to comply with court orders after having been given \u201cample opportunity\u201d to do so, and requires no evidence of \u201cflaunting an intentional disrespect for the judicial process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">Defendants have also failed to demonstrate a meritorious defense to suit. About Defendants\u2019 first asserted defense, we have already determined that the district court exercised properly subject matter jurisdiction over this case. Second, Defendants contend that the terms of the loan violate Florida\u2019s usury laws. But the pertinent loan documents provide expressly that they are governed by the laws of Ontario, Canada. And the record demonstrates sufficiently the existence of a \u201cnormal relationship\u201d between Annon and Ontario, such that Ontario\u2019s usury laws govern, as agreed upon by the parties. For background, see Cont\u2019l Mortg. Inv\u2019rs v. Sailboat Key, Inc., 395 So.2d 507 (Fla. 1981) (a \u201cnormal relationship\u201d exists be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>tween a litigant and a jurisdiction when, among other things, the litigant\u2019s sole domicile and principal place of business are located within the jurisdiction and when the loan proceeds are disbursed from the jurisdiction). Because the loan terms are not violative of Ontario\u2019s usury-laws, Defendants second asserted defense is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Given these circumstances \u2014 and because Annon would likely suffer prejudice as a result of the defaults being set aside \u2014 the district court abused no discretion in denying Defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the clerk\u2019s entries of default.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The district court also abused no discretion by entering a default judgment against Defendants. Because the allegations in Annon\u2019s complaint \u2014 admitted as true \u2014 establish Defendants\u2019 liability under the loan documents, default judgment was appropriate. See Nishimatsu Constr. Co. v. Houston Nat\u2019l Bank, 515 F.2d 1200, 1206 (5th Cir.1975) (entry of default judgment is warranted when there exists \u201ca sufficient basis in the pleadings for the judgment entered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Moreover, because Annon\u2019s damages are capable of mathematical computation, the district court abused no discretion in granting default judgment without first conducting an evidentiary hearing. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(b)(2)(B) (when entering a default judgment, \u201c[t]he court may conduct hearings ... when, to enter or effectuate judgment, it needs to ... determine the amount of damages\u201d); SEC v. Smyth, 420 F.3d 1225, 1231, 1232 n.13 (11th Cir.2005) (no evidentiary hearing required under Rule 55(b)(2) when \u201cthe amount claimed is a liquidated sum or one capable of mathematical calculation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-11\">. In general, \"a defaulted defendant is deemed to admit the plaintiff's well-pleaded allegations of fact.\u201d Cotton v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 402 F.3d 1267, 1278 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations and alterations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b757-9\">. In their appellate brief, Defendants also argue that the district court erred in applying a post-judgment interest rate in excess of the rate provided for in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961. Because Defendants failed to raise this argument in the district court, it is waived. See Albra v. Advan, Inc., 490 F.3d 826, 828 n.1 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
