As part of internal complaints that would later provide the basis for a search warrant for Painter\u2019s office and, separately, in a state court lawsuit, Suire made a number of statements alleging that Painter had sexually harassed and had stalked her. Painter thereafter brought the instant defamation suit against Suire, asserting reputational harm and mental anguish as a result of Suire\u2019s statements. In a bifurcated trial, the first jury determined that Suire\u2019s statements were defamatory and therefore actionable. In the second phase of the trial, another jury found that Painter had not established that he was injured by Suire\u2019s statements, and the district court dismissed his claims with prejudice. Painter now appeals, challenging several of the district court\u2019s rulings in the second phase of the trial. Because we find no reversible error on the part of the district court, we AFFIRM the judgment of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">On August 12, 2011, Plaintiff-Appellant Murphy J. Painter filed the instant action against Defendant-Appellee Kelli Suire in Louisiana state court, bringing claims of defamation and negligence. This action stems from a long and detailed history between Painter and Suire, but we recount only those facts necessary to our decision today.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">A. Facts Underlying Painter\u2019s Defamation Suit</p>\n<p id=\"b245-18\">The basis of Painter\u2019s claims arose during his time as Commissioner of the Louisiana Office of Alcohol and Tobacco Control (ATC). Suire was hired as an administrative assistant in early 2007, left that position several months later, and was rehired in the summer of 2007 as Painter\u2019s secretary. Painter contended that in mid-2009, Suire\u2019s job performance began to decline, and he issued a reprimand to her on August 29, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-19\">Thereafter, Suire met with Dee Everett, who was the human resources director of the Louisiana Department of Revenue\u2014 the state department within which ATC is contained \u2014 to complain of Painter\u2019s treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>ment of her. Following Suire\u2019s meeting with Everett, the Department of Revenue hired an external investigator, Kecia Campbell, to investigate Suire\u2019s complaint. When Campbell interviewed Suire, Suire complained that Painter had sexually discriminated against her, that he was obsessed with her, and that he had attempted to control her life. Suire alleged that Painter, <em>inter </em>alia, often called her outside of work hours, inquired about her personal life, drove by her house several times, called her parents to inquire about her whereabouts, and made suggestive comments about her interactions with her coworkers. Suire further reported that Painter \u201cwant[ed] to control every aspect of [her] life, both professional and personal,\u201d but that Painter had not sexually harassed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Suire worked at ATC through November 2009. On August 4, 2010; Suire filed a complaint against Painter with the Louisiana Office of State Inspector General (OIG). OIG interviewed Suire on August 9, 2010, regarding her complaint against Painter. Reiterating many of her previous complaints to OIG, Suire indicated that she believed that Painter had mistreated her because she refused his romantic advances, but she did not specifically allege that she was sexually harassed. She also stated that Painter misused state law enforcement databases. After Suire\u2019s second interview with OIG officials, Painter conducted a computer search on Suire using a law enforcement database. OIG officials later interviewed other ATC employees about Painter\u2019s activities and began an investigation into his potential misuse of law enforcement databases.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">On August 13, 2010, Painter was called to the Governor\u2019s office in the State Capitol, and his employment with ATC ended.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 16, 2010, OIG prepared and filed an application for a search warrant for Painter\u2019s ATC office and computers, which was later signed by a state court judge. The warrant included the statement that \u201c[[Independent interviews conducted with two [Louisiana] ATC enforcement officers have substantiated the stalking victim\u2019s allegations as to Painter\u2019s stalking of the victim, as well as his misuse of the computerized database known as Voyager.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">On August 26, 2010, Suire petitioned a Louisiana state court for injunctive relief and a temporary restraining order against Painter, which she supported with an affidavit stating that she had resigned from ATC because of the \u201ccontinuous and ongoing harassment, intimidation, abuse, and stalking at the hands of ... Murphy Painter.\u201d With the consent of Painter, a preliminary injunction was issued on September 7, 2010, which prohibited Painter from stalking or harassing Suire and required him to stay away from her and her family. Suire later supplemented and amended her state court petition to add a claim for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, -alleging violations of her clearly established rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments based on Painter\u2019s sexual harassment of her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this amended petition, she named Painter in his individual and official capacities and the Louisiana Department of Revenue as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">While her damages claims were pending before the state court, Painter was found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>guilty of contempt of court on February 24, 2011, for violating the preliminary injunction entered against him. Later, on July 8, 2011, the Department of Revenue and Painter in his official capacity settled Suire\u2019s state court claims for $100,000. Painter, in his individual capacity, however, refused to consent to the settlement. The instant defamation suit followed on August 12, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">B. Painter\u2019s Defamation Suit</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Painter initially filed his defamation suit against Suire in Louisiana state court, and Suire, who by that point had become a citizen of Florida, removed the action to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana on August 21, 2012.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Between the time the suit was filed and the time it was removed, Painter was indicted in federal court on 42 counts of computer fraud, making false statements, and aggravated identity theft, all of which were later dropped by the government, dismissed by the court, or resulted in a not guilty verdict from a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">On October 2, 2014, the district court ordered the trial on Painter\u2019s defamation claims against Suire to be bifurcated, with, separate juries hearing the liability and damages phases of the trial. The trial on the liability issues was conducted between October 7 and 10, 2014, and was to determine whether Painter had been subjected to defamation when Suire uttered the words \u201csexual harassment\u201d and \u201cstalking\u201d in two instances: (1) her state court lawsuit for injunctive relief and (later) seeking damages, and (2) her statements made to OIG, which were later included in a search warrant affidavit. Following the trial, the liability jury was presented with a one-page verdict form asking whether Painter had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that-Suire\u2019s statements, with respect to OIG\u2019s search warrant and her state court suit, were false or that she acted in reckless disregard as to the statements\u2019 truth or falsity. The jury answered \u201cNo\u201d as to the statements concerning OIG\u2019s search warrant application, but yes as to Suire\u2019s statements in her state court suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">The second phase of the trial, which occurred between August 12 and August 14, 2015, concerned only the issues of injury and damages. The damages jury responded \u201cNo\u201d to the following question: \u201cDo you find Plaintiff, Murphy Painter, has proven by a preponderance of the evidence, that he' sustained injury to his reputation and/or for mental anguish and/or emotional distress as a result of specific statements made by Kelli Suire in her State Court lawsuit?\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the jury found that Painter had failed to establish any injury, the district court entered final judgment in favor of Suire, dismissing all of Painter\u2019s claims. Painter timely appealed, raising three general challenges: (1) the district court improperly excluded evidence; (2) the district court improperly instructed the jury; and (3) the jury\u2019s verdict was biased or otherwise improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>motivated. We address each of these challenges in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\">II. EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Under Louisiana law, \u201c[f]our elements are necessary to establish a claim for defamation: (1) a false and defamatory statement concerning another; (2) an unprivileged publication to a third party; (3) fault (negligence or greater) on the part of the publisher; and (4) resulting injury.\u201d <em>Kennedy v. Sheriff of E. Baton Rouge, </em>935 So.2d 669, 674 (La.2006). The liability jury found that Painter had established the first three elements, and the damages jury was tasked with determining whether Painter had established injury and, if so, the extent of that injury. Painter\u2019s challenges on appeal center on the damages phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">His first challenge concerns three separate evidentiary rulings made by the district court. Painter argues that the district court improperly excluded evidence from the damages phase when it (1) prevented him from reviewing defamatory materials with Suire in front of the\u2019 damages jury; (2) refused to admit video recordings of local news stories that reported Suire\u2019s defamatory allegations; and (3) prevented Painter from' referencing his criminal trial and his acquittal in that trial. \u201cWe \u2018review the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings under an abuse of discretion standard.\u2019\u201d <em>Fair-child v. All Am. Check Cashing, Inc., </em>815 F.3d 959, 966 (5th Cir.2016) (quoting <em>Curtis v. M &amp; S Petroleum, Inc., </em>174 F.3d 661, 667 (5th Cir.1999)). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 61 further provides that \u201c[u]n-less justice requires otherwise, no error in admitting or excluding evidence\u2014or any other error by the court or a party\u2014is ground for granting a new trial, for setting aside a verdict, or for vacating, modifying, or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 61. And we \u201cmust disregard all errors and defects that do not affect any party\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Turning to Painter\u2019s first evidentia-ry challenge, we observe no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling. On appeal, Painter argues that the district court erred when it prevented him from reviewing the following materials with Suire in front of the damages jury: Suire\u2019s affidavit filed in support of her petition for a temporary restraining order, her amended petition seeking damages, and prior testimony by both Suire and Painter concerning the nature of the defamatory statements she made. While all of this evidence was relevant during the liability phase of the trial, we agree with the district court that, during the damages phase, the court\u2019s purpose was \u201cto decide whether or not there was injury and if so the nature and extent of that injury and whether damages are called for\u201d and that the issue of liability was \u201cirrelevant,\u201d as it had already been decided by the first jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the evidence Painter sought to review with Suire in front of the damages jury was not relevant to the issue of damages, the district court did not abuse its discretion by preventing Painter from reviewing these materials. <em>See U.S. Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. Verizon Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>761 F.3d 409, 431 (5th Cir.2014), <em>as revised </em>(Sept. 2, 2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1430, 191 L.Ed.2d 366 (2015) (\u201c[T]he court did not abuse its discretion by declining to hear more evidence on a matter that had already been decided.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Fed. R. Evid. 403 (allowing a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>to exclude evidence if it is \u201cneedlessly ... cumulative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">With respect to Painter\u2019s second evidentiary challenge\u2014that the district court refused to admit video recordings of local news stories that reported Suire\u2019s defamatory allegations\u2014we similarly find no abuse of discretion by the district court. Painter attempted to admit videos of local news stories that his daughter had recorded on her home digital recording device. After the district court correctly noted that these recordings contained hearsay, Painter argued that they could nevertheless be admitted for several reasons. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Evid. 802. Painter first argued that the videos contained Suire\u2019s statements from her state court lawsuit and were therefore not hearsay under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(2). However, the district court correctly noted that the videos also contained statements by out-of-court declarants, which were hearsay within the meaning of Rule 801(c). Painter next argued that the videos were admissible as business records under Rule 803(6)(B). In response to this argument, the district court noted\u2014and we agree\u2014that Painter\u2019s daughter was not a proper \u201ccustodian\u201d of these records, so the videos could not be admitted as business records. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Finally, Painter argued that the videos were not inadmissible hearsay because they were not offered \u201cto prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement[s]\u201d in the videos, Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)(2), but only to show that Suire\u2019s statements had been re-publicized. <em>See Thompson v. Bank One of La., NA, </em>134 So.3d 653, 663 (La.Ct.App.2014) (\u201cA defendant who utters a defamatory statement is responsible for all republication that is the natural and probable consequence of the author\u2019s act.\u201d). With respect to this argument, the district court explained \u201ceven if [Painter was] offering them not for the truth of the matter asserted, because of the extraneous information in them and because Ms. Suire doesn\u2019t appear on them ... they\u2019re more prejudicial than they are probative.\u201d Given Suire\u2019s absence from these videos and the other extraneous information contained therein, we agree with the district court that the videos were more prejudicial than probative. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding these videos. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Turning to Painter\u2019s final evidentia-ry challenge\u2014that the district court improperly prevented him from referencing the results of his criminal trial\u2014we conclude that the district court committed no reversible error. In granting Suire\u2019s motion in limine to prevent Painter from \u201creferencing] his acquittal of his separate federal criminal charges,\u201d the district court \u201cfound that, allowing [Painter] to reference his acquittal of his criminal charges, which did not include sexual harassment or stalking, would not be relevant in the pending matter under Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\u201d Additionally, the court noted the potential for jury confusion and \u201cthe fact that [Painter] was acquitted of unrelated computer crimes ha[d] no bearing on whether he stalked or sexually harassed [Suire].\u201d We agree with the district court\u2019s reasoning, as Painter\u2019s criminal charges were, at best, tangentially related to his defamation suit against Suire. <em>See </em>Fed R. Evid. 401. Allowing him to discuss these charges and his acquittal would have risked jury confusion, and the district court properly avoided this risk by excluding such discussion. <em>See </em>Fed R. Evid. 403. Overall, we find no abuse of discretion in any of the evidentiary rulings Painter chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>lenges on appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">III. JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Painter challenges the jury instructions as failing to properly guide the jury on defamation under Louisiana law. We review challenges to jury instructions for abuse of discretion and afford the trial court great latitude in the framing and structure of jury instructions. <em>United States v. Carrillo, </em>660 F.3d 914, 925-26 (5th Cir.2011). \u201cIn order to demonstrate reversible error, the party challenging the instruction must show that the charge \u2018creates substantial and ineradicable doubt whether the jury has been properly guided in its deliberations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eastman Chem. Co. v. Plastipure, Inc., </em>775 F.3d 230, 240 (5th Cir.2014) (quoting <em>Taita Chem. Co. v. Westlake Styrene, LP, </em>351 F.3d 663, 667 (5th Cir.2003)). Moreover, \u201c[t]he instructions need not be perfect in every respect provided that the charge in general correctly instructs the jury, and any injury resulting from the erroneous instruction is harmless.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Eagle Offshore Drilling Servs., Inc., </em>764 F.2d 300, 303 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The district court instructed the damages jury in the instant case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">During this second phase of the trial you. are not to concern yourself with the issue of liability, rather, the sole issue that you will be asked to decide is whether Murphy Painter sustained any injuries caused by statements made by Ms. Suire in her state court lawsuit. And if so, the amount of damages, if any, to award Mr. Painter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">A' person who utters a defamatory statement is responsible for all republication that is the natural and probable consequence of <em>the </em>author\u2019s act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-11\">The injury resulting from defamatory statements may include non-pecuniary or general damages such as injury to reputation, personal humiliation, embarrassment, and mental anguish. Regardless of the type of injury asserted, however, the plaintiff must present competent evidence of the injury suffered. The plaintiff must also demonstrate the defamatory statements were a substantial factor in causing the harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-12\">If Murphy Painter has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that he sustained injuries caused by Kelli Suire, you must determine the damages to which Murphy Painter is entitled if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">Painter challenges these instructions, arguing they caused the jury to find that Painter failed to prove injury as a result of Suire\u2019s defamatory statements. He argues that this was error because a previous jury had already determined that Suire had uttered <em>per se </em>defamatory words. And un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>der Louisiana law, when a plaintiff proves the publication of <em>per se </em>defamatory words, the elements of falsity, injury, and malice are presumed \u2014 although, they may be rebutted by the defendant. We cannot agree with Painter\u2019s characterization of Louisiana law and, accordingly, perceive no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Assuming that Painter had established that Suire uttered <em>per se </em>defamatory statements,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Painter may still be required to prove that he suffered an injury as a result of those statements under Louisiana law. The Supreme Court of Louisiana has explained that \u201c[w]hen a plaintiff proves publication of words that are defamatory per se, the elements of falsity and malice (or fault) <em>are </em>presumed, but may be rebutted by the defendant ... [and] [t]he element of injury <em>may also be </em>presumed.\u201d <em>Costello, </em>864 So.2d at 140 (emphasis added). Thus, the element of injury is not necessarily presumed even if a plaintiff establishes that the defendant uttered <em>per se </em>defamatory words. <em>See also id. </em>at 141 (\u201cRegardless of the type of injury asserted, however, a plaintiff must present competent evidence of the injuries suffered.\u201d); <em>see also Manale v. City of New Orleans, Dep\u2019t of Police, </em>673 F.2d 122, 125 (5th Cir.1982) (\u201cWe have little difficulty in agreeing with the District Court that [the defendants\u2019] statements were defamatory per se [under Louisiana law].... With malice and falsity presumed, [the plaintiff] had only to prove injury.\u201d). In addition to establishing injury, \u201c[a] plaintiff must also demonstrate that the defamatory statements were a substantial factor in causing the harm.\u201d <em>Costello, </em>864 So.2d at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">In its instructions, the district court paraphrased the <em>Costello </em>court\u2019s explanation of the injury element of a defamation claim. Therefore, the district court properly instructed the jury, -and we have no \u201csubstantial and ineradicable doubt [as to] whether the jury has been properly guided in its deliberations.\u201d <em>Taita, </em>351 F.3d at 667 (quoting <em>F.D.I.C. v. Mijalis, </em>15 F.3d 1314, 1318 (5th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">IV. THE JURY\u2019S VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Painter\u2019s final challenge concerns the verdict rendered by the damages jury. Painter first argues that the evidence he adduced supported his claims that he suffered mental anguish and harm to his reputation as a result of Suire\u2019s defamation and that, therefore, the district court should have granted his motion for judgment as a matter of law. However, Painter failed to raise this argument in a motion for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) before the case was submitted to the jury. Because Painter failed to raise this argument in a Rule 50(a) motion prior to the submission of the case to the damages jury and raised it only in a Rule 50(b) renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, our review is \u201conly for plain error.\u201d <em>Navigant Consulting, Inc. v. Wilkinson, </em>508 F.3d 277, 292 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also Md. Cas. Co. v. Acceptance Indem. Ins. Co., </em>639 F.3d 701, 707-08 (5th Cir.2011). \u201cUnder plain error review, we must decide \u2018whether there was any evidence to support the jury verdict.\u2019 ... If any evidence exists that supports the verdict, it will be upheld.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lincoln v. Case, </em>340 F.3d 283, 290 (5th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>We cannot say that no evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict. With respect to Painter\u2019s claim that he suffered mental anguish and emotional distress, Painter testified that he \u201cha[d] no mental disorder\u201d as a result of Suire\u2019s defamatory statements. He also stated that he did not have a psychological impairment and was not diagnosed by a medical professional with any kind of disorder. With respect to the damage to Painter\u2019s reputation, the record contains sufficient evidence from which the jury could have determined that Painter did not suffer reputational harm as a result of \u2019Suire\u2019s defamatory statements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Based on the existence of some evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict, we decline to disturb that verdict on plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\">Painter\u2019s second challenge to the damages jury\u2019s verdict concerns the way in which the jury completed the verdict form. Specifically, the jury first responded \u201cno\u201d to the question of whether Painter had carried his burden to show that he sustained injury as a result of Suire\u2019s defamatory statements. Based on this negative response, the jury should have signed the form and returned it to the court. However, the jury proceeded to other questions, answering \u201cyes\u201d to the question of whether Painter contributed to his injuries and stating that Painter was \u201c100%\u201d at fault for any injury he suffered. From these unnecessary answers, Painter infers that the jury was biased against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">It is not clear from the record whether Painter raised these arguments as part of his Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law or if he was attempting to move for a new trial because of the jury\u2019s bias. If it is the former; then we review the district court\u2019s rejection of these arguments for plain error. <em>Navigant, </em>508 F.3d at 292. If it is the latter, then our review is for abuse of discretion. <em>McIver v. Am. Eagle Airlines, Inc., </em>413 Fed.Appx. 772, 775 (5th Cir.2011) (per curiam) (unpublished). Under any standard of review, however, the district court committed no error in rejecting Painter\u2019s arguments. The jury\u2019s thorough answers to the questions on the verdict form, while unnecessary based on the instructions on that form, were entirely consistent and support its finding that Painter failed to establish that he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Y.

In addition to his suit against Suire, Painter also filed defamation suits against the Governor of Louisiana, several state entities, and several state employees in their official capacities in Louisiana state court on August 19, 2011.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\">. After the jury returned its verdict, Painter argued that the verdict was not supported by the evidence adduced at trial. The district court interpreted this argument as a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, and denied the motion. Painter also argued that the jury\u2019s verdict was nonresponsive to the verdict form, as the jury unnecessarily answered questions on the form. The district court \"denie[d] [Painter\u2019s] objection to nonre-sponsiveness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b248-6\">. Moreover, the district court correctly noted that the statements about which Painter sought to question Suire in front of the damages jury were in the record and that the jury would be able to read them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b250-8\">. We also find that Painter\u2019s substantial rights would not have been affected even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings were erroneous. <em>See Kelly v. Boeing Petroleum Servs., Inc., </em>61 F.3d 350, 361 (5th Cir.1995) (\"Erroneous evidentiary rulings by the trial court constitute reversible error only when those rulings have affected a party\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d). If Painter had prevailed on his first evidentiary challenge, his ability to establish that he was injured as a result of Suire\u2019s defamatory statements would not have been meaningfully improved, as the nature of Suire\u2019s statements are relevant to whether they were defamatory, not whether Painter suffered any injury. Had Painter prevailed on his second challenge, his ability to establish damages would not have been significantly better because he testified separately about the republication of Suire\u2019s statements. And finally, if Painter had been able to discuss his criminal trial and subsequent acquittal, that evidence would not have improved Painter\u2019s ability to establish an injury as a result of Suire\u2019s defamation, as the charges at that trial were not germane to her statements concerning stalking and sexual harassment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b251-6\">. Under Louisiana law, \"[w]ords which expressly or implicitly accuse another of criminal conduct, or which by their very nature tend to injure one\u2019s personal or professional reputation, even without considering extrinsic facts or surrounding circumstances, are considered defamatory per se.\u201d <em>Costello v. Hardy, </em>864 So.2d 129, 140 (La.2004). The liability jury did not explicitly find that Suire's statements were <em>per se </em>defamatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b252-5\">. For example, Painter testified that, in addition to the instant lawsuit, he had filed suit against the State of Louisiana, the Governor of Louisiana, and other defendants, alleging that their actions surrounding his termination on August 13, 2010, caused harm to his reputation. The damages jury could have concluded that these actions, not the defamatory statements made by Suire, caused Painter's reputational injury. <em>See Costello, </em>864 So.2d at 141 (requiring that a defamation plaintiff establish causation).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
