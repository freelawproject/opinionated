We granted a COA as to whether the district court erred in dismissing without prejudice Mr. Daker\u2019s <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2254 petition for failure to pay the filing fee. Mr. Daker seeks to present two more points on appeal. First, Mr. Daker also contends that the district court abused its discretion in determining that he did not qualify to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>without conducting an adequate factual inquiry into his financial status. And second, he requests that on remand this Court assign a different judge because the district court judge\u2019s impartiality has been called into question. After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a state prisoner\u2019s petition for habeas relief. <em>See Arthur v. Allen, </em>452 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir. 2006). As to the district court\u2019s findings of fact, however, we review only for clear error. <em>Id. </em>Under the clear error standard, we will affirm \u201cunless the record lacks substantial evidence to support that determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">The district court erred in dismissing Mr. Daker\u2019s petition for failure to pay the filing fee. Mr. Daker-requested an extended deadline to pay the filing fee, and the district court granted that request. <em>See </em>D.E. 18. The extended deadline for payment of the fee was December 3, 2013, and, according to the docket entry, Mr. Daker paid the filing fee on November 19, 2013. The district court therefore clearly erred in finding that Mr. Daker had not paid the filing fee prior to the extended deadline. <em>See Arthur, </em>452 F.3d at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">We vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Daker\u2019s habeas corpus petition and remand for further proceedings. Because our review is limited to the issue specified in the COA, <em>see Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir. 1998), we do not address the additional issues presented by Mr. Daker.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-13\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
