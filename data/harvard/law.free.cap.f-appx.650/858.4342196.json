He seeks to challenge the denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in which he sought a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 782 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Minor was held responsible for more than the quantity of methamphetamine that triggers the highest base offense level under both the version of \u00a7 2D1.1(c) in effect when he was sentenced and the retroactive, amended version. Accordingly, Amendments 782 and 788 did not change his offense level or lower his guidelines range, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying .him a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009),</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Because the appeal lacks arguable merit and is therefore frivolous, Minor\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b882-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
