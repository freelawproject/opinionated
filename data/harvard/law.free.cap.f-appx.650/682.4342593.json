The district court applied an enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), based on its determination that, in addition to two prior violent felonies that Maida does not contest, Maida had been convicted of four offens\u00e9s under Florida\u2019s burglary statute, Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 810.02, which the court concluded qualified as violent felonies for ACCA purposes. After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we vacate Maida\u2019s sentence and remand with instructions that he be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>resentenced without the ACCA enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">After Maida pled guilty, the probation office prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). According to the PSI, Mai-da had a base offense level of 24 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). The PSI applied a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) for using or possessing a firearm in connection with another felony offense. It also applied a six-level ACCA enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A). Under the ACCA, an individual convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years if he has three previous federal or state convictions \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Section 924(e) defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiV\">any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-9\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">With a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, Maida\u2019s total offense level was 31. The PSI also calculated a criminal history category of VI. In listing Maida\u2019s prior convictions, the PSI failed to identify which convictions qualified as predicate offenses for the ACCA enhancement. Combining a criminal history category of VI with a total offense level of 31, the PSI arrived at a guideline's range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. It noted that the statutory minimum term of imprisonment under the ACCA was 15 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">According to objections to the PSI that Maida filed before sentencing, his probation officer advised via email that the ACCA enhancement was based on the following predicate offenses: a 2005 conviction for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon; two convictions for burglary of a dwelling in 2006 and 2008; a 2006 attempted burglary conviction; a 2006 conviction for burglary of a structure; and a .2007 robbery conviction. As relevant here, Mai-da objected to the ACCA\u2019s application on the ground that the four burglary convictions, each charged under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02, failed to meet the requirements for \u201cburglary\u201d as enumerated in section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). He also objected to application of the ACCA\u2019s residual clause\u2014 which designates a crime as a violent felony if it is not enumerated but \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d \u2014 to his prior burglary offenses because, he asserted, the clause was unconstitutionally vague.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">In response to the objections, the government \u201cagree[d] that under <em>Taylor [v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) ], Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02 does not qualify as a generic burglary as enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\u201d Doc. 37 at 3-4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It nonetheless defended the enhancement on the \u201calternative\u201d ground that Maida\u2019s convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02 qualified as violent felonies under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>Id. </em>at 4-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>At sentencing, Maida\u2019s counsel reiterated the objection that a conviction under Florida\u2019s burglary statute did not qualify as the enumerated offense of burglary. Counsel stated that the \u201cGovernment, in their response, appear to concede that the prior burglary convictions do not qualify as generic burglaries, and are not the type [of] burglary enumerated in Section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\u201d Doc. 62 at 4. - Defense counsel argued that, \u201cafter <em>Descamps, Howard, </em>and <em>Jones, </em>[cases addressing the proper analysis for whether a conviction qualifies as an enumerated offense,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] it is questionable whether a[n ACCA predicate] conviction [under Florida\u2019s] overbroad, non-generic [statute] exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at' 7. And, defense counsel asserted, the government had failed to meet its burden to demonstrate that Maida\u2019s convictions were for the enumerated offense of burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 7-10. In response, the government never argued that the convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 910.02 qualified as enumerated burglary offenses, nor did it mention the ACCA\u2019s enumerated offense of burglary. Instead, it relied exclusively on its contention that the burglary convictions qualified under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. The district court continued the sentencing to consider these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">When the district court reconvened, it overruled Maida\u2019s objections regarding whether his Florida burglary convictions .qualified as violent felonies under the ACCA. The court adopted the factual statements and guidelines calculations in the PSI but ultimately varied downward, sentencing Maida to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment, the mandatory minimum under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">Maida appealed, and briefing concluded in March 2015. While the appeal was pending, on June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court held that the residual clause of the ACCA was unconstitutionally vague. <em>See Johnson v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). Upon this Court\u2019s order, the parties filed supplemental briefing on the impact of <em>Johnson, </em>which we now address.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Gandy, </em>710 F.3d 1234, 1236 (11th Cir.2013). The ACCA divides predicate offenses into three categories.' Under the \u201celements clause,\u201d crimes that have \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d subject a defendant to the ACCA enhancement. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). Under the \u201cenumerated crimes\u201d clause, ACCA predicate offenses include \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). And under the so-called \u201cresidual clause,\u201d a crime that \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d is a violent felony for ACCA purposes. <em>Id.; see Rozier v. United States, </em>701 F.3d 681, 682 n.1 (11th Cir.2012) (describing three categories of ACCA predicate offenses).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Johnson </em>invalidated the residual clause as unconstitutionally vague; thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>as both parties agree, the clause does not provide a basis for the enhancement of Maida\u2019s sentence. Neither party contends that a conviction under Florida\u2019s burglary statute falls within the elements clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Rather, in its supplemental briefing, the government for the first time asserts that Maida\u2019s burglary convictions constitute crimes of violence under the enumerated crimes clause of the ACCA. During sentencing, Maida vigorously objected to the district court\u2019s classification of his Florida burglary convictions as enumerated burglary offenses, and in response the government failed to argue that those convictions qualified under the enumerated crimes clause. Further, the cases the government now cites in support of its argument all were decided before Maida\u2019s objections were ruled upon and he was sentenced. <em>See </em>Nov. 27, 2015 supplemental letter brief at 3-16. Indeed, throughout the sentencing proceedings, and in this Court until its supplemental letter brief, the government has relied solely upon the status of Maida\u2019s convictions as crimes of violence under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. When the district court overruled Maida\u2019s objections and ruled that Maida\u2019s burglary convictions were crimes of violence, it did not indicate whether the convictions qualified under the enumerated crimes clause or the residual clause, and the government did not request clarification. In fact, the government\u2019s remarks at sentencing suggested that the government conceded the inapplicability of the enumerated crimes clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In short, the government\u2019s statements effectively disclaimed reliance on the ground that it now seeks to pursue on remand. We conclude that the government should not now be permitted to do so. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 145, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010) (concluding that, where the government disclaimed reliance on the residual clause at sentencing, it would not be permitted to rely on that ground on remand).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Maida\u2019s sentence may not be enhanced pursuant to the ACCA. We accordingly vacate his sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-14\">. \"Doc.\u201d refers to the docket entry in the district court in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b708-5\"><em>.
