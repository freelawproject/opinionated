SMITH, Circuit Judge:<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">Kathleen Reynolds sued Sovran Acquisitions, L.P. (\u201cSovran\u201d), alleging sex and age discrimination in violation of, respectively, Title VII (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l)) and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\u201cADEA\u201d) (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1)). Concluding that a reasonable jury could not find for Reynolds on either' claim, the district court granted summary judgment to Sovran.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reynolds appeals, claiming there are genuine disputes as to material facts and that the district court erred in various evidentiary decisions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-16\">Reynolds began working as a store manager for Sovran in February 2009.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She was terminated on August 8, 2013, at the age of 53. According to Sovran, her position was first offered to another female employee, who turned it down.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Reynolds\u2019s eventual replacement was a 27-year-old man, Chris Atkinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-17\">At the time of her termination, Reynolds\u2019s immediate supervisor, Kevin Bag-well, told Reynolds that her discharge was for customer-service issues. The main incident that Sovran points to was some time in 2013, when a disgruntled customer became upset with Reynolds \u2014 according to Reynolds about something she would not do because it was against company policy. Reynolds maintains that the customer asked for the phone number to Store 91, stating that he knew \u201cBrian,\u201d the store <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>manager there, but Sovran says the customer asked for the number of Reynolds\u2019s supervisor, i.e., Bagwell. Instead, Reynolds gave the customer her own cell phone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">When the customer realized what had happened, he returned to the store and again asked for Store 91\u2019s phone number (according to Reynolds) or Sovran\u2019s phone number or Bagwell\u2019s phone number (according to Sovran). This time Reynolds provided the customer with the number to Store 91, where Reynolds\u2019s associate manager, Atkinson, was working that day. Reynolds then called Atkinson and told him that a customer would be calling. Reynolds says that she asked Atkinson to back her up on store policy, whereas Sov-ran maintains that Reynolds asked Atkinson to pretend that he was her supervisor so that she would not get into trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Atkinson reported the incident to Bag-well first verbally, then in an email dated July 24, 2013, and Bagwell forwarded the email to Human Resources (\u201cHR\u201d). Sov-ran maintains that HR investigated the complaint by speaking with Atkinson and having Bagwell speak to the customer and Reynolds, whereas Reynolds asserts that there was no investigation and that HR merely backed Bagwell\u2019s decision to terminate her. Eventually, there was a conference call between Bagwell and other Sovran employees over the incident; they decided to terminate Reynolds. Reynolds filed charges with the Equal. Employment Opportunity Commission, which issued a right-to-sue letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Where, as here, the non-movant ultimately bears the burden of proof at trial, Sovran is entitled to summary judgment not only by producing evidence negating Reynolds\u2019s claims but also by pointing to the absence of admissible evidence supporting her claims. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323-24, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). If Sovran does that, Reynolds must \u201cgo beyond the pleadings and designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">Reynolds must do more than show \u201csome metaphysical doubt as to the material facts\u201d or make \u201cconclusory allegations\u201d or \u201cunsubstantiated assertions,\u201d or provide \u201conly a \u2018scintilla\u2019 of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, she must \u201cidentify specific evidence in the record\u201d and \u201carticulate the precise manner in which the evidence supports ... her claim[s].\u201d <em>Ragas v. Tenn. Gas Pipeline Co., </em>136 F.3d 455, 458 (5th Cir. 1998). A fact is material only if it \u201cmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Reynolds\u2019s failure to prove \u201can essential element\u201d of her case \u201cnecessarily renders all other facts immaterial.\u201d <em>Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">In the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, the burden-shifting test set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), applies to both of Reynolds\u2019s claims. Under this framework, Reynolds faces the initial burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. If she does that, the burden shifts to Sovran to \u201carticulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for her termination. <em>Id. </em>At that point, the <em>prima facie </em>case dissolves, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>the burden shifts back to Reynolds. For her Title VII claim, she must then show either \u201c(1) that the employer\u2019s proffered reason is not true but is instead a pretext for discrimination; or (2) that the employer\u2019s reason, while true, is not the only reason for its conduct, and another \u2018motivating factor\u2019 is the plaintiffs protected characteristic.\u201d <em>Alvarado v. Tex. Rangers, </em>492 F.3d 605, 611 (5th Cir. 2007). For her ADEA claim, Reynolds\u2019s burden is somewhat different: She must show \u201ceither [1] that the employer\u2019s proffered reason was not true \u2014 but was instead a pretext for age discrimination \u2014 or [2] that, even if the employer\u2019s reason is true, [s]he was terminated <em>because </em>o/h[er] age.\u201d <em>Miller v. Raytheon Co., </em>716 F.3d 138, 144 (5th Cir. 2013) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">For purposes of summary judgment, Sovran conceded that Reynolds made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, and Reynolds conceded that Sovran had articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for termination. Sovran\u2019s proffered npndiscriminatory reasons for terminating Reynolds are that she had multiple customer service issues, she supplied a customer with false information and falsified her supervisor\u2019s telephone number, and she deceived a customer who wanted to lodge a complaint against her. The court granted summary judgment because it concluded that Reynolds failed to provide sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that Sovran\u2019s nondiscriminatory reason was pretext and that discrimination was a motivating factor in, or but-for cause of, her termination. On appeal, Reynolds avers that summary judgment was improper because there are evidentiary problems with facts on which the district court based its summary judgment and that there are genuine disputes as to material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Reynolds maintains that Sovran failed to carry its burden under the second stage of <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>because its nondiscriminatory reason was not supported by evidence from a witness with personal knowledge. We decline to consider that objection, because it has been waived. In response to Sovran\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Reynolds explicitly conceded that Sovran \u201c \u2018articulated\u2019 a legitimate business reason for her discharge.\u201d Because \u201c[a] party\u2019s concession of an issue means the issue is waived and may not be revived,\u201d <em>Smith v. United States, </em>328 F.3d 760, 770 (5th Cir. 2003), Reynolds cannot now attack Sovran\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reason on the ground that it was not supported by admissible evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">Reynolds contends that Tammy Vega\u2019s deposition raises a genuine issue of material fact. There Vega, who was hired as Atkinson\u2019s associate manager after Atkinson became manager of Store 751, stated that Atkinson told her that he had set Reynolds up to get fired, that he wanted Reynolds\u2019s apartment (which went along with the manager\u2019s position), and that he and Bagwell were trying to get Reynolds\u2019s fired. Sovran objected to Atkinson\u2019s al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>leged- statements as hearsay, but the court declined to rule on the evidentiary issue because it concluded that, even assuming the statements were admissible, they would not enable a reasonable jury to find discrimination based on sex or age.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The district court was correct. Atkinson\u2019s alleged statements do not implicate sex or age. Consequently, they would not enable a reasonable jury to find that Atkinson or Bagwell discriminated based on either of those protected characteristics or that Sovran was aware of their motives when it terminated Reynolds on the basis that she engaged in deceptive conduct involving a customer. Atkinson\u2019s alleged statements raise a genuine dispute as to a fact but not a genuine dispute as to a <em>material </em>fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Reynolds maintains that the district court erred in concluding that Bagwell\u2019s intent to help Atkinson get a promotion could not result in illegal discrimination against Reynolds. Helping Atkinson become a manager necessarily required terminating someone in a managerial position, and Reynolds contends that the jury could infer that Bagwell chose whom to terminate \u2014 namely, Reynolds \u2014 based on sex or age. Reynolds also stresses the consequences of Bagwell\u2019s actions, namely, her termination, and she reasons, based on <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971), and <em>Smith v. City of Jackson, Mississippi, </em>544 U.S. 228, 125 S.Ct. 1586, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005), that there can be illegal discrimination even without the intent to discriminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">. We disagree. Standing alone, Bagwell\u2019s intent to help Atkinson would not permit a reasonable jury to conclude that Bagwell terminated Reynolds based on sex or age. And Reynolds cannot prevail on her discrimination claims in the absence of a finding of discriminatory intent. Her citations to <em>Griggs </em>and <em>Smith </em>are inapposite, because both dealt with disparate-impact claims rather than discriminatory targeting' of a specific individual, and Reynolds does not allege or offer any evidence that her termination was the result of company policies that have a disparate impact based on sex or age.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">According to Reynolds, the record shows that Bagwell was given \u201cunfettered discretion that resulted in [her] firing.\u201d This unfettered discretion, she contends, raises a fact issue precluding summary judgment. In support of that legal proposition, she points to <em>Rowe v. General Motors Corp., </em>457 F.2d 348 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>Lindsey v. Prive, </em>987 F.2d 324 (5th Cir. 1993); and <em>Medina v. Ramsey Steel Co., </em>238 F.3d 674 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">Reynolds\u2019s' theory is flawed. First, the record does not show that Bagwell was given unfettered discretion in hiring and firing. Aside from Reynolds\u2019s conclusory assertions, no evidence supports the notion that Bagwell had sole decisionmaking authority over whether to retain or fire Reynolds. Moreover,' even if he did, and other employees merely rubberstamped his decision to terminate Reynolds, there is no evidence that Bagwell based or could have based his decision on purely subjective factors, as was the case in <em>Rowe, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>Lindsey, </em>and <em>Medina. </em>Instead, the record indicates that the decision to terminate Reynolds rested on objective factors: customer complaints and suspicions that Reynolds had acted deceptively.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Second, all of the cases that Reynolds cites are inapposite. <em>Rowe </em>deals with a disparate-impact claim under Title VII, and <em>Lindsey </em>and <em>Medina </em>concern the use of subjective criteria in hiring and promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Reynolds criticizes the district court for failing to consider Bagwell\u2019s statements to Reynolds as \u201cadmissible and relevant in raising a fact issue showing that he discriminated against her because of her sex or age.\u201d Reynolds testified that, twice when hiring an associate manager, Bagwell remarked that it would be preferable to hire a man. She also stated that Bagwell told her she should be more \u201cfriendly and bubbly\u201d toward people and that she might be happier doing something else and maybe did not like working for Sovran.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">The district court concluded that those alleged remarks failed to qualify as circumstantial evidence of intentional discrimination. To demonstrate that an employer\u2019s proffered reason for termination is pretext or to serve as additional evidence of discrimination, a \u201cremark must, first, demonstrate discriminatory animus and, second, be made by a person primarily responsible for the adverse employment action or by a person with influence or leverage over the formal decisionmaker.\u201d <em>Laxton v. Gap, Inc., </em>333 F.3d 572, 583 (5th Cir. 2003). Bagwell\u2019s alleged statements satisfy the second requirement, given that he was Reynolds\u2019s direct supervisor and participated in the decision to terminate her. The district court concluded, however, that Bagwell\u2019s statements failed to satisfy the first requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">The court was correct. Bagwell\u2019s alleged remarks that Reynolds should be more \u201cfriendly and bubbly,\u201d that she might be happier doing something else, and that she might not like working for Sovran implicate neither sex nor age, nor do they demonstrate discriminatory animus on either basis. Reynolds\u2019s alleged statements regarding a man\u2019s being a preferable hire, on the other hand, do implicate sex but do not raise a genuine dispute concerning discriminatory animus, because they were not \u201cproximate in time to the [complained-of adverse employment decision]\u201d or \u201crelated to the employment decision at issue.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Bagwell\u2019s alleged remarks expressing a preference for male hires occurred in 2012 and were made with regard to the hiring of associate managers. They were thus remote in time and unrelated to Reynolds\u2019s termination in August 2013. Those alleged comments do not create a genuine dispute of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-15\">Reynolds claims that Sovran failed to follow its internal disciplinary procedures, raising a fact issue as to whether Sovran\u2019s nondiscriminatory reason for her termination was mere pretext. The district court concluded otherwise, because Reynolds \u201cfailed to point to summary judgment evidence that would enable a reasonable jury to find that Sovran deviated from its formal disciplinary practice.\u201d <em>Reynolds, </em>2015 WL 6501552, at *6. That analysis is sound. Reynolds never introduced the relevant parts of Sovran\u2019s employee handbook into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the summary judgment record. In support of her claims that Sovran failed to comply with its disciplinary policy, she merely offered testimony that she \u201cbelieved\u201d Sovran adopted a process similar to the one she described. Her \u201cunsubstantiated and subjective beliefs and opinions regarding good employment practices are insufficient to create a genuine fact issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Ramsey v. Henderson, </em>286 F.3d 264, 269 (5th Cir. 2002)). Thus <em>Reynolds </em>has failed to show a genuine dispute as to a material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">G.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Reynolds posits that the district court erred in relying on Atkinson\u2019s statement that, after Reynolds\u2019s termination, Sovran first offered her position to another female employee, because, Reynolds claims, Atkinson\u2019s statement is hearsay. Reynolds did not object to the admissibility of that evidence in the district court, so her challenge is barred unless its admission was a plain error affecting a substantial right. Fed. R. Evid. 103(e). Reynolds makes no attempt to show plain error, and we find none.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Reynolds objects to the district court\u2019s conclusion that an employer\u2019s good-faith mistake in deciding to terminate does not raise a genuine fact issue regarding pretext. Citing <em>Waggoner v. City of Garland, Texas, </em>987 F.2d 1160 (5th Cir. 1993), Reynolds argues that the veracity of an accusation can create a fact issue in situations other than where one employee accuses another employee of engaging in some type of wrongdoing. But Reynolds\u2019s narrow reading of <em>Waggoner </em>is incorrect. \u201c[Ejven an incorrect belief that an employee\u2019s performance is inadequate constitutes a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason.\u201d <em>Little v. Republic Refining Co., </em>924 F.2d 93, 97 (5th Cir. 1991). What Reynolds must therefore prove to avoid summary judgment is not that she really did not handle the customer complaint in a deceptive manner, but that Sovran did not have a good-faith belief regarding the customer complaint. Because she has failed to make this showing, there is no genuine dispute as to a material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">Reynolds asserts that the district court erred in concluding that Atkinson would not have \u201cset up\u201d Reynolds for termination, in light of his praise for her in his deposition. But the court never arrived at any such conclusion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The objection is thus meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">The summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b203-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
