Benevides argues that the government breached the plea agreement by opposing his requests for a two-level reduction based on acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3El.l(a) (Nov. 2014), and for a sentence at the low end of his applicable guideline range. In the written agreement, the government reserved the right to oppose Benevides\u2019s requests if \u201cany adverse information is received suggesting such a recommendation to be unwarranted,\u201d and after he signed the agreement, Benevides falsely denied using other inmates\u2019 prisoner numbers to communicate with a cohort and to continue his fraudulent financial activities. Because the government did not breach the plea agreement, we affirm Benevides\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">On July 14, 2014, Benevides executed a written agreement to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud in exchange for the dismissal of the other eighteen charges relating to his use of shell companies to fraudulently obtain loans, mortgages, and lines of credit that exceeded $44 million. Paragraph eight of the agreement stated, \u201cAt the time of sentencing, and in the event that no adverse information is received suggesting such a recommendation to be unwarranted, the United States will not oppose the defendant\u2019s request to ... receive a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3El.l(a).\u201d Paragraph ten of the agreement stated, \u201cAt the time of sentencing, and in the event that no adverse information is received suggesting such a recommendation to be unwarranted, the United States will not oppose the defendant\u2019s request to .,. receive a sentence at the low end of the applicable guideline range, as calculated by the Court.\u201d In another paragraph entitled Sentencing Information, the government \u201creserve[d] its right and obligation to report to the Court and the United States Probation Office all information concerning [Benevides\u2019s] background, character, and conduct ..., to provide relevant factual information, including the totality of [his] criminal activities,\u201d and \u201cto make any recommendations it deems appropriate regarding the disposition of [Benevides\u2019s] case, subject to any limitations set forth\u201d in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">During an interview on September 16, 2014, Benevides falsely denied that he had continued to engage in fraudulent real estate activities, but eventually he confessed after being presented with evidence of his misdeeds. Federal agents had amassed evidence that, after Benevides\u2019s arrest but before he signed the plea agreement, he used other inmates\u2019 prisoner inmate numbers to make telephone calls to solicit investors in a company that he controlled through a 'straw owner. After signing the plea agreement, Benevides continued to make telephone calls to solicit investors and to discuss other financial transactions. In addition, Benevides began mailing letters in other inmates\u2019 names to prospective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>investors and to a woman whose assistance he sought in his fraudulent activities. '</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the government breached the plea agreement. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>487 F.3d 1358, 1360 (11th Cir. 2007). \u2018\u2018Whether the government violated the agreement is judged according to the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding of the agreement when he entered the plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]e interpret the terms of the plea agreement based on objective standards.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The government did not breach the plea agreement. The government was relieved of its obligation to stand mute about Benevides\u2019s request for a two-level reduction because his conduct was inconsistent with an acceptance of responsibility. <em>See generally United States v. Mahique, </em>150 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir. 1998) (government did not breach its agreement' not to oppose a reduction based on the acceptance of responsibility when the defendant failed to make a full and accurate disclosure of his relevant conduct). After lying to federal agents, Benevides was not entitled to a \u201creduction [that] is intended to reward ... contrition for ... wrongdoing and ... a desire to reform ... conduct,\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>627 F.3d 839, 844 (11th Cir. 2010). And Benevides\u2019s deceptiveness \u201csuggested] [that] a recommendation for [a sentence at the low end of his sentencing range was] unwarranted.\u201d Benevides\u2019s misconduct evidenced that a low-end sentence would not \u201cpromote respect for the law\u201d or \u201cprovide adequate deterrence\u201d against or \u201cprotect the public\u201d from future similar crimes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The actions of the government were consistent with the terms of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">We AFFIRM Benevides\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
