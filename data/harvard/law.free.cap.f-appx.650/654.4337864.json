Boynton suffered a diabetic seizure in a Tallahassee, Florida grocery store. During the emergency medical response that followed, a police officer tased him multiple times. Boynton filed this lawsuit against that officer, two medics, and the City of Tallahassee, claiming that the incident violated his statutory and constitutional rights. The distinct court dismissed some of his claims and granted summary judgment to the defendants on others. This is Boynton\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">Boynton is a Type I diabetic. Although he has experienced diabetic seizures in the past, he does not wear a medical alert bracelet or anything else that would make others aware of his condition. In 2010 he collapsed in the checkout line of a Winn Dixie Supermarket. He has no memory of what happened right after he collapsed, but we know from witnesses that a store employee called 911. Wayne Ellison and Lindsay Cameron, medics with Leon County Emergency Medical Services, responded around 1:12 p.m. They put Boyn-ton, who was largely unresponsive, onto a stretcher and took him outside to their ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-16\">Boynton regained consciousness in the ambulance. Cameron asked him if he had used any illegal drugs, and he told her that he had not. He did not tell the medics that he was a diabetic, but he did ask them for a candy bar or something sweet. According to Boynton, Ellison responded by telling him that he was \u201cabout to be Baker Acted\u201d \u2014 that is, taken into custody for an involuntary psychiatric observation under Florida law. That frightened Boynton, and he tried to leave the ambulance. When the medics tried to stop him, Boynton physically resisted them and a struggle ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-17\">After a minute or two, the medics decided to exit the ambulance and call for help from law enforcement. A police dispatcher contacted Curtis Norton, a police officer for the City of Tallahassee, and told him to \u201cproceed to the scene with lights and siren because of a combative patient inside an ambulance.\u201d When Norton arrived around 1:24 p.m., Cameron told him she thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Boynton might be \u201con illegal drugs.\u201d Norton entered the ambulance and found Boynton lying on the floor, wedged between the stretcher and the ambulance wall, clinging to the bottom of the stretcher.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Norton told him to get onto the stretcher for treatment. Boynton responded with \u201cslurred words that [Norton] couldn\u2019t understand,\u201d but he did not move. Norton decided to take Boynton into \u201cprotective custody,\u201d but he did not tell Boyn-ton that. He hoisted Boynton onto the stretcher, where he lay on his stomach with his arms tucked under his body and his head facing the ambulance door. Norton ordered him to flip onto his back and turn around so that the medics could treat him, but Boynton once again did not move. Norton tried to move Boynton himself, but he was unable to get a solid grip because Boynton repeatedly \u201ctens[ed] his arms and pull[ed] them close to his body.\u201d At that point, Norton decided to use his taser as a stun gun to \u201cget control of [Boynton] so that he could be medically treated.\u201d He did not give any verbal warning before using his taser.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">When Norton tased him, Boynton \u201cflopped\u201d between the stretcher and the ambulance floor. Cameron, who was standing just outside, observed Boynton \u201cscreaming,\u201d \u201cyelling,\u201d \u201cjerking,\u201d and \u201cgo[ing] limp.\u201d According to Cameron, Boynton also said, \u201cOkay, man, okay, man,\u201d and \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll get up,\u201d after Norton first tased him. When Boynton did not move onto the stretcher right away, Norton tased him eight more times \u2014 for a total of nine taser shocks cumulatively lasting 49 seconds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Boynton eventually complied with Norton\u2019s order to lie on his back on the stretcher. Norton then holstered his taser and handcuffed Boynton to the stretcher. The medics returned to the ambulance, and Cameron began driving to the hospital while Ellison resumed his assessment of Boynton\u2019s condition. He discovered that Boynton\u2019s blood sugar was low and administered intravenous dextrose around 1:30 p.m. Boynton was treated and released from the hospital; he was not charged with any crime. He alleges that being tased nine times caused neurological damage to his lumbar spine, resulting in pain and numbness in his right leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Boynton filed this lawsuit against the City of Tallahassee, Ellison, Cameron, and Norton. In his third amended complaint, which is the operative one for purposes of this appeal, Boynton asserted four federal claims: (1) a deliberate indifference claim against Ellison, Cameron, and Norton under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; (2) an excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>force claim against Norton under \u00a7 1983; (3) a municipal liability claim against the City under \u00a7 1983; and (4) a discrimination claim against the City under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (RA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. He also asserted several state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The district court dismissed Boynton\u2019s discrimination claim under Rule 12(b)(6) and his \u00a7 1983 deliberate indifference claim against Norton on the basis of qualified immunity. The court later granted summary judgment to the defendants on Boynton\u2019s remaining \u00a7 1983 claims. It held that the defendants had not violated any constitutional right, and that, if they had, they would be entitled to qualified immunity. The district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Boynton\u2019s state law claims and dismissed them without prejudice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Boynton first challenges the dismissal of his ADA and RA discrimination claims against the City. We review de novo the dismissal of a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), \u201caccepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d Butler v. Sheriff of Palm Beach Cty., 685 F.3d 1261, 1265 (11th Cir. 2012). To survive a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must plead sufficient facts \u201cto state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d Id. We will affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of a claim for any reason supported by the record. Allen v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., 790 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">The ADA and the RA prevent public entities and the recipients of federal funding from discriminating against disabled individuals. See Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 184-85, 122 S.Ct. 2097, 2100, 153 L.Ed.2d 230 (2002). To state a claim for compensatory damages under either statute,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a private plaintiff must show that the defendant acted \u201cwith discriminatory intent.\u201d McCullum v. Orlando Reg. Healthcare Sys., Inc., 768 F.3d 1135, 1146-47 (11th Cir. 2014); see Delano-Pyle v. Victoria Cty., Tex., 302 F.3d 567, 574 (5th Cir. 2002) (\u201cA plaintiff asserting a private cause of action for violations of the ADA or the RA may only recover compensatory damages upon a showing of intentional discrimination.\u201d). That requires proof the defendant either intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff or was \u201cdeliberately indifferent to his statutory rights.\u201d McCullum, 768 F.3d at 1147 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo establish deliberate indifference, a plaintiff must show that the defendant knew that harm to a federally protected right was substantially likely and failed to act on that likelihood.\u201d Id. (quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">In his third amended complaint, Boyn-ton asserts that Norton\u2019s actions were \u201cintentional and/or deliberately indifferent\u201d to his rights under the ADA and the RA. But he does not allege any factual basis for that conclusion. See Randall v. Scott, 610 F.3d 701, 709-10 (11th Cir. 2010) (explain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ing that a legal conclusion must be supported by factual allegations to survive a motion to dismiss). Boynton alleges only that Norton should have recognized his erratic behavior as \u201cconsistent with [an individual] suffering a diabetic crisis.\u201d But that does not suggest Norton actually knew that Boynton was disabled or knew that his actions were substantially likely to violate Boynton\u2019s rights under the ADA or the RA. See McCullum, 768 F.3d at 1147. Because he has not alleged any facts showing that Norton acted intentionally or with deliberate indifference, we affirm the dismissal of Boynton\u2019s statutory discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Boynton next challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendants on his constitutional claims under \u00a7 1988. \u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment,\u201d drawing \u201call inferences and reviewing] all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d Hamilton v. Southland Christian Sch., Inc., 680 F.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir. 2012). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the record discloses no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Harbert Int\u2019l, Inc. v. James, 157 F.3d 1271, 1277 (11th Cir. 1998). We \u201cwill affirm a grant of summary-judgment if it is correct for any reason.\u201d United States v. $121,100.00 in U.S. Currency, 999 F.2d 1503, 1507 (11th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">Boynton first contends that medics Ellison and Cameron treated his medical needs with deliberate indifference in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. To prevail on that claim, he must show (1) an objectively serious medical need; (2) the medics\u2019 deliberate indifference to that need; and (3) that their indifference caused his injuries.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See Gilmore v. Hodges, 738 F.3d 266, 273-74 (11th Cir. 2013). To prove deliberate indifference, Boynton must establish that the medics \u201csubjectively knew of and disregarded the risk of serious harm, and acted with more than mere negligence.\u201d Id. at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">Nothing in the record suggests that the medics knowingly disregarded any risk associated with Boynton\u2019s diabetes. As soon as they tested his blood sugar and found that it was low, they treated him with intravenous dextrose. That was an effective course of treatment, and Boynton finds no fault with it. He appears to argue, however, that the medics might have been able to treat him more quickly if they had not stopped to call for assistance from law enforcement. In some cases, evidence that a defendant delayed medical treatment can support a deliberate indifference claim, \u201cdepend[ing] on the nature of the medical need and the reason for the delay.\u201d Harris v. Coweta Cty., 21 F.3d 388, 393-94 (11th Cir. 1994). This is not one of those eases. The medics began to assess Boynton as soon as they arrived, and they withdrew and called for help only after he physically resisted them. After Norton\u2019s intervention, the medics resumed their efforts right away. Given the circumstances, no reasonable juror could conclude that the medics treated Boynton\u2019s medical needs with indifference, much less deliberate indifference.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Boynton next contends that Norton used excessive force when he repeatedly tased him. \u201cWe analyze a claim of excessive force under the Fourth Amendment\u2019s \u2018objective reasonableness\u2019 standard.\u201d Oliver v. Fiorino, 586 F.3d 898, 905 (11th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). To decide whether the force used was reasonable, we examine \u201c(1) the need for the application of force, (2) the relationship between the need and amount of force used, and (3) the extent of the injury inflicted.\u201d Draper v. Reynolds, 369 F.3d 1270, 1277-78 (11th Cir. 2004) (footnote omitted). The amount of force used must be \u201creasonably proportionate to the need for that force, which is measured by the severity of the crime, the danger to the officer, and the risk of flight.\u201d Id. at 1277 n. 13. We consider the totality of the circumstances from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, not \u201cwith the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u201d Oliver, 586 F.3d at 905 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">When we view the evidence in the light most favorable to Boynton, Norton\u2019s use of force appears to be excessive. He did respond to a call about a \u201ccombative\u201d medical patient, but by the time he arrived Boynton was not combative at all. In fact, he was barely responsive, lying immobile on the floor of the ambulance. When Norton told him to get onto the stretcher, Boynton did not-move, but he also did not struggle or argue when Norton moved him. Norton admits that the only \u201cresistance\u201d he encountered was when Boynton \u201ctensed\u201d his body, making it difficult for him to reposition Boynton on the stretcher. In response, Norton tased Boynton nine times, eight of which were after Boyn-ton had agreed to comply with Norton\u2019s demands. Based on those facts, a reasonable juror could conclude that Norton\u2019s use of force was disproportionate to any threat Boynton posed and was unreasonably excessive under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Norton emphasizes that the police department\u2019s use of force policy allows officers to use a \u201cstun gun\u201d on suspects who exhibit \u201cactive physical resistance,\u201d which is defined to include \u201cbracing or tensing.\u201d Two things about that. First, that policy does not guide our analysis \u2014 the Fourth Amendment does. Second, we do not suggest that \u201ctensing\u201d will never justify the use of a stun gun or taser under any circumstances. We hold only that from the evidence in the record a jury could find Norton\u2019s use of a taser on Boynton nine times was unreasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">Norton contends that he is nonetheless entitled to qualified immunity, which protects government officials acting within their discretionary authority unless they violate a \u201cclearly established\u201d right. Lee v. Ferraro, 284 F.3d 1188, 1193-94 (11th Cir. 2002). The parties agree that Norton was acting within his discretionary authority. To decide whether a right is \u201cclearly established,\u201d we consider whether, based on the law applicable at the time of the alleged violation, it would have been \u201cclear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u201d Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202, 121 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). When this incident occurred in 2010, it would have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In 2009 this Court considered the reasonableness of an officer\u2019s repeated use of a taser on an individual who was not accused of any crime; who did not pose an immediate threat to the officer or others; who was not belligerent or aggressive; and who was not trying to flee or evade arrest. Oliver, 586 F.3d at 906-07, The officer in Oliver deployed her taser \u201cat least eight and as many as eleven or twelve times,\u201d even after the individual was \u201cimmobilized,\u201d \u201climp,\u201d and \u201cwrithing in pain.\u201d Id. at 908. Under those circumstances, we held that the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity because the force used was \u201cso plainly unnecessary and disproportionate that no reasonable officer could have thought that [it] was legal.\u201d Id. In light of Oliver, a reasonable officer in Norton\u2019s position would have known that repeatedly tasing Boynton, who was not argumentative, aggressive, or mobile, was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Norton is not entitled to qualified immunity on Boynton\u2019s excessive force claim at this time.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Finally, Boynton contends that the City is liable for Norton\u2019s use of excessive force. \u201cTo establish the liability of a city or county under section 1983, the plaintiff must show that [his] constitutional deprivation resulted from a custom, policy, or practice of the municipality.\u201d Wideman, 826 F.2d at 1032. Boynton tries to do that in two ways: First, he argues that the police department\u2019s policies condone the use of excessive force. Second, he argues that the police department failed to adequately train Norton. Both arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">In 2010 the Tallahassee police department\u2019s electronic control device policy provided that the \u201cdecision to deploy [a taser] shall involve an arrest or custodial situation during which the [subject] escalates resistance ... from passive physical resistance to active physical resistance and the subject: (1) [h]as the apparent ability to physically threaten the officer or others, or (2) [i]s preparing to, or is attempting to, flee or escape.\u201d The department\u2019s force continuum, in turn, defines \u201cactive physical resistance\u201d as \u201cphysically evasive movements to defeat the officer\u2019s attempt at control,\u201d including \u201cbracing or tensing, attempts to push or pull away, running away, or not allowing the officer to get closer.\u201d When a suspect displays active physical resistance, an officer can \u201cappl[y] a baton, stun gun, or flashlight (used as an impact weapon) to control the suspect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">Boynton first asserts that the department\u2019s use of force policy encourages excessive force because it allows officers to use a taser in response to \u201cbracing or tensing.\u201d As we have said, however, under a different set of facts, resistance like bracing or tensing might justify some limited use of a stun gun or taser. See, e.g., Draper, 369 F.3d at 1277-78 (holding that an officer\u2019s \u201csingle use of [a] taser\u201d to gain control of a \u201chostile, belligerent, and uncooperative\u201d suspect did not violate the Fourth Amendment). Not only that,1 but the policy provides that officers \u201care expected to use only that force reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>necessary to effectively bring a suspect [or] incident under control.\u201d That cannot be interpreted as condoning the repeated tasing of an unresponsive medical patient lying face down on an ambulance stretcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Boynton also points out that the deputy police chief testified that the use of force policy \u201cjust addresses compliance.\u201d From that, Boynton argues that the department instructs its officers to continue applying force until a suspect complies with their orders, which, he says, results in the use of excessive force. But the deputy chief also testified that officers were only allowed to use force to gain compliance \u201csubject to reasonableness.\u201d Authorizing the continued use of reasonable force is not the same as authorizing the use of excessive force. In sum, Boynton has not shown that any department custom,' policy, or practice endorsed or encouraged Norton\u2019s use of excessive force in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Boynton also claims that the Tallahassee police department failed to adequately train Norton in the use of force involving tasers and in identifying medical emergencies like diabetic seizures. To hold a municipality liable under \u00a7 1983 for the failure to train its employees, the plaintiff must \u201cpresent some evidence that the municipality knew of a need to train ... in a particular area and the municipality made a deliberate choice not to take any action.\u201d Gold v. City of Miami, 151 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir. 1998) (quotation marks omitted). Boynton has not provided any \u201cevidence of a history of widespread prior abuse\u201d in the department involving either the use of ta-sers or the identification of medical emergencies that would have put the City \u201con notice of the need for improved training and supervision\u201d in those areas. Id. at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Boynton\u2019s ADA and RA discrimination claims; the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Ellison and Cameron on Boynton\u2019s \u00a7 1983 deliberate indifference claim; and its grant of summary judgment to the City on Boynton\u2019s \u00a7 1983 municipal liability claim. We REVERSE the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Norton on Boynton\u2019s \u00a7 1983 excessive force claim. Because the dismissal of Boynton\u2019s state law claims was predicated on the judgment against him on all federal claims, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s dismissal of those state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-6\">. In its order granting summary judgment to the defendants, the district court prefaced its account of the facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">Mr. Boynton was at a Winn-Dixie when he experienced a hypoglycemic episode that distorted his conduct and triggered an emergency medical response in which he was eventually tased. Unfortunately, Mr. Boynton does not remember much of it. The last thing he remembers before going into hypoglycemic shock is standing in line at the Winn-Dixie. He did not regain consciousness until he was in the back of the ambulance. And so, the details of what happened in between come from the Defendants. This section nonetheless pieces together what Mr. Boynton does remember and construes the evidence in the light most favorable to him,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-13\">Doc. 94 at 2-3 (citations omitted). The parties in their briefs to this Court rely primarily on Norton's recollection of what happened after he arrived. For the purposes of this appeal, we will accept the agreed-upon facts from the parties\u2019 briefs.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b681-14\">. The record does not disclose the total amount of time that elapsed from the first shock through the ninth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\">. Boynton does not appeal the dismissal without prejudice of his state law claims apart from appealing the dismissal of all his claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b682-12\">. Boynton sought both compensatory and punitive damages, but punitive damages are not available in private suits under either statute. See Barnes, 536 U.S. at 189, 122 S.Ct. at 2103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b683-10\">. Boynton must also show that he was in state custody while being treated. See Wideman v. Shallowford Cmty. Hosp., Inc., 826 F.2d 1030, 1034-35 (11th Cir. 1987), The parties dispute that issue, but because his claim fails on other grounds, we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b683-15\">. Boynton also argues that the medics should be held liable for the injuries he suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>when Norton tased him because, he claims, Cameron lied to Norton about Boynton's drug use, which influenced Norton\u2019s decision to tase him. What Cameron actually said is that she thought Boynton might be on illegal drugs. The evidence that Boynton points to would not support a reasonable inference that Cameron did not have a good faith belief that Boynton was on illegal drugs. See Ave. CLO Fund, Ltd. v. Bank of Am., N.A., 723 F.3d 1287, 1294 (11th Cir. 2013) (\u201cAll reasonable inferences arising from the undisputed facts should be made in favor of the nonmovant, but an inference based on speculation and conjecture is not reasonable.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b685-8\">. We note that the \"facts, as accepted at the summary judgment stage of the proceedings, may not be the actual facts of the case.\" ' Oliver, 586 F.3d at 901 (quotation marks omitted). We hold only that the facts presented to us, when viewed in the light most favorable to Boynton, do not support Norton's claim of qualified immunity. The evidence at trial may, of course, prove otherwise. The district court can revisit the qualified immunity issue if it becomes appropriate to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
