In the plea agreement, Villarreal agreed to plead guilty in exchange for the Government\u2019s recommendation that he receive a two-level downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1 for early disposition and that all remaining counts of the indictment be dismissed. The district court declined to apply the \u00a7 5K3.1 downward departure, and denied Villarreal\u2019s post-judgment Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 motion for correction of sentence. Villarreal now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">Villarreal first contends that the district court abused its discretion by rejecting the Government\u2019s, recommendation that he receive the \u00a7 5K3.1. downward departure. However, we have \u201cjurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward from the guideline[s] range only if the district court based its decision upon an erroneous belief that it lacked the authority to depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Alaniz, </em>726 F.3d 586, 627 (5th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Tuma, </em>738 F.3d 681, 691 (5th Cir. 2013) (stating that this \u201crule applies to departures found in both Chapter 5, Part K of the Guidelines and in the commentary to the Guidelines\u201d). Villarreal has not demonstrated, that the district court held such an erroneous belief. Nothing in the record indicates that the district court did not believe it had the authority to depart; rather, the record indicates that district court recognized that it could depart downward pursuant to \u00a7 5K3.1 and listened to the Government\u2019s reasons for recommending the departure, but concluded that a downward departure was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>appropriate under the facts of the case. Because we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of the'\u00a7 5K3.1 downward departure, the appeal is DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Villarreals second argument is that the district court abused its discretion when denying his Rule 85 motion. We will reverse a Rule 35- decision \u201conly for illegality or a gross abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Nerren, </em>613 F.2d 572, 573 (5th Cir. 1980). According to Villarreal, the district court failed to comply with the requirement in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(5) that it give him an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea after the district court denied the \u00a7 5K3.1 downward departure. However, the record does not support this contention; rather, it is clear from the available portions of the record<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the plea agreement, under which the Government agreed only to recommend that the \u00a7 5K3.1 downward departure apply, is a Rule 11(c)(1)(B), not a Rule 11(c)(1)(C), agreement. Unlike a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, a Rule 11(c)(1)(B) recommendation does not bind the district court and does not require the district court to give the defendant an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea if the recommendation is rejected. <em>See </em>Fed. R. CRiM. P. 11(c)(1)(B), (C), (c)(5). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Villarreal\u2019s Rule 35 motion was not a gross abuse of discretion. <em>See Nerren, </em>613 F.2d at 573. The judgment is AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b225-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
