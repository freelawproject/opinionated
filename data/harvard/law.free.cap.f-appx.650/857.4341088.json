Latham appeals the denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) motion to reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>his 285-month sentence for possession of powder cocaine with intent to distribute. Latham contends that comments made by the district court during an unrelated \u00a7 3582(c) hearing three weeks after the denial of his motion demonstrate, in retrospect, that it failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in denying him relief. <em>See United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir. 2011). Finding no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion, we affirm. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1009 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Both in its written order and in a separate statement of reasons, the district court expressly cited \u00a7 3553(a) as the basis for its decision not to grant Latham a sentence reduction. <em>See Larry, </em>632 F.3d at 936. Latham argues, however, that any assumption that the district court contemporaneously considered \u00a7 3553(a) is rebutted by its subsequent comments, in which the court failed to recall having previously denied Latham\u2019s motion and noted the divergence between its treatment of his motion and its normal \u00a7 3582(c) protocol. <em>See generally United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir. 2009). This argument fails for two reasons. First, the district court\u2019s consideration of \u00a7 3553(a) in this case is not merely implicit but, rather, is explicitly documented. Second, the events of the subsequent \u00a7 3582(c) hearing are irrelevant to our review because they \u201cwere not before the district court at the time of the challenged ruling.\u201d <em>Theriot v. Par. of Jefferson, </em>185 F.3d 477, 491 n. 26 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Because the record reflects the district court\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 3553(a) to deny La-tham\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b881-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R, 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
