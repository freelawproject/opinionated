During the trial, Grandison moved to suppress the evidence. The trial court denied the motion, finding that the cocaine had been legally seized under the \"plain view doctrine.\" Thereafter, the trial court sentenced Grandison to imprisonment for ten years, with eight years suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    Grandison v.

We awarded Grandison this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 25, 2003, about 4:56 a.m., Officer Matthew P. Gilstrap of the Petersburg City Police Department was called to assist another officer in a traffic stop of a vehicle that had been reported stolen. The vehicle was stopped in a \"high crime area\" of downtown Petersburg that was known for drug activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Gilstrap approached the passenger side of the vehicle and directed Grandison, the front seat passenger, to step out of the vehicle. When Grandison exited the vehicle, Officer Gilstrap immediately handcuffed Grandison because the officer was concerned for his own safety considering the time and circumstances of the detention. Officer Gilstrap then conducted a pat-down search of Grandison's outer clothing for weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the pat-down search, Officer Gilstrap felt a hard object in the front watch pocket of Grandison's jeans. The object was a cigarette lighter. When the officer looked down at the lighter, he observed a piece of drinking straw and a folded one-dollar bill protruding from the pocket.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   The dollar bill was protruding halfway out of the pocket and was folded in what Officer Gilstrap recognized as an \"apothecary fold.\" The officer testified that, when he saw the bill's apothecary fold, he immediately recognized it as a way of packaging cocaine. Thereupon, Officer Gilstrap pulled the folded bill out of Grandison's pocket and opened it. Inside the bill, the officer discovered a substance that, from a subsequent laboratory analysis, proved to be cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Officer Gilstrap was familiar with the packaging and storage of drugs from his training and experience as a police officer. Consequently, the trial court qualified him as an expert in the packaging of drugs. Officer Gilstrap stated that an apothecary fold is a method commonly used to conceal and carry contraband. He explained that an apothecary fold results when a dollar bill \"is folded three times lengthwise with the material, whatever it is that you're trying to hide on the inside, and then the two ends are folded over toward the middle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

As with the canister in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   and the hand-rolled cigarette in\n   <em>\n    Brown,\n   </em>\n   the folded dollar bill was legal material with a legitimate purpose, even though Officer Gilstrap, based on his experience, knew that dollar bills folded in a similar manner are often used as containers for drugs.

In my view, neither\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   is applicable to the case at bar, and the police officer's search did not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.

That factual predicate was simply absent in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brown,\n   </em>\n   as there was no evidence the otherwise legitimate objects of a film canister and a cigarette had been manipulated in any way. Thus, the film canister and cigarette could not form the basis of probable cause. In contrast, like the items in\n   <em>\n    Texas, Arnold\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Carson,\n   </em>\n   Grandison's dollar bill, creased in an apothecary fold and found in plain view, was a proper basis for probable cause to search by virtue of the manipulation of an otherwise lawful object for an illegitimate purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In affirming Grandison's conviction, the Court of Appeals effectively synthesized these cases and applied them to the facts of this case:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It is clear that the determinative, distinguishing factor in each of these cases was the observed nature of the item seized by the police. Although often used for illegitimate purposes, the items seized in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   - the film canister and hand-rolled cigarette, respectively - were \"facially innocent vessel[s] of a type employed by law-abiding citizens, on a daily basis, for legitimate uses.\" [\n   <em>\n    Ruffin v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4402575\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/13/206/#p209\">\n    13 Va.App. 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=409%20S.E.2d%20177\">\n    409 S.E.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 179 (1991)]. Because there was nothing in those cases that made it immediately apparent to the officer that the items observed in plain view were being used illegitimately, probable cause did not exist to believe they contained contraband. Conversely, the items seized and searched in\n   <em>\n    Carson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Arnold\n   </em>\n   were items legitimately used by law-abiding citizens on a daily basis that had been noticeably manipulated in a manner that was consistent with illegitimate usage. The size of the cut-off straw in\n   <em>\n    Carson\n   </em>\n   led the officer, based on his experience and training, to suspect it was used for snorting cocaine. The shopping bag in\n   <em>\n    Arnold\n   </em>\n   was folded in a manner that led the officer, based on his experience, to suspect it had been lined with aluminum foil for shoplifting purposes. Because the items had been manipulated in a way that made it immediately apparent to the officers that they may contain contraband, the officers had probable cause to seize and search them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Here, like the cut-off straw in\n   <em>\n    Carson\n   </em>\n   and the foil-lined shopping bag in\n   <em>\n    Arnold,\n   </em>\n   the dollar bill seized and searched by Officer Gilstrap was an item legitimately used by law-abiding citizens on a daily basis that had been manipulated in a manner consistent with illegitimate usage. Qualified as an expert in drug packaging, Officer Gilstrap indicated at trial that the distinctive manner in which the dollar bill he saw protruding from appellant's watch pocket had been folded led him to immediately suspect, based on his training and experience, that it contained contraband. The bill, he explained, was manipulated into an \"apothecary fold,\" which involves a series of systematic folds and is a common method for concealing and carrying contraband. Thus, the unique manner in which the bill was manipulated \"distinguishes it from [bills] one would usually encounter for legitimate purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Carson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4401433\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/12/497/\">\n    12 Va.

Hence, unlike the film canister in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   and the hand-rolled cigarette in\n   <em>\n    Brown v.
