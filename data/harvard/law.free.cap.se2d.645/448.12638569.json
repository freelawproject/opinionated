STEVEN AGEE.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this appeal, we consider the capital murder convictions and death sentences imposed upon Ricky Javon Gray\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond. A grand jury indicted Gray on five counts of capital murder arising from the murders of Bryan Harvey, Kathryn Harvey, Stella Harvey and Ruby Harvey, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-31(4), (7), (8), and (12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the first stage of a bifurcated trial conducted under Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3, a jury convicted Gray of the following offenses: capital murder of Bryan Harvey in the commission of robbery or attempted robbery under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(4); capital murder of Bryan Harvey, Kathryn Harvey, Stella Harvey and Ruby Harvey as part of the same transaction under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(7); capital murder of Bryan Harvey, Kathryn Harvey, Stella Harvey and Ruby Harvey within a three-year period under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(8); capital murder of four year old Ruby Harvey while Gray was twenty-one years of age or older under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12); and capital murder of nine year old Stella Harvey while Gray was twenty-one years of age or older under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the separate penalty phase of the trial, the jury found the aggravating factor of vileness and fixed Gray's sentence at death for each of the two convictions under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12) and life imprisonment for the remaining capital murder convictions. After reviewing the post-sentence report required by Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5, the circuit court sentenced Gray in accordance with the jury's verdicts and entered final judgment. We review the circuit court's judgment and death sentences pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-313(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After consideration of Gray's assignments of error, the record, and the arguments of counsel, we find no error in the judgment of the circuit court and will affirm that judgment, including the sentences of death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under well-settled principles of appellate review, we consider the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party in the circuit court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Juniper v.

GUILT PHASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the morning of January 1, 2006, Kathryn and Bryan Harvey and their two daughters, Stella and Ruby, were killed in the Harveys' home in the City of Richmond. Firefighters, responding to a call that the Harveys' home was burning, discovered the bodies of Kathryn and Ruby in the basement as they attempted to fight the fire. The house was filled with \"black smoke\" and the basement was burning and had \"[z]ero visibility and a lot of heat.\" Soon after the firefighters removed the bodies of Kathryn and Ruby from the basement, they determined that the bodies showed evidence of \"battle signs\" and that the victims' legs had been bound. At that point the firefighters stopped their rescue efforts and summoned the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Detective Dwyer of the Richmond Police Department then discovered Stella in the basement under a futon \"with her hands behind her back, tape around her mouth.\" Bryan was discovered on the floor of the basement with orange electrical cord wrapped around his wrists and feet, with \"melted tape around his face [and a] large wound to his neck area.\" Detective Dwyer also found two claw hammers, two broken wine bottles, a knife handle and a separate knife blade in the basement. Those items, as well as several photographs of the scene, were admitted into evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   An autopsy revealed that Bryan had been cut eight times in his neck and underneath his chin, and those wounds, although \"[v]ery painful,\" were not immediately fatal. His mouth had been gagged and taped. Six lacerations were made to the left side and back of Bryan's skull, each caused by blows from a hammer. He experienced severe third degree burns to his skin. Bryan died from the wounds to his skull.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Kathryn had been cut three times in her neck and chest, once in her back, and those wounds caused bleeding and pain but were not fatal. Multiple lacerations were made to Kathryn's skull as a result of blows from a hammer. The hammer blows caused a fracture to the plate above Kathryn's eyes, resulting in bleeding behind her eyes. Kathryn died from the blunt force injuries to her head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ruby's throat had been sliced through to her trachea, a wound that was not fatal but obstructed her breathing. Her head was also fractured and cut, causing brain tissue to exude from her skull. She had also been stabbed in the back with enough force that the knife had passed through her ribs and into her lungs. Ruby died from the blunt force injuries to her head and the stab injury to her lungs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Stella's neck had been cut six times, with the stab wounds having penetrated her trachea and esophagus. Stella's head was also bludgeoned by a hammer, causing brain tissue to exude from her skull. She died from a combination of smoke inhalation, carbon monoxide poisoning and blunt force injury to her head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Forensic evidence showed that the knife blade recovered from the Harveys' home had\n   traces of blood from Kathryn, Stella, Ruby and Bryan. Bryan and Stella's DNA was discovered on the shaft of one of the recovered hammers. Kathryn's DNA was identified on the handle of the other hammer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Evidence at trial established that Gray, Ray Dandridge and Ashley Baskerville were driving the streets of Richmond in Gray's van during the mid-morning of January 1, 2006 \"looking for a house to rob.\" Gray and Dandridge \"spotted a door open\" at the Harveys' home, entered the house, and forced Kathryn, Bryan and Ruby into the basement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stella was not home when Gray and Dandridge entered. In the basement, Gray assured the three family members that he and Dandridge would leave after they took what they wanted from the home. Gray then used electrical cords to tie Bryan's wrists behind his back and bind his ankles together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before Gray and Dandridge could plunder the house, they heard a noise upstairs on the home's main level. Kiersten Perkinson, a family friend, had arrived at the Harveys' home to deliver the Harveys' daughter, Stella, along with Perkinson's own daughter, Grace Lynn, from a slumber party the previous evening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Hearing the commotion, Kathryn explained to Gray that her daughter had returned from a slumber party, so Gray permitted Kathryn to go upstairs to bring her daughter downstairs to the basement. Perkinson heard Kathryn \"running up the stairs\" from the basement, and upon reaching the top of the basement stairs, she appeared \"pale and ashen.\" Stella ran past her mother and down the stairs into the basement, but Kathryn blocked Grace Lynn's path so she could not follow Stella downstairs. Kathryn told Perkinson that she did not feel well, so Perkinson and Grace Lynn left the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Downstairs, Gray bound the hands and feet of all the Harveys and placed clear packing tape over their mouths, but he assured them that everything would be okay. Gray and Dandridge then began collecting the items from the home they intended to steal. Kathryn attempted to comfort her distraught daughters, and she told Gray that he should take what he wanted and just leave. Suddenly, Gray took a razor knife and cut Kathryn's throat and then cut the throats of the young girls and Bryan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Gray saw that his victims were still moving, he took a nearby claw hammer and began repeatedly beating each of the Harveys in the head. When they stopped moving, Gray poured two bottles of wine on an easel in the basement and lit a match, starting the fire. Gray and Dandridge then left the burning home with the items they had stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   John Hott, a family friend of the Harveys, arrived at the Harveys' home for a New Year's Day party at about 1:45 p.m. and noticed smoke coming from the house. He immediately ran to a neighbor's home and called \"911\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Less than a week later, Richmond police received a tip that Gray was a suspect in the murders, and a member of the Richmond Police Department contacted the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Police Department requesting they investigate a location where Gray may be staying and to be on the lookout for a particular vehicle believed related to the Harvey murders. In the early morning hours of January 7, 2006, Philadelphia police obtained a search warrant, and a SWAT team entered the location where Gray was suspected to be staying and found him in the basement. Gray was arrested and advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. After learning that Dandridge was also being questioned, he asked the Philadelphia police: \"Can I tell you my side of the story?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As part of a signed confession, Gray described in detail how he and Dandridge entered the Harveys' home and attacked the Harveys, in which he stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [I]t was a real nasty scene. How am I suppose[d] to explain something like what happened? I started cutting their throats\n   and they kept getting up and they [were] scaring me. I remember seeing the hammer and picking it up, and then . . . I was just hitting them all with the hammer. All I know is nobody was moving when I left out there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Gray admitted that Dandridge spent most of this time searching the home for items to steal, and that only Gray used the hammers to attack the Harveys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Gray stipulated at trial that Bryan's wedding ring, as well as a cookie plate and a basket from the Harveys' home, were discovered in a location Gray provided to police, who also recovered from Gray a computer stolen from the Harveys' home. Gray also stipulated that the boots found at the residence in Philadelphia belonged to him. Bryan and Stella's blood stains were discovered on Gray's boots. The Commonwealth also introduced photographs of the dead bodies as exhibits during the trial, and the jury was permitted to view these exhibits. At the time of the murders, Gray was twenty-eight years old. Ruby was four years old at the time of her death, and Stella was nine years old at the time of her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The jurors returned a verdict of guilty as to all five capital murder counts as charged in the indictments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B. PENALTY PHASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the sentencing phase, the Commonwealth introduced evidence of Gray's criminal record, including convictions for robbery in 1996, distribution of crack cocaine in 2000, and possession of cocaine in 2002. Extensive evidence was also presented to show a history of violent acts perpetrated by Gray.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Lieutenant Daniel Stanek of the City of Washington, Pennsylvania, Police Department testified about the discovery of the dead body of Gray's wife, Treva, on November 5, 2005. Gray was questioned at the time but was not arrested for her murder. After his arrest for the murders of the Harveys in January 2006, Gray also confessed to killing his wife with the help of Dandridge by bludgeoning her to death with a lead pipe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Detective William Brerton of the Richmond Police Department described how, also on January 1, 2006, he learned of another set of murders committed in Richmond. Executing a search warrant, police discovered the dead bodies of Percyell Tucker, his wife, Mary, and Mary's daughter, Ashley Baskerville\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   , all in their home. Dr. Darin Trelka, a medical examiner, testified that the autopsy revealed Percyell's head had been \"covered with Saran Wrap,\" with a sock stuffed into his mouth and duct-taped shut. Percyell probably struggled for several minutes before he died from suffocation. Mary's mouth had been gagged, with duct tape over her eyes. Her neck and chest had been cut four times. Mary struggled several minutes before she died from suffocation. Ashley was found with a plastic shopping bag over her head and taped to her neck with duct tape. Her face was wrapped in duct tape and a sock stuffed into her mouth. Ashley also struggled for several minutes before she died from suffocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Gray's vehicle was discovered three blocks from the Tucker's home, and the Tucker's stolen vehicle was located in Philadelphia where Gray was arrested. Gray confessed to murdering the Tucker family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Police also learned that Gray assaulted a man in Arlington, Virginia on New Year's Eve, 2005. At the sentencing phase of Gray's trial, Ryan Carey testified that as he arrived at his parent's home after work on December 31, he was attacked by two men. He was forced to the ground and stabbed multiple times. Carey escaped the assault and rushed to his father's home covered in blood. Carey's father contacted emergency personnel, who took Carey to a hospital where his condition was stabilized. After two months of hospitalization, Carey was able to return home, although he lost the use of his right arm. Gray confessed to assaulting Carey with Dandridge's assistance and\n   stipulated that Carey's blood was found on Gray's boots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Also testifying at the penalty phase of the trial were Mark Harvey, Bryan's older brother, and Steven Culp, Kathryn's older brother. Each described a loving relationship with their sibling and the devastating grief and emotional impact of the murders upon the extended families.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Gray offered evidence in mitigation including his mother's testimony describing his childhood and home life. Gray's mother, Barbara Moten, described how she established a connection between Gray and his natural father, Ellsworth, when Gray was a baby.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moten later married Ellsworth and moved with him to Maryland, along with their two children and two of Ellsworth's children from another relationship. In school, Gray struggled to learn to read, was hyper and disruptive in the classroom, and he received spankings with a \"horse strap\" from Ellsworth when the school reported Gray was disruptive in class. Moten also told of how Gray \"wet himself\" most nights until he was thirteen years old, resulting in beatings from Ellsworth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Moten also described instances of sexual abuse of two of the children by a friend of Ellsworth, although she maintained that Gray was not a victim of these encounters. Gray was routinely blamed by his siblings for things that happened in the house, resulting in beatings from Ellsworth. Moten told of how she joined the Army and worked in Arlington, Virginia as a chaplain's assistant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Army transferred Moten for a year to the State of Washington, but Gray remained in Maryland with his father and stepbrother. During that time, Ellsworth became a cocaine addict. Upon her return from Washington, Moten also learned that Ellsworth's son, Fitzgerald, had been sexually abusing Gray, although Gray had refused to talk about the abuse with his mother. Later, Ellsworth was arrested and jailed on drug charges. Moten then moved the family to Pennsylvania for a new start. Gray left the home when he was seventeen years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Gray's sister, Ava, also testified about repeated instances of sexual abuse upon her and Gray by Fitzgerald. She also described Gray being victimized by Fitzgerald when he was only four years old, and that such experiences were \"a regular thing\" over the course of seven years. She also testified that Gray started to use drugs when he was thirteen years old and was a user of marijuana, cocaine and PCP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Also presented as mitigation evidence was the videotaped deposition of Dr. David Lisak, a psychologist and expert on the impact of child abuse and the relationship between earlier trauma and the perpetration of violence. Dr. Lisak offered his opinion on the general effects of early childhood abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Gray also presented the opinion of Dr. Mark D. Cunningham, a clinical and forensic psychologist, who opined that Gray was \"likely to make a positive adjustment to prison or an adjustment that is free of serious violence.\" Dr. Cunningham's conclusions were based, in part, on the fact that Gray was nearly thirty years old and that \"his likelihood of getting in trouble in prison is only about half as much as when he was 18 or 20 years old, and continues to fall steadily across the life span.\" Dr. Cunningham noted Gray's history of incarceration and how Gray had avoided violent encounters in prison, how Gray had used his prison time to earn a GED, and how Gray had earned additional education, including courses on sheet metal, business and electrical work. Dr. Cunningham also concluded that \"the seriousness of the offense does not predict violence in prison\" and that \"[c]apital inmates who get sentenced to life or in the general prison population have low rates of violence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In response to Gray's mitigation evidence, the Commonwealth produced the testimony of Officer James Jonas of the Philadelphia Police Department, who testified about the search and arrest of Gray on January 7, 2006. Officer Jonas explained that during the execution of the warrant to arrest Gray, he discovered Gray hiding in an unlit basement, crouched behind a water heater. Officer Jones described how Gray had smirked at him when asked to show his hands, and\n   that Gray had refused to show one of his hands, which Officer Jones identified as a potentially threatening gesture. Officer Jones explained how in the attempt to secure Gray, Gray punched him and resisted arrest. Gray also assaulted Officer Jones' partner and attempted to grab the officer's gun. After multiple punches were exchanged, the officers were eventually able to secure and handcuff Gray.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Gray presents four assignments of error on appeal. First, he avers that the sentences of death were imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice and other arbitrary factors. His second assignment of error contends that the sentences of death are excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. Next, Gray asserts that the circuit court erred by failing to declare Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12) unconstitutional as violating his right to equal protection under the law. Finally, Gray contends that the Virginia death penalty statutes otherwise violate the Virginia and United States Constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Gray's first two assignments of error \"track nearly\n   <em>\n    verbatim\n   </em>\n   the mandatory review of a sentence of death which this Court must undertake under Code \u00a7 17.1-313(C)(1) and (2).\"\n   <em>\n    Juniper,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=271%20Va.%20362\">\n    271 Va. at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12635172\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/626/383/#p393\">\n    626 S.E.2d at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Based on this review, we conclude that Gray's sentences of death were not excessive or disproportionate to the sentences of death imposed by other sentencing bodies in comparable cases with comparable defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   B. Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12) and the Equal Protection Clause\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12) provides that capital murder includes \"[t]he willful, deliberate and premeditated killing of a person under the age of fourteen by a person age twenty-one or older.\" Gray assigns error to the circuit court's ruling that this statute does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Gray contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12) exposes some murderers to the death penalty while protecting other similarly situated offenders from that penalty. This is so, Gray argues, because if a twenty year old defendant murdered the Harvey children, that person would not be eligible for a sentence of death under subsection (12). By contrast, Gray is eligible for the death penalty because he was twenty-one years of age or older when he killed the Harvey children. Gray argues that this disparate treatment under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12) deprives him of a fundamental right to life and liberty and that Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12) thus requires strict scrutiny review in an equal protection context. He concludes that the Commonwealth failed to assert a compelling state interest under\n   strict scrutiny review to justify the varying treatment of defendants under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12). In the alternative, Gray contends the statute does not meet rational basis scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Commonwealth initially responds that Gray waived his argument that strict scrutiny applies to his equal protection claim because the circuit court ruled only on a rational basis standard, and Gray did not ask the court to rule under any other standard. The Commonwealth also contends that a rational basis standard is the correct standard because the legislative classification in Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12) does not burden a suspect class or interfere with a fundamental right. The Commonwealth asserts that under a rational basis review, Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12) does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Commonwealth's contention that Gray waived his right to argue a strict scrutiny standard on appeal is incorrect. Gray raised the argument that Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12) was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause in a pre-trial motion to dismiss and \"declare Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12) unconstitutional.\" In support of that motion, Gray filed a memorandum of law in the circuit court in which he argued \"classifications that attach to the implementation of the death penalty should also be subject to strict scrutiny\" and that \"the Commonwealth must have a compelling interest to justify its age-based classification.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The circuit court conducted a pre-trial hearing on the motion to dismiss, but Gray did not argue at the hearing that a strict scrutiny standard applied. The circuit court ruled at the hearing that Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12) \"is not unconstitutional and there was a rational basis for delineating that distinction,\" thus implicitly rejecting Gray's strict scrutiny argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Gray's memorandum requesting strict scrutiny analysis was before the circuit court and was sufficient to preserve the argument for appeal. Code \u00a7 8.01-384(A);\n   <em>\n    see also Luckett v. Jennings,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2088396\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/246/303/#p306\">\n    246 Va. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 306,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20S.E.2d%20400\">\n    435 S.E.2d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 401 (1993).

First, by covering only those offenders age twenty-one or older, the application of the death penalty would be limited to those defendants who \"by their very age [are] held to be more responsible for their actions.\" Second, the Commonwealth also advanced as a rational basis that \"the legislature has legitimately limited the death penalty to those defendants who have a decreased peer relationship with the child victim and thus an increased predatory relationship.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   While there may be other grounds upon which Code \u00a7 18.2-31(12) could be found to foster a legitimate governmental purpose and would meet a rational basis standard, Gray has failed to show that the foregoing grounds advanced by the Commonwealth do not meet the rational basis requirement.

For example, Code \u00a7 18.2-63 distinguishes between a sixteen year old defendant who has carnal knowledge of a thirteen year old victim (a Class 6 felony) and a sixteen year old defendant who has carnal knowledge of a fourteen year old victim (a Class 4 misdemeanor), all depending on whether a gap of three years or more exists between the age of the victim and the defendant. Similarly, the enhanced penalty under Code \u00a7 18.2-255 for a defendant convicted of drug distribution to a child applies if a twenty-one year old distributes to a sixteen year old, but does not apply if an eighteen year old distributes the same drugs to the same sixteen year old. Although both defendants in the foregoing example are adults, there is a rational basis for the legislative distinction of penalties for the same criminal act both because the older defendant could be deemed more responsible for his actions by virtue of his age and because of the decreased peer relationship with the child victim: the same grounds tendered by the Commonwealth in the case at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Other Virginia statutes provide rationally based distinctions between similarly situated adults. A twenty-one year old commits no crime by purchasing an alcoholic beverage, but a twenty year old commits a class one misdemeanor if that individual makes such a purchase. Code \u00a7 4.1-305. A person twenty-one years or older does not commit a crime solely on the basis of operating a motor vehicle or personal watercraft after consuming alcohol. Code \u00a7 18.2-266.1 and Code \u00a7 29.1-738.02.

Gray also failed to offer an additional instruction on vileness to the circuit court, which Gray conceded during oral argument before this Court.
