Harris was convicted in 2008 in the Eastern District of Wisconsin for possession with intent to distribute 500 grams of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Because he had two prior felony drug convictions \u2014 one from Arkansas and one from Washington state \u2014 the District Court sentenced him to the mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). He appealed, arguing that the district court erroneously admitted evidence and that the evidence presented was insufficient to support his conviction. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>585 F.3d 394, 396 (7th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>559 U.S. 1100, 130 S.Ct. 2390, 176 L.Ed.2d 781 (2010). Finding no reversible error,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment of conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-8\">In May 2010, Harris filed a motion iii the Eastern District of Wisconsin to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Harris v. Drew, </em>No. 1:12-CV-3580-RWS, 2013 WL 2418389, at *1 (N.D.Ga. May 31, 2013). He argued that his sentence was improper because the Arkansas drug conviction used to enhance his sentence was no longer valid. The court rejected this argument, noting that the unchallenged Washington state drug conviction was independently \u201csufficient to trigger the mandatory minimum.\u201d Harris additionally raised arguments regarding ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The court, however, found these arguments to be meritless. Accordingly, the court both denied him relief under \u00a7 2255 and a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). The Seventh Circuit also denied him a COA, thus concluding his first efforts at relief under \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-13\">Eventually, Harris was transferred from the Eastern District of Wisconsin to United States Penitentiary Atlanta in the Northern District of Georgia. On August 22, 2013, Harris filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Northern District of Georgia<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging that he was factually and actually innocent of his \u00a7 841(a) conviction. Harris stated that his conviction resulted from collusion between the trial judge, two Wisconsin police departments, a government informant, and his attorneys, among others. To support these claims of Fifth and Sixth Amendment violations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Harris presented newly discovered evidence that the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>mony offered against Harris at trial \u201cwas known perjury, suborned by the United States Attorney and the District Judge.\u201d In addition to this evidence, he explained that the individuals who colluded to secure his conviction would all testify to their actions (and Harris\u2019s innocence) should there be an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-5\">Harris proposed two bases on which the court could grant his petition. First, he argues that a freestanding claim of actual innocence entitled him to relief. <em>See Herrera v. Collins, </em>506 U.S. 390, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993). Second, if actual innocence alone were insufficient to grant the writ, he argues that such proof would nonetheless suffice to permit the court to consider his constitutional claims. <em>See Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-6\">The District Court considered neither argument. Instead, it dismissed his petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Specifically, the court noted that Harris was \u201cnot eligible to proceed under \u00a7 2241 because he does not meet the requirements for invoking the savings clause under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).\u201d This was because Harris\u2019s claims \u201cf[e]ll within the scope of \u00a7 2255(h)(1).\u201d Accordingly, it was beyond peradventure that a \u00a7 2255 motion was not \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,\u201d as required to invoke the savings clause under 2255(e). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-8\">Harris now appeals. He asserts that the District Court misunderstood the \u201cdifference between a AEDPA <em>substantive </em>claim of actual innocence ... made pursuant to 28 U.S.C.' \u00a7 2255(h)(1),\u201d and a <em>\u201cSchlup </em>Protocol gateway claim of actual innocence of the offense of conviction <em>procedural </em>claim of actual innocence.\u201d As a result, the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-10\">erred as. a matter of law in applying the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h) <em>substantive </em>\u201cclear and convincing\u2019 \u201d standard of review rather than the <em>procedural </em>\u201cmore likely than not\u201d probabilistic assessment standard of review to the \u201cnew evidence\u201d in regard to a <em>Schlup </em>gateway claim of actual innocence of the offense of conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1337-11\">Pet. Br. 3. Had the District Court understood Harris\u2019s <em>Schlup </em>claim, it would have first determined whether \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d in light of newly presented evidence, <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 327, 115 S.Ct. at 867, and, having found that Harris\u2019s new evidence satisfied this burden, would have then reached Harris\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Amendment claims on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-13\">\u201cWhether a prisoner may bring a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) is a question of law we review <em>de novo.\u201d Bryant v. Warden, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Williams v. Warden, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir.2013)). We lack jurisdiction to consider \u00a7 2241 petitions unless a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the petitioner\u2019s] detention.\u201d <em>See Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1338; 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). And, as we pronounced in our most recent savings clause ease, \u201c[t]he petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that the \u00a7 2255 remedy was \u2018inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 2255(e).\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1262; <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1349-50 (dismissing Williams\u2019 petition after concluding that he had not demonstrated that a \u00a7 2255 motion would be inadequate or in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>effective to test the legality of his detention).</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">Petitioner Harris cannot shoulder this burden. It is axiomatic that claims cognizable under \u00a7 2255 cannot be brought under \u00a7 2241. The savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) permits a \u00a7 2241 petition only if a prisoner\u2019s original \u00a7 2255 motion was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Harris was convicted of possession with intent to distribute .500 or more grams of cocaine. He now claims that he is factually and actually innocent of that offense. He maintains that his conviction resulted from collusion between the trial judge, two Wisconsin police departments, a government informant, and his attorneys, among others. Were it not for that collusion, the trial court would not have admitted certain evidence. And were that evidence suppressed, there would have been insufficient evidence to sustain Harris\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In other words, but for violations of Harris\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to the due process of law \u2014 in this case, the right to a fair and impartial judge \u2014 and Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel, Harris would be a free man.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-5\">In other words, Harris alleges that his \u201csentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 2255(a). That Harris already filed a \u00a7 2255 motion is no matter. Although courts generally do not entertain second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions, <em>see id. </em>at \u00a7 2244(a), they may consider the merits of such motions if the movant presents \u201cnewly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 2255(h)(1). Here, Harris did the just that: he has produced a letter from the Greenfield, Wisconsin police department that he believes can help prove that \u201call testimony based on the bogus and fabricated cocaine and traffic stop was known perjury, suborned by the United States Attorney and the District Judge at trial.\u201d Accordingly, upon certification by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, a District Court could evaluate Harris\u2019s claims on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-9\">Harris\u2019s claim thus falls squarely within \u00a7 2255\u2019s ambit. Regardless of whether the Seventh Circuit will actually certify a successive \u00a7 2255 motion based upon the above facts and legal theories, \u00a7 2255 is adequate to test the legality of Harris\u2019 sentence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Gilbert v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325-1335\">*1325-1335</page-number>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc) (noting that \u201c[t]he existence of the statutory bar on second and successive motions cannot mean that \u00a7 2255 is \u2018inadequate or ineffective\u2019 to test the legality of [a petitioner]^ detention within the meaning of the savings clause\u201d). Accordingly, \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-5\">The District Court committed no error when it dismissed Harris\u2019s petition after determining that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to consider Harris\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1336-9\">. The Seventh Circuit found one error below: the district court failed to make explicit findings concerning the admissibility of a cocon-spirator's statement prior to the introduction of that statement at trial. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>585 F.3d 394, 400 (7th Cir.2009). Nonetheless, the Seventh Circuit held that this was not reversible error, and that, regardless, the district court\u2019s decision to admit the hearsay was correct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1336-10\">. Afterwards, Harris filed four additional \u00a7 2255 motions. All were dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1336-11\">. This was Harris\u2019s third \u00a7 2241 petition. The District Court dismissed the first two after determining that. Harris's claims did not fit within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause and that the District Court therefore lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to entertain either petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1336-15\">.Harris\u2019s claim of collusion implicates at least two constitutional rights. First, the facts recount a violation of Harris\u2019s Fifth Amendment due process right to an impartial judge. <em>See, e.g., In re Murchison, </em>349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S.Ct. 623, 625, 99 L.Ed. 942 (1955). Second, the facts recount a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance-of counsel. <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). What other claims Harris might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>raise under these facts is irrelevant to the disposition of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1338-6\">. Harris strenuously disputes that his claims are cognizable under \u00a7 2255(h)(1). In his brief, he states that \u00a7 2251(h)(1) concerns \"substantive claim[s] 'based on\u2019 newly-discovered evidence,\u201d while his claim \u2014 a <em>\"Schlup </em>Protocol <em>procedural </em>claim of actual innocence\u201d' \u2014 is a \"procedural claim 'based on' on [sic] <em>constitutional </em>errors.\u201d Harris misunderstands both \u00a7 2255 and <em>Schlup.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1338-7\">Section 2255(h)(1) is not an invitation to file freestanding claims of actual innocence; indeed, \"our precedent forbids granting habe-as relief based upon a claim of actual innocence, anyway, at least in non-capital cases.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Sec'y Dep't of Corr., </em>485 F.3d 1351, 1356 (11th Cir.2007). A \u00a7 2255(h)(1) showing serves only to allow courts to consider the merits of a petitioner's constitutional claims. And, contrary to Harris\u2019 understanding, \u00a7 2255 encompasses \"procedural claim[s] 'based on\u2019 [sic] <em>constitutional errors.\" See, e.g., United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a \u00a7 2255 motion may be used to enforce plea agreements because the government violates due process when it reneges on such agreements); <em>In re Perez, </em>682 F.3d 930, 932 (11th Cir.2012) (considering a Sixth Amendment ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim under \u00a7 2255's rubric).</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-11\">For its part, the <em>Schlup </em>rule serves only to allow courts, upon a showing of actual innocence, to consider constitutional claims that would otherwise. be procedurally defaulted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325-1335\">*1325-1335</page-number><em>See McQuiggin v. </em>Perkins,-U.S.-,-, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 1928, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013). There is no procedural barrier preventing a court from considering Harris\u2019s constitutional claims on the merits. Furthermore, in the federal habeas context, the <em>Schlup </em>rule only applies to initial \u00a7 2255 petitions. <em>See id. </em>at 1933-34. AEDPA\u2019s strictures govern second and successive \u00a7 2255 petitions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
