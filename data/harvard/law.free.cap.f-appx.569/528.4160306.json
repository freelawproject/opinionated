We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Smith v. Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist., </em>727 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir.2013), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Johnson\u2019s disability discrimination claim because Johnson failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the City terminated him because of \u00e1 perceived disability. <em>See id. </em>at 955 (elements of prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA). Moreover, even assuming that Johnson raised a triable dispute as to the prima facie case, Johnson failed to raise a triable dispute as to whether the City\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating his employment was pretextual. <em>See Snead v. Metro. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>237 F.3d 1080, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2001) (under the ADA, if an employee establishes a prima facie case and the employer provides a nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse action, the employee must raise a triable dispute as to pretext).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-17\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Johnson\u2019s retaliation claim because Johnson failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether there was a causal connection between any protected activity and his termination. <em>See Pardi v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., </em>389 F.3d 840, 849-50 (9th Cir.2004) (discussing prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b551-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
