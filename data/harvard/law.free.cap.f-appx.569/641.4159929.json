HOLMES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Jesus Adan Rodriguez-Reyes petitions for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) order denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings. We dismiss the petition, in part, for lack of jurisdiction and deny the remainder of Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes is a native and citizen of Mexico who entered the United States illegally in 1994. An Immigration Judge (IJ) denied his application for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l) because he failed to establish \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to a qualifying relative, as required by \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). The BIA agreed and dismissed his appeal. While acknowledging that Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes\u2019s removal to Mexico would result in hardship to his United States citizen children, the BIA concluded that he failed to carry his burden to show hardship \u201c \u2018substantially beyond that which ordinarily would be expected to result from the alien\u2019s deportation.\u2019 \u201d Admin. R. at 79 (quoting <em>In re Monreal, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 56, 59 (BIA 2001)). The BIA dismissed Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes\u2019s appeal on August 30, 2013. He did not file a petition for review with this court within the next 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes instead filed a timely motion to reopen on September 23, 2013. He asked the BIA to reopen his proceedings and remand to the IJ based on new evidence of hardship. Specifically, Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes indicated that he had recently married a United States citizen, who had filed an 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative on his behalf. Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes nonetheless conceded there were several barriers to his ability to adjust his status even if the 1-130 Petition were granted. As to new evidence of hardship, he noted that his wife was a qualifying relative for purposes of cancellation of removal, and he described the effect his removal would have on her, both emotionally and financially. He also stated that his son had recently failed to pass the fifth grade, and he explained how the employees of his business in Utah would be affected by his removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>The BIA denied Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes\u2019s motion to reopen. It concluded he had not offered any new evidence of hardship that warranted reopening. Regarding his marriage to a United States citizen, the BIA said his evidence failed to establish the requisite level of hardship for cancellation of removal. It held further that he had not shown prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status based on his 1-130 Petition. Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes filed a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes argues that the agency (1) applied the wrong legal standard in determining that he failed to show the requisite level of hardship for cancellation of removal, (2) otherwise erred in making that hardship determination, and (3) violated his due process rights in denying his motion to reopen. \u201cThe decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen ... is within the discretion of the Board....\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Thus, we generally review the BIA\u2019s denial of -.a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Infanzon v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1359, 1362 (10th Cir.2004). The Attorney General contends that we lack jurisdiction to review most Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes\u2019s claims, and the remaining claims are without merit. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">A. This Court has no Jurisdiction to Review the BIA\u2019s Removal Order</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">First, we have no jurisdiction to review Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes\u2019s claims related to the BIA\u2019s order affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for cancellation of removal, because he failed to file a timely petition for review of that order. <em>See id. </em>at 1361 (holding appellate court lacked jurisdiction to review BIA order affirming IJ\u2019s denial of asylum, because alien did not file petition for review within 30 days of BIA order as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1)). We therefore dismiss the petition for review to the extent that Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes\u2019s first two contentions of error relate to the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal, the IJ\u2019s oral decision, or the preceding hearing before the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">B. This Court has no Jurisdiction to Review the BIA\u2019s Hardship Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">Second, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determinations under \u00a7 1229b regarding an alien\u2019s application for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) (providing \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review ... any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1229b\u201d). In particular, \u201cthe hardship issue is [such] a matter of discretion. There is no algorithm for determining when a hardship is \u2018exceptional and extremely unusual.\u2019 The decision regarding when hardship has reached that level is a judgment call.\u201d <em>Morales Ventura v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1259, 1262 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Moreover, an alien cannot, by appealing the denial of a motion to reopen, \u201cindirectly obtain judicial review of a discretionary ruling that is not directly reviewable.\u201d <em>Alzainati v. Holder, </em>568 F.3d 844, 848, 850 (10th Cir.2009). Therefore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2U\">if, in deciding a motion to reopen the BIA credits and considers the new evidence submitted in support of the motion and determines the alien would still not be entitled to a finding of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship, we cannot review that merits decision even it if takes the form of a denial of a motion to reopen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 850.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-14\">However, if, in deciding a motion to reopen, the BIA refuses, contrary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>established procedures, to consider new and pertinent evidence, due process rights are implicated. Then we exercise limited jurisdiction to review the propriety of the BIA\u2019s failure to consider the evidence and, in an appropriate case, can require consideration of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aob\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes argues the BIA violated his due process rights by denying him the opportunity to present evidence of his marriage and the hardship to his wife that will result from his removal. He asserts that the BIA denied his motion to reopen \u201cwithout even considering the new circumstances in [his] life\u201d and \u201ccompletely ignored\u201d the significance of his recent marriage to a United States citizen. Pet. Br. at 20. The record does not support these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The BIA explicitly referenced Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes\u2019s new evidence related to his marriage to a United States citizen, including an affidavit from his wife describing the emotional and financial hardship she would experience upon his removal. The BIA then concluded that he \u201cha[d] not made a prima facie showing that such hardship would rise to the level of \u2018exceptional and extremely unusual\u2019 hardship.\u201d Admin. R. at 3. It stated further that Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes \u201cha[d] not offered any new or previously unavailable evidence of hardship to any qualifying relative <em>to warrant reopening.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Finally, the BIA said that, despite his wife\u2019s filing of an 1-130 Petition, Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes did not present evidence that he was \u201cprima facie eligible for adjustment of status ... or for any other relief from removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We lack jurisdiction to review these determinations because the BIA did not refuse to consider Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes\u2019s evidence; rather, it credited that evidence but found on the merits that it was insufficient to carry his burden to make a prima facie showing of the requisite level of hardship or eligibility for other relief. <em>See Alzainati, </em>568 F.3d at 850. We therefore dismiss the petition for review to the extent that Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes seeks review of the BIA\u2019s hardship determination in denying his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">C. Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes\u2019s Other Claims Lack Merit</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Notwithstanding the jurisdictional bar in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) that precludes our review of the agency\u2019s discretionary determinations under \u00a7 1229b, this court retains jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We have construed \u201cquestions of law\u201d to mean \u201ca narrow category of issues regarding statutory construction.\u201d <em>Diallo v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 1274, 1282 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes appears to assert a \u201cquestion of law\u201d by contending that the BIA misconstrued the statutory standard of \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d in \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D) in denying his application for cancellation of removal. He notes that the BIA requires a showing of hardship that is \u201csubstantially beyond that which ordinarily would be expected to result from the alien\u2019s deportation.\u201d <em>In re Monreal, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 59 (italics omitted). He argues that the IJ failed to apply that standard, concluding instead that there was \u201cno legal basis\u201d to grant his application under \u00a7 1229b, Admin. R. at 177, and that the BIA was \u201cmisled\u201d by the IJ\u2019s holding, Pet. Br. at 15.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>As we have explained, we lack jurisdiction to review Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes\u2019s contentions related to the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of cancellation of removal because he did not file a timely petition for review of his removal order. But we can review his assertion that the BIA continued to apply an erroneous statutory standard in denying his motion to reopen. That claim has no merit. The BIA cited <em>In re Monreal, </em>and Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes points to nothing in the BIA\u2019s order indicating or even suggesting that it did not apply the correct statutory standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes asserts a constitutional claim by contending that the BIA deprived him of procedural due process in denying his motion to reopen. Although the BIA\u2019s refusal to consider new and pertinent evidence on a motion to reopen implicates due process rights, <em>Alzainati, </em>568 F.Bd at 850, we have already rejected his claim that the BIA did not consider his new evidence. But he also argues that the BIA\u2019s failure to remand to the IJ for further fact finding, including testimony about the hardship his wife will experience if he is removed, was \u201ca quintessential due process violation because [he] was given no meaningful opportunity whatsoever to make his case for cancellation of removal based on the newly available evidence of his marriage.\u201d Pet. Br. at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">This claim has no merit. As Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes acknowledges, an alien in removal proceedings is entitled \u201conly to procedural due process, which provides the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Alzainati, </em>568 F.3d at 851 (internal quotation marks omitted). The process for seeking to reopen removal proceedings \u201cderives solely from regulations promulgated by the Attorney General.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Under the applicable regulation, a motion to reopen must \u201cstate the new facts <em>that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted </em>and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (emphasis added). Thus, it was Mr. Rodriguez-Reyes\u2019s burden to submit sufficient evidence in support of his motion to reopen to establish grounds for further fact finding before an IJ. The BIA considered his new evidence and found it inadequate. He was not thereby deprived of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The petition for review is dismissed in part and denied in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b664-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
