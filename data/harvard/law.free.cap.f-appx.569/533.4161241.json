R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b556-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Ricky Allen Dennis appeals his conviction in a bench trial on stipulated facts for conspiracy to commit a robbery affecting interstate commerce under the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). We review de novo, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, find there is sufficient evidence to support the conviction because \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Si, </em>343 F.3d 1116, 1123 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">The stipulated facts were sufficient to show that Dennis (1) agreed with two or more people (2) to commit a robbery that \u201cobstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a); (3) that Dennis \u201chad knowledge of the conspiratorial goal\u201d; and (4) he \u201cvoluntarily participated in trying to accomplish the conspiratorial goal.\u201d <em>Si, </em>343 F.3d at 1123-24. Dennis agreed with at least three co-conspirators to steal several dozen kilograms of cocaine from a stash house of a notable drug gang and to kill the guards if necessary. This conspiracy affected interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>547 F.3d 1187, 1197 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201csquarely reject[ing]\u201d argument in a Hobbs Act prosecution that \u201ca conspiracy to rob a nonexistent stash house cannot interfere with interstate commerce\u201d). Dennis\u2019s actions were knowing and voluntary: he sought and received an undercover agent\u2019s cell phone to assist him, stated he had \u201ccontingencies\u201d to dispose of the guards\u2019 bodies, met with agents about the robbery, asked specific planning questions, and even procured a black mask for the \u201cspecial day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-16\">That Dennis was not sure when or where precisely the robbery would take place is irrelevant, particularly because the \u201cplan\u201d was always that the undercover agent posing as the gang\u2019s drug courier would \u201cknow\u201d only at the last minute when the shipment arrived and where it was located, and would inform Dennis\u2019s \u201ccrew\u201d at that time. Also irrelevant are any differences between Dennis\u2019s plans and the (staged) robbery one of his associates attempted to commit after Dennis had been incarcerated on a separate warrant; Dennis\u2019s actions prior to his arrest were sufficient to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b556-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
