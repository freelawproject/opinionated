After thorough review, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-16\">We review jurisdictional questions <em>de novo. Evans v. Walter Industries, Inc., </em>449 F.3d 1159, 1162 (11th Cir.2006). We generally review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a party\u2019s motion to reopen the time period to file a notice of appeal, pursuant to Rule 4(a)(6). <em>See McDaniel v. Moore, </em>292 F.3d 1304, 1305</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>(11th Cir.2002) (reviewing whether the district court abused its discretion by denying the petitioner\u2019s request to reopen the time period to file a notice of appeal). \u201cA court, by definition, abuses its discretion when it bases a decision on an erroneous legal premise.\u201d <em>United States v. Hill, </em>643 F.3d 807, 874 (11th Cir.2011). We liberally construe a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">First, we are unpersuaded by the state\u2019s claim that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAED-PA\u201d), state habeas petitioners who file an appeal after April 24, 1996, must obtain a COA to proceed. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). Specifically, the AEDPA provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-5\">[Ujnless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from\u2014(A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court; or (B) the final order in a proceeding under section 2255.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">A COA is required to appeal the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding. <em>Jackson v. Crosby, </em>437 F.3d 1290, 1294-95 (11th Cir.2006). However, the Supreme Court has held that an order denying a motion for appointment of counsel in a habeas proceeding is not a \u201cfinal order\u201d as defined in \u00a7 2253(c), and therefore is not subject to the COA requirement. <em>Harbison v. Bell, </em>556 U.S. 180, 183, 129 S.Ct. 1481, 173 L.Ed.2d 347 (2009). In doing so, it explained that \u00a7 2253(c) \u201cgoverns final orders that dispose of the merits of a habeas corpus proceeding.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Here, Summers\u2019s motion to reopen is not a \u201cfinal order\u201d subject to the COA requirement in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1), because it does not dispose of the merits of a habeas proceeding. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to hear Summers\u2019s appeal of the denial of his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">As for the merits of the appeal, we agree with Summers that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to reopen on jurisdictional grounds. In general, the federal procedural rules require that a party in a civil lawsuit file a notice of appeal within 30 days of the entry of the order being appealed. Fed. R.App.P. 4(a)(1)(A). If a party fails to file a notice of appeal within the 30-day period, \u201c[tjhe district court may reopen the time to file an appeal for a period of 14 days after the date when its order to reopen is entered\u201d when three conditions are met. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(6). First, the court must find that the party did not receive notice within 21 days of the entry of the order that it seeks to appeal. <em>Id. </em>4(a)(6)(A). Second, the party must move to reopen the appeal period within 180 days of the order\u2019s entry or within 14 days after receiving notice of the order\u2019s entry, whichever is earlier. <em>Id. </em>4(a)(6)(B). Third, the court must find that no party would be prejudiced if the window to appeal were reopened. <em>Id. </em>4(a)(6)(C). The party moving under Rule 4(a)(6) bears the burden of showing non-receipt, or delayed receipt, of the order it wishes to appeal. <em>McDaniel, </em>292 F.3d at 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">Here, we are compelled to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying Summers\u2019s motion to reopen on jurisdictional grounds. Although the court was correct that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain Summers\u2019s initial Rule 60(b) motion to the extent that it constituted a successive habeas petition, we find no authority to support the proposition that it also lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of Summers\u2019s motion to reopen and make findings as to whether he had satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>fled the requirements of Rule 4(a)(6). Thus, the district court based its denial of the motion on the erroneous legal premise that it lacked jurisdiction. <em>See Hill, </em>643 F.3d at 874. It is possible that if the district court had considered the motion to reopen on the merits, it would have denied it\u2014indeed, even if Summers sufficiently satisfied all three conditions of Rule (4)(a)(6), the district court would merely be authorized, rather than required, to grant the motion to reopen. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(6) (stating that \u201c[t]he district court may reopen the time to file an appeal\u201d). Regardless, the district court has yet to make findings in the first instance as to whether Summers had satisfied the requirements of Rule 4(a)(6). We therefore vacate the order denying the motion to reopen and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-12\">. This appeal has been consolidated with three other appeals, Nos. 12-14102, 12-14103, and 12-14104. However, Summers only was granted in forma pauperis status on the instant appeal, and therefore he proceeds solely on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-13\">. Also on appeal, Summers raises challenges to several other orders, including direct challenges to the disposition of the Rule 60(b) motion and his motion to stay the Rule 60(b) proceedings. However, we do not have jurisdiction to hear any of these challenges, because the orders for these motions are not specified in the instant notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 3(c)(1)(B) (requiring that the notice of appeal \"designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed\u201d); <em>Osterneck v. E.T. Barwick Indus., Inc., </em>825 F.2d 1521, 1528 (11th Cir.1987) (\"The general rule in this circuit is that an appellate court has jurisdiction to review only those judgments, orders or portions thereof which are specified in an appellant\u2019s notice of appeal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
