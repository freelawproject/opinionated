The Honorable Jane A.

Lopez brings several challenges to his conviction. For the following reasons, we will affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-22\">Lopez first argues that the phrase \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2012) is unconstitutionally vague. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-23\">[A]ny person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime\u2014(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-24\">The statute provides for three distinct offenses. An offender may: (1) \u201cuse\u201d a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime; (2) \u201ccarry\u201d a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime; or (3) \u201cpossess\u201d a firearm \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>344 F.3d 365, 370, 378 (3d Cir. 2003); <em>United States v. Loney, </em>219 F.3d 281, 287 (3d Cir.2000). The \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 element applies only if the charge is for \u201cpossessing\u201d a firearm. The indictment, jury instructions, and verdict form show that Lopez was convicted of carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. The \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 requirement did not apply to this offense, and thus it is irrelevant whether that language would be considered impermissibly vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-25\">Second, Lopez argues that there was insufficient evidence to show that he possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>trafficking offense. Again, Lopez was not charged with or convicted of that offense. Whether the evidence would have supported a conviction for that offense has no bearing on his conviction for carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Finally, Lopez argues that the district court committed plain error by allowing DEA Special Agent Randy Updegraff to testify regarding the relationship between guns and drug trafficking. To succeed on a claim of plain error, \u201ca defendant must establish an error that is plain, which affected his substantial rights, and which, if not rectified, would seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Ward, </em>626 F.3d 179, 183 (3d Cir.2010). Lopez argues that this testimony violated Federal Rule of Evidence 704(b), which prohibits an expert from stating \u201can opinion about whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state or condition that constitutes an element of the crime charged.\u201d Lopez additionally argues that Updegraff s testimony regarding the connection between guns and drug trafficking was unnecessary, as the connection easily could have been understood without the aid of expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Updegraff testified that drug dealers often carry weapons to protect themselves, their money, and their drugs, while drug users rarely carry weapons. He also opined that the evidence in this case indicated that Lopez was a drug dealer, not a user. The testimony regarding weapons was limited to the general practice of drug dealers. Updegraff never stated that he knew Lopez, nor did he opine why Lopez specifically was carrying a gun. Because Updegraff never drew the ultimate inference or conclusion for the jury about Lopez\u2019s intent in carrying a gun, the testimony was entirely in accord with Rule 704(b). <em>United States v. Price, </em>458 F.3d 202, 211-12 (3d Cir.2006). Regarding Lopez\u2019s argument that it was plain error to admit the expert testimony on the connection between guns and drug trafficking because it was \u201ccommon sense,\u201d Lopez cites no authority for this proposition. This type of evidence is often used at trial precisely because jurors may not have familiarity with drug dealing. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion to allow the expert opinion. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 212; <em>United States v. Davis, </em>397 F.3d 173, 178-79 (3d Cir.2005). Furthermore, Lopez has not developed any argument regarding how the admission of this evidence affected his substantial rights or the integrity of the proceedings apart from stating in a single sentence that \u201c[t]he use of an expert in this circumstance amounts to bolstering.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 22. We therefore reject the claim that the admission of this testimony constituted plain' error warranting reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">For these reasons, we will affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-26\">. The district court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 (2012). We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
