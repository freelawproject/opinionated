We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-19\">Under the Lanham Act, \u201c[t]he court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a). \u2018We have held that this requirement is met when the case is <em>either </em>\u2018groundless, unreasonable, vexatious, <em>or </em>pursued in bad faith.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cairns v. Franklin Mint Co., </em>292 F.3d 1139, 1156 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting <em>Avery Dennison Corp. v. Sumpton, </em>189 F.3d 868, 881 (9th Cir.1999)) (emphasis in Cairns). \u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s legal determination that an action is \u2018exceptional\u2019 under the Lanham Act; however, once an action is determined to be exceptional, the district court\u2019s decision to award attorney\u2019s fees is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Secalt S.A. v. Wuxi Shenxi Constr. Mach. Co., </em>668 F.3d 677, 687 (9th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-20\">We have explained that where a plaintiff is \u201cable to provide some legitimate evidence ... [his or her] case would likely fall on the unexceptional side of the dividing line.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688. However, in this case, none of the four pieces of evidence proffered by Appellant\u2014a one-page fax sent by a consultant to a customer that compared eMove with SMD\u2019s SiteLink service, a few cryptic lines in Appellees\u2019 call logs, a declaration about statements Appellee Markus Hecker made at a trade show, and a posting by Hecker to an Internet forum\u2014provides legitimate evidence of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>pellees\u2019 violations of the Lanham Act. Taken together, this evidence constitutes an \u201cutter failure of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688; <em>see also Love v. Associated Newspapers, Ltd., </em>611 F.3d 601, 615-16 (9th Cir.2010) (affirming \u201cexceptional\u201d determination where plaintiff \u201cpresented not one item of evidence substantiating\u201d a critical part of the claim). Three of the four pieces of Appellant\u2019s evidence clearly failed to meet the requirement for dissemination under the relevant standard for Lanham Act claims, given that these statements were made to a handful of people and the market for self-storage facilities in the United States exceeds 50,000 businesses. <em>See Coastal Abstract Serv., Inc. v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., </em>173 F.3d 725, 735 (9th Cir.1999). Furthermore, it is not at all apparent that the one piece of evidence that was disseminated\u2014the Internet posting\u2014was false. <em>See Cairns, </em>292 F.3d at 1156 (affirming award of attorneys\u2019 fees where \u201cstatements in the advertisements at issue were true and the [plaintiff] had no reasonable basis to believe they were false\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Accordingly, Appellant \u201cha[d] no reasonable or legal basis to believe in success on the merits,\u201d <em>Secalt, </em>668 F.3d at 687, and we conclude that \u201cthe case is exceptional as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Love, </em>611 F.3d at 616.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Because the case is \u201cexceptional,\u201d we review the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Secalt, </em>668 F.3d at 687. \u201cAn abuse of discretion is a plain error, discretion exercised to an end not justified by the evidence, a judgment that is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts as are found.\u201d <em>Rabkin v. Or. Health Scis. Univ., </em>350 F.3d 967, 977 (9th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Int\u2019l Jensen, Inc. v. Metrosound U.S.A., Inc., </em>4 F.3d 819, 822 (9th Cir. 1993)). \u201cWe reverse only if we are \u2018convinced firmly that the reviewed decision lies beyond the pale of reasonable justification under the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCollough v. Johnson, Rodenburg &amp; Lauinger, LLC, </em>637 F.3d 939, 953 (9th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Boyd v. City &amp; Cnty. of S.F., </em>576 F.3d 938, 943 (9th Cir.2009)). \u201c[W]e have no basis for concluding that the district court\u2019s award of ... fees and costs\u2014an amount unchallenged by [Appellant]\u2014is an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Lahoti v. Vericheck, Inc., </em>636 F.3d 501, 511 (9th Cir.2011). Accordingly, we affirm the award of fees and costs under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b549-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\">. Appellant recognizes that under our precedent there is no requirement for bad faith in the finding of exceptionality under the Lanham Act, <em>see Cairns, </em>292 F.3d at 1156, but it urges us to join other circuits in finding that a case cannot be considered exceptional without a finding of bad faith. We are unwilling to do so. <em>See Klestadt &amp; Winters, LLP v. Cangelosi, </em>672 F.3d 809, 815 (9th Cir.2012) (\"[W]e are bound by our [previous] decision ..., and as a three judge panel, we cannot overrule it.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
