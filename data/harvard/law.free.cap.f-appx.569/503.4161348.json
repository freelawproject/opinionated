We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>San Diego Police Officers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. San Diego City Emps.\u2019 Ret. Sys., </em>568 F.3d 725, 733 (9th Cir.2009). We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-25\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Grandberry\u2019s equal protection claim as to defendants Lewis and Meza because they were not responsible for the prison lockdown to which Grandberry was subjected. <em>See Leer v. Murphy, </em>844 F.2d 628, 633-34 (9th Cir. 1988) (requiring an individualized inquiry into who caused an individual\u2019s alleged constitutional deprivation).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-26\">With respect to defendant Mantel, however, Grandberry raised a genuine dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>of material fact as to whether the race-based lockdown was narrowly tailored to address the compelling government interest of prison security. <em>See Johnson v. California, </em>543 U.S. 499, 509-15, 125 S.Ct. 1141, 160 L.Ed.2d 949 (2005) (applying strict scrutiny to racial classifications in prison context); <em>see also Richardson v. Runnels, </em>594 F.3d 666, 671-72 (9th Cir. 2010) (prison officials must provide evidence \u201cconcerning the basis for regarding all African-Americans as [ ] security risk[s] when one or a few African-American inmates are responsible for an assault\u201d). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Grandberry, as we are required to do, <em>see San Diego Police Officers\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>568 F.3d at 733, a triable dispute remains as to \u201cthe necessity of [the] racial classification in response to [the] prison disturbance[ ] and [whether] the racial classification was the least restrictive alternative.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>594 F.3d at 671 (citing <em>Johnson, </em>543 U.S. at 505, 125 S.Ct. 1141).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b525-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
