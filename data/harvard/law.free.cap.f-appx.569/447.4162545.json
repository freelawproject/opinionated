His appeal challenges both his conviction and sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-16\">On January 15, 2008, Bethany was charged by a second superseding indictment with one count of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of a substance containing cocaine base in the form of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and three counts of distributing fifty grams or more of cocaine base in the form of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Because Bethany had a previous felony drug conviction, the Government also filed an enhancement notice under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-17\">On January 9, 2009, without the benefit of a written plea agreement, Bethany agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge. As a concession, the Government agreed to dismiss the remaining counts. Bethany, however, was very particular about his admissions during the plea hearing\u2014he admitted only that he possessed and distributed <em>some </em>amount of cocaine base. Bethany refused to admit that the substance was in fact crack cocaine or to a specific quantity of cocaine base. In response, the Government agreed to provide evidence regarding the amount and type of drug at Bethany\u2019s sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-18\">On December 6, 2010, almost two years after the change of plea hearing, but before the sentencing hearing, Bethany moved to withdraw his guilty plea. He argued that the district court failed to discuss or even mention the Federal Sentencing Guidelines or the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 factors during the Rule 11 plea colloquy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Thus, according to Bethany, his plea was not knowingly entered. The court denied his motion on January 24, 2011, and reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">Bethany was very adequately informed of the statutory m\u00ednimums he was facing which would be dependent upon the results of the sentencing hearing to be held at a later date. He was also informed of the maximum sentence he would be facing. He was not told about the sentencing guidelines but the court would be hard pressed to give any kind of estimate because the quantity of drugs was not discussed and there was no agreement as to whether or not the case involved crack cocaine. Consequently, the best estimate of the sentencing he would be facing was anywhere between the minimum and maximum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">It is clear that Bethany had been informed sufficiently about the consequences of his plea to have made an intelligent, voluntary and knowing decision as to whether to plead guilty.... Consequently, the failure to abide by all of the provisions of Rule 11 did not involve substantial rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">Mem. Op. and Order, Dkt. No. 211 at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Immediately thereafter, Bethany filed a motion for reconsideration. This time, he also argued that the district court further violated Rule 11, and thus rendered his plea involuntary, because it did not, as the rule requires, inform him that the statements he made under oath could be used against him in a prosecution for perjury. The motion for reconsideration was also denied by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">On March 21, 2013, the court began a three-day sentencing hearing during which the Government presented evidence concerning the drug type, the drug quantity, and several aggravating factors under the Sentencing Guidelines. After hearing evidence, the court concluded that Bethany was responsible for at least 280 grams of crack cocaine. Thus, he faced a twenty-year mandatory minimum sentence,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and his base offense level was set at 32. Next, the court applied the following enhancements and adjustments from the 2012 Sentencing Guidelines:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Use of violence/threats \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(2) +2 points</p>\n<p id=\"AKX\">Maintaining a drug premises \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(12) +2 points</p>\n<p id=\"Ak-\">Criminal livelihood \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(14)(E) +2 points</p>\n<p id=\"Ahy\">Organizer of Conspiracy \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) +4 points</p>\n<p id=\"AOm\">Obstruction of Justice \u00a7 3C1.1 +2 points</p>\n<p id=\"A6u\">Acceptance of Responsibility \u00a7 3El.l(a) -2 points</p>\n<p id=\"AtX\">Total 42</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Based on a criminal history category IV and a total offense level of 42, Bethany faced ,a Guidelines range of 360 months to life in prison. The court, however, deviated downward from the Guidelines and sentenced Bethany to 300 months in prison\u2014 within the statutory minimum and maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-21\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-22\">On appeal, Bethany argues that the district court erred in three respects: (1) denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and his motion to reconsider; (2) determining, in light of <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), that he was subject to a twenty-year mandatory minimum sentence; and (3) applying several Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Guideline enhancements in violation of the <em>ex post facto </em>clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">A. Guilty Plea and Rule 11 Colloquy</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">A district court may allow a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea before sentencing if a defendant can show a \u201cfair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d <em>United States v. Redmond, </em>667 F.3d 863, 870 (7th Cir.2012) (citing Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B)). For example, a plea may be withdrawn if it was \u201cnot made voluntarily and knowingly.\u201d <em>United States v. Mays, </em>593 F.3d 603, 607 (7th Cir.2010). Importantly, \u201c[t]here is no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Redmond, </em>667 F.3d at 870 (citing <em>United States v. Chavers, </em>515 F.3d 722, 724 (7th Cir.2008)). Rather, the decision to deny a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea \u201crests within the discretion of the district court\u201d and therefore is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 870 (citing <em>United States v. Cavender, </em>228 F.3d 792, 803 (7th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Bethany argues that he should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea because the district court failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 11. \u201cRule 11 generally spells out the procedures that a district court must follow when a defendant wishes to plead guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Sura, </em>511 F.3d 654, 657 (7th Cir.2007). Among the various topics listed under Rule 11 are the Sentencing Guidelines. Specifically, \u201cthe court must inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands ... the court\u2019s obligation to calculate the applicable sentencing-guideline range and to consider that range, possible departures under the Sentencing Guidelines, and other sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(M). However, a literal recitation of Rule 11 is unnecessary. <em>See United States v. Akinsola, </em>105 F.3d 331, 334 (7th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Cross, </em>57 F.3d 588, 591 (7th Cir.1995). Indeed, Rule 11 states that \u201c \u2018[a] variance from the requirements of th[e] rule is harmless error if it does not affect substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Davila, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2139, 2143, 186 L.Ed.2d 139 (2013) (quoting Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(h)). The \u201charmlessness inquiry naturally should focus on whether the defendant\u2019s knowledge and comprehension of the full and correct information would have been likely to affect his willingness to plead guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>205 F.3d 1020, 1024 (7th Cir.2000) (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">Bethany argues that the district court\u2019s \u201cfailure to inform [him] about either the existence or necessity of consulting both the sentencing guidelines and \u00a7 3553 factors\u2014undeniably two of the most important factors in determining a defendant\u2019s sentence\u2014cannot be held to \u2018substantially comply' with the requirements of Rule 11.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12. Although the district court erred in failing to discuss (or even mention) the Sentencing Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as Rule 11 requires, the error in this case was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">Bethany was advised during the change of plea hearing that, assuming the cocaine base was determined to be crack (which the evidence overwhelmingly established), he faced a statutory minimum sentence of twenty years and a statutory maximum sentence of thirty years in prison.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bethany suggests that this non-specific sentencing range may have led him to underestimate his probable sentence. He argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADX\">In the absence of information about the applicable guidelines range, Mr. Betha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>ny might well conclude that he is just as likely to get a sentence close to the low end of the applicable statutory range as a sentence closer to the high end. For example, without any knowledge about the guidelines, Mr. Bethany could have surmised that a sentence of 20 years or less was' just as likely as a sentence of 30 years. That was not an accurate assessment of Mr. Bethany\u2019s situation. Under the guidelines found by the district court at sentencing, Mr. Bethany had an advisory sentencing range of 360 months to life. Hence, a sentence close to the 30-year maximum was much more likely than a sentence of 20 years or less. Mr. Bethany had a right to know that before he entered his plea. Without that knowledge, he was incapable of knowingly and voluntarily pleading guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10. As the Government notes, however, \u201cthe fact that a defendant underestimated his sentence when entering his plea is not a fair and just reason to permit him to withdraw that guilty plea.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 35 (quoting <em>Redmond, </em>667 F.3d at 872).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">More importantly, it is unlikely that a discussion of the Sentencing Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors during the change of plea hearing would have affected Bethany\u2019s willingness to plead guilty. Bethany was aware that he faced a statutory maximum of thirty years in prison. At the sentencing hearing, his Guidelines range was determined to be 360 months to life in prison. The failure to advise him of this range at the change of plea hearing cannot reasonably be said to have affected his decision to plead guilty, because the judge could not have sentenced Bethany beyond the statutory maximum of thirty years. Thus, unless he admitted to additional facts, he already knew that his sentence would not exceed 360 months. <em>Cf. United States v. Padilla, </em>23 F.3d 1220, 1222 (7th Cir.1994) (\u201cIf for instance, the record discloses that a defendant was aware when pleading guilty that the sentencing guidelines would subject him to a sentence well in excess of any statutory mandatory minimum likely applicable to his case, the failure to advise him of such m\u00ednimums during the plea hearing cannot reasonably be said to have affected his decision to accept the plea.\u201d). Thus, the district court\u2019s failure to discuss the Sentencing Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at Bethany\u2019s change of plea hearing was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Rule 11 also requires that \u201cthe court must inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands ... the government\u2019s right, in a prosecution for perjury or false statement, to use against the defendant any statement that the defendant gives under oath.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(A). Because the district court failed to inform Bethany of this fact, he further argues that his plea was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">We previously considered and rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Graves, </em>98 F.3d 258 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">As there is no current or prospective prosecution of [the defendant] for perjury, the violation of Rule 11 ... was harmless____If the violation of the rule weren\u2019t harmless, because there was a prospect of a perjury trial, still the proper sanction would be exclusion of the statement from that trial rather than throwing out the guilty plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 259. Likewise, the district court\u2019s failure to recite Rule 11(b)(1)(A) during Bethany\u2019s plea colloquy was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">Based on the foregoing, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bethany\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The court also did not err in denying Bethany\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-15\">B. <em>Alleyne </em>Error</p>\n<p id=\"b473-16\">Bethany next argues that, in light of <em>Alleyne, </em>the district court erred in de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>termining that he was subject to a twenty-year mandatory minimum sentence. In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cany fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2155. In other words, \u201ca district court errs when it makes a judicial finding of fact that increases the statutory mandatory minimum sentence facing a defendant.\u201d In this case, the district court determined that Bethany faced a statutory minimum of twenty years in prison. Bethany, however, was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison (which was a downward departure from the Guidelines range), and the statutory minimum had absolutely no effect on his ultimate sentence. Thus, there was no error and <em>Alleyne </em>is inapplicable to Bethany\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">C. Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">As his third and final ground for appeal, Bethany argues that the district court violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause and thus erred in applying a two-level enhancement for maintaining a stash house/drug premises, and a two-level enhancement for using violence or the threat of violence, because those enhancements were not in effect when he committed his . crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Peugh v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2072, 186 L.Ed.2d 84 (2013), the Supreme Court held that application of Sentencing Guidelines that came into effect after the commission of an offense violates the <em>ex post facto </em>clause if it results in a higher Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Bethany seems to argue that he is entitled to pick and choose between portions of the 2005 Sentencing Guidelines and the 2012 Sentencing Guidelines. In other words, Bethany asserts that the district court should have applied the individual guidelines from each manual that were most beneficial to him. However, that is not the law of this Circuit\u2014the district court must apply either the <em>entire </em>2005 manual or the <em>entire </em>2012 manual. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hallahan, </em>744 F.3d 497, 513-14 (7th Cir.2014) (discussing <em>ex post facto </em>clause and one-book rule). Bethany, however, has not argued for the application of the (entire) 2005 manual, let alone contended that he would have been better off under it. Thus, Bethany fails to show that that the district court committed reversible error under <em>Peugh.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">Bethany\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-9\">. Bethany faced a statutory minimum sentence of ten years. However, due to his prior drug offense, the minimum sentence was doubled to twenty years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\">. During the change of plea hearing, Bethany\u2019s counsel specifically clarified as follows: \"just so the parties are clear that if the judge at sentencing was to find that it\u2019s crack that the 20 minimum kicks in, the maximum still remains 30.\u201d Change of Plea Tr. at 7-9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b474-9\">. Interestingly, the district court also imposed a two-point enhancement for criminal livelihood under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(14)(E). This provision also was not in effect when Bethany committed his crimes. Bethany, however, did not raise the <em>ex post facto </em>argument as it relates to this enhancement in the district court or in the instant appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
