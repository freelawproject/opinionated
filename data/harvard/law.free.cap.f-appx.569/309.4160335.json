Lavergne is currently serving consecutive sentences of life imprisonment, having pled guilty to two murders. In essence, Lavergne seeks damages from Higgingbottom for false statements she allegedly made to the police, the media, and the grand jury in connection with the murder investigation that culminated in Lavergne\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-20\">The district court dismissed his complaint with prejudice. The court concluded Lavergne failed to state a claim under \u00a7 1983 because he did not allege Higgingbottom, a private citizen, was a state actor acting under color of state law nor did he allege his conviction was invalid. The court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law defamation and libel claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3) and entered judgment for Higgingbottom. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo, \u2018accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and viewing those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe ex rel. Magee v. Covington Cnty. Sch. Dist. ex rel. Keys, </em>675 F.3d 849, 854 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-21\">On appeal, Lavergne asserts the district court violated his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment because (1) it took \u201cno action\u201d from June 2013 through February 2014 on his complaint, (2) the magistrate judge denied Lavergne\u2019s request for leave to amend and motion to recuse together after issuing his findings and recommendations, which Lavergne contends constituted \u201crul[ing] on his own motion to recuse.\u201d To the extent Lavergne attempts to raise other issues through this appeal, we do not decide those issues because they were inadequately briefed. <em>See Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cAlthough we liberally construe briefs of pro se litigants and apply less stringent standards to parties proceeding pro se than to parties represented by counsel, pro se parties must still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the standards of Rule 28.\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Here, the district court correctly concluded Lavergne failed to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for violation of \u00a7 1983. \u201cTo state a cause of action under section 1983 the appellant must allege that the person who deprived him of a federal right was acting under color of law.\u201d <em>Priester v. Lowndes Cnty., </em>354 F.3d 414, 420 (5th Cir.2004). As the district court correctly observed, Higgingbottom is not a state actor or otherwise acted \u201cunder color of law\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983. Moreover, we find no error in the procedure in the district court. After a year without activity in the case, the court appropriately screened his pro se complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). <em>See Ali v. Higgs, </em>892 F.2d 438, 440 (5th Cir.1990). The magistrate judge was under no obligation to recuse himself from Lavergne\u2019s request for leave to amend, and did not abuse discretion in refusing to do so. <em>See Matassarin v. Lynch, </em>174 F.3d 549, 571 (5th Cir.1999) (affirming denial of a motion to recuse because the record \u201cfalls ... short of \u2018such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Accordingly, the district court did not err when it dismissed Lavergne\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim, and therefore we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4. \u25a0</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
