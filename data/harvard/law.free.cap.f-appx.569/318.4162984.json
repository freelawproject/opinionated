On appeal, Appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence, over Appellant\u2019s timely objection, the name of Appellant\u2019s prior felony conviction. Specifically, Appellant\u2019s prior conviction was for conspiracy to commit armed robbery. In Appellant\u2019s view, the admission of the name of the prior conviction was more prejudicial than probative under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-24\">Where the party challenging a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling makes a timely objection, we review the district court\u2019s ruling for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If we find abuse of discretion in the admission of evidence, we review for harmless error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under. Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, an error is harmless unless there is a reasonable probability that the improperly admitted evidence contributed to the conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-25\">In the present case, the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the name of Appellant\u2019s prior conviction. Here, unlike the criminal defendant in <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 190, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997), and the other cases cited in Appellant\u2019s brief,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Appellant'refused to stipulate to the fact of his previous qualifying felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The present case therefore cannot be materially distinguished from <em>United States v. Banks, </em>553 F.3d 1101, 1103-07 (8th Cir.2009). In <em>Banks, </em>the Eighth Circuit affirmed a district court\u2019s decision during a trial under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) to admit the names of the defendant\u2019s two previous convictions, including a previous conviction for possession of a firearm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As in the present case, the defendant in <em>Banks </em>had also refused to stipulate to the fact of his previous qualifying felony. In the absence of a stipulation, as the Eighth Circuit explained, the name of the defendant\u2019s previous felony was relevant to determining whether the defendant fell within the exception created by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 (a) (20):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">At trial, Banks refused to stipulate to the fact that he had prior felony convictions and moved to exclude the names of the prior convictions. He attempted to limit the government\u2019s proof to the fact of a conviction punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year. The district court denied the motion, stating that the government could not meet its burden of proof without the names of the prior felonies because certain felonies cannot be used to support a felon-in-possession charge.... 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20) excludes from the definition of a \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d certain crimes, including \u201cantitrust violations, unfair trade practices, restraints of trade ... or ... any State offense classified by the laws of the State as a misdemeanor and punishable by a term of imprisonment of two years or less.\u201d The government needed to prove, therefore, that Banks\u2019s prior crimes triggered the conviction as a felon in possession of a firearm.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-16\">The Eighth Circuit therefore found no abuse of discretion in <em>Banks.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Fourth Circuit and the Supreme Court of California have applied a similar analysis where a criminal defendant refused to stipulate to a prior conviction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The D.C. Circuit also emphasized in <em>United States v. Cassell, </em>292 F.3d 788, 796 (D.C.Cir.2002), that \u201cevidence of prior gun possessions\u201d does not have \u201can automatic unfair and substantial prejudicial effect on the jury\u201d even \u201cin a subsequent trial for gun possession,\u201d so long as the evidence is offered for a proper purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">\u25a0 Based on these authorities, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. Appellant\u2019s refusal to stipulate to his felony status made it impossible for the prosecutors to address the exception under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20) without presenting some evidence regarding the nature of Appellant\u2019s prior conviction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Moreover, in the present case, even if the district court had abused its discretion under Rule 403, such error would have been harmless because there was no prejudice to Appellant. The district court instructed the jury to consider only Appellant\u2019s guilt with respect to \u201cthe crime charged,\u201d and to disregard \u201cany acts, conduct, or offense not alleged in the indictment.\u201d As we held in <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>567 F.3d 721, 728-29 (5th Cir. 2009), and <em>United States v. Parziale, </em>947 F.2d 123, 129 (5th Cir.1991), limiting instructions of this kind are sufficient to guard against the risk of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Finally, any error related to the name of Appellant\u2019s previous felony was harmless error because of the overwhelming evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt, as the government has demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) requires proof that the defendant (1) has been convicted of a qualifying felony, (2) possessed a firearm in or affecting interstate commerce, and (3) knew that he was in possession of the firearm.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Of these three elements, Appellant contested only his knowledge that the firearm was in his possession. However, the testimony during the trial showed that Appellant was the owner, driver, and sole occupant of the vehicle in which the firearm was found lying in plain view. These facts, which Appellant never attempted to rebut during trial, are sufficient to establish that possession was knowing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">For these reasons, the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b340-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

Where prosecutors are obliged to demonstrate that a defendant's previous conviction does not fall within that exception, and where a criminal defendant refuses to stipulate to this fact, the rationale of <em>Old Chief </em>cannot prevent district courts from admitting evidence on this element of the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\">. <em>See United States v.
