Dreyer, </em>705 F.3d 951, 963 (9th Cir.2013). As the trial judge\u2014who\u2019d monitored Franco\u2019s conduct over the course of eight months and two trials\u2014 noted, Franco\u2019s behavior at the hearing was more likely indicative of recalcitrance than a failure to understand the proceedings. This finding is particularly rational given the complete lack of medical evidence suggesting Franco\u2019s incompetence, and the fact that \u201c[d]efense counsel ha[d] not ... raised the issue of Defendant\u2019s competency prior to the concluding portion of the sentencing proceeding.\u201d Under these circumstances, Franco\u2019s strange remarks and behavior at sentencing are best understood as a \u201creasoned choice,\u201d <em>id., </em>and don\u2019t constitute \u201csubstantial evidence casting doubt upon his competency.\u201d <em>Moore v. United States, </em>464 F.2d 663, 666 (9th Cir. 1972) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b557-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
