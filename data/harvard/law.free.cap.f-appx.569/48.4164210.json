N.Y. State Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>131 F.3d 326, 329 (2d Cir.1997). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the complaint must plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). We also review <em>de novo </em>\u201cthe essentially legal determination of whether the requirements for abstention have been met.\u201d <em>Diamond \u201cD\u201d Constr. Corp. v. McGowan, </em>282 F.3d 191, 197 (2d Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Further, we review a district court\u2019s denial of reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>See Johnson v. Univ. of Rochester Med. Ctr., </em>642 F.3d 121, 125 (2d Cir.2011). A district court abuses its discretion when its decision: (1) rests on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding; or (2) cannot be found within the range of permissible decisions. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Reconsideration will generally be denied unless the moving party can point to controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked\u2014matters, in other words, that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.\u201d <em>Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir.1995). Reconsideration should not be granted where \u201cthe moving party seeks solely to relitigate an issue already decided.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">We affirm for substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned orders. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Sprint Communications, Inc. v. Jacobs, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 584, 187 L.Ed.2d 505 (2013), however, we revisit the issue of abstention under <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">In determining that <em>Younger </em>abstention precluded consideration of all but one of Mir\u2019s federal claims, the district court applied the three-part test derived from <em>Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Garden State Bar Association, </em>457 U.S. 423, 432, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982). While this appeal was pending, however, the Supreme Court rejected this three-part test in favor of a categorical approach. <em>See Sprint, </em>134 S.Ct. at 591-94. It clarified that <em>Younger </em>abstention is triggered by only three categories of state court proceedings: (1) \u201cstate criminal prosecutions\u201d; (2) \u201ccivil enforcement proceedings\u201d; and (3) civil proceedings that \u201cimplicate a State\u2019s interest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588 (internal quotation marks omitted). Prior to <em>Sprint, </em>our jurisprudence on <em>Younger </em>abstention focused on the substance of the claims involved in the state and federal proceedings by asking whether they implicated an important state interest. <em>See Diamond \u201cD\u201d Constr., </em>282 F.3d at 198. By contrast, under the categorical approach outlined by <em>Sprint, </em>federal abstention requires a criminal proceeding, a civil enforcement proceeding, or a determination that a state court\u2019s ability to perform its judicial function would be otherwise impeded. <em>See Sprint, </em>134 S.Ct. at 588. In light of <em>Sprint, </em>the district court\u2019s analysis is no longer applicable. Nevertheless, remand is not necessary because abstention is still appropriate here under the <em>Sprint </em>framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">As Section 230 outlines proceedings for revoking a physician\u2019s medical license, it fits within <em>Sprint\u2019s </em>second category\u2014 civil enforcement proceedings. The <em>Sprint </em>Court defined this category with reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>to two cases: <em>Middlesex, </em>457 U.S. at 433-34, 102 S.Ct. 2515, a federal challenge to state disbarment proceedings; and <em>Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., </em>420 U.S. 592, 598, 95 S.Ct. 1200, 43 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975), a federal challenge to a state\u2019s civil suit to enforce its obscenity laws. <em>See Sprint, </em>134 S.Ct. at 592. The <em>Sprint </em>Court explained that enforcement actions within this second category resemble criminal prosecutions in \u201cimportant respects\u201d: they \u201ccharacteristically ... sanction the federal plaintiff ... for some wrongful act\u201d; they are \u201croutinely\u201d initiated by a state actor; and they are \u201ccommonly\u201d preceded by investigations that culminate in the \u201cfiling of a formal complaint or charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>New York\u2019s referral proceedings are initiated by a state actor, are preceded by investigations that culminate in formal charges, and sanction the physician for some wrongful act. <em>See generally </em>N.Y. Pub. Health Law \u00a7 230 (providing procedures for revocations of medical licenses). For <em>Younger </em>purposes, this type of proceeding resembles a criminal prosecution \u201cin important respects.\u201d <em>Sprint, </em>134 S.Ct. at 592. Moreover, <em>Sprint </em>reaffirmed the court\u2019s adherence to abstention in disciplinary proceedings involving professional licenses. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we conclude that abstention was warranted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">We have considered Mir\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment and order denying reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-21\">. We \"construe notices of appeal liberally, taking the parties' intentions into account,\u201d <em>Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>70 F.3d 255, 256 (2d Cir. 1995), and our appellate jurisdiction \"depends on whether the intent to appeal from [a] decision is clear on the face of, or can be inferred from, the notice[ ] of appeal,\u201d <em>The New Phone Co. v. City of New York, </em>498 F.3d 127, 131 (2d Cir.2007). Here, although Mir\u2019s notice of appeal designates only the order denying reconsideration, his supporting papers attached to his notice address the district court\u2019s entire dismissal. Construing his notice of appeal liberally, we conclude that Mir intended to appeal from both orders.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
