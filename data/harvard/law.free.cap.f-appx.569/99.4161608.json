We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise a plenary standard of review. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Hessein is an anesthesiologist and owner of Advanced Pain Management Specialists (\u201cAPM\u201d). The Union County (New Jersey) Prosecutor\u2019s Office began investigating Hessein and APM for allegedly overbilling Medicare and private insurance companies, and in 2010, a criminal complaint was issued charging Hessein with violating New Jersey\u2019s health-care-claims-fraud law. <em>See </em>N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:21-4.3(a). At about that time, the State of New Jersey initiated criminal forfeiture proceedings, alleging that various items belonging to Hessein\u2014including real property, banks accounts, and cars\u2014were evidence in the criminal action or the fruits of his criminal activity. Finally, the New Jersey Attorney General\u2019s Office instituted an administrative prosecution before the New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners seeking to suspend or revoke Hessein\u2019s medical license. According to Hessein, all three of these actions remain ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In 2013, Hessein filed a complaint (which he later supplemented) in the District Court, naming as defendants about a dozen individuals and entities involved in the state proceedings. Hessein, relying on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleged that his arrest, the seizure of his property, his criminal prosecution, the forfeiture proceedings, and the medical-disciplinary action all violated his constitutional rights. He asked the District Court to enjoin his arrest, suppress the evidence seized by authorities, and dismiss the three pending actions. He also sought money damages for the \u201cwrongful and illegal criminal prosecutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The def\u00e9ndants filed motions to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the District Court granted the motions and dismissed Hessein\u2019s complaint. Hessein then filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">We discern no error in the District Court\u2019s disposition of this case. Hessein first argues that the District Court should have granted a default judgment to him because Union County filed its motion to dismiss a few days after the deadline prescribed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 12. However, Hessein did not seek an entry of default, which is a prerequisite to obtaining a default judgment. <em>See Johnson v. Dayton Elec. Mfg. Co., </em>140 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1998). Moreover, none of the relevant default-judgment factors militate in Hessein\u2019s favor\u2014he was not prejudiced by the brief delay, there is no indication that Union County was culpable, and Union County had litigable defenses. <em>See Chamberlain v. Giampapa, </em>210 F.3d 154, 164 (3d Cir.2000). We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s order as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">We also agree with the District Court\u2019s decision to apply the <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrine. <em>See generally Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). This doctrine \u201creflects a strong federal policy against federal-court interference with pending state judicial proceedings absent extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Gwynedd Props., Inc. v. Lower Gwynedd Twp., </em>970 F.2d 1195, 1199 (3d Cir.1992) (quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has recently emphasized that the doctrine applies to only three specific categories of cases: (1) \u201congoing state criminal prosecutions\u201d; (2) \u201ccertain civil enforcement proceedings\u201d; and (3) \u201cpending civil proceedings involving certain orders uniquely in furtherance of the state courts\u2019 ability to perform their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>judicial functions.\u201d <em>Sprint Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, </em>- U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 584, 591, 187 L.Ed.2d 505 (2013) (quotation marks, alteration omitted); <em>see also ACRA Turf Club, LLC v. Zanzuccki, </em>748 F.3d 127 (3d Cir.2014). Further, even if a parallel state proceeding falls within one of these categories, abstention is not appropriate when \u201cextraordinary circumstances exist such that deference to the state proceeding will present a significant and immediate potential for irreparable harm to the federal interests asserted.\u201d <em>Zahl v. Harper, </em>282 F.3d 204, 209 (3d Cir.2002) (quotation marks, alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The proceedings that Hessein seeks to interrupt fit squarely within the categories described above. First, Hessein has requested an order enjoining his state criminal action, which is the paradigmatic situation calling for <em>Younger </em>abstention. <em>See Younger, </em>401 U.S. at 54, 91 S.Ct. 746. Likewise, it was proper for the District Court to refuse to enter an order concerning \u201c[tjhe propriety of arrests and the admissibility of evidence\u201d in the state criminal proceedings. <em>See Perez v. Ledesma, </em>401 U.S. 82, 84, 91 S.Ct. 674, 27 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971); <em>see also Dubinka v. Judges of the Superior Court, </em>23 F.3d 218, 223 (9th Cir.1994). The same conclusion also applies to Hessein\u2019s efforts to enjoin the state criminal forfeiture proceedings. <em>See Loch v. Watkins, </em>337 F.3d 574, 579 (6th Cir.2003). Finally, we agree with the District Court that the administrative prosecution before the New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners represents the type of \u201ccivil enforcement proceeding\u201d for which abstention is appropriate. <em>See Middlesex Cnty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>457 U.S. 423, 432, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982); <em>Zahl, </em>282 F.3d at 209-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Hessein argues that extraordinary circumstance exist here rendering abstention inappropriate. More specifically, he contends that he is being prosecuted for committing Medicare fraud, an offense that implicates federal, rather than state, interests. <em>See Zahl, </em>282 F.3d at 210 (explaining that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d may be presented when the case involves \u201cstate proceedings that entrench upon the federal domain\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">We are not persuaded. As an initial matter, in <em>Zahl, </em>we rejected this precise argument when raised by a party seeking to justify federal injunction of a state medical-disciplinary proceeding; we held that \u201cNew Jersey\u2019s regulation of the licensing and behavior of its physicians .... is a matter of paramount state interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212. This holding applies here and forecloses Hessein\u2019s argument -with respect to his disciplinary proceeding. As to his criminal prosecution, the state has charged Hessein under a general statute criminalizing false medical claims,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the documents he attached to his complaint reveal that the criminal prosecution is focused at least in part on his conduct toward private (non-Medicare) insurers. We have recognized that states have significant interests in \u201cmedical fee regulation,\u201d <em>Pa. Med. Soc\u2019y v. Marconis, </em>942 F.2d 842, 846 (3d Cir.1991), and \u201cthe regulation of [their] insurance industry,\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r of Pa., </em>874 F.2d 926, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>934 (3d Cir.1989), and Hessein has not identified any legal authority suggesting that Congress has intended to displace these state functions, see <em>Zahl, </em>282 F.3d at 212. Accordingly, we discern no error in the District Court\u2019s application of the <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrine here.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Finally, Hessein presented a claim for money damages against Union County and the prosecutor\u2019s office. This claim lacks merit: prosecutors are immune from damages in a \u00a7 1983 action for the initiation of prosecution and presentation of a state\u2019s case, <em>see Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976), and Hessein failed to plead that Union County has any role in his prosecution, <em>see Coleman v. Kaye, </em>87 F.3d 1491, 1499 (3d Cir.1996); <em>see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. We also grant Hessein\u2019s motion to file a supplemental reply brief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\">. Hessein was charged with \"health care claims fraud,\u201d which is defined as \"making, or causing to be made, a false, fictitious, fraudulent, or misleading statement of material fact in, or omitting a material fact from, or causing a material fact to be omitted from, any record, bill, claim or other document, in writing, electronically or in any other form, that a person attempts to submit, submits, causes to be submitted, or attempts to cause to be submitted for payment or reimbursement for health care services.\u201d N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:21-4.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-11\">. We note that in his appellate briefs, Hessein has raised numerous claims that he did not present in the District Court. We will not address the merits of these claims for the first time on appeal. <em>See Smith v. Commissioner of Social Security, </em>631 F.3d 632, 637 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
