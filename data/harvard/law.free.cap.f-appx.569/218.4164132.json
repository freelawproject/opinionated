By moving to proceed IFP, Kendrick challenges the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Kendrick has also moved for leave to file a supplemental brief discussing proposed statutory and guidelines amendments affecting the sentencing ranges for federal drug offenses. The motion to supplement is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-22\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o).\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-23\">Citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) and <em>United States v. Wren, </em>706 F.3d 861 (7th Cir.2013), Kendrick argues that, because he received a downward departure based on substantial assistance to the Government, the district court was able to further reduce his sentence even though his original sentence was lower than the statutory minimum term. Section 1B1.10(b)(2)(B), however, addresses the extent to which a district court may reduce a sentence under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). In this case, Amendments 750 and 759 and the FSA were already in effect at the time that Kendrick was sentenced. His base offense level at the time of sentencing was a 28, and it remained unchanged at the time he filed his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(6). Thus, the amendments on which Kendrick relies did not have the effect of lowering'his applicable guidelines range, and the district court had no authority to reduce Kendrick\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In light of the foregoing, Kendrick has not demonstrated that he will present a nonfrivolous issue with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his request for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b240-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
