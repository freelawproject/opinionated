He was sentenced to 71 months of imprisonment and two years of supervised release. Jimenez-Ramirez now appeals. He contends that his sentence is unreasonable and violates the Equal Protection Clause. He also contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">We review criminal sentences for reasonableness \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We examine the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts de novo. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). De novo review applies to constitutional claims, <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>633 F.3d 370, 373 (5th Cir.2011), and claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>United States v. Faubion, </em>19 F.3d 226, 228 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">The district court did not procedurally err by enhancing Jimenez-Ramirez\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Jimenez-Ramirez\u2019s argument that his August 2012 removal was not \u201csubsequent to\u201d his 1999 conviction of bank robbery lacks merit. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1326(b)(2), \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. l(A)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">Jimenez-Ramirez has not shown that the district court procedurally erred, exceeded its discretion, or imposed an unreasonable sentence when it assigned a term of supervised release to provide added deterrence in his case. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601; \u00a7 5D1.1(c); \u00a7 5D1.1, comment. (n.5); <em>United States v. Becerril-Pena, </em>714 F.3d 347, 349-50 (5th Cir.2013). Nor has he shown that imposing supervised release on deportable aliens violates equal protection. <em>See Gallegos-Hernandez v. United States, </em>688 F.3d 190, 195 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-16\">Finally, Jimenez-Ramirez was not denied the effective assistance of counsel. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The record contradicts Jimenez-Ramirez\u2019s assertion that his attorney performed deficiently or prejudiced him by failing to effectively raise his pro se sentencing challenges. An attorney\u2019s failure to make meritless arguments is not ineffective lawyering. <em>Johnson v. Cockrell, </em>306 F.3d 249, 255 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
