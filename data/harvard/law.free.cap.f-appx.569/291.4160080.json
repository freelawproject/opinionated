Fowler argues that the 2-level dangerous weapon enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), was not warranted because the evidence reflects that he was never seen physically possessing a firearm. He contends that the appeal waiver in his plea agreement does not preclude him from raising this issue on appeal because he did not receive a fair sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-19\">The Government moves for summary dismissal of the appeal because Fowler\u2019s appeal is barred by the waiver of appeal in the plea agreement and also because Fowler failed to file a timely notice of appeal. In the alternative, the Government requests an extension of time to file its appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-20\">The Government\u2019s motion is well-taken on both grounds. Fowler\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed, and when the Government objects on that ground, this court must enforce this claims-processing rule. <em>See Eberhart v. United States, </em>546 U.S. 12, 18, 126 S.Ct. 403, 163 L.Ed.2d 14 (2005). Even if we overlooked the untimeliness of the notice of appeal, the record reflects that Fowler knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence, <em>see United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292 (5th Cir.1994), and that his argument is barred by the appeal waiver. Therefore, the Government\u2019s motion for summary dismissal is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion to extend the time to file its brief is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AxL\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
