Linge was convicted and sentenced in Georgia state court in 2011 for abandonment, based on his failure to pay child support. In his complaint, which was filed in January 2013, Linge referred to himself as \u201cJack N.: Linge\u201d and argued that he was a sovereign citizen and the name \u201cJACK LINGE\u201d was a \u201ccertified title\u201d in which he had proprietary ownership. As a result, he argued that he was not subject to the jurisdiction of Georgia state courts or Georgia law, and he asked the district court to nullify the Georgia state court criminal proceedings, conviction, and sentence, and to prevent Georgia from collecting child support from him in the future. The district court dismissed his complaint, construing it to name the State of Georgia as the sole defendant and determining that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine barred the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-19\">On appeal, he reiterates the arguments brought in his complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He claims that he is a sovereign citizen and not a citizen of Georgia nor subject to any government, and makes various other claims challenging the enforceability of his Georgia state conviction. He states that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies only to \u201cunrebutted corporate \u2018persons\u2019 \u201d not protected by the Bill of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-20\">\u201cThe <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Brown v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>611 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2010). When the doctrine applies, it \u201cbars federal district courts from reviewing state court decisions.\u201d <em>Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir.2009). The Supreme Court has held that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is very narrow and applies only in \u201climited circumstances.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 291, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). It applies only to bar \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine also applies to federal claims that are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a state-court judgment, unless the litigant \u201cdid not have a reasonable opportunity to raise [the] federal claim in state proceedings.\u201d <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir. 2009). \u201cA claim is inextricably intertwined if it would \u2018effectively nullify\u2019 the state-court judgment or it \u2018succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">The district court did not err in determining that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Linge\u2019s claim or in dismissing the claim <em>sua sponte </em>as frivolous pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine barred Linge\u2019s claim, as he lost a Georgia state-court case, claimed injuries in this action based on the state-court judgment, initiated this action after the state-court judgment was final, and asked the district court to nullify the state-court judgment. Further, to the extent that he more broadly argues that he is a sovereign citizen and is not subject to the jurisdiction of Georgia state courts or Georgia laws, both we and the district court lack jurisdiction to consider his claim because it is \u201cwholly insubstantial and frivolous.\u201d <em>See Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ala. v. Sanders, </em>138 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.1998) (stating a federal court may dismiss a federal claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction if the claim is \u201cwholly insubstantial and frivolous\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-16\">.
