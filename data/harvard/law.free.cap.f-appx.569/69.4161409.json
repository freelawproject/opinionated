For the reason that follows, we will deny the mandamus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-17\">Gee filed a habeas corpus petition in 2011, which the District Court dismissed as time-barred on April 3, 2014. Prior-to that disposition, the matter had been pending without action for two years. Gee prepared and mailed his mandamus petition before the District Court acted on his habeas petition, but the mandamus petition was docketed shortly after the District Court\u2019s decision. The Clerk notified Gee that a decision had been issued regarding his habeas petition, but Gee did not seek to withdraw his mandamus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-18\">As the District Court has already done what Gee asks this Court to order it to do\u2014rule on his habeas petition\u2014Gee\u2019s mandamus petition is moot. <em>See In re Surrick, </em>338 F.3d 224, 230 (3d Cir.2003) (noting that \u201cthe central question of all mootness problems is whether changes in circumstances that prevailed at the beginning of the litigation have forestalled any occasion for meaningful relief\u2019) (quotation marks omitted). We will therefore deny the mandamus petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
