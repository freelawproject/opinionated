After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-16\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"A4d\">A. Trial and Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b884-17\">In a five-count superseding indictment, Joseph was charged with conspiring to buy and illegally transport firearms from the United States to Haiti, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (Count 1); unlawfully transporting firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(e), 924(a)(1)(D) (Count 2); attempting to transport firearms to a person residing outside the same state, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(5) (Count 3); providing false and fictitious information to a federally licensed firearms dealer in relation to the acquisition of firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6) (Count 4); and attempting to export firearms from the United States to Haiti (Count 5), violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-18\">After a jury trial, Joseph was found guilty on all counts. The district court imposed a total 63-month sentence, consisting of 60-month sentences on Counts 1, 2, and 3, and 63-month sentences on Counts 4 and 5, all to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>B. First Appeal and Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">In Joseph\u2019s first appeal, this Court affirmed Joseph\u2019s convictions and sentences on Counts 1, 2, 4, and 5. As to Count 3, the Court vacated Joseph\u2019s conviction and 60-month concurrent sentence because Count 3 failed to allege a federal offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(5). <em>See United States v. Joseph, </em>530 Fed.Appx. 911, 917 (11th Cir.2013).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The Court rejected several sentencing arguments raised by Joseph. The Court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) the district court had properly denied Joseph\u2019s request for a minor-role reduction; and (2) Joseph\u2019s 63-months sentence, \u201cimposed at the lowest end of the guidelines range, was procedurally and substantively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 927-28. This Court specified that \u201ceven without Count 3, [it could not] say that Joseph\u2019s 63-month total sentence ... was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">This Court remanded \u201cfor the district court to enter a corrected judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In so doing, we noted that a new sentencing hearing was not required, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApX\">As shown by the calculations above, Count 3 did not affect Joseph\u2019s guidelines calculations, and Joseph was given a reasonable sentence at the low end of the guidelines range. Thus, we do not require the district court to hold a new sentencing hearing. <em>See, e.g., United States v. McGarity, </em>669 F.3d 1218, 1270-71 (11th Cir.2012) (vacating convictions and sentences on some counts of the defendants\u2019 indictment, without requiring the district court to resentence those defendants). However, the district court does retain the discretion to have an additional sentencing hearing if it concludes the vacatur of Count 3 affects in any way its sentencing decision on the other counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 928 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">C. Amended Judgment on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">On remand, the district court entered an amended judgment without requesting a new presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) or holding a hearing. The amended judgment states that Joseph was found not guilty on Count 3. The district court re-imposed a total prison term of 63 months, consisting of 60-month sentences for Counts 1 and 2, and 63-month sentences for Counts 4 and 5, all to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b885-15\">On appeal, Joseph contends the district court abused its discretion and violated Joseph\u2019s due process rights by amending the judgment without ordering a new PSI and holding a resentencing hearing. We disagree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-16\">Although both the due process clause and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43(a)(3) give the defendant the right to be present at sentencing, that right does not extend to every instance of judicial action modifying a sentence. <em>See United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number><em>v. Parrish, 427 </em>F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir. 2005). Here, this Court did not vacate the entire sentencing package on direct appeal, but instead issued only a limited remand; Joseph\u2019s 63-months sentence reimposed on remand was not more onerous. Given the particular circumstances here, Joseph was not entitled to be present and allocute at a resentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1522 (11th Cir.1996) (concluding the district court did not plainly err in not giving the defendant an opportunity to allocute because the defendant\u2019s entire sentencing package was not vacated on direct appeal and remand was limited to consideration of a single sentencing issue); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>923 F.2d 1494, 1497 (11th Cir. 1991) (\u201c[W]here the entire sentencing package has not been set aside, a correction of an illegal sentence [under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35] does not constitute a resentencing requiring the presence of the defendant, so long as the modification does not make the sentence more onerous.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Taylor, </em>11 F.3d 149, 151-52 (11th Cir.1994) (relying upon <em>Jackson </em>to conclude the defendant was entitled to allocute at resentencing because district court granted the defendant\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, vacated the defendant\u2019s sentence in its entirety, and held a resentencing hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">In this case, this Court vacated only Joseph\u2019s Count 3 conviction and sentence and did not vacate his entire sentencing package. Further, the Court\u2019s remand was limited to \u201centering] a corrected judgment.\u201d The Court\u2019s limited mandate did not require the district court to hold a resentencing hearing. Rather, the Court\u2019s remand gave the district court the discretion to hold a hearing <em>if </em>it concluded that the vacatur of Count 3 affected its sentencing decision on the other counts. Stated another way, if the district court concluded that the vacatur of Count 3 had no effect on its sentencing decisions as to Joseph\u2019s other counts, the court would not hold a resentencing hearing. Consistent with this Court\u2019s mandate, the district court, after concluding that the vacatur of Count 3 did not undermine its sentencing determinations on the remaining counts, imposed the same sentence without holding a hearing. Joseph was not required to be present at a re-sentencing hearing before the district court could amend the judgment and reimpose the same sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Joseph contends that: (1) the district court originally considered Joseph\u2019s conduct in Count 3 in denying his request for a minor-role reduction; (2) this Court vacated Count 3; and (3) thus, the district court was required hold a hearing and reconsider Joseph\u2019s minor-role request. This argument ignores the fact that, in Joseph\u2019s first appeal, this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of Joseph\u2019s request for a minor-role reduction and stated that \u201cCount 3 did not affect Joseph\u2019s guidelines calculations.\u201d <em>Joseph, </em>530 Fed.Appx. at 929 n. 10. Accordingly, the mandate rule and the law-of-the-case doctrine precluded the district court from revisiting, and Joseph from relitigating, the issue of Joseph\u2019s role on remand. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>429 F.3d 1032, 1035 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining the doctrine of the law of the case precludes a party from relitigating issues decided in an earlier appeal of the same case); <em>Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d at 1519-20 (explaining that, under the mandate rule, which is an application of the law-of-the-case doctrine, a district court can only \u201csettle so much as has been remanded,\u201d and cannot address sentencing issues already decided in the first appeal (quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>We also reject Joseph\u2019s argument that a new PSI and sentencing hearing were required under <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011), so he could present evidence of his post-sentencing rehabilitation. In <em>Pepper, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that, \u201cwhen a defendant\u2019s sentence has been set aside on appeal and his case remanded for re-sentencing,\u201d the court may consider evidence of post-sentencing rehabilitation. <em>Pepper, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1241. The Supreme Court stressed, however, that the appellate court had \u201cset aside Pepper\u2019s entire sentence and remanded for a <em>de novo </em>resentencing,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1251, and that its decision did not \u201cpreclude courts of appeals from issuing limited remand orders, in appropriate cases, that may render evidence of post-sentencing rehabilitation irrelevant in light of the narrow purposes of the remand proceeding,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1249 n. 17. Here, given the narrow scope of this Court\u2019s limited remand, nothing in <em>Pepper </em>required the district court to order a new PSI and hold a resentencing hearing so Joseph could introduce rehabilitation evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s decision on remand to amend the judgment and re-impose the same total 63-month sentence without ordering a new PSI and holding a resentencing hearing was not an abuse of the limited discretion our mandate conferred upon it and did not violate Joseph\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-8\">. The Court agreed with the parties that Count 3 of Joseph's indictment alleged an attempt to transfer firearms to an out-of-state resident, but that \u00a7 922(a)(5) prohibits only a completed, and not an attempted, offense, and the indictment did not rely on any other federal statute prohibiting an attempt. <em>Joseph, </em>530 Fed.Appx. at 917-18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b885-9\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s compliance with this Court's mandate from a previous appeal. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 829 (11th Cir.2007). We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s exercise of the limited discretion left to it by our mandate. <em>Pelletier v. Zweifel, </em>987 F.2d 716, 718 (11th Cir.1993). \"We review for harmless error claims that a defendant was entitled to be present at various stages of a criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Parrish, </em>427 F.3d 1345, 1346-47 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b886-5\">. For the same reasons, we are barred from considering Joseph's argument in this second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>appeal that his re-imposed 63-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. A panel of this Court already decided that, even without Count 3, Joseph\u2019s total 63-month sentence is reasonable. <em>See Joseph, </em>530 Fed.Appx. at 928. We are bound by that earlier determination. <em>See United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1561 (11th Cir.1997) (stating that the determination of a legal issue establishes the \u2019\u2019law of the case and must be followed ... on a later appeal in the appellate court\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
