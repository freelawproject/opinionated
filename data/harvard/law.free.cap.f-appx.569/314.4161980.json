Ramirez-Mata, </em>539 Fed.Appx. 348 (5th Cir.2013) (per curiam), because Pena-Medrano\u2019s challenge to the denial of an additional one-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b) was foreclosed by <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 377-78 (5th Cir.2008). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded \u201cfor further consideration in light of the position asserted by the Solicitor General.\u201d <em>Garcia v.

U.S.S.G. Manual, Supp. to App. C, Amendment 775, at 43-46 (2013). In <em>United States v. Villegas Palacios, </em>No. 13\u201440153, 2014 WL 2119096, at *1, 2014 U.S.App. LEXIS 9493, at *2 (5th Cir. May 21, 2014) (per curiam), we applied Amendment 775 to a case on direct appeal in which the error was preserved and the government conceded error. The panel announced that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-17\">\u25a0 the other judges on the Court have reviewed this opinion, and all active judges have assented. The Court en banc therefore concludes Newson\u2014to the extent it may constrain us from applying Amendment 775 to cases pending on direct appeal under our rule of orderliness\u2014is abrogated in light of Amendment 775.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-18\"><em>Id. </em>n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-19\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s order and <em>Villegas Palacios, </em>the judgment is VACATED and REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
