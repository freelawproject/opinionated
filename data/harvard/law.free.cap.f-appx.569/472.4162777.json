His counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-24\">Having carefully reviewed the record in accordance with our duty under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we affirm the convictions, and we conclude that those sentences that are subject to appellate review for reasonableness, <em>see United States v. Gregg, </em>451 F.3d 930, 937 (8th Cir.2006) <em>(United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not relate to statutorily imposed sentences), are not unreasonable, <em>see United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc) (appellate review of sentencing decision). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-25\">As for counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, we conclude that allowing counsel to withdraw at this time would not be consistent with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s 1994 Amendment to Part V of the Plan to Implement the Criminal Justice Act of 1964. We therefore deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as premature, without prejudice to counsel refil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>ing the motion upon fulfilling the duties set forth in the Amendment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-17\">.
