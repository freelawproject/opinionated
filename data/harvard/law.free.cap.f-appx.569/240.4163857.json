United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Bradham does not claim procedural error. He contends only that the sentence imposed is substantively unrea-^ sonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Because Bradham\u2019s sentence falls within the applicable statutory and Guidelines-sentencing range, we afford it a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding the application of the presumption of reasonableness to sentences within a properly calculated Guidelines range). We decline his invitation to re-weigh the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors because \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant\u201d. <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). Bradham fails to rebut the presumption that his sentence is substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
