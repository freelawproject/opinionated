The district court revoked his supervised release and sentenced Munoz to 24 months of imprisonment. Munoz now challenges the substantive reasonableness of his revocation sentence, which was within the advisory range, arguing that it is greater than nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>essary to achieve the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He asserts that the district court did not consider the fact of his self-surrender and that the sentence should not have been imposed consecutively to a state court sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">This court reviews revocation sentences under the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). Munoz argues that revocation sentences should be reviewed under the reasonableness standard as set forth in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He acknowledges that this issue is foreclosed, but he seeks to preserve the issue for further possible review.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The revocation sentence imposed in the instant case fell within the advisory range, and is, therefore, entitled to an appellate presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 809 (5th Cir.2008). Munoz\u2019s arguments amount to nothing more than a disagreement with the sentence imposed, and he fails to rebut the presumption of reasonableness attached to his sentence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
