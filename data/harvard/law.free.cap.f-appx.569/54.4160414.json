(\u201cTEI\u201d), Francis Greenburger, Robert Kantor, and Hyman Schermer\u2019s motion for summary judgment on his hostile work environment, retaliation, and national origin discrimination claims brought pursuant to Title VII and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-17\">\u201cWe review the grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>El Sayed v. Hilton Hotels Corp., </em>627 F.3d 931, 933 (2d Cir.2010). Summary judgment is appropriate only \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a); <em>Wright v. Goord, </em>554 F.3d 255, 266 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-18\">In an employment discrimination or retaliation case, summary judgment may be granted \u201cif the record conclusively revealed some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer\u2019s decision, or if the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer\u2019s reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred.\u201d <em>Reeves v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>Sanderson Plumbing Prods., </em>530 U.S. 133, 148, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000); <em>see also Schnabel v. Abramson, </em>232 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir.2000). Viewed in the light most favorable to Karimian, the record contains an overabundance of evidence of TEI\u2019s legitimate, nonretaliatory, and nondiscriminatory reasons for having laid Karimian off: that is, the company\u2019s significant cost-reduction measures\u2014taken in plaintiffs department and others\u2014in the wake of the 2008 financial downturn. No reasonable juror could conclude that bias against those of Iranian national origin motivated his discharge. Nor could a reasonable juror find that retaliation for complaining about Schermer\u2019s comments was a but-for reason for laying him off, <em>see Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, </em>570 U.S. 2-, 133 S.Ct. 2517, 2534, 186 L.Ed.2d 503 (2013). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Karimian\u2019s retaliation and national origin discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">We also affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs hostile-work environment claim. Drawing all inferences in Karimian\u2019s favor, Schermer made several general comments about Israel bombing Iran, and one specific comment about Karimian\u2019s \u201cIranian ass.\u201d On this record, no reasonable factfinder would conclude that the workplace was \u201cpermeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult,\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted), or that the environment \u201calter[ed] the conditions\u201d of Karimian\u2019s employment, <em>id. See also Petrosino v. Bell Atl., </em>385 F.3d 210, 223 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201cSimple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents of offensive conduct (unless extremely serious) will not support a claim of discriminatory harassment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">We have considered Karimian\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
