Kimble appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his \u201cMotion for a New Trial and Other Extraordinary Relief in the Interests of Justice\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and its subsequent order denying reconsideration of that order. We have reviewed the record and find that this appeal is frivolous. Accordingly, we deny leave to appeal in for-ma pauperis and dismiss the appeal for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Kimble v. Montgomery Cnty. Police Dep\u2019t, </em>No. 1:90-cv-00320-WMN (D.Md. Dec. 14, 2013; Jan. 28, 2014). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process. <em>DISMISSED.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b206-15\"> Noting that Kimble\u2019s notice of appeal lists only the order denying reconsideration, Appellees argue that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the order denying Kimble\u2019s motion for a new trial. However, because Kimble's informal brief adequately demonstrates his intent to appeal this order, and because Appellees were not prejudiced by the omission given the arguments in their response brief, we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review both orders. <em>See Canady v. Crestar Mortg. Corp., </em>109 F.3d 969, 974 (4th Cir.1997) (recognizing that failure to properly designate portion of judgment appealed <em>in </em>notice of appeal \"will not result in a loss of appeal as long as the intent to appeal a specific judgment can fairly be inferred and the appellee is not prejudiced by the mistake\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
