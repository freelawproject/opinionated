CARNEY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b60-15\"> The Clerk of the Court is directed to amend the caption as above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b60-13\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b60-14\">ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of said District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-17\">Plaintiff-appellant David Pedi appeals from a July 31, 2013 judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Briccetti, <em>J.), </em>granting defendant-appellee Government Employees Insurance Company\u2019s (\u201cGEI-CO\u2019s\u201d) motion for summary judgment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-18\">Pedi asserts that GEICO\u2019s termination of his employment was retaliatory in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>and the New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Executive Law \u00a7 290 <em>et seq. </em>We review each of Pedi\u2019s retaliation claims under the burden-shifting framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See, e.g., Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., </em>596 F.3d 93, 105 n. 6, 110 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-19\">We assume, without deciding, that Pedi sufficiently established a prima facie case of retaliation at this stage of the litigation. We agree with the district court that there is no genuine dispute that GEICO set forth a legitimate, non-discriminatory, non-retaliatory reason for terminating Pedi\u2019s employment\u2014namely, his involvement in the matter related to his sister\u2019s vehicle, which violated GEICO\u2019s code of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-20\">Thus, under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, the burden shifts back to Pedi to establish a genuine dispute that GEI-CO\u2019s decision to terminate him was, in fact, retaliatory and that GEICO\u2019s reliance on Pedi\u2019s violation of the company\u2019s code of conduct was merely pretext. <em>See Gorzynski, </em>596 F.3d at 106, 110. Pedi has failed to carry that burden here. GEI-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>CO\u2019s stated preferences for experienced workers, and William Carr\u2019s statements related to older workers, are insufficient to create a genuine dispute that Pedi was terminated because of his complaints regarding age discrimination. In addition, the ways in which Carr\u2019s deposition testimony varied from the other record evidence does not support the reasonable conclusion that he was trying to cover up for recommending Pedi\u2019s termination based on a retaliatory motive. Nor were the other GEICO employees that Pedi claims received better treatment than he similarly situated to Pedi. Finally, the timing of Pedi\u2019s termination in relationship to his complaints does not alter our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">We have considered the remainder of Pedi\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
