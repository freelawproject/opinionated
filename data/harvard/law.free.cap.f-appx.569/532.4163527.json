In denying Avila leave to amend, the district court determined that, even if Avila\u2019s proposed revisions were successful .in curing the deficiencies in the original complaint, the court would decline to exercise jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act. <em>See Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of Am., </em>316 U.S. 491, 494, 62 S.Ct. 1173, 1175, 86 L.Ed. 1620 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">We construe the district court\u2019s ruling as a dismissal under <em>Brillhart, </em>and conclude that the court properly exercised its discretion in dismissing on this ground. Applying the <em>Brillhart </em>factors, the district court determined that it should not assert jurisdiction over Avila\u2019s declaratory relief claim because, \u201c[a]t the time that [Avila] filed this Complaint, there was a proceeding pending in Mexico\u2014which is still pending\u2014discussing issues relating directly to this Complaint and involving essentially the same parties.\u201d Moreover, \u201cadjudication of Plaintiffs declaratory action could result in duplicative litigation and lead to inconsistent rulings by this Court and the Mexican court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">In light of these circumstances, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to entertain Avila\u2019s claim 'for declaratory relief. We further conclude that, given the interrelated nature of Avila\u2019s accounting and equitable indemnity claims and the declaratory relief claim, and the fact that he was willing to dismiss the former two claims in his amended complaint, Avila\u2019s accounting and equitable indemnity claims were properly dismissed as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">The district court did, however, err in dismissing Avila\u2019s action \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d The phrase \u201cdismissal with prejudice\u201d is \u201csynonymous\u201d with \u201c[fjinal judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>Hells Canyon Pres. Council v. U.S. Forest Serv., </em>403 F.3d 683, 686 (9th Cir.2005). Here, the district court clearly did not intend to finally decide the merits. Instead, it contemplated that Avila would litigate his claims in Mexico. We remand to the district court with directions to correct the dismissal order to reflect that dismissal of the complaint is \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">In light of the foregoing, we need not resolve whether the district court erred in granting Guillen\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and forum non conveniens.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">AFFIRMED in part and REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b555-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
