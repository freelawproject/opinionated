He argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to justify a sentence six times above the top end of the guideline range. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-16\">The defendant bears the burden to show his sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008). We review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion using a two-step process. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. Normally we look first at whether the sentence is procedurally reasonable. <em>Id. </em>Here, however, Ferrao does not assert any procedural error in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-18\">Second, we examine whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the guideline range. <em>Id. </em>If the sentence imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented, the weight given to any specific sentencing factor in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>See United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). \u201c[A] district judge must give serious consideration to the extent of any departure from the Guidelines and must explain [her] conclusion that an unusually lenient or an unusually harsh sentence is appropriate in a particular case with sufficient justifications.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). At the same time, a sentence outside the guideline range does not require extraordinary circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 47, 128 S.Ct. at 595. We will reverse a sentence for being substantively unreasonable only when \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-19\">Here, Ferrao has not met his burden to show that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. <em>See Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1189-90. At sentencing, the district court noted that Ferrao\u2019s guideline range was zero to six months. However the district court, relying on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, found that a sentence in that range would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>be inadequate. In so finding the district court relied on the nature of the offense, 18 U.S.C.. \u00a7 3553(a)(1); the seriousness of the offense, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A); and the need to afford adequate deterrence to this kind of criminal conduct, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B). The district court also considered undisputed facts in the presentence report describing Ferrao\u2019s conduct. Based on these findings and weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court sentenced Ferrao to 36-months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Given the totality of the circumstances, Ferrao\u2019s 36-month sentence is within the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of this case, especially considering the wide-ranging nature of the credit card fraud conspiracy to which Ferrao pleaded guilty. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190. Ferrao\u2019s argument essentially asks us to reweigh the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which we do not do as long as the ultimate sentence is reasonable. <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010). While, as Ferrao argues, the applicable guideline range and proportionality with codefendants are also relevant factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(4), (a)(6), we cannot say the district court\u2019s decision to weigh other factors more heavily was unreasonable. <em>See Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
