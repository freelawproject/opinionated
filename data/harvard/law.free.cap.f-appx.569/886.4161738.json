The district court ruled that the losses were excluded from coverage under Dashtpeyma\u2019s insurance policy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>The district court did not err by entering summary judgment in favor of Liberty Insurance. Under Georgia law, which the parties agree applies, \u201cinsurance is a matter of contract, and the parties to an insurance policy are bound by its plain and unambiguous terms.\u201d <em>Richards v. Hanover Ins. Co., </em>250 Ga. 613, 299 S.E.2d 561, 563 (1983). Dashtpeyma\u2019s policy covered losses to his home \u201ccaused by rain, snow, sleet, sand [and] dust\u201d if the substances entered through \u201can opening in a roof or wall\u201d created by \u201cthe direct force of wind or hail damages,\u201d but the policy excluded all losses caused by \u201c[w]ear and tear, marring, [or] deterioration.\u201d Liberty Insurance submitted photographs; an affidavit and testimony from its adjuster, James Monaghan; and the depositions of its loss specialist, Ralph Gill, and of an independent adjuster, Eric Aucoin, that established that Dashtpeyma\u2019s home was damaged when rain water leaked through rotted wood on window sills and pieces of siding. This undisputed evidence proved that Dashtpeyma\u2019s loss was attributable to the deterioration of materials on the exterior of his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">No evidence supports Dashtpeyma\u2019s argument that Liberty Insurance fabricated evidence. Dashtpeyma challenged the authenticity of a letter written by Gill because it was dated before specific events mentioned in the letter occurred, but Gill explained that the letter was misdated and contained the correct dates, for the events. Although Dashtpeyma also argues that the damage could not be blamed on deterioration because Monaghan said there were no visible signs that the home had been neglected, Monaghan explained that the deterioration was hidden in the wood. Dashtpeyma failed to present any evidence that Liberty Insurance contrived a reason to deny coverage. Dashtpeyma acknowledged that he did not know how to identify rotten wood; he did not know whether his siding had rotted before the storm; and he was unaware how the water entered his home. No genuine factual dispute exists whether Dashtpeyma\u2019s loss is excluded from coverage under the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Liberty Insurance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
