(\u201cNovo\u201d), asserting age discrimination and retaliation claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1) and (d). After the issues were joined and the parties engaged in discovery, the District Court granted Novo\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and a final summary judgment was entered accordingly. Florence appeals, challenging in addition to the summary judgment two nondispositive orders entered by the Magistrate Judge: an order granting, in part, Novo\u2019s motion for a discovery protective order under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c), and an order granting, in part, Novo\u2019s motion for sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">We consider first the nondispositive orders entered by the Magistrate Judge. The background against which the orders were entered is informative, so we start with Florence\u2019s employment with Novo and go from there.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Novo is responsible for marketing Nor-disk A/S\u2019s pharmaceutical products in the United States\u2014in particular, products related to bleeding disorders. Florence went to work for Novo on January 8, 2001. He was 47 years old. Novo terminated his employment on November 19, 2010. His last job with the company was BioPharmaceutical Sales Manager. In that capacity, he contacted health care professionals about Nordisk A/S\u2019s products and provided them with educational tools and resources, including product literature. According to Novo, it terminated Florence\u2019s employment because of his poor job performance\u2014his failure to meet the minimum requirements of his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">On March 14, 2011, Florence filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Florida Commission on Human Relations, alleging that he was subjected to age discrimination and retaliated against in violation of the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992 (\u201cFCRA\u201d), FLA. STAT. \u00a7 760.01 <em>et seq. </em>and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>On September 8, 2011, following its investigation into the matter, the Commission determined that there was no reasonable cause to believe that Novo had engaged in any unlawful employment practice, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-8\">[Florence] was terminated for a legitimate non-discriminatory reason. Specifically, [he] was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan to assist him in conquering his performance problems. [He] was repeatedly counseled on his failure to meet the minimum requirements for his position and when he failed to do so despite being given abundant opportunity, [Novo] terminated [his] employment. Additionally, [Novo] was able to prove that eight of the ten staff members [his supervisor supervised] over were over the age of 40.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjX\">Doc. 10-3, at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">Notwithstanding the Commission\u2019s no-reasonable-cause determination, Florence, on September 30, 2011, initiated a proceeding on his FCRA age discrimination and retaliation claims before the Florida Division of Administrative Hearings (\u201cDOAH\u201d), <em>Joseph G. Florence v. Novo Nordisk Inc., </em>DOAH Case No. 11-51113. While the case was before DOAH, Florence obtained extensive, discovery from Novo, including the taking of depositions of Novo employees possessing information relevant to his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">The ALJ set March 21, 2012, as the trial date for Florence\u2019s case. On March 15, Florence withdrew his claims, and his DOAH case was closed. Then, on April 19, 2012, he brought the instant law suit. His complaint contained the same allegations he had presented to the ALJ in the DOAH proceeding, except that they were brought only under the ADEA. Florence thereafter served Novo with the same discovery requests he previously made in the DOAH proceeding. On October 5, 2012, Novo, in an effort to avoid having to duplicate the discovery it had provided Florence in the DOAH proceeding, moved the District Court for a protective order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c). The District Judge referred the motion to the Magistrate Judge, who held several hearings on the matter. On December 19, 2012, the Magistrate Judge granted Novo\u2019s protective order in part and denied it in part\u2014granting Florence permission to redepose his immediate supervisor regarding any documents pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>duced in discovery after he deposed the supervisor in the DOAH proceeding, and to depose two individuals who had knowledge about Florence\u2019s job performance\u2014 and deferred ruling in part. Doc. 20, at 1-2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 8, 2013, the Magistrate Judge resolved the deferred issues in favor of Novo. Doc. 24. Florence did not file objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">On April 10, 2013, Novo moved the District Court Novo to enter an order awarding it expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(5)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court referred the matter to the Magistrate Judge. On August 23, 2013, the Magistrate Judge entered an order granting Novo\u2019s motion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-5\">Defendant is entitled to up to seventy-five percent of its reasonable expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred in filing the motion for protective order. This is appropriate as Defendant\u2019s motion for protective order was granted as to most of the relief sought.... If the parties are unable to agree as to the amount, the Court will decide the amount of sanctions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Doc. 64, at 6. Florence did not file objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order pursuant to Rule 72(a). Meanwhile, on May 1, 2013, Novo moved the District Court for summary judgment. The court granted the motion on October 17, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">With this background in hand, we consider now Florence\u2019s challenges to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s nondispositive orders granting in part Novo\u2019s motions for a protective order and for expenses and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">A party, or any person from whom discovery is sought, may move for a protective order in the court where the action is pending. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c). The motion should be \u201cplain enough and specific enough so that the court can understand in what way the interrogatories are alleged to be objectionable.\u201d <em>Panola Land Buyers Ass\u2019n v. Shuman, </em>762 F.2d 1550, 1559 (11th Cir.1985). If it grants the motion, the court must limit the frequency or extent of discovery if it determines that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-14\">(i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-15\">(ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity to obtain the information by discovery in the action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-16\">(iii) the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties\u2019 resources, the importance of the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>at stake in the action, and the importance of discovery in resolving the issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Rule 72(a), Nondispositive Matters, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-7\">When a pretrial matter not dispositive of a party\u2019s claim or defense is referred to a magistrate judge to hear and d\u00e9cide, the magistrate judge must promptly conduct the required proceedings and, when appropriate, issue a written order stating the decision. A party may serve and file objections to the order within 14 days after being served with a copy. A party may not assign as error a defect in the order not timely objected to. The district judge in the case must consider timely objections and modify or set aside any part of the order that is clearly erroneous or is contrary to law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Novo\u2019s motion for a protective order was a nondispositive matter. Thus, the Magistrate Judge\u2019s ruling on the motion was a nondispositive order falling within Rule 72(a)\u2019s ambit. <em>See Maynard v. Bd. of Regents of Div. of Univs. of Florida Dept. of Educ. ex rel. Univ. of S. Florida, </em>342 F.3d 1281, 1286 (11th Cir.2003). If Florence thought the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order contained constituted an abuse of discretion, he had an obligation under Rule 72 to file an objection to the order in the District Court. He did not and therefore was precluded from filing an objection here, in his brief on appeal. \u201c[Wjhere a party fails to challenge a magistrate\u2019s nondispositive order before the district court, the party waived his right to appeal those orders in this Court.\u201d <em>Smith v. Sch. Bd. of Orange Cnty., </em>487 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir.2007). The result of Florence\u2019s failure to object is that the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order stands as if it were affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">Rule 37 provides that if a motion for a protective order is \u201cgranted in part and denied in part, the court ... may, after giving an opportunity to be heard, apportion the reasonable expenses\u201d for prosecuting or defending the motion. Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a)(5)(C). Rule 26(c) states that \u201cRule 37(a)(5) applies to the award of expenses.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c)(3). But the court must not award expenses if: (i) the movant filed the motion before attempting in good faith to resolve the issue without court action; (ii) the opposing party\u2019s actions were substantially justified; or (iii) other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust. Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a)(5)(A). Like the Magistrate Judge\u2019s ruling on Novo\u2019s Rule 26(c) motion, the Magistrate Judge\u2019s ruling on disposition of Novo\u2019s Rule 37(a)(5)(A) motion falls under Rule 72, and because he did not object to the ruling, we do not consider it here. The ruling stands as if it were affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Rojas v. Florida, </em>285 F.3d 1339, 1341 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cWhen deciding whether summary judgment is appropriate, all evidence and reasonable factual inferences drawn therefrom are reviewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1341-42. Summary judgment should be granted only when \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">The ADEA makes it \u201cunlawful for an employer ... to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>tions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1). When a plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence to establish his ADEA claim, as Florence did here, the district court applies the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Sims v. MVM, Inc., </em>704 F.3d 1327, 1332-33 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Under that framework, the plaintiff must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir.2000)(en <em>banc). </em>Second, if a <em>prima facie </em>case is established, the burden shifts to the employer to present a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the employment action. <em>Id. </em>Third, if the employer articulates such a reason, the plaintiff may present evidence sufficient for a factfinder to conclude that the employer\u2019s proffered reason is a pretext for discrimination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">A plaintiff may show that an employer\u2019s proffered legitimate nondiscriminatory reason is pretext by either \u201cpersuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Jackson v. State of Ala. State Tenure Comm\u2019n, </em>405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir. 2005). \u201cThe district court must evaluate whether the plaintiff has demonstrated such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable fact-finder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir.1997). A plaintiff seeking to show pretext must \u201cmeet [the reason] head on and rebut it.\u201d <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1088 (11th Cir.2004). We do not judge whether an employer\u2019s decisions are prudent or fair, but, instead, rather whether they were motivated by an unlawful animus. <em>Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., </em>196 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir.1999). Moreover, a reason is not pretextual \u201cunless it is shown both that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason.\u201d <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2751, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Florence did not meet Novo\u2019s reason for terminating him \u201chead on and rebut it.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>376 F.3d at 1088. He admitted that, in his position as a sales manager, his call average was low throughout his employment, and his former manager had expressed displeasure with his administrative efficiency and Blackberry use\u2014all issues outlined in the Performance Improvement Plan (\u201cPIP\u201d) that preceded his termination. Furthermore, even if company officials had already formed the intent to terminate him regardless of the results of his PIP, that did not show that they were going to terminate him anyway, <em>because of his age. See St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr., </em>509 U.S. at 515, 113 S.Ct. at 2751. Florence says his high sales numbers indicate pretext. But sales numbers were not at issue in his PIP, and we will not judge whether the employer\u2019s decisions were prudent or fair. <em>Damon, </em>196 F.3d at 1361. In sum, Florence did not present \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in Novo\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Combs, </em>106 F.3d at 1538.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Employers are forbidden from discriminating against any employee because that individual opposed any practice made unlawful by the ADEA\u2019s provisions. <em>See </em>29 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 623(d). The <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework governs ADEA retaliation cases. <em>See Hairston v. Gainesville Sun Publ\u2019g Co., </em>9 F.3d 913, 919 (11th Cir.1993) (noting that this court has adapted Title VII principles to ADEA cases, and applying the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework to an ADEA retaliation case). A plaintiff alleging retaliation in violation of the ADEA must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case by showing: (1) a statutorily protected expression; (2) a materially adverse action; and (3) a causal link between the protected expression and the adverse action. <em>See id. </em>Once the plaintiff has established a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, the burden shifts to the defendant to rebut the presumption of retaliation by producing legitimate reasons for the adverse employment action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">To obtain reversal of a district court judgment that is based on multiple, independent grounds, an appellant must convince this court that every stated ground is incorrect. <em>Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 680 (11th Cir.2014). When an appellant fails to challenge on appeal one of the grounds on which the district court based its judgment, he is deemed to have abandoned any challenge on that ground; hence, it follows that the judgment is due to be affirmed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">The District Court did not find that Florence established a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, and he has not expressly argued the issue on appeal, so it is abandoned, and the judgment is due to be affirmed on that ground. <em>Sapuppo, </em>739 F.3d at 680. Additionally, even if he had not abandoned the issue, and he had established a <em>prima facie </em>ease, Florence did not show that Novo\u2019s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions was merely a pretext for retaliation, for the same reasons he did not show that the reason was merely a pretext for age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-7\">. As it turned out, Florence did not depose the three witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b930-8\">. The motion represented that Novo</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-9\">was compelled to file its Motion for Protective Order, supplement its Case Management Report, prepare for and attend three hearings before [the] Magistrate Judge including an evidentiary hearing, and respond to Plaintiff's needless Motion to Extend Time to Complete Discovery to protect itself from Plaintiff's duplicative, burdensome, and harassing requests. Discovery is now closed and, ultimately, the only discovery Plaintiff obtained in this case was Defendant\u2019s 12 page supplemental document production. Notably, although this Court granted Plaintiff's Motion to Extend Time to Complete Discovery, Plaintiff did not take any depositions. Instead, out of the three depositions permitted by the Court, Plaintiff never scheduled one of them and he unilaterally cancelled the remaining two.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-18\">Doc. 34, at 1-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
