We deny Dong\u2019s petition for review as to her untimely motion to reopen, and we grant Dong\u2019s petition for review as to the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">I. Motion to Reopen Petition (No. 10-70006)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">On appeal to this court, Dong neglected to challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that she failed to submit evidence of changed country conditions in China in her untimely motion to reopen. This issue is therefore waived and this petition for review is denied. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">II. Merits Petition (No. 08-73489)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Dong also petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s decision dismissing her appeal from the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. \u201cWe review ... adverse credibility finding[s] under the substantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002). We conclude that substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination in this pre-REAL ID Act ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">1. The BIA\u2019s determination that Dong\u2019s Falun Gong claim was not credible is not supported by substantial evidence. First, although Dong did not mention in her asylum declaration that she was beaten while in detention during her first arrest, \u201cthe mere omission of details is insufficient to uphold an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir.2000). Moreover, the BIA and IJ put themselves in Dong\u2019s shoes and determined what they thought someone in Dong\u2019s situation would include in her asylum application. That is prohibited. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[T]he IJ\u2019s subjective view of what a persecuted person would include in [her] asylum application has no place in an adverse credibility determination.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">Second, the IJ\u2019s remaining adverse credibility findings as to Dong\u2019s Falun Gong claim were not specifically relied on by the BIA. In any event, none were supported by substantial evidence. The IJ\u2019s finding that Dong did not mention the second arrest on direct examination when her counsel asked her if there was anything else that she wanted to add was based on a misstatement of the record; she was never asked about or given an opportunity to talk about the second arrest during her direct examination. <em>See Mutuku v. Holder, </em>600 F.3d 1210, 1213 (9th Cir.2010) (where an adverse credibility determination is based on a clearly erroneous factual finding, it will not be upheld).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-15\">That Dong at first testified that she was arrested on September 4, 1999 before she corrected herself, saying she made a mistake because she was nervous, and then testified that she was arrested on Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>ber 8, 1999, and that she also misspoke about the date she started practicing with Shunzi Li at her home before correcting herself were trivial inconsistencies in dates, made a number of years after the events in question occurred. <em>See Rizk v. Holder, </em>629 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201c[M]inor inconsistencies regarding non-material and trivial details, such as ... inconsistencies in specific dates and times that lack a close nexus to the petitioner\u2019s asserted grounds of persecution, cannot form the exclusive basis for an adverse credibility determination.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">That Dong testified that sixteen people were arrested at the same time she was arrested for the second time was not actually inconsistent with her written statement, which said \u201cabout 20\u201d people, not exactly that number, as the IJ asserted; further, any possible discrepancy between sixteen and approximately twenty is minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">That Dong testified at first that she was interrogated twice during her first arrest and then clarified that she was interrogated twice in the interrogation room and once in the detention room was a minor inconsistency. Further, that she said in her written statement that she was interrogated three times without making a distinction in locations is a mere omission of details, not an inconsistency. <em>See Garrovillas v. INS, </em>156 F.3d 1010, 1014 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201c[I]nconsistencies of less than substantial importance for which a plausible explanation is offered\u201d cannot serve as the sole basis for a negative credibility finding); <em>Bandari, </em>227 F.3d at 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Any inconsistency regarding her passports did not go to the heart of her asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">2. The BIA\u2019s determination that Dong\u2019s forced abortion claim was not credible is also not supported by substantial evidence. The BIA gave four reasons for disbelieving Dong. The first was Dong\u2019s alleged inconsistent testimony regarding the date that Chinese family planning officials discovered Dong was pregnant. Yet, even if Dong\u2019s testimony was inconsistent in this respect, it is a minor inconsistency that does not support an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Vilorio-Lopez v. INS, </em>852 F.2d 1137, 1142 (9th Cir.1988) (a minor inconsistency that \u201creveal[s] nothing about an asylum applicant\u2019s fear for [her] safety [is] not an adequate basis for an adverse credibility finding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Second, the BIA found it was \u201cimplausible\u201d that officials would allow Dong to delay the abortion for three months after telling her \u201cthat an abortion was required right away.\u201d The record reveals, however, that Dong was told immediately, at the physical exam, that she would have to have the abortion, not that she was required to have the abortion immediately. Dong\u2019s subsequent testimony confirms this reading of the record. Dong testified: \u201c[T]hey told me to go [to] family planning classes for one month, and then told me to do the abortion.\u201d An erroneous factual finding based on a misreading of the record does not constitute substantial evidence to support an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Mutuku, </em>600 F.3d at 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Moreover, the BIA\u2019s determination that it was \u201cimplausible\u201d and \u201cunreasonable\u201d for family planning officials to allow Dong\u2019s pregnancy to progress while they waited for her voluntarily to undergo an abortion, especially since she \u201cwould have been vulnerable to enforcement of a forcible abortion at any time,\u201d is at odds with the 2005 Country Report on China in the record. The country report affirms Dong\u2019s testimony that social and economic pressure to adhere to the one-child policy are common, and that women are visited by family planning officials and reminded of their potential liabilities should they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>continue an unauthorized pregnancy. <em>See </em>2005 U.S. State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices in China. The country report thus supports Dong\u2019s testimony that officials coerced and pressured her to have an abortion, but did not immediately subject her to a forced abortion. The BIA\u2019s determination, therefore, cannot be upheld because it is based on mere speculation and conjecture that family planning officials would not allow Dong to voluntarily undergo the abortion. <em>See Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1071 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cWe cannot uphold an adverse credibility finding that rests on conjecture and speculation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The third reason the BIA gave for finding Dong incredible was the alleged contradictory statement in her testimony that \u201cshe was \u2018hiding\u2019 at either her cousin\u2019s or father\u2019s home while she was also attending the family planning classes.\u201d The record does not support this finding. Dong did not testify that she was hiding at the same time as she was going to family planning classes. Instead, she testified that (1) she went to family planning classes for a month; (2) she then went into hiding; (3) she was later found and taken back home where she resumed family planning classes for a week; and, finally, (4) the family planning committee director forcibly took her from her class to the hospital for the abortion. An erroneous factual finding does not support an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Mutuku, </em>600 F.3d at 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Finally, the BIA found unpersuasive Dong\u2019s statement that as long as she was not visibly pregnant, the family planning officials \u201cwere not insistent on seeing proof that her abortion had been completed.\u201d The BIA misinterpreted Dong\u2019s testimony and failed to address Dong\u2019s reasonable explanation that she postponed the abortion by telling the officials she would get the abortion the following week. Although the family planning officials knew Dong was pregnant, she testified that they did not force her to terminate her pregnancy because she told them she would do it on her own. Again, this is supported by the country report. Thus, the BIA\u2019s speculation and conjecture about what it believes the family planning officials would have done does not support an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Shah, </em>220 F.3d at 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Because the BIA\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence, Dong\u2019s testimony must be accepted as credible. <em>See Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 890 (9th Cir.2004). Dong is therefore statutorily eligible for asylum based on her credible forced abortion claim. <em>See Ding v. Ashcroft, </em>387 F.3d 1131, 1140 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201c[I]f an applicant is believed to have suffered forced abortion or sterilization, the applicant is <em>necessarily </em>eligible for asylum under the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the INA because such a person is automatically classified as a refugee under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B).\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, we grant the petition for review, and remand to the BIA, which shall, on behalf of the Attorney General, exercise discretion regarding whether to grant asylum based on Dong\u2019s forced abortion claim. <em>See id. </em>We remand for further proceedings as to whether Dong is eligible for withholding of removal and CAT relief based on either her Falun Gong or forced abortion claims. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Dong\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen (No. 10-70006) is DENIED. Dong\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s dismissal of her appeal from the IJ\u2019s denial of her application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT (No. 08-73489) is GRANTED, and REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
