Plaintiffs originally challenged the approval of increased patient copayments in an Arizona Medicaid demonstration project that provided healthcare benefits to individuals not otherwise covered by Arizona\u2019s Medicaid plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-26\">It is a well-settled that under Article III of the Constitution a federal court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to live cases and controversies. U.S. Const, art. III, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>order for a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over a claim, \u201ca litigant must have suffered, or be threatened with, an actual injury traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Cont\u2019l Bank Corp., </em>494 U.S. 472, 477, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990). The Arizona Medicaid demonstration program at issue and its corresponding administrative record expired on October 21, 2011, and, as such, this Court is unable to grant effective relief in this appeal because the challenged administrative decision and its corresponding administrative record are no longer in effect. <em>See generally Grand Canyon Trust v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, </em>691 F.3d 1008, 1017 (9th Cir.2012). Therefore, all claims stemming from that program and its administrative record are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">This is not a situation \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d This court recognizes that while \u201cthe mootness doctrine generally bars claims challenging an action that has already taken place, there is an exception for claims which \u2018may be repeated and yet evade review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nw. Res. Info. Ctr., Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Marine Fisheries Serv., </em>56 F.3d 1060, 1070 (9th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Alaska Fish &amp; Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. Dunkle, </em>829 F.2d 933, 939 (9th Cir.1987)). To qualify for this exception, \u201cthe injury suffered must be of a type inherently limited in duration such that it is likely always to become moot before federal court litigation is completed.\u201d <em>Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Lohn, </em>511 F.3d 960, 965 (9th Cir.2007). As a general matter, agency decisions fall within the \u201ccapable of repetition\u201d exception to the mootness doctrine if i) the duration of the challenged action is too short to allow full litigation before it ceases, and ii) there is a reasonable expectation that the complaining party will be subject to the same action again. <em>Greenpeace Action v. Franklin, </em>14 F.3d 1324, 1329 (9th Cir.1992). This appeal fails to meet either of these requirements. First, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims fail to satisfy the durational requirement needed to qualify for this exception. This court has consistently held that \u201can issue that \u2018evades review' is one which, in its regular course, resolves itself without allowing sufficient time for appellate review.\u201d <em>Biodiversity Legal Found, v. Badgley, </em>309 F.3d 1166, 1173-74 (9th Cir.2002). Plaintiffs had ample time to fully litigate these issues, and they did just that. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims do not evade review because they have been reviewed several times and by several courts. Second, there is no reasonable expectation that Plaintiffs will be subject to this same action again. It is unlikely, if not entirely impossible, that this dispute over the sufficiency and development of the administrative record accompanying Arizona\u2019s prior demonstration project will arise again because that program has expired and was replaced by a new demonstration project with a new administrative record. Ultimately, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that the facts on appeal fall within the narrow \u201ccapable of repetition\u201d exception to the mootness doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">This case is moot because the challenged agency decision and administrative record are now inoperative and a new administrative record supports the approval of the subsequent demonstration project and the corresponding increased copayments. Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is moot and is hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b547-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
