The BIA\u2019s order has three aspects: it decreed the petitioner\u2019s removal to his homeland (Albania); it rejected the petitioner\u2019s cross-applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture; and it denied the petitioner\u2019s motion, accompanied by, inter alia, evidence of psychiatric treatment and suicidal tendencies, to remand the case to the immigration judge (IJ) for consideration of the petitioner\u2019s eligibility for humanitarian asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)(iii)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-17\">In its brief in this court, the government has conceded that the BIA \u201cmisapprehended\u201d the basis of the petitioner\u2019s motion to remand and, therefore, never really resolved that motion. Despite this confession of error, the government argues that any error was harmless and, in effect, asks us to rule in the first instance on the claim for humanitarian asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-19\">We do not see why we should be put in a position of making a determination that the law requires the BIA to make. Moreover, we think that considerations of fairness, efficiency, and the appropriate husbanding of scarce judicial resources all militate in favor of remanding this case so that the BIA can do now what it should have done in the first place. <em>See INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (describing benefits of allowing BIA to decide issues in first instance). We therefore vacate the BIA\u2019s final order and remand to the BIA for further proceedings. <em>See Mejia v. Holder, </em>756 F.3d 64, 69 (1st Cir.2014) [No. 13-2202, 2014 WL 2872220, *3] (remanding issue not yet properly considered by the BIA and concluding that \u201cthe BIA must do its own work\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-20\">We have considered and rejected the possibility of deciding at this time the other issues presented in the petition for judicial review. Piecemeal judicial review of administrative orders is disfavored, <em>see Cano-Saldarriaga v. Holder, </em>729 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir.2013), and we see no need to indulge such piecemeal review in this case. On the one hand, the BIA may act favorably on the petitioner\u2019s motion to remand the case to the IJ; and if it does, those other issues, at least as presently framed, will become moot. If, on the other hand, the BIA denies the motion to remand after affording it due consideration, the BIA can simply reinstate the other aspects of its final order. The petitioner can then seek judicial review of all the issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>We need go no further. The petition for judicial review is granted; the final order of the BIA is vacated; and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">\n<em>So Ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
