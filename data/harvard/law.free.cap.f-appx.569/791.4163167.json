Pledger was convicted on one count of possession with intent to distribute, and distribution of, cocaine base within 1,000 feet of a public school in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 860(a), and one count of aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute cocaine base within 1,000 feet of a public school in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1), 860(a), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. At sentencing, the district court found that Pledger qualified as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1\u2014making the applicable Guidelines range 360 months to life\u2014and sentenced him to a term of 360 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-20\">On appeal, Pledger argues Amendment 750 entitles him to a reduced sentence. He acknowledges that, because he was sentenced as a career offender, our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), makes him ineligible for such a reduction. However, Pledger contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), abrogated <em>Moore </em>and entitles him to relief. We considered this same argument in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1320-21 (11th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012), and determined that <em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent notwithstanding the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman. </em>Accordingly, Pledger\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-25\">Pledger also argues that the FSA entitles him to a reduced sentence. However, the FSA does not apply to defendants who were sentenced before its enactment date. <em>See United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 181, 187 L.Ed.2d 124 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-28\">The United States has moved for summary affirmance and to stay the briefing schedule. Because the \u201cposition [of the United States] is clearly right as a matter of law so that there [is] no substantial question as to the outcome of the case,\u201d <em>see Groendyke Transp., Inc. v. Davis, </em>406 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>F.2d 1158, 1162 (5th Cir.1969),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we grant the motion for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision to deny Pledger\u2019s motion for a reduction and DISMISS as moot the motion to stay the briefing schedule.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-18\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this court adopted as precedent all decisions of the former United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rendered prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
