We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. <em>Hamilton v. Brown, </em>630 F.3d 889, 892 (9th Cir.2011). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The district court properly dismissed Herrera\u2019s due process claim because, even assuming that Herrera had a liberty interest in avoiding confinement in the Security Housing Unit, Herrera failed to allege facts sufficient to show that he was denied due process. <em>See Bruce v. Ylst, </em>351 F.3d 1283, 1287 (9th Cir.2003) (prison officials need only provide the inmate with notice of the charges against him and an opportunity to present his views and a prison gang validation need only be supported by \u201csome evidence\u201d); <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 448 (9th Cir.2000) (a prisoner possesses a liberty interest only when a change occurs in confinement that imposes an \u201catypical and significant hardship ... in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">To the extent that Herrera intended to allege a claim for retaliation, the district court properly dismissed Herrera\u2019s retaliation claim because Herrera failed to allege facts sufficient to show that defendants retaliated against him for exercising his constitutional rights. <em>See Bruce, </em>351 F.3d at 1288 (explaining elements of a prison retaliation claim under \u00a7 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Herrera\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel because Herrera failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances. <em>See Terrell v. Brewer, </em>935 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir.1991) (setting forth standard of review and explaining \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b511-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
