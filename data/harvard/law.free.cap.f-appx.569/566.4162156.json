MeHUGH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">This appeal arises out of the arbitration of a construction dispute between a subcontractor, Hungry Horse LLC, and a prime contractor, E Light Electric Services, Inc. (E Light). Hungry Horse claims the district court erred in denying its motion to vacate the arbitration award because the arbitration panel exceeded its authority. Exercising jurisdiction under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(3), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b589-17\">E Light engaged Hungry Horse to perform subcontractor duties on two solar panel projects in New Mexico. Toward completion of the projects, a dispute arose between the two regarding the amount Hungry Horse was owed for work completed under the subcontract and for additional work. Hungry Horse filed mechanic\u2019s liens against the projects, claiming it was owed approximately $2.8 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-18\">I. Mediation Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b589-19\">The parties first attempted to resolve their dispute through mediation. As part of that process, Hungry Horse and E Light each filed a written mediation statement, outlining their positions on the proper interpretation of the contract, the scope of the work performed, and the validity of the mechanic\u2019s hens. Neither party raised any issues with respect to Hungry Horse\u2019s contractor\u2019s license in its written mediation statement. When the mediation failed, the parties stipulated to submit their dispute to binding arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-20\">II. Arbitration Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b589-21\">Hungry Horse and E Light entered into an arbitration agreement that provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Pursuant to the statements made at the settlement conference held January 25, 2012, this is to confirm the Stipulation reached in the above-captioned case upon the following terms:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\">1. The parties agree to binding arbitration of all disputed issues including the issues related to the Mechanics Lien and Bond....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Aplt.App. 272. The parties further agreed the arbitration would be held in Colorado but governed by New Mexico law pursuant to the forum selection and choice of law provisions of their construction agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">To recover in a suit for compensation in New Mexico, a contractor must \u201calleg[e] and prov[e] that such contractor was a duly licensed contractor at the time the alleged cause of action arose.\u201d N.M. Stat. \u00a7 60-13-30(A); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 60-13-30(B) (stating that any contractor operating without a required license \u201cshall have no right to file or claim any mechanic\u2019s lien\u201d). Accordingly, Hungry Horse\u2019s statement of claims filed with the arbitration panel included an allegation stating, \u201c[Hungry Horse] is licensed to undertake the construction activities required by the expressed and implied agreement between the parties to this dispute.\u201d Aplt.App. 147. In its initial answer to Hungry Horse\u2019s statement of claims, E Light indicated it lacked sufficient information to confirm, and therefore denied, Hungry Horse\u2019s allegation with respect to its license. It also asserted affirmative defenses that Hungry Horse \u201cfailed to fulfill all conditions precedent to its right to assert its mechanic\u2019s liens\u201d and that Hungry Horse\u2019s \u201cmechanic\u2019s liens are invalid and unenforceable under applicable law.\u201d Aplt.App. 161. After discovery, E Light filed a supplemental answer to Hungry Horse\u2019s statement of claims in which it asserted as an affirmative defense that Hungry Horse was not duly licensed (the duly licensed issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">During the arbitration proceedings, E Light argued Hungry Horse did not have the correct license for the type of work performed and the license it did hold never should have been issued. In support of the latter claim, E Light relied on New Mexico\u2019s requirement that no construction license be issued unless the director of the New Mexico Construction Industries Division of the Regulations and Licensing Department (Division) is satisfied that an applicant employs or is owned by a qualifying party. N.M. Stat. \u00a7 60-13-14(A); N.M. Admin. Code R. \u00a7 14.6.3.8. Under New Mexico law, a \u201cqualifying party\u201d is a licensed individual \u201cwho is responsible for the licensee\u2019s compliance\u201d with New Mexico construction \u201cregulations, codes, and standards.\u201d N.M. Stat. \u00a7 60-13-2(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">In its license application, Hungry Horse had listed Mr. Stokes, a New Mexico contractor, as its qualifying party. Although Mr. Stokes and a company he owned had valid New Mexico contractor\u2019s licenses, E Light claimed Mr. Stokes had no involvement in the solar projects and was neither an owner nor employee of Hungry Horse. At the arbitration hearing, E Light presented evidence that Hungry Horse had paid Mr. Stokes\u2019s company $1,500 to use his name on Hungry Horse\u2019s license application. E Light argued that under these facts, Hungry Horse was not duly licensed and could not recover on its compensation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">Hungry Horse objected to any inquiry by the arbitration panel into whether its construction license had been properly issued, arguing the panel was empowered to consider only whether the license covered the type of work performed. The arbitration panel disagreed and found Mr. Stokes had never been an owner or employee of Hungry Horse. Because Hungry Horse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>was not owned by and did not employ a qualifying party, the panel treated Hungry Horse as an unlicensed contractor and denied its claims for unpaid construction work. The panel did award Hungry Horse $350,000 for supplying materials to the solar panel projects, a task which did not require a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">III. District Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Hungry Horse filed an action to vacate the arbitration award, alleging the arbitrators \u201cexceeded their powers\u201d in violation of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(4). Hungry Horse argued the Division had the exclusive jurisdiction to issue contractor licenses, thereby precluding the arbitration panel from considering whether Hungry Horse\u2019s license had been properly issued. Hungry Horse also claimed the arbitration panel had revoked the license issued to Hungry Horse and that only the New Mexico Construction Industries Commission (Commission) had the power to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The district court denied Hungry Horse\u2019s motion to vacate, concluding the panel had acted within its broad authority. The district court explained the panel properly decided whether Hungry Horse was duly licensed as part of its determination of whether Hungry Horse could recover additional compensation from E Light. It further found the panel did not revoke Hungry Horse\u2019s license, but merely refused to treat Hungry Horse as duly licensed with respect to the work performed on the solar panel projects. Accordingly, the district court refused to vacate the arbitration award. Hungry Horse appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">When considering a district court\u2019s decision on a motion to vacate an arbitration award, we review the court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>Bowen v. Amoco Pipeline Co., </em>254 F.3d 925, 931 (10th Cir.2001). Our review of the underlying arbitration award, however, is far more limited. <em>Id. </em>We \u201c \u2018give extreme deference\u2019 \u201d to the decision of the arbitration panel. <em>Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Public Service Co. of Oklahoma, </em>636 F.3d 562, 567 (10th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Brown v. Coleman Co., </em>220 F.3d 1180, 1182 (10th Cir.2000)). Indeed, this \u201chighly deferential standard\u201d is one of the \u201cnarrowest known to the law.\u201d <em>Bowen, </em>254 F.3d at 932 (internal quotation marks omitted). As a result, once an arbitration award has been entered, it is not easily vacated. <em>See Oxford Health Plans LLC v. Sutter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2064, 2068, 186 L.Ed.2d 113 (2013) (\u201cUnder the FAA, courts may vacate an arbitrator\u2019s decision \u2018only in very unusual circumstances.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, </em>514 U.S. 938, 942, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995))); see <em>also Burlington, </em>636 F.3d at 567; <em>Bowen, </em>254 F.3d at 932. To hold otherwise would defeat arbitration\u2019s goal of speedy and final resolution of disputes and create a system in which \u201carbitration would become \u2018merely a prelude to a more cumbersome and time-consuming judicial review process.\u2019\u201d <em>Oxford Health Plans, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2068 (quoting <em>Hall Street Associates, LLC v. Mattel, Inc., </em>552 U.S. 576, 588, 128 S.Ct. 1396, 170 L.Ed.2d 254 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">Hungry Horse contends we should vacate the award under this narrow standard of review because, \u201cthe arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It claims the arbitration panel lacked authority to consider whether Hungry Horse\u2019s license was properly issued and also ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ceeded its power by invading the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission and revoking Hungry Horse\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">I. Arbitrability and Authority</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In considering the limits of an arbitration panel\u2019s power, we apply different standards of review to questions of arbitrability than to questions of the extent of the panel\u2019s authority in deciding arbitrable issues. <em>See Burlington, </em>636 F.3d at 567-68. The Supreme Court has explained that the initial question of whether the parties \u201cagreed to arbitrate the merits\u201d of their dispute is \u201cabout the <em>arbitrability </em>of the dispute,\u201d which turns on the scope of the arbitration agreement. <em>See First Options, </em>514 U.S. at 942, 115 S.Ct. 1920 (emphasis in original). Unless the parties have expressly agreed to submit the question of arbitrability to the arbitration panel, the court must independently decide that preliminary question based on ordinary principles of state contract formation law. <em>See id. </em>at 943-44, 115 S.Ct. 1920. In determining whether the particular issue is arbitrable, the district court should resolve any doubts about the scope of the arbitration agreement in favor of arbitration. <em>See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 614, 626, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985). We review a district court\u2019s arbitrability decision concerning the scope of the arbitrable issues de novo. <em>First Options, </em>514 U.S. at 941, 947-49, 115 S.Ct. 1920 (approving the circuit court\u2019s de novo review of the arbitrability question).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Once the court determines that the parties agreed to submit an issue to arbitration, we afford the arbitration panel \u201cextreme deference\u201d regarding the extent of its authority to decide the arbitrable issue. <em>See Burlington, </em>636 F.3d at 568 (citing <em>Schoenduve Corp. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., </em>442 F.3d 727, 733 (9th Cir.2006); <em>Major League Umpires Ass\u2019n v. American League of Prof'l Baseball Clubs, </em>357 F.3d 272, 279 (3d Cir.2004)). We have referred to this second question as an inquiry into the \u201cscope of the [arbitration panel\u2019s] authority,\u201d because it focuses on the permissible extent of the arbitration panel\u2019s inquiry when deciding the arbitrable issue. <em>Burlington, </em>636 F.3d at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">If an issue is arbitrable and the arbitration panel renders a decision on the merits, the circumstances under which the award can be set aside as exceeding the arbitrator\u2019s powers are quite limited. <em>See Oxford Health Plans, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2068. \u201cOnly if the arbitrator acts outside the scope of his contractually delegated authority\u2014issuing an award that simply reflects his own notions of economic justice rather than drawing its essence from the contract\u2014may a court overturn his determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2068 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Local No. 7 United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Int'l Union v. King Soopers, Inc., </em>222 F.3d 1223, 1226-27 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">II. Nature of this Dispute</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">A. Arbitrability: Scope of the Arbitration Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">Hungry Horse admits in its reply brief on appeal it \u201cnever contested the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>authority of the Panel to determine if [it] was duly licensed,\u201d and it \u201cwas required to prove [it] was \u2018duly licensed\u2019 \u201d to recover on its claims for additional compensation. Aplt. Reply Br. 12. Thus, there is no dispute the duly licensed issue was arbitrable. Likewise, our independent analysis of whether the duly licensed question falls within the scope of the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement is consistent with Hungry Horse\u2019s concession. <em>See Burlington, </em>636 F.3d at 569-70 &amp; n. 3 (finding the appellant conceded it \u201cexpressly agreed to allow the arbitration board to consider the rate floor issue,\u201d but proceeding to consider the language of the arbitration agreement independently of that concession).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Whether a dispute falls within the scope of an agreement\u2019s arbitration clause is determined by first \u201c \u2018classifying] the particular clause as either broad or narrow.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cummings v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., Inc., </em>404 F.3d 1258, 1261 (10th Cir. 2005) (quoting <em>Louis Dreyfus Negoce SA v. Blystad Shipping &amp; Trading, Inc., </em>252 F.3d 218, 224 (2d Cir.2001)); <em>see also Burlington, </em>636 F.3d at 569. If the clause is narrow, we must \u201cdetermine whether the dispute is over an issue that is on its face within the purview of the clause, or over a collateral issue that is somehow connected to the main agreement that contains the arbitration clause.\u201d <em>Cummings, </em>404 F.3d at 1261 (internal quotation marks omitted). Where the clause in the parties\u2019 agreement is narrow, \u201ca collateral matter will generally be ruled beyond its purview.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). In contrast, where the arbitration clause is broad, \u201cthere arises a presumption of arbitrability and arbitration of even a collateral matter will be ordered if the claim alleged implicates issues of contract construction or the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">\u201cTo determine the breadth of an arbitration clause, we ask if the parties clearly manifested an intent to narrowly limit arbitration to specific disputes that might arise between them.\u201d <em>Chelsea Family Pharm., PLLC v. Medco Health Solutions, Inc., </em>567 F.3d 1191, 1196 (10th Cir.2009). Agreements using language like \u201cdisputes of any nature or character\u201d or \u201cany and all disputes\u201d have been held to be broad. <em>McDonnell Douglas Finance Corp. v. Pa. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>858 F.2d 825, 832 (2d Cir.1988) (internal quotation marks omitted);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see also Newmont U.S.A. Ltd. v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>615 F.3d 1268, 1274-75 &amp; n. 5 (10th Cir.2010) (stating the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 a contract is generally construed broadly (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Rochdale Village, Inc. v. Public Service Employees Union, Local No. 80, </em>605 F.2d 1290, 1295 (2d Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Hungry Horse and E Light agreed to \u201cbinding arbitration of all disputed issues including the issues related to the Mechanics Lien and Bond.\u201d We agree with E Light that this is a broad arbitration provision. It broadly refers to \u201call disputed issues,\u201d listing two specific examples, the mechanic\u2019s lien and bond, but does not expressly indicate that no issues other than those specifically identified are subject to arbitration. <em>Cf. Burlington, </em>636 F.3d at 566 (involving an agreement that the arbitration board \u201cshall not consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>any claims ... other than [that] referenced in (a) above\u201d); <em>Cummings, </em>404 F.3d at 1260, 1262 (involving an agreement stating that \u201ceach such disagreement (but no others) shall be settled by arbitration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Hungry Horse relies on the arbitration agreement\u2019s inclusion of the phrase, \u201c[p]ursuant to the statements made at the settlement conference,\u201d to argue the issues submitted to the arbitration panel were limited to those discussed at mediation. Aplt. Br. 17-18. We need not consider this argument because Hungry Horse, did not raise it until its reply brief below and the district court did not address it. <em>See FDIC v. Noel, </em>177 F.3d 911, 915-16 (10th Cir.1999) (holding that arguments first raised in reply are waived when not addressed by the district court). Even if we were inclined to consider the merits of Hungry Horse\u2019s argument, it would be unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The introductory language of the arbitration clause indicates only that the parties reached an agreement at the settlement conference to arbitrate; the issues they agreed to arbitrate are identified in the plain language that follows. <em>See First Options, </em>514 U.S. at 943-44, 115 S.Ct. 1920 (arbitrability is to be determined by ordinary principles of state contract law); <em>ConocoPhillips Co. v. Lyons, </em>2013-NMSC-009, \u00b6 23, 299 P.3d 844 (\u201cThe purpose, meaning[,] and intent of the parties to a contract is to be deduced from the language employed by them; and where such language is not ambiguous, it is conclusive.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 24-25, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983) (\u201c[A]ny doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.\u201d). That language submits any disputed issues to the arbitration panel and expressly indicates such issues include those \u201crelated to the Mechanics Lien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">As discussed, in New Mexico, a contractor may not recover on a compensation claim unless it proves it was duly licensed at the time the work was performed. <em>See </em>N.M. Stat. \u00a7 60-13-30(A). During the arbitration proceedings, E Light disputed Hungry Horse\u2019s claim it was duly licensed and placed that issue squarely before the panel. Thus, the duly licensed issue is a disputed issue and \u201con its face within the purview of the [arbitration] clause.\u201d <em>Cummings, </em>404 F.3d at 1261 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Even if the duly licensed issue were collateral, it would be arbitrable. Given the broad language of the arbitration clause, we presume collateral matters implicating issues of contract construction or the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under the subcontract fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement. <em>Burlington, </em>636 F.3d at 569. \u201c[A] collateral issue ... is somehow connected to the main agreement that contains the arbitration clause.\u201d <em>Burlington, </em>636 F.3d at 569. The duly licensed issue is somehow connected to the arbitration agreement because Hungry Horse needed to prove it was duly licensed as an element of its claim for compensation. <em>See </em>N.M. Stat. \u00a7 60-13-30. Similarly, Hungry Horse\u2019s rights and E Light\u2019s obligations under the construction contract are implicated because Hungry Horse cannot recover on its mechanic\u2019s lien claims without proving it is duly licensed. The arbitration panel, therefore, had the authority to decide the question. <em>See Louis Dreyfus Negoce, </em>252 F.3d at 228-29 (holding collateral agreements\u2014letters of indemnity\u2014were within the scope of a broad arbitration clause in a contract because the matter of indemnity implicated clauses in the contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Whether we resolve the arbitrability question based on Hungry Horse\u2019s concession or by construction of the arbitration agreement\u2019s broad arbitration provision, we reach the conclusion the duly licensed issue was arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">B. Authority: Scope of the Arbitration Panel\u2019s Inquiry</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In characterizing the issue on appeal, Hungry Horse states the parties have a \u201cfundamental disagreement as to what one must prove to meet its burden of establishing the contractor is \u2018duly licensed.\u2019 \u201d Aplt. Reply Br. 12. Accordingly, the issue before us is whether the arbitration panel had the authority to consider the circumstances under which Hungry Horse obtained its license in determining whether it was duly licensed when it performed work on the solar panel projects. Although Hungry Horse frames this dispute as a question of arbitrability, we are convinced it is a question of the proper extent of the panel\u2019s authority to decide the \u201cduly licensed\u201d issue Hungry Horse admits was submitted to arbitration. <em>See Burlington, </em>636 F.3d at 568 (rejecting a party\u2019s \u201cattempts to garner a more favorable standard of review by masquerading its scope of authority claims as an arbitrability claim\u201d). In this circuit, the arbitration panel is entitled to extreme deference in setting the bounds of its authority to decide an issue submitted to arbitration. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">For example, in <em>Burlington, </em>the Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) and Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company (BNSF) disagreed on the proper interpretation of the rate provisions governing the amount due to BNSF under a coal transportation agreement. PSO calculated the rate using an amended rate adjustment procedure agreed to in connection with the resolution of a prior dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 566. BNSF sought a higher amount based on a \u201crate floor\u201d of $11.77 per ton included in the pre-amendment agreement. <em>Id. </em>Eventually, the parties asked an arbitration board to adjudicate: 1) BNSF\u2019s claim the rate could not be less than $11.77 per ton; and 2) all of PSO\u2019s defenses to BNSF\u2019s claim. The arbitration agreement further provided the arbitration board \u201cshall not consider any [other] claims by BNSF and PSO.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The arbitration board issued an award holding the rate floor in the pre-amendment agreement had been extinguished when the parties adopted the amended rate adjustment procedure. <em>Id. </em>at 566-67. BNSF brought a motion to vacate the award in the district court, claiming the arbitration board had exceeded its powers by interpreting the rate floor provision of the prior contract. <em>Id. </em>at 567. The district court denied the motion to vacate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">This court affirmed. We first rejected BNSF\u2019s attempt to characterize the question on appeal as one of arbitrability. <em>Id. </em>at 568. Because BNSF\u2019s claims and PSO\u2019s defenses were arbitrable, we held, \u201cthe board\u2019s determination that it had the authority to declare no rate floor provision existed is entitled to the same \u2018extreme deference\u2019 as its determinations on the merits.\u201d <em>Id.; see also id. </em>at 569 (\u201cAfter the district court independently concluded the parties\u2019 rate dispute was arbitrable, it correctly applied a deferential standard of review to the board\u2019s determination of the scope of its authority.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">The same level of deference is appropriate here. The parties agree the duly licensed issue was arbitrable. Thus, the arbitration panel\u2019s implicit \u201cdetermination that it had the authority to declare\u201d no license should have been issued to Hungry Horse is entitled to \u201cextreme deference.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 568. Under that standard, we cannot say the panel exceeded its powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>by considering the circumstances under which Hungry Horse obtained its contractor\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">C. Correctness of the Arbitration Panel\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Finally, Hungry Horse argues the arbitration panel exceeded its powers because the Division and the Commission have exclusive jurisdiction to issue licenses in the first instance and to review or revoke licensing decisions. Aplt. Br. 19-20 (citing N.M. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 60-13-12, -14, -15, -30). In particular, Hungry Horse claims the arbitration panel\u2019s decision is contrary to New Mexico\u2019s statutory scheme and the legal decisions addressing the duly licensed requirement in the context of contractor claims. This challenge is appropriately considered an attack on the merits of the arbitration panel\u2019s decision that Hungry Horse was not duly licensed when it performed the work on the solar projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In such circumstances, Hungry Horse \u201cbears a heavy burden\u201d in seeking relief under section 10(a)(4) of the FAA. <em>See Oxford Health </em>Plans, 133 S.Ct. at 2068. \u201cIt is not enough ... to show that the [arbitrator] committed an error\u2014or even a serious error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration and omission in original); see <em>also Burlington, </em>636 F.3d at 568 (holding the arbitrator\u2019s determination of the extent of the inquiry is entitled to the same extreme deference as the arbitrator\u2019s merits decision). Section 10(a)(4) \u201cpermits courts to vacate an arbitral decision only when the arbitrator strayed from his delegated task ..., not when he performed that task poorly.\u201d <em>Oxford Health Plans, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2070; <em>see also Stolh-Nielsen SA v. AnimalFeeds Int'l Corp., </em>559 U.S. 662, 671-72, 130 S.Ct. 1758, 176 L.Ed.2d 605 (2010). Because the panel was \u201carguably\u201d addressing the duly licensed issue\u2014and not dispensing its own brand of justice\u2014when it determined Hungry Horse\u2019s license should not have been issued, its decision must stand regardless of our view of the merits. <em>See Oxford Health Plans, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2068; <em>cf Wells Fargo Bank, NA v. WMR e-PIN, LLC, </em>653 F.3d 702 (8th Cir.2011) (holding where the parties submitted issue of misappropriation of trade secrets to arbitration and argued inventorship in their arbitration briefs, the panel could consider the issue of inventorship despite the fact inventorship decisions are reserved exclusively to the United States Patent and Trademark Office).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Because the duly licensed issue was arbitrable, we afford extreme deference to the panel\u2019s determination of the proper extent of the inquiry necessary to decide that question and to its decision on the merits. Hungry Horse has not demonstrated that the district court erred in refusing to vacate the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b589-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-10\">. Section 10 of the FAA allows an arbitration award to be vacated if: (1) \"the award was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means\u201d; (2) \"there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators\u201d; (3) the \"arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced\u201d; or (4) \"the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a). Hungry Horse relies only on subsection 10(a)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b593-6\">.
