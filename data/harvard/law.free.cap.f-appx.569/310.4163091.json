He filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application in the district court alleging, inter alia, that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to several improper statements made by the prosecutor during closing arguments. Gonzales raised similar claims in an earlier state habeas proceeding; the state court concluded that he had not shown prejudice resulting from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>counsel\u2019s failure to object. The district court denied \u00a7 2254 relief, finding in relevant part that the state court\u2019s conclusion was entitled to deference and was not an unreasonable application of federal law. However, the district court granted a COA on Gonzales\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">As an initial matter, the Respondent has moved to vacate the district court\u2019s grant of a COA as improvidently granted. We find that the district court\u2019s grant of a COA included the relevant issue on appeal, whether Gonzales established prejudice. Therefore, the Respondent\u2019s motion to vacate the grant of a COA is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In reviewing the denial of \u00a7 2254 relief, we review issues of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Richards v. Quarterman, </em>566 F.3d 553, 561 (5th Cir. 2009). Because the state court\u2019s rejection of Gonzales\u2019 claims of ineffective assistance of counsel was not contrary to and did not involve an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and did not involve \u201can unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d the district court did not err in denying relief on these claims. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 131 S.Ct. 770, 787-89, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court -has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
