We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for an abuse of discretion. <em>Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah Cnty., Or. v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1262 (9th Cir.1993). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Escamilla\u2019s motion for relief from judgment because Escamilla failed to show grounds warranting such relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1263 (setting forth grounds for relief from judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Contrary to defendants\u2019 contention, we have jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s order denying Escamilla\u2019s motion for relief from judgment because Escamilla\u2019s timely motion for an extension to file an appeal is the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal. <em>See Estrada v. Scribner, </em>512 F.3d 1227, 1236 (9th Cir.2008) (noting that a documentas the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal if it is filed within the time specified by Fed. R.App. P. 4 and gives the notice required by Fed. R.App. P. 3, and that a more lenient standard is used with pro se litigants); <em>Andrade v. Attorney General of Cal., </em>270 F.3d 743, 752 (9th Cir.2001), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>538 U.S. 63, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) (holding that pro se prisoner\u2019s timely motion for an extension to file an appeal was the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">We lack jurisdiction to consider the district court\u2019s summary judgment because Escamilla failed to file a timely notice of appeal from the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), (4) (notice of appeal must be filed within thirty days after entry of judgment, and only a timely tolling motion suspends time to appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">We lack jurisdiction to consider the district court\u2019s postjudgment rejection of Escamilla\u2019s request for a voluntary dispute resolution program because Escamilla failed to file an amended or separate notice of appeal. <em>See Whitaker v. Garcetti, </em>486 F.3d 572, 585 (9th Cir.2007) (appellant generally must file a separate notice of appeal or amend a previously filed notice of appeal to secure review of a postjudgment order).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b528-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
