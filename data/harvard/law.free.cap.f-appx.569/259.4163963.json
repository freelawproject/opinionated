It subsequently added Kunt\u2019s new employer, M3 Technology (M3), as a defendant and, brought claims for tortious interference with contract, trade secret misappropriation, and copyright infringement. A jury found in favor of Aspen and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the district court issued a permanent injunction. M3 appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law as to Aspen\u2019s misappropriation and infringement claims and further appeals the damages award and the grant of a permanent injunction. We affirm the district court\u2019s rulings on M3\u2019s motion and the grant of a permanent injunction. However, we vacate the award of attorney\u2019s fees and remand for the issuance of an adjusted damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Aspen and M3 both develop, sell, and service specialized software for chemical and petrochemical companies. They compete directly in three areas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">(1) scheduling (Aspen\u2019s Orion vs. M3\u2019s SIMTO Scheduling);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">(2) blending (Aspen\u2019s MBO vs. M3\u2019s SIMTO M-Blend); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">(3) distribution (Aspen\u2019s DPO vs. M3\u2019s SIMTO Distribution).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">Aspen is the older of the two companies. M3 was founded in 2002 by Dong Dong, Lei Wu, and Lawrence Pan, all of whom are former Aspen employees. In 2005, David Jasper, also a former Aspen employee, became the fourth employee and shareholder of M3. In 2008 and 2009 respectively, Robert Hutchings and Craig Acuff\u2014 also former Aspen employees\u2014joined M3.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">Initially, M3 developed and sold terminal software, a product not sold by Aspen, because Dong\u2019s employment agreement with Aspen included a two-year noncom-petition clause. Following this two-year period, M3 began selling its scheduling product, which competes with Aspen\u2019s Orion. M3 developed its blending software, M-Blend, which competes with Aspen\u2019s MBO, shortly thereafter. At least by 2011, all three of M3\u2019s products that compete with Aspen\u2019s products were on the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-15\">In January 2010, Kunt, Aspen\u2019s director of technology and research, resigned and joined M3. Kunt had previously signed a noncompete agreement with Aspen, which required Kunt to refrain from competitive employment and from soliciting Aspen customers with whom he had worked for one year after leaving Aspen. In April 2010, Aspen initiated this suit against Kunt to enforce its contract. In June and July 2010, Aspen filed copyright registrations for versions of its software beginning in 2006 through 2010. In July 2010, Aspen amended its complaint to assert claims against M3 for trade-secret misappropriation, copyright infringement, and tortious interference with its contract with Kunt. Aspen and Kunt eventually settled their dispute, leaving only Aspen\u2019s claims against M3.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-16\">During discovery, M3 employees engaged in an array of misconduct. Kunt admitted to having concealed Aspen property at a friend\u2019s home, including a laptop with Aspen documents, an external hard drive containing Aspen\u2019s source code, and technical notes Kunt had made while working on Aspen\u2019s software. Acuff revealed that he had removed an external hard drive containing Aspen\u2019s confidential pricing calculators from Aspen. Furthermore, Acuff admitted to initiating a defragmentation of his laptop\u2014a process that makes the subsequent recovery of a deleted file \u201cnearly impossible\u201d\u2014before it could be imaged during discovery. On advice from counsel, Acuff invoked the Fifth Amendment during his deposition and at trial. Hutchings also initiated a defragmentation of his laptop before it could be imaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-17\">At trial, the jury heard evidence of additional misconduct, namely that Pan, the chief developer of M3\u2019s M-Blend software, was in possession of a confidential manual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>for Aspen\u2019s MBO blending software, and that Jasper had a customer list on his computer, the metadata of which suggested that it had been created while Jasper was still in Aspen\u2019s employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">At the close of Aspen\u2019s case, M3 moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) on the grounds that Aspen\u2019s misappropriation and infringement claims were barred by statutes of limitations and, alternatively, that Aspen had failed to present sufficient evidence on its claims. This motion was denied. The case was tried before a jury, which found, in relevant part, that none of Aspen\u2019s claims was time-barred; that M3 had misappropriated eight of Aspen\u2019s trade secrets; that M3 had infringed all of Aspen\u2019s asserted copyrights; and that M3 had interfered with Aspen\u2019s contract with Kunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The jury also awarded the following damages to Aspen in the following categories:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">A. Tortious interference:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">1. Damages (including attorney\u2019s fees): $896,332</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">2. Exemplary damages: $100,000</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">B. Trade-secret misappropriation:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">1. Aspen\u2019s lost profits: $2,000,000</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">2. M3\u2019s profits: $2,800,000</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">3. Exemplary damages: $1,000,000</p>\n<p id=\"b285-15\">C. Copyright infringement:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-16\">1. Aspen\u2019s lost profits: $2,000,000</p>\n<p id=\"b285-17\">2. M3\u2019s profits: $2,900,000</p>\n<p id=\"A3D\">TOTAL: $11,696,332</p>\n<p id=\"b285-22\">Pursuant to Aspen\u2019s request, the district court reduced the tortious interference damages to $546,329 to reflect only Aspen\u2019s requested attorney\u2019s fees. The district court awarded the adjusted total of $11,346,329, which reflects the remainder of the jury verdict in its entirety. The district court also issued a permanent injunction prohibiting M3 from selling any presently existing or future derivative versions of those products that use or contain any information substantially derived from Aspen\u2019s protected material. M3 renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b), which the court also denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-23\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b285-24\">\u201cThis court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such motions \u201cin an action tried by jury [are] a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In reviewing a jury verdict, this court considers \u201call of the evidence\u2014not just that evidence which supports the non-mover\u2019s case\u2014but in the light and with all reasonable inferences most favorable to the party opposed to the motion,\u201d that is, Aspen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIf the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the Court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict, granting [judgment as a matter of law] is proper.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-25\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b285-26\">We first address M3\u2019s contention that the statutes of limitations barred Aspen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>misappropriation and infringement claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Causes of action for trade-secret misappropriation and copyright infringement both have a three-year limitations period.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While causes of action generally accrue \u201cwhen a wrongful act causes some legal injury, even if the fact of the injury is not discovered until later, and even if all resulting damages have not yet occurred,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> several equitable tolling doctrines may defer the accrual of a claim. Specifically, the discovery rule and the doctrine of fraudulent concealment apply to both misappropriation and infringement claims.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Here, the jury had sufficient evidence to find that Aspen did not discover and in the exercise of reasonable diligence should not have discovered the asserted misappropriation until after Aspen filed suit against Kunt. First, M3\u2019s marketing of competing products alone did not constitute \u201cdiscovery of the injury.\u201d Aspen must have known or have been reasonably able to discover that M3 had used Aspen\u2019s proprietary information to create competing products, and M3 points to no such conclusive evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, the jury could have found that M3 had fraudulently concealed its misconduct. In a letter to Aspen, M3 denied all allegations of misappropriation and infringement. The denial of wrongdoing \u201cmay constitute concealment ... [if] the circumstances indicate that it was reasonable for [Aspen] to rely on [M3\u2019s] denial.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Given that the jury found that M3 had misappropriated and infringed Aspen\u2019s protected informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>tion, it could have also reasonably concluded that MB\u2019s denial was intended to conceal its wrongdoing. Therefore, M3 was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its limitations defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">M3 next argues that the jury\u2019s verdict, which found that M3 had misappropriated eight of Aspen\u2019s trade secrets, was not supported by legally sufficient evidence. These eight trade secrets are as follows: (1) DPO source code, (2) MBO source code, (3) Orion and MBO V7 Roadmap, (4) Scheduling <em>&amp; </em>Blending V8 <em>&amp; </em>Beyond, (5) MBO 1.3.1 User\u2019s Manual, (6) SDPIMS code, (7) Customer list, and (8) Pricing calculators. \u201cA trade secret is any formula, pattern, device or compilation of information which is used in one\u2019s business and presents an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Trade-secret misappropriation in Texas requires (1) the existence of a trade secret, (2) improper acquisition of that secret, and (3) use of the trade secret without authorization.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cThe word \u2018use\u2019 ... has been equated with \u2018commercial use,\u2019 and has been liberally defined to include both the sale of the trade secrets themselves, as well as the \u2018commercial operation\u2019 of those trade secrets within profit-seeking endeavors.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This court has recently acknowledged the even more liberal construction of the term \u201cuse\u201d contained in the <em>Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition, </em>which states that \u201c[a]s a general matter, any exploitation of the trade secret that is likely to result in injury to the trade secret owner or enrichment to the defendant is a \u2018use\u2019 under this Section.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">Of these eight violations, we first address the four unrelated to Aspen\u2019s source code and th\u00e9n turn to those related to its source code.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b287-15\">The first four materials refer to the customer list in Jasper\u2019s possession, the pricing calculators in Acuffs possession, and two product development road maps.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> M3 argues that Aspen never presented any evidence that M3 actually used the confidential information found in its possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-16\">M3 is incorrect that no evidence of use was presented. Jasper admitted to having used the customer list after joining M3. Jasper\u2019s explanations that support a finding of non-use are not so \u201coverwhelming\u201d that reasonable jurors could not have concluded that the customer list was in existence while Jasper was employed at Aspen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>arid therefore, that its use by M3 constituted misappropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">There was also sufficient evidence of use as to the pricing calculators. These confidential pricing calculators were discovered on Acuff s external hard drive and when he was questioned as to their use, Acuff invoked his Fifth Amendment right and refused to answer. The district court permitted an adverse-inference jury instruction, directing that the jury could \u201cinfer by [ ] Acuff s refusal to answer that his answers to the questions posed to him would have been adverse to M3\u2019s interests\u201d so long as the jury did \u201cnot base [its] verdict solely on that adverse inference.\u201d The record demonstrates that Aspen also presented circumstantial evidence of use by eliciting testimony that - pricing is a highly individualized, confidential process; that Acuff was one of the primary negotiators for M3; that M3 directly competed against Aspen in almost all its projects; and that between 2009 and at least through early 2010\u2014i.e., the time period Acuff worked at M3\u2014M3 lost only one of its bids against Aspen. Furthermore, because Acuff defragmented his laptop hard drive, the district court permitted the jury to \u201cinfer that the content of those deleted ... documents or information would have been unfavorable to M3.\u201d Given the circumstantial evidence presented and the two adverse-inference instructions, the jury had a legally sufficient basis from which to determine that M3 had misappropriated Aspen\u2019s pricing calculators.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Finally, Aspen presented sufficient evidence on the use of the two road maps. Though evidence of possession itself cannot support an inference of actual use,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Aspen presented testimony on three specifie ways M3 could have used these road maps to \u201ctremendous advantage\u201d: (1) permitting M3 to create a competing product, (2) showing M3 where it need not waste its time and resources, and (3) revealing the needs that would not be met by Aspen\u2019s anticipated design.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Aspen also presented evidence to suggest that Dong and Hutchings had personally solicited information about Aspen\u2019s road maps from other companies. As Aspen\u2019s expert testified, road maps are sometimes shared with Aspen\u2019s customer community to obtain feedback, and M3 had contacts with customers.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The jury could have reasonably inferred from this calculated attempt to acquire confidential information that M3 used the road maps in its possession. Moreover, because Hutchings also violated instructions regarding discovery by initiating a defragmentation of his hard drive, the jury was once again entitled to infer that the deleted or altered information would have been unfavorable to M3.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">As before, M3 presented contrary testimony that it had completed its own product plans years before Aspen\u2019s road maps were created. However, the jury was entitled to make credibility determinations, and it found Aspen\u2019s version to be more compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">The remaining trade-secret violations\u2014MBO User\u2019s Manual, MBO source code, DPO source code, and SDPIMS code\u2014all concern Aspen\u2019s source code. M3\u2019s argument consists of isolating each of the similarities presented at trial between its source code and that of Aspen\u2019s to assert that none of the common terms are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>trade secrets. However, Aspen never contended that these common terms in and of themselves were trade secrets, but rather that the jury could infer from these commonalities that M3 had misappropriated Aspen\u2019s source code\u2014the actual trade secrets at issue. We hold that there was sufficient evidence as to all four source code violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">First, there was evidence as to the misappropriation of Aspen\u2019s MBO User\u2019s Manual and MBO source code. As discussed above, trade-secret misappropriation requires a showing that a trade secret existed, that it was improperly acquired, and that it was used without authorization.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the MBO User\u2019s Manual and MBO source code were trade secrets and that Pan improperly acquired them. As to their unauthorized use, Aspen\u2019s expert testified that M3 could have used the manual \u201cto create source code\u201d and to generally gain a competitive advantage by determining how the program operated and creating competing source code. Furthermore, \u201c[ejvidence of a similar product may give rise to an inference of actual use under certain circumstances,\u201d such as when the defendant\u2019s product was quickly developed by someone who had recently resigned from the plaintiff-company.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Here, Pan was the primary developer of M3\u2019s competing M-Blend product, and he developed this software in six months. As a point of comparison, Aspen\u2019s expert testified that Aspen\u2019s MBO took multiple people years to develop. Therefore, the jury had a legally sufficient basis to find that M3 had misappropriated these trade secrets.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Next, the jury\u2019s verdict as to Aspen\u2019s DPO source code was also supported by sufficient evidence. Again, it is undisputed that this source code was a trade secret and that it was improperly acquired. As to M3\u2019s unauthorized use, Aspen\u2019s expert presented evidence that several unusually identical structures appeared in both Aspen\u2019s DPO source code and in M3\u2019s competing distribution product. This expert explained that there are \u201cinnumerable ways\u201d to design source code since it involves a number of choices, left entirely to the programmer\u2019s discretion, as to the structure, organization, and naming of lines of code. There were various instances where Aspen\u2019s DPO source code appears verbatim in M3\u2019s distribution source code, including not only sequences of numbers but also names of variables within the code. Additionally, both M3 and Aspen used the same large numbers as boundaries for infinity in their source code even though these numbers did not represent an industry convention. Furthermore, despite appearing in M3\u2019s code, these boundary values did not actually serve a purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">Finally, the jury\u2019s verdict that M3 had misappropriated Aspen\u2019s SDPIMS source code\u2014the predecessor of Aspen\u2019s DPO software\u2014also must be upheld. Aspen demonstrated that SDPIMS was undeniably source code and that it was improperly in M3\u2019s possession. Its expert also noted that access to this code could harm Aspen in the same three ways it had specified in earlier testimony\u2014by permitting M3 to create a competing product, save time and resources, and capitalize on gaps in the market. Although M3 elicited testimony from this same expert suggesting that SDPIMS never actually appeared in any Aspen product, this does not foreclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the possibility that M3 used the older version of Aspen\u2019s code to avoid making the same mistakes, assuming there were any, or as a baseline for developing its own competing software, either of which would constitute use under the <em>Restatement.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">In sum, the jury had a legally sufficient basis for the eight misappropriation findings; accordingly, M3 was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on any of Aspen\u2019s trade-secret misappropriation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Next, M3 challenges the jury\u2019s verdict as to Aspen\u2019s copyright infringement claims. To establish an infringement claim, a copyright owner must prove ownership of a valid copyright and copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> M3 asserts that Aspen failed to provide sufficient evidence as to either element. We address both assertions below.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">M3 first argues that Aspen did not present sufficient evidence of its ownership interest. \u201cTo establish \u2018ownership,\u2019 the plaintiff must prove that the material is original, that it can be copyrighted, and that he has complied with statutory formalities.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> M3 contests only the last element, arguing pursuant to Circular 61\u2014a publication issued by the Copyright Office\u2014that Aspen\u2019s registered versions of its software do not protect its prior versions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">M3\u2019s contention fails as a matter of law. As an initial matter, circulars may be instructive but are not authoritative.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> More significantly, however, Circular 61 does not support M3\u2019s position. Although M3 contends that under Circular 61, registration of a derivative work does not protect \u201cpreexisting material,\u201d this Circular instructs only that derivative works must themselves be registered in order for newer material not contained in preexisting software to be protected.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, although Circular 61 implies that copyrighting a derivative work affects a party\u2019s rights as to the new material, it says nothing about the effects on preexisting work.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">Furthermore, the case law weighs against M3\u2019s position. In <em>In re Independent Service Organizations Antitrust Litigation.</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendant made the same argument M3 makes here, urging that the plaintiff was \u201cbarred from bringing its copyright infringement [ ]claims because [the plaintiff] ha[d] not come forward with the registrations covering the preexisting materials from which the registered up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>grades were derived.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The court rejected this argument, holding that the plaintiffs \u201cregistration of the derivative works [wa]s sufficient to allow an infringement claim based on copying of the material, either newly added or contained in the underlying work.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This position has been recognized by at least five circuits<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and by district courts in two others.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Therefore, Aspen\u2019s registration of its derivative materials permits Aspen to bring a claim that M3 had infringed preexisting versions of its software.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">To prove actionable copying, a plaintiff must show (1) \u201cas a factual matter\u201d that the defendant \u201cactually used the eopyrighted material to create his own work\u201d and (2) that the copying is \u201clegally actionable.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Copying is legally actionable if \u201cthe allegedly infringing work is substantially similar to protectable elements of the infringed work. [A] side-by-side comparison must be made between the original and the copy to determine whether a layman would view the two works as \u2018substantially similar.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The question of whether two works are substantially similar is typically left to the ultimate factfinder.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">To aid the factfinder in this comparison, this court has \u201cgenerally endorsed the \u2018abstraction-filtration-comparison\u2019 test first outlined by the Second Circuit in <em>[Computer Associates International, Inc. v. Altai, </em>/tcc.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>].\u201d <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> This three-step procedure first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u201cdissect[s] the allegedly copied program\u2019s structure and isolate[s] each level of abstraction contained within it.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The court next filters out any unproteetable expression,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> which, in this context, means removing from comparison any hardware and software standards, computer manufacturer design standards, target industry practices and demands, and computer industry programming practices.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Lastly, the court compares the \u201cremaining protectable elements with the allegedly infringing program to determine whether the defendants have misappropriated substantial elements of the plaintiffs program.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ASK\">Here, Aspen\u2019s expert explained that he had followed the <em>Altai </em>framework and discovered three nonliteral patterns that were shared between Aspen\u2019s and M3\u2019s codes: (1) both used the same three steps to process cells across different spreadsheets; (2) both used \u201cparsing\u201d to execute Excel formulas without using Excel; and (3) both used the power function device in a significant inflow/outflow calculation. None of the similarities were filtered out, the expert explained, since they were not dictated by technical limitations or required by petroleum industry standards, and these similarities were essential to the operation of Aspen\u2019s product. Though M3 contends that this testimony was insufficient to demonstrate proper filtration or comparison, the jury heard M3\u2019s account as to why the three similarities should have been removed from the comparison. The jury, as the ultimate factfinder, was entitled to determine whether the copied aspects of the program were entitled to copyright protection. We cannot say as a matter of law that the expert testimony was so lacking as would cause reasonable minds to reject the conclusion drawn by the jury in this case that Aspen\u2019s claims were legally actionable. Accordingly, M3 was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Aspen\u2019s copyright infringement claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">M3 next argues that the district court erred in denying its Rule 50(b) motion because Aspen failed to present sufficient evidence of damages. As an initial matter, M3\u2019s argument that Aspen\u2019s damages model does not account for the infringing fraction of M3\u2019s source code fails. Although M3 is correct that, relatively speaking, few lines of its source code contained infringing material, it ignores the fact that those few lines could have been integral to the development of M3\u2019s competing products. Aspen presented testimony that this was in fact the ease. Aspen was therefore permitted to make the same assumption in its damages model.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">M3\u2019s argument that Aspen did not present sufficient evidence to support its asserted amount of damages likewise fails. With respect to its damages on its copyright claims, Aspen was \u201cpermitted to recover [its] own actual damages, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>lost profits\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cany profits of [M3] that are attributable to the infringement.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> To demonstrate M3\u2019s profits, Aspen was required to present proof of M3\u2019s gross revenue, i.e., the \u201crevenue <em>reasonably related </em>to the infringement,\u201d after which M3 was required \u201cto prove [its] deductible expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The record reflects that Aspen\u2019s expert presented detailed testimony regarding both theories of damages based on Aspen\u2019s and M3\u2019s financial records. This testimony provided a legally sufficient basis for the award of damages on Aspen\u2019s copyright claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Aspen also adequately supported its misappropriation damages award. Aspen was permitted to prove its damages on these claims in a number of ways, including by demonstrating its lost profits or the amount by which M3 was unjustly enriched based on its misappropriation.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> As discussed above, Aspen\u2019s expert testimony likewise provided sufficient evidence for this damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">M3\u2019s next contention\u2014that the district court impermissibly stacked the damages award for Aspen\u2019s claims\u2014also fails. Although \u201c[a] plaintiff seeking compensation for the same injury under different legal theories is ... only entitled to one recovery,\u201d a \u201cjury\u2019s award is not duplicafive simply because it allocates damages under two distinct causes of action.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Where there is evidence that the plaintiff suffered the total amount of the damage award on one of its theories, a court may rationally conclude that the jury found that the plaintiff suffered that amount of injuries and \u201cmerely allocated that amount between the two different causes of action.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In this case, Aspen\u2019s expert testified that M3 may have been unjustly enriched in an amount ranging from $5.5 million to $9.7 million; the total compensatory damages award fell within this range. Accordingly, the jury\u2019s and, by extension, the district court\u2019s damages award did not grant Aspen a double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">Last, M3 argues that if judgment is upheld on the trade secret theory alone, the damages award would need to be modified since this theory permits recovery either of lost profits or unjust enrichment, but not both.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> However, as discussed above, there is legally sufficient evidence to uphold the jury\u2019s verdict on Aspen\u2019s copyright claims, and copyright law permits the recovery of both lost profits <em>and </em>unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">M3 next argues that the tortious interference award, which allotted only at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>torney\u2019s fees, fails as a matter of law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u201cIn Texas, attorney\u2019s fees may not be recovered from an opposing party unless such recovery is provided for by statute or by contract between the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> A number of equitable exceptions to this general rule have been recognized, one of which provides for attorney\u2019s fees \u201cwhere a plaintiff has been involved in litigation with a third party as a result of the tortious act of another.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Certain prerequisites must be met, including that \u201cthe litigation must have involved a third party and must not have been brought against the defendant in the same action in which the fees are sought.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Particularly on point is <em>Brown &amp; Brown of Texas, Inc. v. Omni Metals, </em>Inc.,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> in which a Texas court of appeals vacated the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees incurred in an earlier stage of litigation, which was initially brought against other parties and to which the appellants were later added.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> These fees could not be awarded because the earlier stage could \u201cnot properly be styled [as] \u2018prior litigation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">It is undisputed that no statute or contract provided for the recovery of attor-</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">ney\u2019s fees incurred by Aspen in its dispute involving Kunt.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Moreover, since both M3 and Kunt were involved in this litigation, Aspen cannot recover from M3 the attorney\u2019s fees it expended to litigate against Kunt in the prior stage of litigation. We hold, therefore, that the district court erred in awarding Aspen its attorney\u2019s fees under this equitable exception to the general rule. Because Aspen requested and was awarded $546,329 in attorney\u2019s fees, we direct the district court to reduce the judgment-by this amount on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">M3\u2019s final objection is to the district court\u2019s grant of a permanent injunction. \u201cAccording to well-established principles of equity, a plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must ... demonstrate: (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balances of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>injunction.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> M3 argues that the district court erroneously presumed irreparable harm, ignored adequate alternatives, and failed to consider the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We review the grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs if the district court [ ] relie[d] on clearly erroneous factual findings when deciding to grant or deny the permanent injunction, [] relie[d] on erroneous conclusions of law ..., or [ ] misapplied] the factual or legal conclusions when fashioning its injunctive relief.\u201d <footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">With these principles guiding us, we turn to M3\u2019s challenges to the injunction. First, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Aspen would suffer irreparable harm based on evidence that M3 had been \u201cmaking use of As-pent ]\u2019s information from the inception of its business,\u201d and that there was a \u201csubstantial probability that Aspenf] [would] be unable to collect a judgment against M3\u201d in light of M3\u2019s initiation of bankruptcy proceedings.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Regarding adequate alternatives, requiring M3 to discontinue the use or sale of its products was not unreasonable because M3\u2019s competing products were found to contain Aspen\u2019s source code.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Finally, we agree that it was in the interest of public policy to prohibit the sale and use of M3 products containing infringing source code and that were derived from the improper misappropriation of trade secrets.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">Nor was this permanent injunction \u201coverbroad and non-specific.\u201d The jury made specific findings as to which trade secrets and copyrights M3 had used, and the district court\u2019s injunction accordingly enumerates the trade secrets and copyrights that M3 is enjoined from using. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment in all respects except the grant of attorney\u2019s fees for Aspen\u2019s tortious interference claim. We direct that the district court reduce the judgment by the attorney\u2019s fee amount on remand.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b283-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
