Seven codefendants were indicted with Mink on the conspiracy to distribute marijuana charges, and two related indictments were also filed, one with four codefendants and one against a single defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">On appeal, Mink argues that the district court erred in imposing an obstruction of justice enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, based on a call he placed from prison in which he identified a confidential informant who had bought drugs from Mink and who was a defendant in one of the related indictments. Mink argues that the enhancement does not apply because he did not intend to obstruct justice in his \u201cinstant offense of conviction.\u201d He also argues that he should have been credited a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, even if we uphold the obstruction-of-justice enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s imposition of an enhancement for obstruction of justice, we review \u201cthe district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and review the application of the factual findings to the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Doe, </em>661 F.3d 550, 556 (11th Cir.2011). We \u201creview the district court\u2019s determination of acceptance of responsibility only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d 1305, 1320 (11th Cir. 2004). We will not disturb a district court\u2019s factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard unless we are left with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Doyal v. Marsh, </em>777 F.2d 1526, 1533 (11th Cir.1985); <em>see Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, a defendant\u2019s offense level will be increased by two levels if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-11\">(1) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (2) the obstructive conduct related to (A) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (B) a closely related offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. An example of conduct deemed \u201cobstructive\u201d under \u00a7 3C1.1 is attempting to threaten or intimidate a codefendant or witness. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 comment. (n. 4(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">Prior to November 1998, \u00a7 3C1.1 applied an enhancement if a defendant obstructed justice \u201cduring\u201d the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the \u201cinstant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (1997). In 1998, Amendment 581 amended \u00a7 3C1.1 to apply the enhancement if a defendant obstructed justice \u201cduring the course of\u2019 the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the \u201cinstant offense of conviction,\u201d and also added the second part to the guideline that required the obstructive conduct relate to either (A) the defendant\u2019s own offense of conviction and any relevant conduct, or (B) a closely related offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (1998); U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 581 (2013). The stated purpose of Amendment 581 was to clarify the term \u201cinstant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>offense\u201d and resolve a circuit split as to whether the adjustment applied to obstructions occurring in cases closely related to a defendant\u2019s case or just to those obstructions that specifically related to the offense for which the defendant was convicted. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C., amend. 581. Amendment 581 adopted the majority view that the obstruction must relate \u201ceither to the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction or to a closely related case,\u201d and further clarified the temporal element of \u00a7 3C1.1, namely that the obstruction must occur during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction. <em>See id. </em>Thus, the obstruction must have occurred during the prosecution of the defendant\u2019s instant offense, but it could relate either to that case or a closely related case. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">In 2006, \u00a7 3C1.1 was amended to its current version to apply the enhancement if the defendant obstructed justice \u201cwith respect to\u201d (not \u201cduring the course of\u2019) the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (2006); U.S.S.G.App. C., amend. 693 (2013). Amendment 693 addressed a circuit split regarding whether pre-investigatory conduct could trigger the enhancement, and adopted the majority view that pre-investigatory obstruction came within \u00a7 3 C 1.1 if it was purposefully calculated and likely to thwart the investigation or prosecution of the offense of conviction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C., amend. 693; <em>see also Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d 1305. In interpreting \u00a7 3C1.1, under the current Guidelines, this Court has stated that the \u201c \u2018relevant question is whether the obstructive conduct occurred during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing\u2019 of the offense of conviction or a closely related offense.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>661 F.3d at 566 (quoting <em>United States v. Campa, </em>529 F.3d 980, 1016 (11th Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, the district court will decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two if he \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a). Upon the government\u2019s motion and assertion that the defendant assisted in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely pleading guilty, the district court shall decrease the offense level by one additional level. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1(b); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 6). However, while a defendant\u2019s guilty plea before trial and admission of the conduct comprising the offense of the conviction will constitute \u201csignificant evidence\u201d of acceptance of responsibility, \u201cthis evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility,\u201d and a defendant who pleads guilty is not entitled to an adjustment under \u00a7 3E1.1 as a matter of right. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 3). Conduct resulting in an enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice \u201cordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 4). The commentary states that there \u201cmay\u201d be \u201cextraordinary cases\u201d in which adjustments under both \u00a7 3C1.1 and \u00a7 3E1.1 would apply. <em>Id. </em>Because the sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, the district court\u2019s determination on this issue is \u201centitled to great deference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Here, Mink does not actually challenge the fact that he made a phone call from prison identifying a confidential informant. The district court concluded that Mink\u2019s call demonstrated a \u201cclear intent\u201d to intimidate the confidential informant, conduct that would fit within \u00a7 3 C 1.1. This finding is not clearly erroneous, as it is supported by the testimony of a Drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>Enforcement Agency special agent at the sentencing hearing. <em>See Doyal, </em>777 F.2d at 1538. Accordingly, the question that remains before us is whether Mink\u2019s conduct obstructed justice as contemplated by the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">First, Mink\u2019s obstruction occurred during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of his instant offense because the phone calls were placed prior to his sentencing. <em>See Doe, </em>661 F.3d at 566. That satisfies the \u201cwith respect to ... the instant offense of conviction\u201d language of the current \u00a7 3C1.1, which seems to include the \u201cduring the course of\u2019 language that was added by Amendment 581, and is in fact broader to also include certain preinvestigation conduct within \u00a7 3C1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. 3, amend. 693 (explaining that the purpose of the amendment was to expand \u00a7 3C1.1). Accordingly, the district court properly applied the \u00a7 3 C 1.1 enhancement so long as Mink\u2019s obstructive conduct related either to his offense of conviction or to a closely related case. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Mink\u2019s and the confidential informant\u2019s offenses are closely related. <em>See Doe, </em>661 F.3d at 556. The confidential informant\u2019s and Mink cases were charged on the same day and in consecutive case numbers, both Mink and the confidential informant purchased marijuana from the same codefendants, and the confidential informant also admitted to purchasing drugs from Mink. Additionally, the record indicates that, at the time of Mink\u2019s call, proceedings were ongoing as to all of his seven codefendants. On the related indictments, proceedings were ongoing for three out of the five defendants, including the confidential informant. Thus, Mink\u2019s outing of the confidential informant, with the intent to intimidate, affected his case and both related cases, and qualified as obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1. Accordingly, the district court did not err by applying the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Because the district court did not err by applying \u00a7 3C1.1, Mink is entitled to an acceptance of responsibility adjustment only if his circumstances represent an \u201cextraordinary case.\u201d <em>See Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d at 1321. The district court\u2019s conclusion that Mink\u2019s outing of a confidential informant, coupled with his conduct, attitude, and lack of cooperation throughout the proceedings, all showed that he had not clearly accepted personal responsibility for his criminal offense, is not clearly erroneous. Mink has not shown that the district court clearly erred in not finding this to be an extraordinary case where he merited both a \u00a7 3C1.1 and \u00a7 3E1.1 adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
