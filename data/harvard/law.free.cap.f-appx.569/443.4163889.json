Murphy, III, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b466-17\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b466-18\">Plaintiff Camille Obnamia, a traveling nurse who suffers from hearing impairments and related balance difficulties, appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to her employer, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), on her claims for reasonable accommodations and retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq. </em>Though Obnamia\u2019s employment history involves multiple accommodation requests, she presently seeks two adjustments to her workplace: (1) a private office to minimize disruptive background noise, and (2) handrails in a hallway where she suffered head injuries from a fall. Her retaliation claim stems from the temporary suspension of her driving privileges following her request for handrails. After carefully reviewing the record, the applicable law, and the parties\u2019 briefs, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>find that the district court\u2019s opinion diligently and correctly sets out the undisputed facts and governing law. We AFFIRM on the basis of its well-reasoned opinion with these additional comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">On appeal, Obnamia takes issue with three aspects of the district court\u2019s judgment: (1) that her ability to perform her job well without accommodation defeated her claim for a private office; (2) that she failed to demonstrate a need for handrails in the hallway in which she fell; and (3) that the temporary suspension of driving privileges pending medical review following her fall did not evince retaliation. For each of these claims, Obnamia asserts a genuine issue of material fact. These arguments lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">On the reasonable accommodation claims, we agree with the district court that Obnamia failed to carry her burden of demonstrating the reasonableness of her proposed accommodations. <em>See, e.g., Kleiber v. Honda of Am. Mfg., Inc., </em>485 F.3d 862, 870 (6th Cir.2007). Reasonable accommodations consist of \u201c[mjodifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position ... is customarily- performed, that enable an individual with a disability ... to perform the essential functions of that position.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(o)(ii). An ADA plaintiff must show that the \u201caccommodation is reasonable in the sense both of efficacious and of proportional to costs.\u201d <em>Keith v. Cnty. of Oakland, </em>703 F.3d 918, 927 (6th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Monette v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., </em>90 F.3d 1173, 1183 (6th Cir.1996)). As the district court explained, our decisions generally require an ADA plaintiff to show the need for a proposed accommodation \u201cin light of the plaintiffs known physical limitations.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. Cleveland City Sch. Disk, </em>344 Fed.Appx. 104, 111 (6th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Nance v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>527 F.3d 539, 557 (6th Cir.2008)). Plaintiff failed to do so for her proposed accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">With regard to the private office request, Obnamia admits that she successfully performed her job without a private office. <em>(See </em>R. 18-1, Obnamia Aff. \u00b6 3; R. 15-1, Obnamia Dep. at 52:6-12.) In light of that admission, Obnamia has not adequately explained her need for a private office to address her hearing impairment. Further undermining the reasonableness of the accommodation, she offers no evidence rebutting the district court\u2019s finding that \u201cnone of [her] requests for a private office mentions\u201d her current disability-based justification for the private office: \u201ca need to reduce background noise\u201d to enable her to overcome her hearing difficulties. Instead, her requests mentioned harassment by her coworkers and expressed her concern that the symptoms of her disability disturbed eoworkers. <em>(See </em>Appellant Br. at 6-7; R. 18-1, Obnamia \u00c1ff. Exs. 1-2; R. 15-2, Accommodation Request.) Finally, although a physician recommended a \u201csolitary work-space\u201d as a way to \u201cminimize ... background noise and maximize her efficiency,\u201d he did not deem this change essential to her performance of job functions, and a clinical audiologist recommended more modest adjustments to her workspace to facilitate working near colleagues. <em>(Compare </em>R. 15-6, Dodson Letter, <em>with </em>R. 15-5, Szopa Letter (recommending \u201cpositioning [Obnamia\u2019s] desk towards co-workers or [the] office doorway, allowing her face-to-face communication\u201d).) Presented with this evidence, the district court properly found Obnamia\u2019s threshold reasonableness showing wanting.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">So too for the handrails request, as Obnamia offers no evidence linking handrails in this location to the performance of her job. She vouches for the handrails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>only as a means of mitigating her injuries from the fall. Yet the district court correctly notes that she admitted not using her prescribed three-legged cane at the time of the fall\u2014a tool she concedes assists with her balance issues. (R. 18-1, Obnamia Aff. \u00b6 6.) We agree with the district court that Obnamia \u201cfailed to indicate how handrails would be reasonable in light of her ability to rely upon her doctor-prescribed cane to help her balance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Finally, on the retaliation claim, we concur in the district court\u2019s judgment that the temporary suspension of driving responsibilities falls short of an actionable adverse action because it effected no material change in the terms and conditions of Obnamia\u2019s employment. See, <em>e.g., Trepka v. Bd. of Educ., </em>28 Fed.Appx. 455, 462 (6th Cir.2002); <em>Kocsis v. Multi-Care Mgmt., Inc., </em>97 F.3d 876, 885-87 (6th Cir.1996). \u201c[Rjeassignments without salary or work hour changes do not ordinarily constitute adverse employment decisions in employment discrimination claims.\u201d <em>Kocsis, </em>97 F.3d at 885 (citing <em>Yates v. Avco Corp., </em>819 F.2d 630, 638 (6th Cir.1987)). Here, Obnamia continued to work with pay during the suspension, which lasted until a specialist cleared her for driving duties. The VA imposed no other limitations to her work responsibilities after her fall. Though Obnamia stresses the importance of driving to her job as a traveling nurse and argues that the district court overlooked \u201cthe possibility of her being terminated,\u201d she offers no evidence of the suspension imperiling her job. Indeed, her deposition testimony contradicts her affidavit\u2019s vague account of the suspension preventing her from doing her job \u201cfor several weeks,\u201d explaining that she had a \u201clot of [computer] work ... to do until [she] got the doctor\u2019s clarification, which came <em>within a week.\u201d (Compare </em>R. 18-1, Obnamia Aff. \u00b6 19, <em>with </em>R. 15-1, Obnamia Dep. at 82:2-18 (emphasis added).) In the absence of specific evidence that the suspension materially affected the terms of her employment, the district court properly denied this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
