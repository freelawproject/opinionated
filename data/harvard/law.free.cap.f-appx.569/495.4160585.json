Pleasant, </em>704 F.3d 808, 810 (9th Cir.2013). We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">St. James\u2019s sentence cannot be reduced under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because it is not <em>\u201cbased on </em>a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted). In his plea agreement, St. James stipulated that the career offender guidelines in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 would be used to calculate his sentence. At the sentencing hearing, both the court and St. James\u2019s attorney reaffirmed that the agreement adopted the career offender guideline range. The plea agreement never mentioned the subsequently amended drug quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. St. James is ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because his sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d the career offender guidelines rather than the drug quantity guidelines. <em>See Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 2697-98, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011) (controlling opinion of Sotomayor, J.); <em>United States v. Wesson, </em>583 F.3d 728, 731 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201c[W]ith respect to the first prong of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a drug offense sentence that is \u2018based on\u2019 a sentencing range calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because the defendant was a career offender cannot have been \u2018based on\u2019 a sentencing range calculated under the \u00a7 2D 1.1 drug amount table. The two sentencing schemes are mutually exclusive.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-19\">Alternatively, St. James\u2019s sentence cannot be altered under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because a reduction would not be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Pleasant, </em>704 F.3d at 810 (quotation marks and citation omitted). The amendment to the drug quantity tables in \u00a7 2D1.1 \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2), because St. James\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d is the career offend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>er guidelines in \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(a); <em>Pleasant, </em>704 F.3d at 811-12. Application Note 1(a) is consistent with \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, both of which contemplate that the Commission will adopt policy statements defining the scope of the defendant\u2019s eligibility for a sentencing reduction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); Fan-Sentencing Act of 2010 \u00a7 8, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372; <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (commenting on \u201c[t]he substantial role Congress gave the Commission with respect to sentence-modification proceedings\u201d). The delegation of authority to the Commission to promulgate policy statements and interpretive commentary is consistent with separation-of-powers principles. <em>See Mistretta v. United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 390, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989); <em>United States v. Fox, </em>631 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b518-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

We need not address whether St. James waived his right to file a \u00a7 3582 motion in his plea agreement because the district court expressly invoked its sua sponte authority to decide whether to reduce his sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (\"[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ..., upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, <em>or on its own motion, </em>the court may reduce the term of imprisonment ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
