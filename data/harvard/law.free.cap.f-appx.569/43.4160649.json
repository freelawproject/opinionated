We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPSLRA\u201d) imposes a heightened standard for an allegation to be well pleaded. Plaintiffs must satisfy Rule 9(b), which requires plaintiffs to state \u201cthe circumstances constituting fraud,\u201d and the PSLRA also requires them to \u201cstate with particularity all facts on which [their belief that defendants violated Rule 10(b)(5)] is formed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(l)(B). Thus, plaintiffs must plead \u201csufficient\u201d facts to support a reasonable belief as to the misleading nature of defendants\u2019 statements or omissions. <em>Novak v. Kasaks, </em>216 F.3d 300, 313-14 n. 1 (2d Cir.2000). The PSLRA also requires plaintiffs to \u201cstate with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind,\u201d which focuses attention on the scienter allegations. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">\u201cTo state a claim under Rule 10b-5 for misrepresentations, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant (1) made misstatements or omissions of material fact, (2) with scienter, (3) in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, (4) upon which the plaintiff relied, and (5) that the plaintiffs reliance was the proximate cause of its injury.\u201d <em>ATSI Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., </em>493 F.3d 87, 105 (2d Cir.2007). However, the PSLRA provides a safe harbor for defendants, protecting them from liability when they make forward-looking statements that meet three \u201csafe harbor\u201d requirements. <em>Slayton v. Am. Express Co., </em>604 F.3d 758, 766 (2d Cir.2010) (\u201c[A] defendant is not liable if the forward-looking statement is identified and accompanied by meaningful cautionary language <em>or </em>is immaterial or the plaintiff fails to prove that it was made with actual knowledge that it was false or misleading.\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">We affirm for the substantially the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s thor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>ough opinion. We note that even.assuming the district court misstated the law when it required plaintiffs to plead defendants had knowledge of, or access to specific reports that contradicted their public statements, the district court also rested its findings on the fact that the allegations by the confidential witnesses were not sufficiently close in time to the class action period to support an inference of scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We have considered the remainder of Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the order of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED. Each side to bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
