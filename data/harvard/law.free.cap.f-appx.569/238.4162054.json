He contends the district court abused its discretion in denying his amended motion to recuse the district court judge under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144, 455(a), and 455(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-23\">For the first time on appeal, Lopez contends he moved for recusal under \u00a7 455(b)(1) (disqualification of judge based on personal bias or prejudice). \u201cThis circuit has not yet clearly defined the scope of our review of \u00a7 455 issues raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>McKethan v. Tex. Farm Bureau, </em>996 F.2d 734, 744 n. 31 (5th Cir.1993). Nevertheless, we pretermit the issue of the standard of review because Lopez\u2019 appeal fails even under the abuse of discretion standard for properly preserved objections to denials of motions for recusal. <em>Patterson v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>335 F.3d 476, 483 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-24\">By pleading guilty unconditionally, Lopez waived appellate review of the denial of his amended motion to recuse under \u00a7 455(a) (disqualification where impartiality reasonably questioned). <em>See United States v. Hoctel, </em>154 F.3d 506, 508 (5th Cir.1998). To the extent he contends <em>Hoctel </em>was decided wrongly, we may not over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>rule another panel\u2019s decision without <em>en banc </em>reconsideration, a superseding contrary Supreme Court decision, or change in law. <em>See United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002). Further, the record belies his contention that waiver of his \u00a7 455(a) recusal claim was not preceded by a full disclosure of the basis for recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Lopez has also failed to show the court abused its discretion in denying his amended motion to recuse under either \u00a7 144 (bias or prejudice of judge) or \u00a7 455(b)(1). <em>See United States v. MMR Corp., </em>954 F.2d 1040, 1044-46 (5th Cir. 1992). Aside from conclusional allegations that the district court judge had \u201ca personal bias, prejudice and/or impartiality against [defense counsel] and/or his client,\u201d Lopez failed to state facts showing the judge had an actual personal extrajudicial bias or prejudice against him in particular. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144 and 455(b)(1); <em>Patterson, </em>335 F.3d at 483-84. \u201cIn order for bias against an attorney to require disqualification of the trial judge, it must be of a continuing and personal nature and not simply bias against the attorney or in favor of another attorney because of his conduct.\u201d <em>Henderson v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr., </em>901 F.2d 1288, 1296 (5th Cir.1990) (citation omitted). The alleged facts, if true, would not convince a reasonable person the judge had an actual, personal extrajudicial bias or prejudice against defense counsel. <em>See, e.g., Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994); <em>Patterson, </em>335 F.3d at 483-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-18\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
