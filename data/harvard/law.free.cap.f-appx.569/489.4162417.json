We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Valdez v. Rosenbaum, </em>302 F.3d 1039, 1043 (9th Cir.2002), and may affirm on any ground supported by the record, <em>Johnson v. Riverside Healthcare Sys., LP, </em>534 F.3d 1116, 1121 (9th Cir.2008). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Kenner\u2019s due process claim concerning his placement in administrative segregation pending disciplinary charges because Kenner failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether his placement gave rise to a protected liberty interest warranting due process protections. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 486, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (administrative segregation by itself does not implicate a protected liberty interest because it does not impose an atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life); <em>see also Cousins v. Lockyer, </em>568 F.3d 1063, 1070-71 (9th Cir.2009) (failure to comply with prison regulations does not amount to a constitutional violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Summary judgment on Kenner\u2019s due process claim concerning his confinement to disciplinary segregation and loss of good time credits was proper because, even assuming Kenner raised a triable dispute as to whether these restraints gave rise to a protected liberty interest, he received all the process that he was due. <em>See Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 564-67, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) (setting forth due process requirements before imposing sanctions implicating a prisoner\u2019s liberty interest); <em>Koenig v. Vannelli, </em>971 F.2d 422, 423 (9th Cir.1992) (prison officials may limit an inmate\u2019s efforts to defend himself if they have a legitimate penological reason).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">We do not consider issues regarding the dismissal of Kenner\u2019s conspiracy and Eighth Amendment claims because they are not supported by argument. <em>See Am. Int\u2019l Enters., Inc. v. FDIC, </em>3 F.3d 1263, 1266 n. 5 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">Kenner\u2019s contentions regarding defendants\u2019 alleged failure to give him <em>Miranda </em>warnings and their alleged decision to place him in the equivalent of solitary confinement are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
