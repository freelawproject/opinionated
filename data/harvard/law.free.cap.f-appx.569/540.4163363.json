We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">Plantiff does not argue that the police car\u2019s rolling over him was anything but an accident. Police officers\u2019 conduct only implicates the Fourth Amendment when it involves <em>\u201cmeans intentionally applied.\u201d Brower v. Cnty. of Inyo, </em>489 U.S. 593, 597, 109 S.Ct. 1378, 103 L.Ed.2d 628 (1989). \u201c[T]he Fourth Amendment addresses \u2018misuse of power,\u2019 <em>Byars v. United States, </em>273 U.S. 28, 33, 47 S.Ct. 248, 71 L.Ed. 520 (1927), not the accidental effects of otherwise lawful government conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596, 109 S.Ct. 1378. Here, because the car was not a \u201cmeans intentionally applied,\u201d the Fourth Amendment was not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">Nor does this court\u2019s \u201c \u2018continuing seizure\u2019 rule, which provides that \u2018once a seizure has occurred\u2019, it continues throughout the time the arrestee is in the custody of the arresting officers,\u201d <em>Torres v. City of Madera, </em>524 F.3d 1053, 1056 (9th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Robins v. Harum, </em>773 F.2d 1004, 1010 (9th Cir.1985)), help plaintiff. Even under the continuing seizure rule, the officers must apply a use of force\u2014in other words, a means intentionally applied, <em>Brower, </em>489 U.S. at 597, 109 S.Ct. 1378\u2014 to implicate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">Because the officers\u2019 negligent conduct causing the accident did not implicate the Fourth Amendment, we affirm the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b563-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
