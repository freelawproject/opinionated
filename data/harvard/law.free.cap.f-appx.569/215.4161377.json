Benoit moves for appointment of appellate counsel. However, he is not proceeding in forma pauperis, and he has made no attempt to show that he is indigent. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(1). Accordingly, his motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In his complaint, Benoit alleged that he had been illegally arrested and was illegally confined and that after his arrest there was an illegal search and seizure. The district court agreed with the magistrate judge\u2019s determination that the complaint failed to state a claim because the relief Benoit sought\u2014immediate release\u2014could not be obtained via \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Although Benoit reasserts in his appellate brief the claims he raised below, he does not address the district court\u2019s reason for dismissing the complaint. Thus, he has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). Benoit raises for the first time on appeal numerous issues that he did not raise in the district court. We decline to address these issues. <em>See Stewart Glass &amp; Mirror, Inc. v. U.S. Auto Glass Discount Centers, Inc., </em>200 F.3d 307, 316-17 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b237-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
