The district court denied Scott\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and sentenced Scott to concurrent terms of 188 months of imprisonment on each count, concurrent supervised release terms of three and five years, and $200 in special assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">On appeal, appellant asserts primarily that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>647 F.3d 41, 57 (2d Cir.2011). Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, a defendant may withdraw his guilty plea before the district court imposes a sentence if \u201cthe defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d Fed.R. Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). In determining whether the defendant has met this standard, district courts \u201cshould consider, inter alia: (1) the amount of time that has elapsed between the plea and the motion; (2) whether the defendant has asserted a claim of legal innocence; and (3) whether the government would be prejudiced by a withdrawal of the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Doe, </em>537 F.3d 204, 210 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">\u201cA defendant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing as a matter of right whenever he seeks to withdraw his guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>970 F.2d 1095, 1100 (2d Cir.1992). \u201cAlthough the standard to be applied in granting a hearing is less rigorous than the standard for granting the motion to withdraw the plea, the defendant must present some significant questions concerning the voluntariness or general validity of the plea to justify an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cNo hearing need be granted when the allegations on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea before sentencing merely contradict the record, are inherently incredible, or are simply conelusory.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">Applying these standards, we conclude that the district court acted well within its discretion in denying Scott\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea without holding an evidentiary hearing. As recognized by the court, Scott\u2019s assertions that his plea was involuntary are belied by his own statements, made under oath during his plea allocution, representing that his plea was knowing and voluntary and was supported by a factual basis, and confirming that he understood the specific rights he was giving up by pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">It was also not an abuse of discretion for the district court to have concluded that Scott\u2019s claims of coercion\u2014that is, that the FBI told his wife he would be sure to \u201cget 45 years,\u201d and that she could be charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>with a crime\u2014were not credible. As an initial matter, any statement by an FBI agent that Scott would \u201cget 45 years\u201d would have been an accurate description of the risk Scott would have taken in going to trial, and thus cannot provide the basis for withdrawing his guilty plea. <em>Accord Doe, </em>537 F.3d at 212 (\u201cThis statement was neither a threat, a misrepresentation, nor a promise unrelated to the prosecutor\u2019s business. It was, rather, a true recital of the scenario that would play out should the defendant choose to proceed to trial.\u201d (citation omitted)). With respect to the alleged threats that his wife would be \u201ccharge[d] ... with a crime,\u201d the district court\u2019s decision not to credit this vague and conclusory assertion cannot be said to have been a clearly erroneous factual finding, nor an abuse of discretion, particularly in light of Scott\u2019s statements at his plea allocution, defense counsel\u2019s representation that he did not believe he could make a plea withdrawal motion on Scott\u2019s behalf \u201cin good faith,\u201d and the district court\u2019s docket in this case, which reflects that the parties had been engaged in ongoing plea negotiations for many months prior to Scott\u2019s decision to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Finally, though Scott emphasizes on appeal how quickly he had moved to withdraw his plea after the hearing, that is only one of several factors a district court should consider, <em>see Doe, </em>537 F.3d at 210-11, and it alone does not create a question as to the voluntariness of Scott\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">We have considered Scott\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
