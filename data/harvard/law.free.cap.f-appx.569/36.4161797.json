We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and underlying proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to: (1) vacate the dismissal of Morales\u2019s claims against defendants Andrew Czubatyj, Richard Phelan, Steven Weiss, and Mitchell Rubin; and (2) affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">We review Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals de novo, \u201caccepting all factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Litwin v. Blackstone Grp., L.P., </em>634 F.3d 706, 715 (2d Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the complaint must plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Courts should read a pro se complaint with \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d and interpret it \u201cto raise the strongest [claims] that [it] suggest[s].\u201d <em>Hill v. Curcione, </em>657 F.3d 116, 122 (2d Cir.2011) (alterations in Hill) (internal quotation marks omitted). Courts should generally not deny leave to amend a pro se complaint unless amendment would be futile. <em>See Cuoco v. Moritsugu, </em>222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">Our review of the complaint in this case leads us to conclude that the district court erred in dismissing Morales\u2019s claims against police officers Czubatyj and Phelan. The complaint\u2019s allegations, which we accept as true for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6), that those officers repeatedly tasered and kicked Morales when he was unarmed were sufficient to state claims for excessive force. We further conclude that the district court erred in dismissing Morales\u2019s claims against prosecutors Weiss and Rubin without affording plaintiff the opportunity to amend his pro se complaint to allege sufficient facts that those defendants acted outside the scope of their roles as prosecutors and, thus, were not shielded by absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">Accordingly, the dismissal of Morales\u2019s claims against Czubatyj, Phelan, Weiss, and Rubin is VACATED and the matter is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order. In all other respects, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
