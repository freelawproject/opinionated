After reviewing Bey\u2019s handwritten petition, the district court issued an order on September 26, 2018, directing Bey to submit an amended petition and either pay the filing fee or apply to proceed in forma pauperis. The order also warned Bey of the consequences of faffing to comply with the court\u2019s order. <em>See Ballard v. Carlson, </em>882 F.2d 93, 95-96 (1989). When that order was returned as undeliverable, the district court concluded that Bey failed to notify it of a change of address, failed to comply with its September 26 order, and dismissed the action without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that the court\u2019s September 26 order -was mailed to an incorrect address, the origins of which are not known. We conclude, therefore, that Bey should be given an opportunity to comply with the court\u2019s order and pursue in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding those claims that, but for the district court\u2019s addressing error, could have been further developed before the district court. Accordingly, we grant Bey leave to proceed in forma pauperis, vacate the October 9 dismissal order, and remand the action for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
