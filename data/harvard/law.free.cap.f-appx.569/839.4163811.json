The sole issue raised in this appeal is whether the district court erred in calculating Harris\u2019 guidelines sentence when it concluded that his 2011 burglary conviction qualified as a prior felony conviction for a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">In determining Harris\u2019 guidelines sentence, the district court applied United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), which assigns defendants a base offense level of 20 if they are convicted under 18 U.S.C \u00a7 922(a)-(g) and have a prior felony conviction for a crime of violence. The guidelines define \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) as any offense punishable by a prison term of more than one year that either (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another person, or (2) presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, such as <em>\u201cburglary of a dwelling, </em>arson, or extortion.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) (Nov. 2012) (emphasis added). Over Harris\u2019 objection, the district court concluded that he had a prior felony conviction for a crime of violence based on his 2011 conviction for burglary in Georgia, and it therefore assigned him a base offense level of 20 according to \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-16\">Recognizing that \u00a7 4B1.2(a) lists \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d as the type of burglary that qualifies as a crime of violence, Harris argues that his 2011 conviction was not for a crime of violence because he was not convicted of burglarizing a dwelling. He contends that he was instead convicted of burglarizing a \u201cstructure designed for use as the dwelling of another,\u201d and his conviction cannot qualify as a crime of violence under the guidelines because the category \u201cstructure designed for use as the dwelling of another\u201d includes buildings that are not actual dwellings. His argument is one which we review <em>de novo. United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 975 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-17\">In 2011 the Georgia burglary statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-18\">A person commits the offense of burglary when, without authority and with the intent to commit a felony or theft therein, he enters or remains within the dwelling house of another or any building, vehicle, railroad car, watercraft, or other such structure designed for use as the dwelling of another or enters or remains within any other building, rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>road car, aircraft, or any room or any part thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-7-1(a) (current version at Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-7-1(b)). Harris and the government agree that \u00a7 16-7-1 (a) is a divisible statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and they also agree that the <em>Shepard</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>documents related to the 2011 conviction show that Harris was convicted under the portion of \u00a7 16-7-1(a) that makes it a crime to unlawfully enter a \u201cstructure designed for use as the dwelling of another\u201d with the intent to commit a crime inside. Therefore the only issue for us to decide is whether burglary of a \u201cstructure designed for use as the dwelling of another\u201d categorically qualifies as \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). <em>See United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1350 (11th Cir.2008) (noting that \u201cwe consider the offense [categorically] as defined by the law, rather than considering the facts of the specific violation,\u201d when determining whether a prior conviction qualifies as a crime of violence).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Four of our sister circuits have already defined \u201cdwelling\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Relying on <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>all four have agreed that a \u201cdwelling\u201d under \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) is an \u201cenclosed space which is used or intended for use as a human habitation.\u201d <em>United States v. McClenton, </em>53 F.3d 584, 587 (3d Cir. 1995) (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>505 (6th ed.1990)); <em>accord United States v. Ramirez, </em>708 F.3d 295, 303 (1st Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Rivera-Oros, </em>590 F.3d 1123, 1132 (10th Cir. 2009); <em>United States v. Graham, </em>982 F.2d 315, 316 (8th Cir.1992). We follow those other circuits and apply the same definition of a dwelling for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">In resolving the question presented here, we find it instructive that the definition mentions both \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cintended use.\u201d By including both of those terms, the definition of a \u201cdwelling\u201d includes not only structures that are presently \u201cused\u201d for human habitation, but also structures that are simply \u201cintended for use as a human habitation.\u201d <em>See McClenton, </em>53 F.3d at 587. We see no meaningful distinction between a structure that is \u201cintended\u201d for use as a human habitation and one that is, in the words of Georgia\u2019s burglary statute, \u201cdesigned\u201d for use as a human habitation. <em>See Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary </em>539 (2d ed.2001) (defining \u201cdesign\u201d in part as \u201cto intend for a definite purpose\u201d); <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary </em>373 (3d college ed.1991) (defining \u201cdesign\u201d in part as \u201cto plan to do; purpose; intend\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">Harris\u2019 2011 burglary conviction was for \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4B1.2(a), and the district court did not err in concluding that he had a prior conviction for a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-7\">. <em>See Descamps v.
