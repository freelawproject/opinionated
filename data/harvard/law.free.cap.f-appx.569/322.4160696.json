Davis, Sr. (\u201cDavis\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motions to modify an installment-payment order and for a hearing. For the reasons that follow, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Davis\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Davis filed suit to recover payments made toward federal tax liabilities assessed against him for the trust fund portion of unpaid employment taxes of three entities for which he was a board director.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 7, 2008, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding Davis jointly and severally liable for $3,152,652.85. After Davis unsuccessfully appealed to this court and the Supreme Court denied his petition <em>for </em>writ of certiorari, the government filed a motion for an installment-payment order and the imposition of a ten-percent surcharge with the district court. On October 6, 2011, after denying two of Davis\u2019s motions for oral argument on the issue, the court granted the United States\u2019 installment motion, ordering Davis to pay $3,327 on a monthly basis. After Davis appealed, this court affirmed the district court\u2019s installment-payment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">On February 28, 2013, Davis filed a motion to modify the installment-payment order based on what he describes as a \u201csignificant change in his financial circumstances,\u201d due primarily to the decline of his legal practice. He also filed a motion for a hearing and a motion to stay the installment-payment order. The district court denied his motions to stay the payments and for a hearing on March 11, 2013, stating that \u201c[t]he Court will review the record once briefing on the Motion to Modify is complete and determine at the time if a hearing would assist the Court.\u201d On September 25, 2013, the court denied Davis\u2019s motion to modify, concluding that \u201cDavis did not experience a substantial change in income which would warrant a modification of the Installment Payment Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">Davis appeals, arguing that by failing to modify the installment-payment order, the district court rendered it impossible for him to comply. He claims that the court erred by failing to consider his 2012 income, and by failing to grant his requests for a hearing, which he asserts is statutorily required.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">\u201cBecause the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act (FDCPA) accords district courts broad discretion in issuing installment-payment orders, we review for abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>479 Fed.Appx. at 602; <em>see also FTC v. Nat\u2019l Bus. Consultants, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 317, 321 (5th Cir.2004) (applying abuse of discretion standard for discretionary provision of FDCPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">Pursuant to the FDCPA, a district court may enter an installment-payment order \u201cif it is shown that the judgment debtor\u2014 (1) is receiving or will receive substantial nonexempt disposable earnings from self employment that are not subject to garnishment; or (2) is diverting or concealing substantial earnings from any source, or property received in lieu of earnings.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3204(a). But \u201c[a]n order may not be issued under subsection (a) with respect to any earnings of the debtor except nonexempt disposable earnings.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3204(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">The statute further provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-15\">In fixing the amount of the payments, the court shall take into consideration after a hearing, the income, resources, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>and reasonable requirements of the judgment debtor and the judgment debtor\u2019s dependents, any other payments to be made in satisfaction of judgments against the judgment debtor, and the amount due on the judgment in favor of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3204(a). It also provides that \u201cthe court <em>may </em>modify\u201d installment-payment orders \u201cupon a showing that the judgment debtor\u2019s financial circumstances have changed or that assets not previously disclosed by the judgment debtor have been discovered.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3204(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Davis\u2019s main challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to modify is based on his contention that his income decreased significantly since the original installment calculation. But the district court did not, as Davis asserts, ignore his 2012 earnings in denying his motion. It noted that Davis\u2019s average income from 2008 to 2010 was $159,716. In comparison, his average income from 2009 to 2011 was $158,794. \u201cBased on these calculations,\u201d the court found \u201cthat Davis did not experience a substantial change in income which would warrant a modification of the Installment Payment Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The district court\u2019s decision to compare Davis\u2019s three-year average incomes was consistent with the way it originally calculated his monthly payment amount, which this court affirmed in June 2012. <em>Davis, </em>479 Fed.Appx. at 603-04. And while the district court order did not specifically mention Davis\u2019s 2012 earnings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it commented on ways he could reduce expenses so as to meet his monthly payment obligations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">Davis continues to make spending choices which fail to indicate the necessity of a modification to this Court\u2019s Order. Davis continues to provide his adult son with approximately $1,700 each month and provided what amounts to $1,406.50 each month to charitable organizations. This $3,100 each month would go a long way in helping Davis satisfy the monthly $3,327 he owes the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Based on its review of his income (both current and historical) and expenses, the court found that Davis was able to meet his payment schedule. We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Davis failed to show a substantial change in circumstances warranting a modification of his payment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">We also hold that the remainder of Davis\u2019s appeal is either meritless or foreclosed by our court\u2019s previous rulings. Davis claims that the district court erroneously considered amounts he paid in taxes as disposable income, and improperly included in its average-income figure exempt retirement earnings. But, as this court held in rejecting his previous appeal, Davis\u2019s \u201carguments are premised on an incorrect reading of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603. Any error in calculating his average income would not render the payment plan unlawful because \u201c[t]he requirement that a judgment debtor have \u2018substantial nonexempt disposable earnings\u2019 merely preconditions the district court\u2019s authority to issue an installment-payment order; it does not delimit that authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, \u201cthe [district] court was not required to use 25% of Davis\u2019s income\u2014or earnings\u2014 as its basis,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 604, and could instead have ordered any amount supported by the totality of his finances, so long as substantial nonexempt disposable earnings were available. We hold that Davis\u2019s challenges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>to the district court\u2019s computation of his monthly-payment amount are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Finally, Davis argues that the district court erred by denying him hearings (1) for determining the appropriate payment amounts, and (2) to show that a modification was necessary based on changed financial circumstances. He raises essentially the same arguments we rejected in his previous appeal. In that appeal, this court held: \u201cwe see no merit in Davis\u2019s contention that he was entitled to oral argument in satisfaction of his right to due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). \u201cDavis ... received all the process he was due under [\u00a7 3204(a) ]\u201d because \u201cthe district court explained it would set argument, if needed, after the briefing was complete,\u201d and then \u201cheard from both parties and considered the factors enumerated by \u00a7 3204(a) in fixing the payment amounts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As before, the district court allowed both parties to fully brief the motion for modification, allowed Davis to submit evidence of a change in his financial condition, and considered the \u00a7 3204(a) factors in its order denying Davis relief. Because a district court is not statutorily required to hold oral argument for a motion such as Davis\u2019s, it did not abuse its discretion by denying his motion for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s orders in their entirety.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
