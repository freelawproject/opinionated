He now appeals his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-27\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-28\">In December 2012 Morton escaped from a community correction center where he was finishing serving a federal sentence. He has a serious and extensive criminal history. In 2005 Morton was convicted in Pennsylvania state court for possession of a firearm without a license. In 2006 he was indicted in federal court for being a felon in possession of a firearm. In 2007, while on pre-trial bond for the 2006 offense, he was again caught possessing a firearm and indicted on a second felon in possession charge. Morton was sentenced to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment for the 2006 offense and 57 months\u2019 imprisonment on the 2007 offense. It was while serving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>time for these offenses that he escaped from the community correction center.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Six weeks after escaping from the center, Morton was arrested during a traffic stop. He subsequently pled guilty to escape after conviction, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a). At sentencing, neither Morton nor the Government contested the Presentence Investigation Report\u2019s Guidelines calculation, which provided for a range of 15 to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, the Government sought an upward variance to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory maximum for a violation of \u00a7 751(a). Morton objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">At Morton\u2019s sentencing hearing in August 2013 the District Court explained that the Guidelines range was inappropriately low and that Morton\u2019s prior record called for an upward variance. (App. at 71-80.) As noted, the Court imposed a sentence of 42 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Morton claims that the sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We review both the procedural and the substantive reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United, States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Tomko, </em>562 F.3d 558, 567 (3d Cir.2009) <em>(en Banc). </em>We must \u201censure that the [District [CJourt committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If the sentence is proeedurally sound, we then consider if it is substantively reasonable given \u201cthe totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">Morton argues that the District Court failed to explain its reasons for imposing an upward variance and failed to consider meaningfully the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. However, as Morton admits, the District Court gave a lengthy explanation of the sentence. (App. at 71-80.) The Court reviewed the arguments by the Government and Morton and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it imposed the above-Guidelines sentence. (Id.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court determined that Morton\u2019s extensive criminal record, the evident failure of his prior incarceration to deter him from engaging in further criminal activity, his disregard for the law, and the risk he posed to the public, warranted an upward variance in his sentence. <em>(Id. </em>at 75-77.) That determination was neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable. For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-18\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. Our jurisdiction is pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\">. Morton also argues that the sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the District Court did not follow the procedures for an upward departure described in \u00a7 4A1.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines. However, as the Government correctly explains, Morton\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 4A1.3(a) is incorrect because that section deals with upward <em>departures, </em>whereas in this case the Government sought an upward <em>variance </em>based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Fumo, </em>655 F.3d 288, 317 (3d Cir.2011) (explaining that a \"departure\u201d \"diverges ... from the originally calculated range 'for reasons contemplated by the Guidelines themselves,' \u201d whereas a \"variance\u201d \"diverges ... from the Guidelines, including any departures, based on an exercise of the court\u2019s discretion under \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The District Court clearly stated that it was varying upward based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Therefore, \u00a7 4A1.3 is irrelevant. The Government claims that this argument was waived and should only be reviewed for plain error. As Morton loses no matter the standard of review, we need not determine that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
