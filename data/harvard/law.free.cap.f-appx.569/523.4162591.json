We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a district court\u2019s decision on cross-motions for summary judgment <em>de novo. Guatay Christian Fellowship v. Cnty. of San Diego, </em>670 F.3d 957, 970 (9th Cir.2011). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">In this insurance action based upon diversity jurisdiction, \u201cCalifornia law controls.\u201d <em>St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Ralee Eng\u2019g Co., </em>804 F.2d 520, 522 (9th Cir.1986). An \u201cinsurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of, or if the third party lawsuit pleads, facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement.\u201d Aroa <em>Mktg., Inc. v. Hartford Ins. Co. of Midwest, </em>198 Cal.App.4th 781, 786, 130 Cal.Rptr.3d 466 (2011) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The district court did not err in concluding that State Farm\u2019s duty to defend FMOA in the underlying suit was never implicated because the alleged misconduct\u2014the firing of an employee in violation of California Military &amp; Veterans Code \u00a7 394 and the</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4301, <em>et </em>seq.\u2014did not fall within the scope of FMOA\u2019s Directors and Officers (\u201cDO\u201d) liability policy. The DO policy covered \u201cthose sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018wrongful acts\u2019 committed by an insured solely in the conduct of their management responsibilities for the Condominium/Assoeiation.\u201d The policy defined \u201cwrongful acts\u201d to mean \u201cany negligent acts, errors, omissions or breach of duty directly related to the operations of the Condominium/Association.\u201d Established California law holds that this policy languages reaches only negligent conduct\u2014 \u201cnegligent act[s], negligent error[s], or negligent omission[s].\u201d <em>Oak Park Calabasas Condo. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>137 Cal.App.4th 557, 564, 40 Cal. Rptr.3d 263 (2006). Since the firing of an employee is an intentional act, it cannot qualify as negligence and does not fall within the policy. <em>See Coit Drapery Cleaners, Inc. v. Sequoia Ins. Co., 14 </em>Cal.App.4th 1595, 1603, 18 Cal.Rptr.2d 692 (1993). Accordingly, FMOA has not shown there was a potential for coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">FMOA\u2019s alternative argument that, even if the firing were intentional, the supposedly <em>ultra vires </em>act of the board president in terminating the employee cannot be relied upon to deny coverage to FMOA under the policy\u2019s \u201cseparation of insureds\u201d clause is of no moment. FMOA was the only entity sued, and it was not sued on a theory of vicarious liability, but directly, as any corporation can be. Cal. Corp.Code \u00a7 105; <em>see also Heiman v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., </em>149 Cal.App.4th 724, 739, 57 Cal.Rptr.3d 56 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">Finally, because State Farm\u2019s duty to defend FMOA was never implicated, State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Farm was not contractually liable for refusing to accept FMOA\u2019s tender of defense. Since it was not contractually liable for the tender, there was no. breach of contract. And because there was no breach of contract, FMOA\u2019s claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing also fails. <em>See Waller v. Truck Ins. Exch., Inc., </em>11 Cal.4th 1, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 870, 900 P.2d 619, 639 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Since no duty to defend arose, we need not address the applicability of the civil rights exclusion in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
