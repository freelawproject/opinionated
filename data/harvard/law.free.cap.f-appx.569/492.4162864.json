We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000), and may affirm on any ground supported by the record, <em>Thompson v. Paul, </em>547 F.3d 1055, 1058-59 (9th Cir.2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Dismissal of Polk\u2019s claims under \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 for alleged violations of her First, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments rights, and for a conspiracy to discriminate based on religious animus, was proper because Polk failed to file this action within the applicable two-year statute of limitations, or establish grounds for equitable tolling or equitable estoppel. <em>See Douglas v. Noelle, </em>567 F.3d 1103, 1109 (9th Cir. 2009) (\u00a7 1983 claim accrues when the plaintiff knows or should know of the injury that is the basis of the cause of action); <em>Taylor v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., </em>993 F.2d 710, 711 (9th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (California\u2019s statute of limitations for personal injury actions governs claims brought under \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985); <em>see also Lukovsky v. City &amp; County of San Francisco, </em>535 F.3d 1044, 1051-52 (9th Cir. 2008) (discussing requirements for equitable tolling and equitable estoppel under California law); Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 335.1 (two-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">The district court properly dismissed Polk\u2019s claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d) because, despite numerous amendments, Polk failed to allege sufficient facts to show that defendants conducted an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity or the collection of an unlawful debt. <em>See Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., </em>473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985) (setting forth elements of a civil RICO claim under); <em>Cholla Ready Mix, Inc. v. Civish, </em>382 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2004) (court need not accept as true allegations that are eonclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">Polk\u2019s contentions regarding defendants\u2019 alleged violation of the Hobbs Act, the district court\u2019s alleged failure to grant an additional extension of time to further amend her complaint, and the allegedly premature dismissal of her action before the commencement of discovery are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b515-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
