We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Toguchi v. Chung, </em>391 F.3d 1051, 1056 (9th Cir.2004). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Lebovitz\u2019s Eighth Amendment claims because Lebovitz failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether defendant was deliberately indifferent in her treatment of his various medical conditions. <em>See id. </em>at 1057-58, 1060 (deliberate indifference is a high legal standard, and is met only if the defendant knows of and disregards an excessive risk to the prisoner\u2019s health; negligence and a mere difference in medical opinion are insufficient); <em>see also Starr v. Baca, </em>652 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir.2011) (requirements for establishing supervisory liability); <em>Nelson v. Pima Cmty. Coll., </em>83 F.3d 1075, 1081-82 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201c[M]ere allegation and speculation do not create a factual dispute for purposes of summary judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Lebovitz\u2019s retaliation claim because Lebovitz failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether defendant took an adverse action against him because Lebovitz filed grievances. <em>See Brodheim v. Cry, </em>584 F.3d 1262, 1271 (9th Cir.2009) (setting forth the elements of a retaliation claim in the prison context and stating that \u201ca plaintiff must show that his protected conduct was the \u2018substantial\u2019 or \u2018motivating\u2019 factor behind the defendant\u2019s conduct\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-18\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Lebovitz\u2019s motion to appoint counsel because Lebovitz failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances. <em>See Palmer v. Valdez, </em>560 F.3d 965, 970 (9th Cir.2009) (setting forth standard of review and requirement of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d for appointment of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-19\">Kenyon\u2019s motion to strike portions of Lebovitz\u2019s reply brief, filed on October 17, 2013, is denied as moot because we do not consider arguments raised for the first time in the reply brief, or allegations raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Smith v. U.S. Customs &amp;. Border Prot., </em>741 F.3d 1016, 1020 n. 2 (9th Cir.2014) (denying motion to strike as moot).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b513-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
