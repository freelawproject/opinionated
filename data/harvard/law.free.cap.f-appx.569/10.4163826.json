Christensen, which denied her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>See In re Cai Hua Chen, </em>No. A087 980 894 (B.I.A. July 24, 2012), <em>aff'g </em>No. A087 980 894 (Immig.Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 4, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the decision of the IJ as supplemented and modified by the BIA. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">For applications such as Chen\u2019s, governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, \u201cConsidering the totality of the circumstances,\u201d base a credibility finding on the applicant\u2019s \u201cdemeanor, candor, or responsiveness,\u201d the plausibility of her account, and inconsistencies in her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008). We \u201cdefer to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make\u201d such a ruling. <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">As a preliminary matter, the BIA did not err in denying asylum based on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Although the BIA may not make findings of fact, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv), here, it relied only on the IJ\u2019s findings that Chen lacked credibility and did not independently corroborate her testimony to determine that she failed to establish her eligibility for asylum, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1208.13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">Moreover, the adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. The agency reasonably based its credibility finding on the inconsistency between Chen\u2019s testimony that she hid in her sister\u2019s home after she removed her intrauterine device in October 2004 and her application statement that she hid there after discovering her second pregnancy in January 2005. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii), 1231(b)(3)(C); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167 (providing that an IJ may support an adverse credibility determination with \u201cany inconsistency\u201d). The IJ reasonably rejected Chen\u2019s explanation that she did not prepare her application with detail, given that her application clearly states that she hid in her sister\u2019s home to evade detection of her second pregnancy. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-13\">The adverse credibility determination is also supported by the IJ\u2019s observation that Chen was evasive and hesitant while testifying to how she hired a smuggler and the age of her eldest son. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir.2006) (upholding a negative demeanor finding when supported by specific instanc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>es of inconsistent testimony). Although Chen argues that her delay in stating her son\u2019s age was due to difficulty converting dates from the Chinese to the U.S. calendar, the IJ was not required to credit this explanation as the record indicates that it was the IJ who, with the aid of the interpreter, converted the age. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Chen also argues that the BIA erroneously required her to provide corroborating documents from her persecutor by finding that the sterilization document did not rehabilitate her testimony. To the contrary, the BIA relied on the lack of corroboration only to affirm the IJ\u2019s determination that Chen\u2019s non-credible testimony and documentary evidence did not satisfy her burden of proof. Chen\u2019s failure to submit independent, reliable corroborating evidence made her unable to rehabilitate her testimony. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Given the inconsistent dates and Chen\u2019s problematic demeanor, the totality of the circumstances supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. Because the only evidence of a threat to Chen\u2019s life or freedom based on her violation of China\u2019s family planning policy depended upon her credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes all forms of relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Chen additionally argues that she established her eligibility for relief from removal because she would be arrested, detained, and harmed based on her illegal departure from China. However, prosecution for illegal departure does not constitute persecution absent evidence that prosecuting authorities have a motive other than law enforcement, which Chen did not allege. <em>See Saleh v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>962 F.2d 234, 239 (2d Cir.1992). Nor did Chen submit particularized evidence that she would be intentionally tortured. <em>See Pierre v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 109, 121 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 157-60 (2d Cir.2005). Accordingly, the agency did not err in denying relief based on Chen\u2019s illegal departure. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16(b)-(c), 1208.17(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
