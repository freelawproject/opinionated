Prine challenges the exclusion of evidence that he did not possess child pornography; the denial of a jury instruction on entrapment; and the sufficiency of the evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-25\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding as irrelevant evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>that investigators did not discover child pornography in Prine\u2019s home or on his computer. To be relevant, evidence must have a \u201ctendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence\u201d and must be \u201cof consequence in determining the action.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 401. The lack of child pornography in Prine\u2019s home is not probative of whether he intended to have a sexual encounter with a minor. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b); <em>United States v. Ellisor, 522 </em>F.3d 1255, 1270 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cevidence of good conduct is not admissible to negate criminal intent\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Camejo, </em>929 F.2d 610, 613 (11th Cir.1991)). Prine argues, for the first time, that evidence proved that he lacked the predisposition to induce a minor to engage in a sexual activity, but he could not introduce evidence about entrapment when he failed to prove that the government \u201cpush[ed]\u201d him to commit the crime, <em>see United States v. Parr, </em>716 F.2d 796, 802-03 (11th Cir.1983). Because \u201c[\u00a1Irrelevant evidence is not admissible,\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 402, the district court correctly excluded evidence unrelated to Prine\u2019s charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion by refusing to instruct the jury about entrapment. \u201cEntrapment is an affirmative defense and requires a defendant to prove that, but for the persuasion or mild coercion of the government, he would not have committed the crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Louis, </em>559 F.3d 1220, 1224 (11th Cir.2009). Prine responded within an hour to a vague advertisement containing the phrases \u201cP.hamily fun\u201d and \u201cserious replies only\u201d that had been posted on a Craigslist website by Corporal James Morton, who investigated online predators. The advertisement also used a code for \u201cP.T.H.C.\u201d Morton, posing as \u201cCindy,\u201d replied vaguely, \u201cPm all ears.\u201d Prine inquired if she had \u201ckids\u201d and their \u201cage/ sex.\u201d When Cindy did not reply, Prine reinitiated contact six hours later about the \u201cposting for what [he] thought was family fun,\u201d which he described as \u201csexual interaction' between family members.\u201d Prine continued to exchange emails with Cindy for five hours, during which he discovered that Cindy had two daughters who were \u201cnot much older\u201d than \u201c9 + \u201d; he probed into the girls\u2019 sexual experiences; and he planned to meet the girls two days later. Prine also emailed Cindy and eagerly discussed the rendezvous on Monday morning, Monday evening, and Tuesday morning. Prine argues that he was induced by Morton\u2019s emails suggesting that sexual contact with the girls was normal and beneficial to them, but the emails reveal that Morton did not \u201cimplant in [Prine\u2019s] mind ... the disposition to commit the alleged offense and induce its commission,\u201d <em>Sorrells v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 435, 442, 53 S.Ct. 210, 213, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932). Prine commenced and reinitiated each email exchange with Cindy about her girls; he inquired about what sexual activities were permitted and prohibited; he promptly scheduled a rendezvous with them; and he suggested that he could develop a rapport with the girls by buying them ice cream and by bringing pizza for dinner. In sharp contrast to Prine, Cindy was vague and nonexplicit in her responses. Prine was not entitled to a jury instruction on entrapment when he initiated contact with Cindy and suggested having sexual activity with her daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Ample evidence supports Prine\u2019s conviction for attempting to induce a minor to engage in sexual activity prohibited by state law. Prine\u2019s emails established that he intended to abuse two girls who were less than 12 years old by subjecting them to sexual contact. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-6-69.1(a). A jury reasonably could find that Prine thought the girls were younger than 12 years old. Prine expressed a prefer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>ence for girls \u201c9 + \u201d and he cunningly suggested enticing the girls with child-friendly food. Cindy told Prine that her \u201ctwo girls [were] not much older\u201d than \u201c9 + \u201d; she cautioned Prine against using explicit language around her \u201cbabies\u201d; she mentioned that the girls\u2019 bedtime was 9:00 p.m. on school nights and that she helped them bathe and dress; she stated that the girls \u201cfe[lt] comfortable in their room\u201d and her younger daughter \u201clike[d] her stuffed animals\u201d; and she mentioned that the girls \u201cpicked ... out\u201d their outfits \u201ccause they wanted to be able tell [Prine] that its their favorite to wear\u201d and that she was \u201cmak[ing] a bow to go with their outfits.\u201d A reasonable jury also could find that Prine intended to molest the girls. Prine told Cindy that he \u201cwouldent feel right f* * *ing\u201d the girls, and he asked if they \u201clike[d] to touch and explore a man\u201d;, if he could \u201ctouch[ ]/explor[e] them\u201d; and if one of the girls had \u201cmasturbate[d] herself ... or [if] someone [did] it for her.\u201d And Prine took substantial steps in an attempt to have a tryst with the girls. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b); <em>United States v. Lanzan, </em>639 F.3d 1293, 1296-97, 1299 (11 th Cir.2011). He arranged to meet the girls in their home on a day and time convenient for their schedule; he traveled to their home; and he arrived with a pizza to entice them.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Prine disputes his conviction on the ground that he communicated exclusively with an adult, but Prine concedes that his argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Murrell, </em>368 F.3d 1283 (11th Cir.2004). In <em>Murrell, </em>we held that a defendant\u2019s \u201cconduct fit[ ] squarely within the definition of \u2018induce\u2019 \u201d under section 2422(b), when he, through \u201cnegotiating with the purported father of a minor, ... attempted to stimulate or cause the minor to engage in sexual activity with him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1287. And we have since reiterated that \u201c[a] defendant can be convicted under ... section [2422(b) ] when he arranges to have sex with a minor or a supposed minor through communications with an adult intermediary.\u201d <em>Lanzon, </em>639 F.3d at 1299 (citing <em>Murrell </em>and <em>United States v. Lee, </em>603 F.3d 904, 912-13 (11th Cir.2010)). \u201cUnder the prior precedent rule, we are bound to follow [our] prior binding precedent \u2018unless and until it is overruled by this court <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>342 F.3d 1245, 1246 (11th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">We AFFIRM Prine\u2019s conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
