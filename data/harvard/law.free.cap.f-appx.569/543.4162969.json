SMITH, and MURGUIA, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Petitioner Rodney Barno appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas petition. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">First, it is not clearly established that the Sixth Amendment prohibits a sentencing court from using a defendant\u2019s prior juvenile adjudication to enhance his sentence beyond the statutory maximum. <em>See Boyd v. Newland, </em>467 F.3d 1139, 1152 (9th Cir.2006); <em>see also John-Charles v. California, </em>646 F.3d 1243, 1252-53 (9th Cir. 2011). Therefore, the California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that Barno\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by the trial court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence beyond the statutory maximum based on his juvenile adjudications was not contrary to clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Second, it is also not clearly established that the admission of propensity evidence violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Alberni v. McDaniel, </em>458 F.3d 860, 866 (9th Cir. 2006). The California Court of Appeal held that Barno\u2019s right to a fundamentally fair trial was not violated by the trial court\u2019s failure to limit the jury\u2019s consideration of uncharged domestic violence evidence to the domestic violence counts. This decision was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">Third, assuming the existence of a freestanding actual innocence claim, the California Court of Appeal\u2019s denial of Barno\u2019s actual innocence claim was not unreasonable because Barno failed to meet the \u201cextraordinarily high\u201d threshold showing for such a claim. <em>See Herrera v. Collins, </em>506 U.S. 390, 417, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993). We view his family members\u2019 affidavits with suspicion. <em>See id. </em>They also do not affirmatively prove his innocence. <em>See Carriger v. Stewart, </em>132 F.3d 463, 477 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">Finally, we conclude that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that Bar-no was not prejudiced by any alleged errors on his trial counsel\u2019s part was not unreasonable under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), in light of the significant evidence of Barno\u2019s guilt at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b566-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
