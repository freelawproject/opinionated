We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal order. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). For the reasons set forth below, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-28\">Pittman initiated this action by filing a complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the District Court. In the complaint, he al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>leged that he has been unlawfully imprisoned because the criminal information against him was wrongfully amended in 1998 proceedings in the Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas. He named as defendants the Lehigh County District Attorney;. the Lehigh County District Attorney\u2019s Office; the Lehigh County Public Defender\u2019s Office; Lehigh County; the Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas; two assistant district attorneys; four defense attorneys; two judges of the Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas; and a judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Pittman requested $100 million in compensatory damages and $100 million in punitive damages from each defendant, plus fees and costs. He further requested a declaratory judgment acknowledging that he was wrongfully imprisoned. Pittman also moved to amend his complaint to include several state-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The District Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, citing the immunity of all defendants from Pittman\u2019s \u00a7 1988 claims. Pittman then filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The District Court\u2019s disposition of this case was correct. Judges are generally immune from suits for money damages. Mi<em>reles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 9, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991). If the actions underlying the complaint were judicial and were not performed \u201cin the complete absence of all jurisdiction,\u201d then this immunity is absolute, regardless of whether the judicial acts were malicious, corrupt, or wrong. <em>Id. </em>at 11-18, 112 S.Ct. 286. The judges\u2019 acts to which Pittman points\u2014permitting the amendment of criminal information, sentencing a defendant, and dismissing motions and petitions\u2014are prototypical judicial acts, inherent to the process of adjudication. <em>See, e.g., Barrett v. Harrington, </em>130 F.3d 246, 255, 257 (6th Cir.1997) (acts of adjudication, including the rendering of judgments and orders, are judicial acts); <em>Figueroa v. Blackburn, </em>208 F.3d 435, 443 (3d Cir.2000) (ordering a defendant to prison is a paradigm judicial act); <em>Johnson v. Kegans, </em>870 F.2d 992, 997 (5th Cir.1989) (sentencing is a judicial act). The record does not demonstrate that these acts were performed in the complete absence of all jurisdiction. The judges are thus immune to Pittman\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Likewise, prosecutors acting within the scope of their duties in initiating and pursuing a criminal prosecution are immune to suit under \u00a7 1983. <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 410, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). The acts of which Pittman complains vis-a-vis the prosecutors\u2014namely, that they amended the criminal information and prosecuted the case against him\u2014fit squarely within the realm of official prosecutorial duties. <em>See id. </em>at 430, 96 S.Ct. 984 (activities intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process, casting the prosecutor as an advocate rather than an administrative or investigative officer, trigger absolute immunity). The prosecutor defendants therefore enjoy immunity from \u00a7 1983 liability for those acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Pittman\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against the defense attorneys are also unavailing. Public defenders do not act under color of law when performing the traditional functions of counsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding. Consequently, they cannot be sued for such actions under \u00a7 1983. <em>Polk Cnty. v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981). While they could nonetheless be liable under \u00a7 1983 if they conspired with a state actor to deprive Pittman of federal <em>rights\u2014see Tower v. Glover, </em>467 U.S. 914, 916, 104 S.Ct. 2820, 81 L.Ed.2d 758 (1984)\u2014Pittman has presented only con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>elusory allegations of conspiracy, which are insufficient from a pleading perspective. <em>See Great W. Mining &amp; Mineral Co. v. Fox Rothschild </em>LLP, 615 F.3d 159, 178-79 (3d Cir.2010) (conclusory allegations of an agreement do not meet the pleading standards; instead, specific facts addressing the time the agreement was made, the period of the conspiracy, the exact parties to the agreement, and the object of the conspiracy are required). Because Pittman failed to plead conspiracy with the necessary particularity, his claim cannot support liability for the defense attorney defendants under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Pittman\u2019s claims against the Le-high County Court of Common Pleas are equally ineffective, because the Eleventh Amendment shields it from liability to suits brought in federal court. <em>See Benn v. First Judicial Dist. of Pa., </em>426 F.3d 233, 235 n. 1, 241 (3d Cir.2005). Similarly, his claims against Lehigh County cannot stand. A municipality may be sued under \u00a7 1983 only when its execution of a government policy or custom injures the plaintiff. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Beyond the occasional and bare recitation of the words \u201ccustom and/or policy,\u201d the complaint failed to allege governmental action on anyone other than Pittman. Because this demonstrates neither custom nor policy on the part of Lehigh County, his \u00a7 1983 claim against it fails. <em>Cf. id. </em>(New York City Board of Education policy compelling all pregnant employees to take unpaid leaves of absence before they were medically required constitutes a custom or policy that could trigger liability under \u00a7 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In addition to his claims as to each defendant, Pittman seems to make a general claim of wrongful imprisonment. To the extent that Pittman seeks money damages for that claim, it is barred by the immunity each defendant enjoys. And to the extent that Pittman seeks equitable relief affecting his continued incarceration, he has no claim under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (\u201c[W]hen a state prisoner is challenging the very fact or duration of his physical imprisonment, and the relief he seeks is a determination that he is entitled to immediate release or a speedier release from that imprisonment, his <em>sole </em>federal remedy is a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Lastly, Pittman moved to amend his complaint to include various state-law claims for the same underlying acts. We interpret the District Court\u2019s silence on the state-law claims in its opinion to mean that it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over them. Given the fate of Pittman\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims discussed above, declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction was not error. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. 1367(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Pittman\u2019s complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
