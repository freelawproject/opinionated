Pursuant to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4A1.3, the district court departed upwardly from the 15 to 21-month advisory Guidelines sentencing range and imposed a 30-month sentence, after finding Ramirez\u2019 criminal-history category did not adequately address his past criminal conduct. Ramirez contends the court erred procedurally in departing upwardly.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-22\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). \u201c[W]e review upward departures for reasonableness\u201d, requiring this court to evaluate both the \u201cdecision to depart upwardly and the extent of that departure for [an] abuse of discretion\u201d. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cAn upward departure ... is not an abuse of discretion if the court\u2019s reasons for departing 1) advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and 2) are justified by the facts of the case\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-24\">Ramirez asserts departure is not warranted when application of the advisory Guidelines results in convictions not being factored in the determination of his criminal-history category. The district court did not rely exclusively on Ramirez\u2019 uncounted convictions or sentences; rather it also considered Ramirez\u2019 repeated illegal returns and his use of 14 aliases. None<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>theless, uncounted sentences are a proper basis for a \u00a7 4A1.3 upward departure. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Although Ramirez concedes he has several prior convictions, he contends his criminal-history category of IV does not substantially under-represent the seriousness of his past criminal conduct. He asserts the \u00a7 4A1.3 departure provision is meant for cases involving more serious criminal histories than his, and so, an upward departure cannot be imposed unless he is an \u201cexceptional case\u201d under Guideline \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(3). The inadequacy of a defendant\u2019s criminal-history category, however, \u201cis a factor <em>not </em>taken into account by the Guidelines and is a permissible justification for upward departure\u201d. <em>United States v. Laury, </em>985 F.2d 1293, 1310 (5th Cir.1993) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, an upward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3 may be justified by \u201ca long criminal history of nonviolent crimes\u201d. <em>United States v. Roach, </em>18 F.3d 935, 1994 WL 83366, at *2 (5th Cir.21 Feb.1994) (unpublished). As a result, Ramirez\u2019 claims regarding the seriousness of his criminal history and the \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(3) \u201cexceptional case\u201d requirement fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Regarding the extent of the departure, the 30-month sentence constituted a nine-month increase above the original high end of the 15 to 21-month advisory sentencing range, which is well within the range of departures our court has upheld. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 433, 442-43 (5th Cir.2006) (affirming departure from 46-57 month range to 120 months); <em>Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 346-48 (affirming departure from 27-33 month range to 60 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The district court\u2019s reasoning advances \u201cthe objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and ... [is] justified by the facts of the case\u201d; therefore, it did not abuse its discretion either in departing upwardly pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3 or in the extent of its departure. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347. (Accordingly, we need not consider Ramirez\u2019 claims concerning the alternative 36-month upward-variance sentence. <em>See United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 656-59 (5th Cir. 2008).)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b223-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
