He was sentenced to a total of 162 months in prison, five years of supervised release, and restitution in the amount of $6,342.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Muhammad argues that the trial evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for conspiracy to commit money laundering. He contends that the evidence did not establish that he committed the substantive offense of money laundering by any of the methods noted in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a), including, inter alia, with the intent to promote the carrying on of the armed bank robbery. He did not move for a judgment of acquittal in the district court and, therefore, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Delgado, </em>672 F.3d 320, 331-32 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">Muhammad\u2019s assertion that the evidence is insufficient to show that he committed an offense under \u00a7 1956(a) is inapposite. He was not convicted of violating \u00a7 1956(a); instead, he was convicted of conspiracy to commit money laundering under \u00a7 1956(h). \u201cIt is settled law that conspiring to commit an offense is wholly separate from the crime that is the object of the conspiracy\u201d; thus, \u201ca conspiracy charge need not include the elements of the substantive offense the defendant may have conspired to commit.\u201d <em>United States v. Threadgill, </em>172 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir. 1999). Therefore, the Government did not have to prove the substantive offense of money laundering under \u00a7 1956(a) to sustain Muhammad\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of \u00a7 1956(h). Muhammad has not otherwise identified deficiencies in the Government\u2019s case regarding his conviction under \u00a7 1956(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b343-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
