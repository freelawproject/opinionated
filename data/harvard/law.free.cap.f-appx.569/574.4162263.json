KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b597-21\">In this diversity case, Plaintiff-Appellant Shannon Wagner appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to American Family Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cAmerican Family\u201d) dismissing her breach of contract claim. <em>Wagner v. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co., </em>968 F.Supp.2d 1100 (D.Colo.2013). Ms. Wagner also appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of her statutory and common law bad faith claims. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-22\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b597-23\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. Ms. Wagner insured her Aurora, Colorado home through American Family under a homeowner\u2019s policy. Aplt.App. 334. In April 2011, suspecting a water leak in her home, Ms. Wagner had her property inspected. Aplt.App. 334. She was informed that a water pipe underneath the slab foundation near an exterior wall was the source of the leak. Aplt.App. 334. The parties agree that water from the leaking pipe eroded the soil underneath her home, causing settlement and cracking of the slab, which, in turn, caused drywall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>and flooring panels to crack. Aplt.App. 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">On May 31, 2011, Ms. Wagner filed a damage claim with American Family. Aplt.App. 334. On June 2, 2011, an American Family adjuster inspected Ms. Wagner\u2019s home and agreed there was damage. Aplt.App. 334. However, on June 15, 2011, American Family denied Ms. Wagner\u2019s claim, citing several policy provisions including losses not covered and the earth movement and water damage exclusions. Aplt.App. 85-86. As did the parties, we set out the pertinent portions of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">PERILS INSURED AGAINST\u2014 SECTION 1</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">COVERAGE A\u2014DWELLING AND DWELLING EXTENSION</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">We cover risks of accidental direct physical loss to property described in Coverage A\u2014Dwelling and Dwelling Extension, unless the loss is excluded in this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"AhK\">(HO-5 (CO) Ed. 6/94, at pg. 5, Aplt.App. 42).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">LOSSES NOT COVERED</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">We do not cover loss to the property described in Coverage A resulting directly or indirectly from, or consisting of, or caused by one or more of the following. Such loss is excluded regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">1. Losses excluded under EXCLUSIONS\u2014SECTION I.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">3. Continuous or Repeated Seepage or</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-14\">leakage of water or steam from within a plumbing, heating, air-conditioning or automatic fire protection sprinkler system or from within a household appliance which occurs over a period of weeks, months or years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-15\">6. Other causes of loss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-16\">a. wear and tear, marring, scratching, deterioration;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-17\">b. inherent vice, latent or inherent defect, mechanical breakdown;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-18\">c. smog, rust, corrosion, frost, condensation, wet or dry rot;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-19\">d. smoke from agricultural smudging or industrial operations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-20\">\n<em>e. settling, cracking, shrinking, bulging, or expansion of pavements, patios, foundations, walls, floors, roofs or ceilings;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-21\">f. birds, vermin, rodents, insects or domestic animals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-22\">If any of these cause water or steam to escape from a plumbing, heating, air-conditioning or automatic fire protection sprinkler system or household appliance, we cover loss caused by the water or steam. We also cover the cost of tearing out and replacing any part of a building necessary to repair the system or appliance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-23\">We do not cover loss to the system or appliance from which this water or steam escaped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-24\">For the purposes of this provision, a plumbing system or household appliance does not include a roof drain, sump, sump pump, gutter, downspout, drain tile or attached equipment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-25\">However, we do cover any resulting loss to property described in Coverage A from items 2 through 8 above, not excluded or excepted in this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-26\">EXCLUSIONS\u2014SECTION I</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>PARTA</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The following exclusions apply to Coverage A\u2014Dwelling and Dwelling Extension, Coverage B\u2014Personal Property, Coverage C\u2014Loss of Use and the Supplementary Coverages\u2014Section I. We do not insure for loss consisting of, or caused directly or indirectly by any of the following. Such loss is excluded regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">(Endorsement 584C (CO) Ed 11/09, at p. 2-3, ApltApp. 60-61) (bold in original, italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">1. <em>Earth Movement, meaning any loss caused by, resulting from, contributed to or aggravated by earthquake; landslide; subsidence; sinkhole; erosion; mudflow; earth sinking, rising, shifting, expanding or contracting; </em>volcanic eruption, meaning the eruption, explosion or effusion of a volcano.

This includes water which exerts pressure on or flows, seeps or leaks through any part of a building or other structure, sidewalk, driveway or swimming pool.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-16\">We do cover direct loss that follows, caused by Fire or Explosion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-17\">\n<em>However, we do cover any resulting loss to property described in Coverage A\u2014Dwelling and Dwelling Extension \u25a0not excluded or excepted in this policy.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b599-18\">(HO-5 (CO) Ed. 6/94, at pg. 7, Aplt.App. 44 (bold in original, italics added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-19\">Although the parties subsequently discussed Ms. Wagner\u2019s claim and American Family\u2019s reason for denying it, American Family continuously maintained that the damage was not a covered loss. Aplt.App. 334; <em>see also </em>Aplt.App. 84-95, 251-90. In a February 22, 2012 letter, American Family reiterated that the pipe beneath Ms. Wagner\u2019s home had been leaking for months, and its \u201cpolicy excludes damage caused by continuous or repeated leakage.\u201d Aplt.App. 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-20\">Ms. Wagner filed suit in district court seeking declaratory relief and claims for breach of the insurance contract, statutory bad faith under Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 10-3-1116, and common law bad faith. American Family moved for summary judgment, arguing that no breach occurred because it properly denied the claim and acted reasonably in doing so. Aplt.App. 29, 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-21\">Ms. Wagner contended that the \u201cany resulting loss\u201d exception at the end of EXCLUSIONS\u2014SECTION 1 restored coverage where it would otherwise be ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>eluded by other provisions. The district court disagreed, noting that Ms. Wagner conceded that at least two exclusions applied: earth movement and water damage. Aplt.App. 838; <em>see also </em>Aplt.App. 105-06. The district court rejected Ms. Wagner\u2019s argument that the \u201cany resulting loss\u201d exception at the end of EXCLUSIONS\u2014 SECTION 1 restored coverage that would otherwise be excluded. Aplt.App. 339\u201440. Rather, the district court read the policy\u2019s plain language as excluding coverage because (1) the earth movement and water damage exclusions do not cover any loss \u201ccaused directly or indirectly\u201d by these events, which applied to Ms. Wagner\u2019s claim; and (2) for the \u201cany resulting loss\u201d exception to restore coverage, the damage must result from a separate and independent covered peril. Aplt.App. 341. The court gave the example of gas-fed fires (covered peril) occurring after an earthquake (excluded peril). Aplt.App. 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The district court also rejected Ms. Wagner\u2019s reliance on <em>Kesling v. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co., </em>861 F.Supp.2d 1274 (D.Colo.2012), because the damage in <em>Kesling </em>involved both an excluded and a covered peril and invoked a different policy exclusion. Aplt.App. 342-43. Accordingly, the district court determined that American Family did not breach the contract by excluding coverage, and because breach was an essential element of all Ms. Wagner\u2019s claims, her remaining claims also failed. Aplt.App. 343-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Ms. Wagner argues that the district court erred because (1) any ambiguity as to covered losses should be construed in her favor; and (2) her statutory and common law bad faith claims remain, regardless of the district court\u2019s conclusion on breach. Aplt. Br. 9. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">We review an order granting summary judgment de novo. <em>Helm v. Kansas, </em>656 F.3d 1277, 1284 (10th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). Given a material issue, we view the evidence and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Ricci v. DeStefano, </em>557 U.S. 557, 586, 129 S.Ct. 2658, 174 L.Ed.2d 490 (2009). However, when the relevant facts are undisputed, we review the district court\u2019s interpretation of an insurance contract de novo. <em>Houston Gen. Ins. Co. v. Am. Fence Co., Inc., </em>115 F.3d 805, 806 (10th Cir.1997). Contract interpretation is a matter of state law; thus, when sitting in diversity, we look to the law of the forum state. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">A. <em>Breach of Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Under Colorado law, Ms. Wagner is correct that ambiguous insurance contracts are construed against the insurer and in favor of providing coverage. <em>See, e.g., Compass Ins. Co. v. City of Littleton, </em>984 P.2d 606, 613 (Colo.1999). However, in the absence of ambiguity, an insurance policy must be given effect according to the plain and ordinary meaning of its terms. <em>Nat\u2019l Cas. Co. v. Great Sw. Fire Ins. Co., </em>833 P.2d 741, 744 (Colo.1992). That is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">Ms. Wagner\u2019s primary argument is that an \u201cinherent conflict\u201d exists between the earth movement exclusion, which excludes coverage of her claim, and the \u201csettling exclusion\u201d found under LOSSES NOT COVERED, 6(e), which covers losses caused by water when settling causes \u201cwater or steam to escape from a plumbing ... system.\u201d Aplt. Br. 17. In support, she contends that (1) the exception to the settling exclusion provides a clear grant of coverage without referencing any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>policy exclusions or limitations, and that her interpretation of coverage under this provision was confirmed by an American Family sales agent; and (2) American Family presented no evidence to rebut that the damage to her house comes under the exception to the settling exclusion due to either wear-and-tear, deterioration, defect, or a mechanical breakdown of the leaking pipe. Aplt. Br. 18, 21-23. Alternatively, Ms. Wagner argues that (3) under the earth movement exclusion, any ambiguity as to whether the \u201cany resulting loss\u201d provision restores coverage should have been interpreted in her favor, based on (a) <em>Kesling, </em>861 F.Supp.2d at 1274, and (b) the clear grant of coverage under the exception to the settling exclusion. Aplt. Br. 19-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">American Family argues that this court should not address Ms. Wagner\u2019s arguments relating to the settling exclusion because they were not raised before the district court and therefore were not preserved. Aplee. Br. 14. Ms. Wagner argues that the preservation rule is more relaxed when the arguments are legal and a fundamental miscarriage of justice would occur. Aplt. Reply Br. 8. We decline to exercise our discretion in addressing Ms. Wagner\u2019s settling-exclusion arguments, particularly where the district court noted that Ms. Wagner did not argue that restoration of coverage occurred notwithstanding the earth movement exclusion. Aplt. App. 344. In sum, plain error did not occur, <em>see Somerlott v. Cherokee Nation Distributors, Inc., </em>686 F.3d 1144, 1148 (10th Cir.2012), and our declining to address these newly raised arguments will not result in a miscarriage of justice given the clarity of the policy. <em>See In re C.W. Mining Co., </em>625 F.3d 1240, 1246 (10th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">As to Ms. Wagner\u2019s third argument, no ambiguity exists in the earth movement exclusion that should be read in her favor. While Ms. Wagner is correct that the <em>Kesling </em>court interpreted \u201cany resulting loss\u201d against the insurer to mean any resulting damage to the home, <em>Kesling, </em>861 F.Supp.2d at 1284, we need not reach the \u201cany resulting damage\u201d provision. The damage here comes squarely under the earth movement exclusion. We also note that under <em>Kesling, </em>the ambiguity in \u201cany resulting loss\u201d would not end the inquiry. The next step is to determine whether the loss is subject to some other policy exclusion or exception. <em>Id. </em>Ms. Wagner presents no other policy exception that would restore coverage to her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">B. <em>Unreasonable Delay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">Ms. Wagner argues that regardless of whether her claim is covered by her policy, American Family remains liable for its unreasonable delay and denial of her claims in violation of Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 10-3-1115, 1116 and common law. Aplt. Br. 23. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">In Colorado, the statutory and common law bad faith claims relating to insurance are similar. By statute, \u201c[a] person engaged in the business of insurance shall not unreasonably delay or deny payment of a claim for benefits owed to or on behalf of any first-party claimant.\u201d Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 10-3-1115(l)(a). An insurer\u2019s delay or denial is unreasonable \u201cif the insurer delayed or denied authorizing payment of a covered benefit without a reasonable basis for that action.\u201d Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 10-3-1115(2). Similarly, to support a common law bad faith claim, a claimant must show that an \u201cinsurer\u2019s conduct is unreasonable and the insurer knows that the conduct is unreasonable or recklessly disregards the fact that the conduct is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Savio, </em>706 P.2d 1258, 1275 (Colo.1985). The legal standard between the two is slightly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>different: In the statutory claim, the only element at issue is whether the insurer denied benefits without a reasonable basis; whereas, a common law claim must show both unreasonableness and that the insurer knew that its conduct was unreasonable or recklessly disregarded that fact. <em>Vaccaro v. Am. Family Ins. Grp., </em>275 P.3d 750, 760 (Colo.App.2012) (as modified on denial of reh\u2019g (Mar. 15, 2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Although Ms. Wagner is correct that in Colorado \u201cthe tort of bad faith depends on the conduct of the insurer regardless of the ultimate resolution of the underlying compensation claim,\u201d <em>Brodeur v. Am. Home Assurance Co., </em>169 P.3d 139, 147 (Colo.2007), Ms. Wagner\u2019s bad faith claims nonetheless fail based on the element of reasonableness. In essence, Ms. Wagner argues that American Family failed to investigate her claim in good faith, failed to explain the basis for its denial, and improperly denied coverage of her claim. Aplt. Reply Br. 20-21. We have already determined that Ms. Wagner\u2019s claim was properly denied based upon exclusions in the policy which were fairly applied. An American Family adjuster inspected Ms. Wagner\u2019s home on June 2, 2011, just days after she made her May 31, 2011 claim, and then issued a denial letter on June 15, 2011, citing several policy exclusions\u2014even if Ms. Wagner disagreed with those exclusions during subsequent discussions. We find nothing unreasonable about American Family\u2019s denial of her claim because it had a reasonable basis for its action. <em>See Vaccaro, </em>275 P.3d at 759 (reasonableness may be decided as a matter of law when there are no genuine issues of material fact); <em>see also Zolman v. Pinnacol Assurance, </em>261 P.3d 490, 497 (Colo.App.2011) (\u201c[A]n insurer will be found to have acted in bad faith only if it has intentionally denied, failed to process, or failed to pay a claim without a reasonable basis.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Although the district court summarily stated that breach was an element of all of Ms. Wagner\u2019s claims, we may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Thigpen v. Roberts, </em>468 U.S. 27, 29-30, 104 S.Ct. 2916, 82 L.Ed.2d 23 (1984). Ms. Wagner failed to meet a required element of both her bad faith claims because American Family acted reasonably in denying coverage under her homeowner\u2019s policy. <em>See MarkWest Hydrocarbon, Inc. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>558 F.3d 1184, 1192-93 (10th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b597-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
