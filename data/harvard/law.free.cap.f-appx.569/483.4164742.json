The district court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. \u201cOur review of the district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(6) is <em>de novo.\u201d Pride v. Correa, </em>719 F.3d 1130, 1133 (9th Cir.2013). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Westwind failed to exhaust the FDIC\u2019s mandatory administrative claims process. <em>Intercontinental Travel Mktg., Inc. v. FDIC, </em>45 F.3d 1278, 1282 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cNo court has jurisdiction over [a] claim until the exhaustion of this administrative process.\u201d). The FDIC published notice that any claim against Silver State Bank must be submitted in writing by the claims bar date of December 10, 2008. Westwind received notice of the receivership before the claims bar date. And although West-wind filed suit in state court against Silver State Bank on October 23, 2008, it did not submit a claim to the FDIC until July 11, 2011, more than two and a half years after the claims bar date. Therefore, we lack subject matter jurisdiction over West-wind\u2019s claims. <em>Id. </em>at 1284 (\u201cWe read the claims bar date to be a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">Westwind\u2019s failure to exhaust cannot be excused by the FDIC\u2019s failure to mail notice, the FDIC\u2019s decision to publish in newspapers rather than on its website or in a press release, or Westwind\u2019s contention that the FDIC knew or should have known about its claim based on the state court action. <em>Id. </em>at 1284-86; <em>see also </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(3). Finally, Westwind has not alleged affirmative misconduct or intentional disregard of the mail notice requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b506-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
