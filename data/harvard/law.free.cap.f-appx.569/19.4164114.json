The district court sentenced Henry principally to 72 months\u2019 imprisonment. Henry appeals his sentence, asserting that the district court erred in denying his request for a downward departure from the applicable range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">\u201c[A] refusal to downwardly depart is generally not appealable.\u201d <em>United States v. Cuevas, </em>496 F.3d 256, 268 (2d Cir.2007). \u201cClaims that the district court erred in refusing to depart are not cognizable on appeal in the absence of substantial indication that the district judge believed she lacked authority to depart or an indication that a violation of law occurred.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>658 F.3d 145, 153-54 (2d Cir.2011); <em>see United States v. Scott, </em>387 F.3d 139, 143 (2d Cir.2004) (holding that a district court\u2019s decision is appealable \u201cwhere the defendant shows that a violation of law occurred, that the Guidelines were misapplied, or that the refusal to depart was based on the sentencing court\u2019s mistaken conclusion that it lacked the authority to depart\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">Henry\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the district court erred in denying his request for a horizontal departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b) from Criminal History II to Criminal History I, because Criminal History II substantially overrepresents the seriousness of his past criminal conduct. This is precisely the type of appeal over which we lack jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Desena, </em>260 F.3d 150, 159 (2d Cir.2001) (holding that district court\u2019s denial of motion to downwardly depart under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 is not appealable where there was \u201cno indication that [the district court] mistakenly believed [that it] lacked the authority to depart as a matter of law.\u201d); <em>United States v. Ogman, </em>535 F.3d 108, 111(2d Cir.2008) (per curiam). Henry\u2019s attempt to reframe his appeal to argue that the district court\u2019s denial was a misapplication of the Guidelines, because the district court should have \u201cconsidered] a downward departure from the guidelines\u201d under <em>United States v. Mishoe, </em>241 F.3d 214, 218 (2d Cir.2001), is unavailing. <em>Mishoe </em>concerned the government\u2019s appeal from a decision <em>granting </em>a downward departure and did not purport to identify factors that should generally be considered in cases involving the claim that a particular criminal history category overstates the seriousness of a defendant\u2019s criminal past. <em>See id. </em>The record demonstrates, moreover, that the district court understood its authority to downwardly depart and declined to exercise this authority after considering the circumstances of Henry\u2019s case and criminal history. Because Henry\u2019s appeal thus amounts to a dispute with the district court\u2019s decision not to downwardly depart from the applicable Guidelines range, we lack jurisdiction to review his appeal. <em>See Jackson, </em>658 F.3d at 153-54. Accordingly, we dismiss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>We have reviewed Henry\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, Henry\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
