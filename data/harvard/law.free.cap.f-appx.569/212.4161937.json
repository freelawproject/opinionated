Brown appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action and the denial of his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion challenging the dismissal. The vast majority of the issues raised by Brown concern the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 action rather than the denial of his Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">The timing of Brown\u2019s notice of appeal raises a threshold question regarding this court\u2019s jurisdiction, which we must examine on our own motion, if necessary. <em>See Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). In a civil case, the timely filing of a notice of appeal \u201cis a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-17\">Brown\u2019s notice of appeal was timely in relation to the denial of his Rule 59(e) motion, but it was not directly timely in relation to the judgment of dismissal. Thus, the notice of appeal was timely as to the underlying dismissal of the complaint only if Brown\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion was timely filed. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-18\">The judgment of dismissal was entered on March 14, 2013. Brown\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion, which was dated April 9, 2013, was received and filed in the district court on April 12, 2013, 29 days after the dismissal of the complaint and one day after the expiration of the time to file a Rule 59(e) motion. Thus, if the prisoner mailbox rule applies to Brown, the Rule 59(e) motion was presumptively timely, but if the prisoner mailbox rule does not apply, the Rule 59(e) motion was untimely. <em>See United States v. Young, </em>966 F.2d 164, 165 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-19\">The prison mailbox rule applies to prisoners who are proceeding pro se. <em>See Stoot v. Cain, </em>570 F.3d 669, 671 (5th Cir. 2009). When a litigant is not incarcerated, however, the prison mailbox rule does not apply. <em>United States v. Clark, </em>193 F.3d 845, 846 n. 3 (5th Cir.1999). A pro se litigant is given the benefit of the prisoner mailbox rule if by tendering a pleading for mailing he \u201chas completed everything within his control to deliver the actual petition to the court.\u201d <em>Spotville v. Cain, </em>149 F.3d 374, 376 (5th Cir.1998); <em>see also Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 270-72, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-20\">At the time Brown filed his Rule 59(e) motion, he was not incarcerated pursuant to a criminal conviction, but he was civilly</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>committed under the Texas sexually violent predator civil commitment law, Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 841.001-.150. According to the Texas Supreme Court, the Texas sexually violent predator civil commitment law \u201cpermits the [sexually violent predator] to live at large in the community.\u201d <em>In re Commitment of Fisher, 1</em>64 S.W.3d 637, 652 (Tex.2005). However, in his Rule 59(e) motion, Brown alleged that he was, at that time, \u201cforced to live in a \u2018secure correctional\u2019 facility ... 24 hours per day.\u201d Brown made no allegations regarding his access to mail and other methods of filing pleadings in the district court.' Furthermore, the district court received no other evidence and made no factual findings on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">On the present record, we cannot determine whether the prison mailbox rule applies, making Brown\u2019s notice of appeal timely and giving us jurisdiction over this appeal. Accordingly, we hold the appeal and Brown\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel on appeal in abeyance and remand for the limited purpose of making factual findings regarding the extent of Brown\u2019s confinement and Brown\u2019s ability to file pleadings at the time he filed his Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">APPEAL AND MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL ON APPEAL HELD IN ABEYANCE; LIMITED REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b235-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
