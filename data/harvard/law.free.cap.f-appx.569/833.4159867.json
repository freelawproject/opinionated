An administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) initially denied Monroe\u2019s application for Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d), finding that she did not have a requisite impairment under the Listings of Impairments in 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1. Monroe then filed a complaint to the district court. In response, the Commissioner of Social Security (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d) argued that Monroe did not qualify as mentally retarded under Listing 12.05(C). After the district court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s denial of Monroe\u2019s SSI application, we reversed, holding that Monroe had met the standard for mental retardation under Listing 12.05(C), and, as such, her application should have been granted. <em>See Monroe v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. See., </em>504 Fed.Appx. 808 (11th Cir.2013) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Monroe then filed the instant motion for attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA, which the district court denied. In support, the district court found that, notwithstanding our reversal, the Commissioner\u2019s position that Monroe did not meet the requirements of Listing 12.05(C) was substantially justified. Accordingly, the court concluded that Monroe was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA. On appeal, Monroe argues that the court should have granted her motion because the Commissioner\u2019s position was not substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to award attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA, as well as the determination as to whether the government\u2019s position was substantially justified, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 559, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 2547, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988). This standard requires great deference to the district court\u2019s findings of fact but allows for close scrutiny of its rulings on questions of law. <em>Reese v. Sullivan, </em>925 F.2d 1395, 1396 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">Following entry of a favorable judgment in a Social Security case, a prevailing party may obtain attorney\u2019s fees in two different ways. First, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b), the district court may award a \u201creasonable fee ..., not in excess of 25 percent of the total of the past-due benefits to which the claimant is entitled.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1)(A). This fee is paid directly to the party\u2019s attorney, not to the party herself. <em>Reeves v. Astrue, </em>526 F.3d 732, 736 (11th Cir. 2008). Under the EAJA, by contrast, a prevailing party shall recover attorney\u2019s fees and costs if, <em>inter alia, </em>the position of the United States was not \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A); <em>see Comm\u2019r, I.N.S. v. Jean, </em>496 U.S. 154, 155, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 2317, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (1990). We have held that an award under the EAJA is separate from an award under \u00a7 406(b). <em>Jackson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>601 F.3d 1268, 1271 (11th Cir.2010).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">To be \u201csubstantially justified\u201d under the EAJA, the government\u2019s position must be \u201cjustified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Jean, </em>496 U.S. at 158 n. 6, 110 S.Ct. at 2319 n. 6 (quotations omitted). Thus, the government\u2019s position must have a \u201creasonable basis both in law and fact.\u201d <em>Reese, </em>925 F.2d at 1396 (quotations and emphasis omitted). \u201cThe government bears the burden of showing that its position was substantially justified.\u201d <em>Stratton v. Bowen, </em>827 F.2d 1447, 1450 (11th Cir.1987). The outcome of the underlying litigation is not dispositive as to whether the government\u2019s position was substantially justified. <em>Pierce, </em>487 U.S. at 569, 108 S.Ct. at 2552. Furthermore, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>position can be justified even if it is not correct. <em>Id. </em>at 566 n. 2, 108 S.Ct. at 2550 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">With regard to our review of an ALJ\u2019s denial of a claimant\u2019s SSI application, we review an ALJ\u2019s decision to determine whether it was supported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards were applied. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). \u201cEven if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner\u2019s findings, we must affirm if the decision reached is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1158-59 (quotations omitted). We have affirmed denials of motions for attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA where the Commissioner\u2019s litigation position was an application of a correct legal standard. <em>See, e.g., Jefferson v. Bowen, 837 </em>F.2d 461, 462-63 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The Social Security Regulations outline a five-step sequential process used to determine whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). Specifically under Step 3, the claimant must show that her alleged impairment meets or equals the criteria contained in one of the Listings of Impairments. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Listing 12.05 deals with mental retardation. 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 \u00a7 12.05. Listing 12.05(C) requires a \u201cvalid verbal, performance, or full scale IQ of 60 through 70 and a physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional and significant work-related limitation of function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12.05(C). \u201cGenerally, a claimant meets the criteria for presumptive disability under section 12.05(C) when the claimant presents a valid I.Q. score of 60 to 70 inclusive, and evidence of an additional mental or physical impairment that has more than \u2018minimal effect\u2019 on the claimant\u2019s ability to perform basic work activities.\u201d <em>Lowery v. Sullivan, </em>979 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1992). An ALJ may find the results of an IQ test to be incredible such that Listing 12.05(C) is not satisfied. <em>See Popp v. Heckler, </em>779 F.2d 1497, 1499-1500 (11th Cir.1986) (rejecting a claim of Listing 12.05(C) mental retardation where the claimant\u2019s IQ score of 69 was inconsistent with other evidence and there was good reason to believe that the claimant exaggerated his problems). Further, an ALJ \u201cmay reject any medical opinion if the evidence supports a contrary finding.\u201d <em>Sharfarz v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 278, 280 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Commissioner\u2019s position that Monroe did not meet the requirements of Listing 12.05(C) was substantially justified. First, the court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Commissioner\u2019s position had a reasonable basis in fact. The record shows that a physician diagnosed Monroe as having an IQ score of 51, which was sufficient to establish that she was presumptively disabled. <em>See Lowery, </em>979 F.2d at 837. Nevertheless, the Commissioner\u2019s position that Monroe\u2019s IQ results were not valid and, thus, did not establish that she met the requirements of Listing 12.05(C), was based upon evidence in the record. Specifically, Monroe\u2019s physician noted that the test results were a \u201clow estimate\u201d of her actual IQ, and that her depression and the side effects of her medication had compromised her IQ score by between 10 and 15 points. Additionally, none of the other mental-health reports included in the record indicated that Monroe suffered from mental retardation. Moreover, two consulting physicians had independently concluded that Monroe\u2019s IQ score was not consistent with her adaptive skills, and that a diagnosis of mental retardation was not warranted or supported. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Commissioner\u2019s position had a reasonable basis in fact. <em>See Reese, </em>925 F.2d at 1396.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Commissioner\u2019s position also had a reasonable basis in law. Under our precedent, the ALJ was not required to accept Monroe\u2019s IQ score, and was permitted to reject it on the basis of the contrary evidence in the record. <em>See Sharfarz, </em>825 F.2d at 280. Additionally, the ALJ had the discretion to find that the results of the IQ test were incredible, such that Listing 12.05(C) was not satisfied. <em>See Popp, </em>779 F.2d at 1499-1500. Given this precedent, the Commissioner had a reasonable basis in law for defending the ALJ\u2019s finding that Monroe\u2019s IQ results did not satisfy Listing 12.05(C). Accordingly, the Commissioner\u2019s position was substantially justified, and the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Monroe\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-8\">.
