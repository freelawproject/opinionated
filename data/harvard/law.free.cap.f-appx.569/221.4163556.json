He contends that that the evidence at trial was insufficient to sustain his convictions. Because Diallo moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the Government\u2019s case and renewed the motion at the close of all of the evidence, he has properly preserved his sufficiency claim for appellate review. <em>See United States v. Mendoza, </em>226 F.3d 340, 343 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Section 1253(a)(1)(C) provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]ny alien against whom a final order of removal is outstanding by reason of being a member of any of the classes described in [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) ], who ... connives or conspires, or takes any other action, designed to prevent or hamper or with the purpose of preventing or hampering the alien\u2019s departure pursuant to such ... shall be fined ... or imprisoned not more than four years.\u201d \u00a7 1253(a)(1)(C). Diallo does not dispute that he was subject to a final order of removal to the Central African Republic, that he was a deportable alien as defined by \u00a7 1227(a), or that he refused to be removed to the Central African Republic. Instead, he contends that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he <em>knowingly </em>prevented or hampered his removal because, based on the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) actions, he reasonably believed that he would be removed to Mali instead of the Central African Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that Diallo knowingly connived or took other actions designed to prevent or hamper or with the purpose of preventing or hampering his removal. Diallo does not dispute that he was subject to a valid and final order of removal to the Central African Republic or that the Central African Republic had issued two sets of travel documents allowing for his removal to that country. Unlike the immigration officials\u2019 representations in <em>Heikkinen v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 273, 279-80, 78 S.Ct. 299, 2 L.Ed.2d 264 (1958), the fact that ICE had memorialized Diallo\u2019s claim that he was a citizen of Mali and had requested travel documents from the Malian Embassy did not reasonably suggest that ICE had abandoned its efforts to remove him to the Central African Republic or justify his failure to cooperate with the valid removal order. As the deportation officer explained, a person can request travel documents from any country he chooses and some countries issue travel documents to non-natives if the person has other ties to that country. Diallo maintained that he was a native and citizen of the Central African Republic throughout his immigration proceedings, and it was not until June 23, 2011, six years after the issuance of the Notice to Appear and nearly two years after the removal order became final, that he claimed to be a native and citizen of Mali. Further, more than one year after ICE\u2019s request, the Malian government had not issued any travel documents. The jury was free to reject Diallo\u2019s proffered defense and instead infer that his claim of Malian citizenship was nothing more than another attempt to delay or prevent his removal to the Central African Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Diallo was repeatedly warned that his failure to cooperate with his removal to the Central African Republic could result in criminal prosecution. Despite these warnings, Diallo continued to prevent and hamper his removal by becoming disruptive and physically resisting the immigration enforcement agents when they attempted to escort him onto commercial flights bound for the Central African Republic on November 14, 2011, and March 13, 2012. As a result of Diallo\u2019s actions, ICE was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>forced to abandon their efforts to remove him from the United States. In light of the foregoing, the evidence at trial was sufficient to sustain Diallo\u2019s convictions, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
