MATHESON, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b634-21\">Cornell Joe Parker, proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and having unsuccessfully moved in federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>district court for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) for this court to review four issues. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). We deny COA as to all four issues and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AOl\">A. <em>State Trial Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Alleging that in August 2007, Mr. Parker and two other individuals robbed, beat, and shot a man they met at a bar, the State of Oklahoma charged him with Shooting with Intent to Kill, Robbery with a Firearm, Kidnapping, Larceny of an Automobile, Arson, and Felon in Possession of a Firearm. On the morning of trial, Mr. Parker moved to change his plea. Defense counsel advised Mr. Parker about the range of years he would face for the six counts, but he misstated the statutory m\u00ednimums for three of the counts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the change of plea hearing, the trial judge, after reading out loud the plea form prepared by defense counsel containing the misstatements, corrected the range on Larceny of an Automobile upon prompting from the prosecutor. Mr. Parker pled no</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">contest to Shooting with Intent to Kill, and guilty to the other five counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Mr. Parker later moved to withdraw his pleas, arguing they had not been knowing and voluntary. After hearing testimony from Mr. Parker and his defense attorney, the court denied the motion, finding defense counsel\u2019s misstatements were either cured or harmless because they were \u201cnot outcome determinative.\u201d Change of Plea Hr\u2019g Tr., ROA, Vol. II at 147-48. It said \u201cthe defendant knowingly entered into the plea, and that his final decision to accept a\u2014the blind plea sentence of the Court was not in any material way based upon the errors in the Court\u2019s recitation or in the [plea] form.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">B. <em>OCCA Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">Mr. Parker filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) on four issues: \u201c(1) whether he received effective assistance of counsel; (2) whether his plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered; (3) whether his sentence is excessive; and (4) whether cumulative error deprived him of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>a fair proceeding.\u201d OCCA Op. Denying Certiorari, ROA, Vol. I at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">First, Mr. Parker argued his lawyer violated <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) by (a) failing to prepare a defense and instead advising Mr. Parker to plead guilty even though Mr. Parker wished to go to trial and insisted he had an alibi, and (b) failing to advise him properly about the effect of pleading guilty, in particular misstating the three statutory minimum ranges. The OCCA rejected the trial preparation argument because \u201cdefense counsel researched [Mr.] Parker\u2019s alibi, subpoenaed witnesses, and attempted to get a continuance to further research [Mr.] Parker\u2019s potential alibi.\u201d OCCA Op. Denying Certiorari, ROA, Vol. I at 109. The OCCA rejected the failure-to-advise argument because Mr. Parker \u201cmet with his attorney multiple times about the case and spent sufficient time reviewing the plea form.\u201d ROA, Vol. I at 109.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Second, the OCCA acknowledged the state trial court erred by overstating the minimum sentences for two counts, but concluded Mr. Parker\u2019s pleas were not involuntary or unknowing because any misunderstanding did not affect the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Third, Mr. Parker claimed his sentence was excessive because he received a harsher sentence than some of his more-culpable co-defendants. Mr. Parker quoted Oklahoma statutory and case law stating that when a guilty plea \u201cshocks the conscience of the court or an injustice has been done\u201d the OCCA \u201chas the power to modify that sentence.\u201d OCCA Br., ROA, Vol. I at 99-100 (citing Okla. Stat. tit. 22, \u00a7 1066 and <em>Livingston v. State, </em>795 P.2d 1055, 1058 (Okla.Crim.App.1990) (addressing state law only)). The OCCA concluded Mr. Parker\u2019s sentence was within the statutory range and \u201cdoes not shock the conscience of [the] Court.\u201d OCCA Op., ROA, Vol. I at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Fourth, the OCCA rejected Mr. Parker\u2019s cumulative error claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">The OCCA affirmed the trial court in a summary opinion on the merits and denied his petition. Mr. Parker neither petitioned the United States Supreme Court for certiorari nor sought post-conviction relief in the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">C. <em>Federal District Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">On November 24, 2010, Mr. Parker timely applied for habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, raising the same four issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">First, applying the deferential standards required by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAED-PA\u201d), the district court determined that Mr. Parker had failed to show an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland. </em>On the trial preparation argument, it noted defense counsel had prepared by interviewing witnesses and investigating the alleged alibi. Nothing suggested defense counsel\u2019s recommendation to plead guilty was unreasonable \u201cbased on [defense counsel\u2019s] investigation and known facts.\u201d <em>Parker v. Evans, </em>2013 WL 6800138, at *5 (N.D.Okla. Dec.20, 2013). On the failure-to-advise argument, the district court noted that defense counsel met with Mr. Parker for 20-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>25 minutes to go over the pleas and that Mr. Parker indicated he had understood the pleas. The district court further noted Mr. Parker had not demonstrated that counsel\u2019s misstating the statutory minimums would have affected his decision to not go to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Second, the district court concluded the OCCA\u2019s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent on the voluntariness of a guilty plea. It said the state trial court\u2019s factual finding that the misstatements of the statutory m\u00ednimums did not affect Mr. Parker\u2019s decision to plead guilty was based on \u201ca careful review of the errors alleged by Petitioner\u201d and that the trial court \u201cdetermined them to be either cured or harmless.\u201d <em>Parker, </em>2013 WL 6800138, at *7. It noted that under AEDPA, federal courts presume that state court factual findings are correct unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, which Mr. Parker failed to do. <em>Id. </em>at *8; <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Third, the district court observed that \u201c[a] habeas court affords \u2018wide discretion to the state trial court\u2019s sentencing decision, and challenges to the decision are not generally constitutionally cognizable, unless it is shown [that] the sentence imposed is outside the statutory limits or unauthorized by law,\u2019 \u201d <em>Parker, </em>2013 WL 6800138, at *9 (quoting <em>Dennis v. Poppel, </em>222 F.3d 1245, 1258 (10th Cir.2000)). The district court concluded \u201c[t]here is no basis for habeas relief\u2019 because all of Mr. Parker\u2019s challenged sentences were within statutory limits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Fourth, the district court concluded the OCCA did not unreasonably apply the cumulative error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The district court therefore denied habeas relief and declined to issue a COA. Mr. Parker timely filed a notice of appeal and request for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">A. <em>COA Standard and AEDPA Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">Mr. Parker may not appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2254 application without a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 335-36, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). To obtain a COA, he must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), by demonstrating \u201cthat jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude that the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further,\u201d <em>Dulworth v. Jones, </em>496 F.3d 1133, 1137 (10th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">The AEDPA standard governs federal habeas review of state court decisions. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. If state court proceedings adjudicated the merits of a claim, a federal court may grant habeas relief only if the state court decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(2); <em>see also Richter, </em>131 S.Ct. at 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">In deciding whether to grant a COA, we are required to \u201clook to the District Court\u2019s application of AEDPA to petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims and ask whether that resolution was debatable among jurists of reason.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">Mr. Parker seeks a COA on the same four issues he raised in the OCCA and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the district court: (1) ineffective assistance of counsel; (2) unknowing and involuntary-pleas; (3) excessive sentence; and (4) cumulative error. <em>See </em>Aplt. Br. at 3-4. Because the OCCA rejected these claims on the merits, the district court correctly reviewed them under AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">1. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">a. <em>Strickland</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Mr. Parker claims he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Under <em>Strickland, </em>a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel is violated when (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the defendant suffered prejudice as a result. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. As to (1), a defendant must show counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The defendant must overcome a \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct [fell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance ... [and] might be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (quotations omitted). As to (2), a defendant must show \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. A \u201creasonable probability\u201d is one \u201csufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe likelihood of a different result must be substantial, not just conceivable.\u201d <em>Richter, </em>131 S.Ct. at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Under AEDPA, a \u201cstate court must be granted a deference and latitude that are not in operation when the case involves review under the <em>Strickland </em>standard itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 785. When evaluating the state court\u2019s resolution of <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>performance requirement, federal courts must \u201cuse a \u2018doubly deferential\u2019 standard of review that gives both the state court and the defense attorney the benefit of the doubt.\u201d <em>Burt v. Titlow, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 10, 13, 187 L.Ed.2d 348 (2013) (quoting <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1403, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">b. <em>Mr. Parker\u2019s claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-14\">Mr. Parker posits two ineffective assistance of counsel claims. First, he alleges his counsel was not prepared for trial and instead recommended a guilty plea. As the OCCA and the district court concluded, the record shows he was prepared, and reasonable jurists would not debate otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-15\">Second, he alleges his counsel\u2019s misstatement of sentencing ranges for three of his six charges caused him to plead guilty rather than go to trial. To show prejudice, Mr. Parker must demonstrate he would not have pled guilty but for counsel\u2019s errors. <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). A mere assertion is not enough. <em>Miller v. Champion, </em>262 F.3d 1066, 1072 (10th Cir.2001). Instead, \u201cwe look to the factual circumstances surrounding the plea to determine whether the petitioner would have proceeded to trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-16\">Of the three misstated ranges, the trial court corrected one. Defense counsel overstated the other two- and four-year-minimums by two years each. These misstatements must be considered in the context of the three correctly stated 20-to-life sentence ranges. <em>See supra </em>note 2. Moreover, after holding a hearing on this issue, the state trial court found Mr. Parker would have pled guilty notwithstanding the two misstatements. Federal courts must accept this finding unless Mr. Parker contradicts it with clear and convincing evidence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1), which he has not. Reasonable jurists would not debate the district court\u2019s denial of this claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>We therefore deny COA on ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">2. Unknowing and Involuntary Pleas</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Mr. Parker claims his guilty- plea was not knowing and voluntary because counsel misstated the sentence range for three charges. The district court corrected one of the misstatements, and our case law holds this claim can succeed as to counsel\u2019s misstatements only when counsel is held to have been constitutionally ineffective. <em>Bush v. Neet, </em>400 F.3d 849, 853 (10th Cir.2005). Our disposition of the ineffective assistance claim therefore resolves this claim. We deny COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">3. Excessive Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Mr. Parker claims his sentence was excessive under Oklahoma law but fails to identify any federal constitutional violation, which is the core predicate for habeas relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). He has not even shown that his sentence falls outside the state statutory limits. <em>See Dennis, </em>222 F.3d at 1258 (stating challenges to state sentencing decisions \u201care not generally constitutionally cognizable, unless it is shown the sentence imposed is outside the statutory limits or unauthorized by law\u201d). The district court was indisputably correct in denying habeas relief on this claim, and we again deny- COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">4. Cumulative Error</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Based on the foregoing, Mr. Parker\u2019s request for COA on the issue of cumulative error has no basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">-III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude Mr. Parker has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. We deny COA as to all issues and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b634-11\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-22\">. Because Mr. Parker is proceeding pro se, we construe his pleadings liberally. <em>See Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam); <em>see also United States v. Pinson, </em>584 F.3d 972, 975 (10th Cir.2009) (\"[W]e must construe [a pro se litigant\u2019s] arguments liberally; this rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>of liberal construction stops, however, at the point at which we begin to serve as his advocate.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b635-12\">. This table summarizes the misstated and correct ranges, and the actual sentence imposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-13\">Count Misstated Range Correct Range Sentence Imposed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-14\">Shooting with Intent to Kill N/A 20 years to life 25 years</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-15\">Robbery with a Firearm N/A 20 years to life 25 years</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-16\">Kidnapping N/A 20 years to life 10 years \u2020</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-17\">Larceny of an Automobile 6 years to life 9 years to life 5 years \u2020</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-18\">Arson 6 years to life 4 years to life 10 years</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-19\">Felon in Possession of a Firearm 4 years to life 2 years to life 5 years</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-20\">t The record does not reflect why the district court imposed two sentences below their respective statutory m\u00ednimums.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-21\">Because some sentences run concurrently while others run consecutively, Mr. Parker's sentences total 40 years of imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\">. Although the OCCA determined Mr. Parker's counsel was not deficient, the OCCA\u2019s opinion does not discuss defense counsel\u2019s misstatements of the statutory minimums. Under AEDPA, we must presume the OCCA decided that issue on the merits. <em>Johnson v. </em>Williams,- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1088, 1097, 185 L.Ed.2d 105 (2013) <em>reh\u2019g </em>denied, - U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1858, 185 L.Ed.2d 858 (2013); <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 131 S.Ct. 770, 785, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). Mr. Parker does not attempt to rebut this presumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
