Wieder filed suit against defendants-appellees Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. and Home Depot\u2019s former employee John Marrugo (collectively, \u201cHome Depot defendants\u201d), defendants-appellees Jose and Rosario Berg (the \u201cBerg defendants\u201d), and the City of New York and NYPD Officers Ramos, Ro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>sario, and Alborano, as well as several unnamed \u201cJohn Doe\u201d defendant-officers (collectively \u201cCity Defendants\u201d), alleging false arrest, malicious prosecution, and failure to intervene under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, as well as several state law claims, all arising from a \u201cspontaneous physical altercation\u201d between Wieder and the Bergs at a Home Depot located in Flushing, Queens on August 12, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">On April 29, 2013, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Kuntz, <em>J.) </em>granted defendants\u2019 respective motions for summary judgment, dismissing all of Wieder\u2019s federal claims and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims. Judgment was entered on April 30, 2013. Plaintiff subsequently moved for relief under Rule 60, which the district court denied in an oral order entered on September 26, 2013. Plaintiff now appeals from the court\u2019s judgment and order dismissing his case, and from the court\u2019s denial of his motion for relief from judgment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u2018We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo,\u201d to determine \u201cwhether genuine disputes over material fact exist ... which should properly be submitted to a jury or whether, where no issues of material fact are found, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Byrnie v. Town of Cromwell, Bd. of Educ., </em>243 F.3d 93, 101 (2d Cir.2001). We review denials of Rule 60 motions for abuse of discretion. <em>See United Airlines, Inc. v. Brien, </em>588 F.3d 158, 175 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Upon our independent review of the record, we affirm the rulings and judgment of the district court for substantially the same reasons, set forth in its thorough and well-reasoned decision on defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. There was no error in the district court\u2019s determination that the Home Depot defendants were not acting under color of state law, and that, accordingly, summary judgment was properly granted on the \u00a7 1983 claims against them. No factfinder could find Marrugo\u2019s actions so entwined with those of the City Defendants \u201cthat [Marrugo\u2019s] seemingly private behavior may be fairly treated as that of the State itself.\u201d <em>Tancredi v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>316 F.3d 308, 312 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">As to claims against the City Defendants, Officer Ramos had sufficient probable cause to justify Wieder\u2019s arrest, which is fatal to his false arrest claim. <em>See Jenkins v. City of New York, </em>478 F.3d 76, 84 (2d Cir.2007). Though there were conflicting accounts of the physical altercation, \u201cwe have found probable cause where a police officer was presented with different stories from an alleged victim and the arrestee.\u201d <em>Curley v. Vill. of Suffern, </em>268 F.3d 65, 70 (2d Cir.2001). \u201cOnce a police officer has a reasonable basis for believing there is probable cause, he is not required to explore and eliminate every theoretically plausible claim of innocence before making an arrest.\u201d <em>Ricciuti v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., </em>124 F.3d 123, 128 (2d Cir.1997). \u201c[I]t is well-established that a law enforcement official has probable cause to arrest if he received his information from some person, normally the putative victim or <em>eyewitness.\u201d Panetta v. Crowley, </em>460 F.3d 388, 395 (2d Cir.2006) (emphasis added) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>(internal quotation marks omitted). We find that this standard was satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">We also affirm the court\u2019s dismissal of the malicious prosecution claim. While probable cause could \u201cdissipate\u201d if the \u201cgroundless nature of the charge [were] made apparent by the discovery of some intervening fact,\u201d <em>Kinzer v. Jackson, </em>316 F.3d 139, 144 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted), there is no evidence in the record to support an inference that the defendant-officers had any \u201cintervening facts\u201d at their disposal between the time of the arrest and the time plaintiff was formally charged a few hours later. Because the underlying constitutional claims were properly dismissed, we also affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs failure to intervene claim. <em>See O\u2019Neill v. Krzeminski, </em>839 F.2d 9, 11 (2d Cir.1988) (\u201cA law enforcement officer has an affirmative duty to intercede on the behalf of a citizen whose constitutional rights are being violated in his presence by other officers.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Finally, we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs Rule 60 motion, or in its treatment of Wieder\u2019s spoliation claims and motion for spoliation sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">We have considered Wieder\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-8\">. For the same reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of the federal claims brought against the Berg defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
