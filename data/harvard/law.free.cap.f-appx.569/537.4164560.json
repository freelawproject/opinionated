We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">1. The denial of Li\u2019s asylum application was supported by substantial evidence, including a forensic document examiner\u2019s testimony that a purported Chinese arrest notice submitted by Li was prepared on the same printer as documents seized during a raid of a Los Angeles \u201cdocument mill.\u201d Substantial evidence also supported the IJ\u2019s determination that Li\u2019s testimony that his wife mailed the arrest notice to him from China was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">2. Because Li did not establish eligibility for asylum, his applications for withholding of removal and CAT protection were also appropriately denied. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 971 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b560-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
