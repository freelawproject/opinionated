He contends the district court erred in assessing a 16-level crime-of-violence enhancement, based on his prior conviction under New York Penal Law \u00a7 130.25 (rape in the third degree).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-22\">The court found all subsections of \u00a7 130.25 fit within the generic meaning of enumerated offenses listed in the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 (unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States). Peralta contends there was insufficient evidence to determine under which section he was convicted, and that this court must vacate his sentence if any subsection of \u00a7 130.25 does not qualify as a crime of violence. Along that line, Peralta asserts \u00a7 130.25(2), sexual intercourse with a person under 17, involves the least culpable conduct, and does not qualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-23\">Regarding \u00a7 130.25(2), this court has held previously, in unpublished opinions, that the. offense constitutes a crime of violence under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). <em>United States v. Guzman-Saldivar, </em>262 Fed.Appx. 594, 594 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Alonzo, </em>204 Fed.Appx. 359, 360 (5th Cir. 2006). In the light of these opinions, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>unavailing for Peralta to challenge the court\u2019s finding as to subsection two. As Peralta concedes in the light of our following controlling precedent, it is also unavailing for him to contend the age of consent is 16 for purposes of the generic, contemporary meanings of sexual abuse of a minor and statutory rape. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 548, 562 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 512, 187 L.Ed.2d 365 (2013) (recognizing this court uses age of consent as defined by state statute). He presents the issue to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b259-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
