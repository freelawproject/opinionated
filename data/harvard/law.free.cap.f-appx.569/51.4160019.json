(\u201cPhotobucket\u201d) on Wolk\u2019s claims of copyright infringement. Specifically, Wolk challenges the district court\u2019s determination that Photobucket is entitled to the safe harbor protection of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. <em>See </em>17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">We review an award of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor. <em>See Viacom Int\u2019l, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc., </em>676 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2012). Summary judgment is appropriate only \u201c[wjhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); <em>accord Donnelly v. Greenburgh Cent. Sch. Dist. No. 7, </em>691 F.3d 134, 141 (2d Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Upon such review, we conclude, substantially for the reasons stated by the district court in its published opinion, <em>see Wolk v. Kodak Imaging Network, Inc., </em>840 F.Supp.2d 724 (S.D.N.Y.2012), that summary judgment was properly awarded. Insofar as Wolk urges otherwise by arguing that Photobucket should have done more to police its website for infringing material, her assessment fails in light of <em>Viacom International, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc., </em>where this court explained that \u00a7 512(c)\u2019s safe harbor applies to a service provider\u2019s otherwise infringing material caused \u201cby reason of the storage at the direction of a user\u201d so long as the service provider, among other things, (1) properly removes infringing activity upon gaining subjective knowledge of infringement or of \u201cfacts that would have made the specific infringement objectively obvious to a reasonable person,\u201d (2) bans repeat offenders, and (3) does not have the \u201cright and ability to control\u201d infringing activity to which a \u201cfinancial benefit\u201d is \u201cdirectly attributable.\u201d 676 F.3d at 30-41 (internal quotation marks omitted). This case falls within these parameters. We have considered Wolk\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude that they are moot,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> forfeited,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\">. Wolk appeals from the district court's denial of her motion for leave to amend her complaint to add claims against defendants Kodak Imaging Network, Inc. and Eastman Kodak Company (collectively, \"Kodak\u201d), which had entered into an agreement with Photobucket that allowed users to print images obtained from Photobucket\u2019s website. As we previously dismissed Wolk\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Kodak because all claims \"against Kodak were discharged by the confirmation of the reorganization plan in bankruptcy proceedings,\u201d Order, Nov. 13, 2013, ECF No. 130, we deny as moot Wolk\u2019s challenge to the denial of her motion to amend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-12\">. Insofar as Wolk asserts that Photobucket improperly used her works for its promotional activities, we decline to address this argument because it was not properly presented to the district court. <em>See Zalaski v. City of Hartford, </em>723 F.3d 382, 395-96 (2d Cir.2013) (declining to address argument forfeited in district court).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
