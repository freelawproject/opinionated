The immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) made an adverse credibility finding and determined that Quan-Barrera had failed to satisfy his burden of proof for relief under the INA or the CAT. The IJ\u2019s decision was upheld by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) when it dismissed Quan-Barrera\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-20\">Quan-Barrera claims that the adverse credibility determination was erroneous. We review questions of law <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). Under the substantial-evidence standard, reversal is improper unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-21\">In making a credibility determination, the IJ may consider, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s or wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>ness\u2019s account, the consistency between the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s written and oral statements [and] any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii), 1231(b)(3)(C). 'We must defer to the IJ\u2019s credibility determination \u201cunless it is plain that no reasonable factfinder could make\u201d such a ruling. <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 538 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The IJ noted inconsistencies between Quan-Barrera\u2019s testimony in 2000 and his testimony in 2012. In 2000, he testified that in December 1998 and January and February 1999, ex-guerillas robbed him and the passengers on the bus he was driving. In 2012, he testified that in October 1998 he witnessed three police officers kidnap a passenger on the bus he was driving and that they beat and threatened him. Quan-Barrera fails to show, as he must to preyail on review, that no reasonable factfinder could reach the same conclusion regarding his credibility. <em>See Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In light of the foregoing, this court need not consider the merits of Quan-Barrera\u2019s CAT claim. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 79. Furthermore, he has abandoned his claim for withholding of removal under the INA by failing to brief it. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b228-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
