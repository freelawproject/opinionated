We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000) (dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A); <em>Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir.1998) (order) (dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-22\">The district court properly dismissed Fisher\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim because Fisher failed to allege facts showing that defendant disregarded an excessive risk to Fisher\u2019s safety. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 845, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (a prison official acts with deliberate indifference by failing to take reasonable measures to abate a substantial risk of serious harm to an inmate); <em>see also Hebbe v. Pliler, </em>627 F.3d 338, 341-42 (9th Cir.2010) (though pro se pleadings are to be liberally construed, a plaintiff must still present factual allegations sufficient to state a plausible claim for relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-23\">The district court properly dismissed Fisher\u2019s equal protection claim because Fisher failed to allege facts showing that defendant intentionally treated him differently from others who were similarly situated without a rational basis, <em>see N. Pacifica LLC v. City of Pacifica, </em>526 F.3d 478, 486 (9th Cir.2008), or intentionally discrim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>mated against him on the basis of his membership in a protected class, <em>see Thornton v. City of St. Helens, </em>425 F.3d 1158, 1166 (9th Cir.2005); <em>see also Hebbe, </em>627 F.3d at 341-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The district court properly dismissed Fisher\u2019s due process claim because Fisher failed to allege facts that give rise to a liberty interest. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (protected liberty or property interest arises under Due Process Clause only when a restraint imposes an \u201catypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life\u201d); <em>see also Hebbe, </em>627 F.3d at 341-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">We do not consider arguments and allegations raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Padgett v. Wright, </em>587 F.3d 983, 985 n. 2 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b522-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
