GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Jahad Ali entered prison as Tracy Spencer. While serving his sentence, he changed his name for religious reasons. Although his prison agreed to recognize Mr. Ali\u2019s religious name years ago, he complains about problems he\u2019s had using that name when sending and receiving mail\u2014and he accuses a handful of prison officials of infringing his constitutional and federal statutory rights. The district court dismissed several of the defendants from the case early on. More recently, the court held that the last remaining defendants, mail room supervisors Michele Wingert and Bernadette Scott, weren\u2019t liable either. Now Mr. Ali seeks to undo this last conclusion on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Mr. Ali begins by contending that the defendants have violated his rights under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act. To initiate the process of establishing a claim under that statute, a plaintiff must allege facts suggesting that his sincere religious exercise has been substantially burdened by prison policy. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000cc-1(a); 2000cc-2(b). A burden can count as substantial if it prohibits the prisoner taking actions motivated by sincerely held religious beliefs\u2014or if it requires or places considerable pressure on the prisoner to do something his sincerely held religious beliefs forbid. <em>Yellowbear v. Lampert, </em>741 F.3d 48, 55 (10th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Mr. Ali\u2019s complaint fails to allege so much. In places, the complaint suggests that the prison forbids Mr. Ali from using his religious name on mail\u2014and that this is the gravamen of his complaint. Indeed, the title of the relevant claim in his complaint reads: \u201cThe SCF mail room\u2019s refusal to permit the plaintiff to send and receive mail under Jahad Ali violates his right to freely exercise his religious beliefs.\u201d R. at 35. Yet, Mr. Ali himself elsewhere concedes that the prison <em>doesn\u2019t </em>actually forbid the use of his religious name. Instead, he simply has to include his committed name alongside his religious name. R. at 34. So even if we were to agree with Mr. Ali that it might be a substantial burden on his religious exercise to forbid him to use his religious name on his mail, his own pleading makes plain that no such burden exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">We suppose it\u2019s possible the prison\u2019s modest requirement that both names appear could itself be enough to qualify as a substantial burden under RLUIPA\u2014if, say, a prisoner\u2019s sincerely held religious beliefs forbade <em>any </em>mention of a former name. But even affording the liberality due a <em>pro se </em>litigant, we don\u2019t see this allegation clearly made in claim 2 of Mr. Ali\u2019s complaint. And even if we could strain to find so much, we don\u2019t see any well-pleaded facts suggesting Mr. Ali\u2019s religious beliefs extend so far. For example, Mr. Ali summarily asserts that his spiritual experience is \u201cheightened\u201d by using his religious name and that he finds his old name \u201coffensive.\u201d R. at 35. But under prison policy, again, there\u2019s nothing prohibiting him from using his religious name. Neither does Mr. Ali plead facts suggesting how or why his religious beliefs might be burdened by having to write both names on the outside of envelopes. It</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>might be \u201coffensive\u201d to him, but he does not tell us how or why it burdens his religious exercise. Federal courts certainly are not arbiters of religious scripture or dogma, but to establish a RLUIPA claim they do require from the claimant some <em>well-pleaded facts </em>suggesting a substantial burden on a sincere religious exercise. And that much we simply don\u2019t have here. <em>See generally Mutawakkil v. Huibregtse, </em>735 F.3d 524, 527 (7th Cir.2013) (\u201c[Plaintiff] says that it would be preferable (from his perspective) if he were allowed to use just his spiritual name ... but preference or convenience is not the standard.\u201d); <em>United States v. Quaintance, </em>608 F.3d 717, 720-23 (10th Cir.2010) (RLUIPA requires courts to protect against only burdens on sincere religious exercises, not personal offenses). Further, because Mr. Ali hasn\u2019t alleged that the prison\u2019s policy is anything but neutral toward religion and generally applicable, we don\u2019t see how his religious liberty argument might fare any better under the First Amendment\u2019s free exercise guarantee than it does under RLUIPA. <em>See Emp\u2019t Div. v. Smith, </em>494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Beyond his religious liberty claims, Mr. Ali argues that by refusing to process mail bearing only his religious name the prison has interfered with his constitutional right to access the courts. In particular, Mr. Ali claims that the prison\u2019s mail policy limited his ability to obtain discovery in an earlier breach of contract case heard in state court. Mr. Ali\u2019s aim in that case was to hold the prison to its earlier pledge to recognize his religious name. But Mr. Ali doesn\u2019t allege that he was kept from discovering evidence that might have changed the outcome of that case, which ended with the state court\u2019s conclusion that the terms of the parties\u2019 contract in fact didn\u2019t assure Mr. Ali he could use <em>only </em>his religious name. Neither does Mr. Ali allege that the prison\u2019s mail policy caused him to miss any of the court\u2019s deadlines. And, as the magistrate judge in this case observed upon consulting the publicly available state court records, even with the two-name policy Mr. Ali succeeded in submitting more than a few filings to the state court during the relevant time period. R. at 210. Because he hasn\u2019t sufficiently alleged any actual injury or prejudice from the prison\u2019s mail policy, Mr. Ali\u2019s access to the courts claim can\u2019t succeed. <em>See, e.g., Peterson v. Shanks, </em>149 F.3d 1140, 1145 (10th Cir.1998) (\u201cTo present a viable claim for denial of access to courts ... an inmate must allege and prove prejudice arising from the defendants\u2019 actions.\u201d); <em>Gee v. Pacheco, </em>627 F.3d 1178, 1191 (10th Cir.2010) (ignoring allegations \u201ctoo conclusory to present a plausible claim that [the prisoner] was impeded in his effort to pursue a nonfrivolous legal claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Mr. Ali\u2019s third contention is that the defendants impermissibly decided to enforce the mail policy in retaliation for his efforts to vindicate his constitutional rights in court. Mr. Ali doesn\u2019t dispute that to state such a claim, he must plead facts plausibly suggesting that the defendants\u2019 enforcement of the policy was substantially motivated by an intent to retaliate and that this retaliatory motive was a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the defendants\u2019 actions. <em>Peterson, </em>149 F.3d at 1144; <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>561 Fed.Appx. 695, 698 (10th Cir.2014). But here again Mr. Ali\u2019s complaint comes up short, offering no facts that even hint at a retaliatory motive on the defendants\u2019 part or \u201cbut for\u201d causation. In fact, the complaint says the prison began enforcing its two-name policy in 2009, over a year before he filed the state court lawsuit that he suggests provoked the defendants\u2019 retaliatory animus. R. at 33, 36. A retaliation claimant can\u2019t establish the causal connection required for his claim with alie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>gations that the adverse actions against him preceded his protected activity. <em>See, e.g., Lawrence v. Sch. Dist. No. 1, </em>560 Fed.Appx. 791, 793 (10th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Mr. Ali receives one strike under the Prison Litigation Reform Act because the district court dismissed Mr. Ali\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted and because we affirm that dismissal but don\u2019t find the appeal frivolous. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>Childs v. Miller, </em>713 F.3d 1262, 1266 (10th Cir.2013); <em>Jennings v. Natrona Cnty. Det. Ctr. Med. Facility, </em>175 F.3d 775, 780 (10th Cir.1999) (dismissal of complaint yields one strike when followed by simple affirmance but two strikes when appeal is dismissed as frivolous). We grant Mr. Ali\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and remind him he must continue making partial payments until the filing fees he owes are paid in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
