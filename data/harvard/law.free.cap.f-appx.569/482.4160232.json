We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, <em>see Alcala v. Holder, </em>563 F.3d 1009, 1014 (9th Cir.2009), and review for abuse of discretion, <em>Delgado-Ortiz v. Holder, </em>600 F.3d 1148, 1150 (9th Cir.2010) (per curiam). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-26\">Reynoso-Avila\u2019s motion to reopen would normally have been number- and time-barred: it was her second motion to reopen, and was filed far more than 90 days after the BIA dismissed her appeal of the IJ\u2019s removal order. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Although the pertinent regulation sets out several exceptions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the numerical and time limitations, none apply here. See <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1003.2(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Reynoso-Avila contends that the limitations should be equitably tolled since she was denied due process by her attorney\u2019s ineffective assistance in failing to assert a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Ray v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 582, 590 (9th Cir. 2006). This argument fails: even if her counsel performed deficiently, Reynoso-Avila did not suffer prejudice. <em>See Ahmed v. Mukasey, </em>548 F.3d. 768, 771 (9th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Counsel\u2019s performance could not have affected the outcome of the proceedings since Reynoso-Avila has not shown plausible grounds for relief on her claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Alcala v. Holder, </em>563 F.3d 1009, 1020 (9th Cir.2009). Although Reynoso-Avila argues that she suffered persecution in Mexico based on her membership in the group of \u201cdefenseless children in a household who were severely abused both physically and emotionally by a controlling and overbearing parent,\u201d this group does not qualify as a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16; <em>Tamang v. Holder, </em>598 F.3d 1083, 1091 (9th Cir.2010). The characteristic of being a child in an abusive household is neither immutable, nor \u201cso fundamental to the identities or consciences of [the group\u2019s] members that they ... should not be required to change it.\u201d <em>Donchev v. Mukasey, </em>553 F.3d 1206, 1215 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Reynoso-Avila presents this Court with an alternative formulation of her social group: \u201cMaria and the female siblings of her family who were also abused by their mother.\u201d However, Reynoso-Avila did not argue to the BIA that she was persecuted on account of her membership in this group. Thus, this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the issue. <em>See Vargas v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Immigration &amp; Naturalization, </em>831 F.2d 906, 907-08 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">Finally, although Reynoso-Avila argues that she would be entitled to withholding of removal on humanitarian grounds, this issue was also not raised to the BIA. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b504-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
