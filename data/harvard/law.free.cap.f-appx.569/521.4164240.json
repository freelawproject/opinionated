Rather, the district court said that it had \u201creconsidered the evidentiary record\u201d and indicated that, \u201cshould the Ninth Circuit remand [on H <em>&amp; </em>L\u2019s motion for assignment of royalty streams], the Court would reconsider its prior order and grant assignment of Clinton\u2019s rights to royalty payments to H &amp; L.\u201d The district court added that \u201cif permitted by remand, the Court would restrain Clinton from disposing of or otherwise encumbering his rights to royalty payments\u201d and \u201cwould also require Clinton to turn over documentation of his royalty rights to H &amp; L.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The district court also said that, on further review of the record, it believed \u201cthat H &amp; L may levy Clinton\u2019s assets to the extent necessary to secure the money judgment owed by Clinton. H &amp; L may do so even as it pursues the assignment of Clinton\u2019s royalties.\u201d The district court concluded: \u201cIf remanded, the Court would reconsider its decision to release H &amp; L\u2019s levies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Accordingly, we continue to vacate the district court\u2019s prior orders, and we now remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Because the prior orders protecting funds are vacated, we order provisionally that any funds presently in the Attorney Trust Account of Mr. Thennisch shall be held and preserved, and that any funds received from third-party royalty payors after the date of this order shall also be preserved. The district court may make alternate orders to preserve the property in due course until it rules once more on the pending motions. The panel will retain jurisdiction over this appeal, pending this remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b543-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
