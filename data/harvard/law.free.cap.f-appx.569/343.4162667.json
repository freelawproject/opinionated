We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-16\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b366-17\">On the deadline date of January 4, 2010, David Bur\u00e9n Wilson submitted an application for a place on the Democratic Party primary election ballot for the position of Harris County Commissioner for Precinct # 4. The application asked for his residence address and Wilson listed his as 1512 W. 34th Street, Houston, Texas 77018. The chair of the Harris County Democratic Party, Gerald Birnberg, formed a personal belief that the address listed was not Wilson\u2019s residential address, although it was within Precinct # 4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He rejected Wilson\u2019s application, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>wrote, \u201cnot because I have concluded you do not live within precinct four. It is solely because I have concluded that your application fails to include your residence address, as required by mandatory provisions of the statute.\u201d No other applications were approved for the Democratic primary ballot for the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Wilson \u201cfailed to gain relief in various state courts,\u201d and sued Birnberg and other officials in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. <em>Wilson v. Birnberg, </em>667 F.3d 591, 594 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 32, 183 L.Ed.2d 678 (2012). Wilson claimed a denial of a right to ballot access, violations of due process and equal protection, and that Section 141.032 of the Texas Election Code was unconstitutional on its face. He sought injunctive relief and damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Wilson filed three complaints at the beginning of his case: two that were submitted <em>pro se </em>and a third drafted with the aid of counsel. His \u201cOriginal Complaint\u201d was filed on September 10, 2010. It stated that on January 4, 2010, Wilson had \u201ctimely and properly filed his sworn application for a place on the March 2, 2010 Democratic Party Primary Election Ballot.... Defendant originally accepted Plaintiffs application on January 4, 2010 but 4 days later rejected Plaintiffs application ... contending that Plaintiff did not correctly state his residence address on his application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Wilson pointed out a different election law case in which Birnberg had argued that he \u201chad and has no authority under the Texas Election Code to make a determination concerning the residency of an applicant for a place on the ballot.\u201d Wilson identified seven other applicants by name \u201cwith similar circumstances\u201d who had their applications \u201caccepted and certified\u201d by Birnberg and stated that his was the \u201conly one rejected.\u201d Wilson asserted that his \u201cvoter registration, voter history, and Texas drivers\u2019 [sic] license and other documents\u201d showed that his \u201cresidence\u201d was \u201ccorrectly stated in his application.\u201d Wilson \u201cincorporate[d]\u201d various portions of his complaint \u201cby reference\u201d in other portions of his brief. He also \u201cre-allege[d]\u201d portions of his complaint, pointing to the relevant numbered paragraphs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">On December 8, 2010, Wilson submitted a third complaint, titled his \u201cSecond Amended Complaint\u201d with a motion for leave to file the complaint. This was the first complaint submitted by counsel. It stated that \u201c[a]t all relevant times, Wilson resided in Harris County,\u201d but did not allege that 1512 W. 34 Street was his residential address. It alleged that \u201cBirnberg rejected Wilson\u2019s application out of retaliation for Wilson\u2019s exercise of free speech\u201d because he had circulated flyers opposing Houston Mayor Annise Parker. Wilson alleged that Birnberg had \u201cdeprived [him] a place on the ballot acting under color of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>The district court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim and Wilson appealed to this court. On January 12, 2012, this court released an opinion affirming \u201cin all respects except for Wilson\u2019s equal protection claim as to Birnberg as party chairman. The dismissal of that claim is REVERSED and the claim is REMANDED.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>667 F.3d at 602. This court first pointed out that Wilson had filed three complaints. <em>Id. </em>at 594-95. While a party has a right to amend a pleading within 21 days of its service under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, later amendments are permitted \u201conly with the opposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2)). Since the district court appeared to consider all of the complaints while not formally ruling on the motion for leave to amend, this court considered all three as well in evaluating their sufficiency. <em>Id. </em>at 594-95. However, this court instructed that \u201c[o]n remand ... the district court should insist on a single operative complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Critical to the analysis were two facts alleged in Wilson\u2019s complaint: (1) that he \u201cwas an eligible candidate\u201d because his \u201cvoter history, and Texas driver\u2019s] license and other documents show that Plaintiffs residence is correctly stated on his application,\u201d and (2) that Birnberg \u201creject[ed] Wilson\u2019s application out of retaliation for Wilson\u2019s exercise of free speech\u201d in opposing the successful Democratic mayoral candidate. <em>Id. </em>at 600, 599. This constituted sufficient \u201cfactual content\u201d supporting Birnberg\u2019s liability on a \u201cclass of one\u201d equal protection theory. <em>Id. </em>at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">On remand, the district court gave Wilson thirty days to file his single operative complaint. That complaint, styled Wilson\u2019s \u201cSecond Amended Complaint\u201d (to avoid confusion with the prior \u201cSecond Amended Complaint,\u201d this complaint will be referred to as the \u201cOperative Complaint\u201d) and drafted with the aid of his counsel, included not just an equal protection claim as to Birnberg as party chairman, but added a conspiracy claim against the former and current Harris County clerks, Beverly Kaufman and Stan Stanart, and sought the return of his filing fee from the Harris County Democratic Party and Lane Lewis, the current chair of the Harris County Democratic Party. It also sued Gerald Birnberg \u201cindividually.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The Operative Complaint eliminated the assertion made in Wilson\u2019s <em>pro se </em>filings that he had \u201cproperly\u201d filled out his application, asserting only that Wilson \u201ccompleted the entire application\u201d and that the \u201capplication listed his residence as 1512 W. 34th St., Houston, Texas 77018.\u201d Instead of any factual allegations of \u201cretaliation\u201d for opposing a political ally, Wilson alleged that \u201cBirnberg conducted an investigation and unilaterally determined that Wilson\u2019s residence was located at 7307 Lake Lane, Houston, TX 77040.\u201d Instead of listing the names of any similarly-situated parties that had been treated differently than Wilson, Wilson alleged that, \u201c[f]ive other candidates did in fact list their commercial address on the application. On reasonable belief, Birnberg did not investigate those candidates and certified their name [sic] to appear on the ballot.\u201d Wilson added the allegation that someone in the Harris County Clerk\u2019s office \u201cplaced some election ballots in the mail prior to the deadline with the intent to aid Birnberg and keep Wilson off the election ballot\u201d in an effort to make the issue moot under Texas law before his case was heard. He alleged in the alternative that someone from the \u201cClerk\u2019s Office lied to\u201d the state court judge about placing the ballots in the mail to moot his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The district court again dismissed the case for failure to state a claim. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>district court granted the motion to dismiss the Harris County Defendants, Kaufman and Stanart, under Rule 41(b) (failure to comply with a court order). The district court found that \u201c[n]owhere did this Court or the Fifth Circuit allow Plaintiff to add additional claims or additional parties to his lawsuit ... [d]oing so was clearly a violation of both the Fifth Circuit and this Court\u2019s Orders.\u201d For the same reasons, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed the claim against the Harris County Democratic Party. As to Birnberg, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the court dismissed the Section 1983 equal-protection claim because Wilson no longer specifically alleged in his pleading that Birnberg was acting under color of law. Alternatively, the district court found Wilson no longer alleged that the address he provided was his residential address, as statutorily required to submit a proper application. Wilson appeals this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u2018We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).\u201d <em>Cuvillier v. Taylor, </em>503 F.3d 397, 401 (5th Cir. 2007). Rule 12(b)(6) permits a party to move to dismiss if a plaintiff has failed \u201cto state a' claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). \u201c[A] plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitle[ment] to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do. Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201cNor does a complaint suffice if it tenders \u2018naked assertion[s]\u2019 devoid of \u2018further factual enhancement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). \u201c[W]hen the allegations in a complaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, this basic deficiency should ... be exposed at the point of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the court.\u201d <em>Cuvillier, </em>503 F.3d at 401 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">The Equal Protection clause \u201cprotects against the unlawful administration by state officers of a state statute fair on its face, resulting in unequal application to those who are entitled to be treated alike.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>667 F.3d at 599 (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To establish liability under a \u201cclass of one\u201d equal protection analysis \u201cthe plaintiff must establish (1) he was \u2018intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated\u2019 and (2) there was no rational basis for any such difference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">\u201cA candidate\u2019s application for a place on the ballot that is required by this code must ... include ... the candidate\u2019s residence address or, if the residence has no address, the address at which the candidate receives mail and a concise description of the location of the candidate\u2019s residence.\u201d Tex. Elec.Code \u00a7 141.031(a)(4)(I). \u201cIf an application does not comply with the applicable requirements, the authority [with whom it is filed] shall reject the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>application and immediately deliver to the candidate written notice of the reason for the rejection.\u201d Tex. Elec.Code \u00a7 141.032(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u201cAn amended complaint supersedes the original complaint and renders it of no legal effect unless the amended complaint specifically refers to and adopts or incorporates by reference the earlier pleading.\u201d <em>King v. Dogan, </em>31 F.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir. 1994). \u201c[T]he original pleading, once superseded, cannot be utilized to cure defects in the amended pleading, unless the relevant portion is specifically incorporated in the new pleading.\u201d 6 Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Civ. \u00a7 1476 (3d ed.) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Wilson was provided 30 days by the district court to provide a single, unified complaint in light of our remand and with the benefit of our opinion\u2019s guidance. Accordingly, Wilson\u2019s Operative Complaint is the only live complaint in this proceeding. Although Wilson\u2019s prior complaints evince an awareness that he could adopt and incorporate parts of a complaint, his Operative Complaint does not adopt or incorporate any prior filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Wilson\u2019s Operative Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Wilson\u2019s \u201cfactual allegations\u201d no longer include the crucial assertion that his application was proper because his \u201cresidence is correctly stated on his application.\u201d Wilson ceased to make this allegation when he began preparing his pleadings with counsel. Wilson\u2019s complaint also no longer includes any \u201cfactual allegations\u201d about Birnberg\u2019s desire to retaliate against him, which would offer some alternative explanation for why Birnberg rejected his application other than the fact that it did not comply with the statutory requirement to state his residence address. The failure to include these elements fatally undermines his pleadings; he cannot allege that there was \u201cno rational basis\u201d for the rejection of his application if Birnberg is legally obligated to review and reject applications without properly listed residence addresses. Our prior opinion clearly recognized that a prerequisite for Wilson to prove that he had been discriminated against was that his application had been statutorily \u201ccompliant,\u201d \u201cproper,\u201d and that the \u201capplication must list the candidate\u2019s residential address.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>667 F.3d at 594, 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Wilson\u2019s pleadings have also become more vague and speculative over time. While his Original Complaint listed seven people by name \u201cwith similar circumstances\u201d who had their applications accepted and his First Amended Complaint listed six people by name, his Operative Complaint lists no names of similarly-situated people who were certified for the ballot, but merely asserts now that \u201c[fjive other candidates did in fact list their commercial address on the application.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No further detail is offered of these others. No allegation is made that Birnberg knew these addresses were not the residential addresses of these prospective candidates but chose to approve them anyway while rejecting Wilson\u2019s application for some irrational, discriminatory reason. In light of this, these pleadings fail to rise \u201cabove the speculative level\u201d required to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) challenge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-10\">. Birnberg provides the full text of the January 8, 2010 letter that Wilson partially quotes in his pleadings to explain why Wilson\u2019s application was rejected. In it, he references a conversation he had with Wilson in which Wilson \u201cindicated that this is actually [his] business address.\u201d Birnberg said this triggered his statutory obligation to investigate the application. During this investigation of public records, Birnberg found that Wilson\u2019s wife was the record title owner of a residence located at 7307 Lake Lane, Houston, Texas, upon which a residential homestead exemption had been claimed (under Texas law, a married man is held to reside where his wife resides), Harris County Appraisal District list<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ed the 1512 W. 34th Street site as commercial property described as \"Industrial Warehouse-Metallic,\u201d and there was no City of Houston Certificate of Occupancy authorizing its use for residential purposes. Because it is referenced in Wilson\u2019s pleadings, we may consider this letter even at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage. <em>Grynberg v. BP P.L.C., </em>855 F.Supp.2d 625, 639 (S.D.Tex.2012) <em>aff'd, </em>527 Fed.Appx. 278 (5th Cir.2013) (\"Generally, any documents that are referenced in the pleadings themselves may be considered [in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion].\u201d); <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 10(c) (adopting documents attached to a pleading as part of the pleading for all purposes).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b367-13\">. Three days later, Wilson filed another document styled his \"First Amended Complaint.\u201d Wilson repeated the majority of his \"factual allegations\u201d in a complaint that is almost identical to his Original Complaint. This time, however, he claimed Birnberg \"accepted and certified\u201d the ballot for at least six people in \"similar circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\">. As an initial matter, this court\u2019s original opinion in this case affirmed the district court in all respects except for \"Wilson\u2019s equal protection <em>claim </em>as to <em>Birnberg as party chairman.\" </em>667 F.3d at 602 (emphases added). This court gave Wilson no authority to add additional claims or additional parties to his cause of action, all of whom could have been included in his Original Complaint or added within the appropriate period of time. Fed. R.Civ.P. 15. We, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of claims under Rule 41(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\">. The statement strongly implies that Wilson submitted a commercial address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\">. Wilson\u2019s Operative Complaint argues that Birnberg has previously taken the position that he cannot go outside of the record to unilaterally decide someone's residency, and that the fact he did so here evidences discrimination against him. He cites to a brief submitted on behalf of Birnberg to request that he be estopped from arguing that he can look outside the record. On the contrary, the full text of the quote reveals that Birnberg\u2019s brief claimed \"that a candidate may be declared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>ineligible only if ... facts indicating that the candidate is ineligible are conclusively established by another public record.\u201d After his conversation with Wilson in which Wilson told Birnberg that 1512 W. 34th Street was not his residence, he relied on public records to conclusively establish that Wilson\u2019s application was non-compliant. There is no discriminatory inconsistency visible here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
