Williams appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> adverse grant of summary judgment in her employment-discrimination case. Williams alleged that she was subjected to a hostile-work environment because of her race and gender, in violation of Title VII and the Arkansas Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-20\">Upon careful de novo review and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Williams, this court disagrees with Williams that the district court improperly decided an issue of fact when the court concluded as a matter of law that a particular work-place incident was not severe enough to create a hostile-work environment. <em>See McMiller v. Metro, </em>738 F.3d 185, 188 (8th Cir.2013) (per curiam) (standard of review). Although Williams may have produced some evidence to show she was subjected to a hostile environment, we conclude the district court did not err in determining that she failed to offer evidence permitting an inference of discriminatory animus. <em>See Lewis v. Jacks, </em>486 F.3d 1025, 1028 (8th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-21\">The judgment is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-16\">. The Honorable D.P.
