The district court upheld the BIA\u2019s decision, which in turn affirmed the decision of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to deny Gisele\u2019s 1-130 Petition for \u201cimmediate relative\u201d status on behalf of her husband Jean Marie. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-22\">Our review of the district court\u2019s decision is <em>de novo, Karpova v. Snow, </em>497 F.3d 262, 267 (2d Cir.2007), but we may only overturn an agency decision if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>accord Egan v. </em>Weiss, 119 F.3d 106, 107 (2d Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-23\">A U.S. citizen (the \u201cpetitioner\u201d) may seek preferential immigration status on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>behalf of an alien spouse (the \u201cbeneficiary\u201d) by filing a Form 1-130 Petition. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a)(1)(A)(i). Pursuant to the marriage-fraud bar, however, an 1-130 Petition must be denied if there is \u201csubstantial and probative evidence\u201d that (1) the beneficiary \u201chas previously been accorded, or has sought to be accorded,\u201d immediate relative status based on a marriage \u201centered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws,\u201d or (2) the beneficiary \u201chas attempted or conspired to enter into a marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(c); <em>accord </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.2(a)(1)(ii). The petitioner carnes the burden of proving the beneficiary\u2019s visa eligibility, and must therefore rebut any evidence of marriage fraud \u201cin the alien\u2019s file\u201d with proof that the prior marriage was <em>bona fide, ie., </em>not fraudulent. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.2(a)(1)(ii); <em>accord In re Kahy, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 803, 805-07, 1988 WL 235464 (BIA 1988); <em>In re Laureano, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1, 2-3, 1983 WL 29913 (BIA 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Substantial and probative evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision here. In two sworn statements, Jean Marie admitted the following: his previous marriage to Mirlande Lauture, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was not <em>bona fide; </em>the two separated immediately after the marriage and never spoke to or saw each other again; and they never shared any assets or property. Jean Marie further admitted that he knew his cousin arranged for Lauture to travel to Haiti to help him obtain U.S. residency. The agency reasonably concluded that Jean Marie knew he was entering into a marriage, as the marriage certificate he signed was clearly labeled. The agency also reasonably inferred, based on Jean Marie\u2019s misrepresentations about his previous marriage, that he had intended to evade the immigration laws through a sham marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">We have considered the Bourisquots\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
