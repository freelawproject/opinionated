Breslow (\u201cBreslow\u201d), the former director of the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles (\u201cDMV\u201d), which was filed as a result of the DMV\u2019s denial of Linlor\u2019s applications for personalized license plates. In 2009 and 2010, the DMV denied Linlor\u2019s applications, on behalf of his wholly owned and controlled corporation, Paperless, Inc., for personalized prestige license plates bearing the phrases \u201cGOPALIN,\u201d \u201cPA-LIN,\u201d \u201cPALIN12,\u201d and \u201cPALIN 16.\u201d The DMV based its decision on sections 482.320(6)(b)(5) and 482.320(6)(f) of the Nevada Administrative Code (\u201cNAC\u201d), which provided, respectively, that \u201c[n]o combination of letters, numbers or spaces is allowed if it ... [expresses contempt, ridicule or superiority of ... political affiliation,\u201d or \u201c[i]s determined by the Department to be inappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) reversed the denial of the application for the \u201cPALIN,\u201d \u201cPALIN 12,\u201d and \u201cPALIN 16\u201d license plates on September 9, 2010, after which the DMV issued those license plates to Linlor. A \u201cGOPALIN\u201d license plate was ultimately issued to Linlor\u2019s col-. league, who also applied for it on behalf of Paperless, Inc. Subsequently, on October 6, 2011, Breslow, then the DMV director, issued a memorandum advising the DMV not to \u201cdeny any new personalized license plate requests\u201d based on the provisions of the Nevada Administrative Code that were relied upon to deny Linlor\u2019s initial applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">More significantly, the memorandum indicated that the DMV had initiated formal procedures to repeal those provisions. The repeal process entailed, among other</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">procedures, providing notice to the public so that it has an opportunity to comment on proposed amendments, issuing an informational statement describing comments received and responses, <em>see </em>Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 233B.066, and issuing a summary of the reasons for adopting a regulation without change, if none were made following the comment period. Similar procedures would be required to reinstate the regulations. While this appeal was pending, the amended regulations became final on February 15, 2012, formally repealing sections 482.320(6)(b)(5) and 482.320(6)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">We hold that the challenges to the repealed regulations are moot. The repeal of NAC sections 482.320(6)(b)(5) and 482.320(6)(f) reflects a permanent change in the DMV\u2019s personalized license plate regulations, so that the challenged conduct \u201ccannot reasonably be expected\u201d to recur. <em>See White v. Lee, </em>227 F.3d 1214, 1243-44 (9th Cir.2000). Indeed, the formal manner in which the repeal of the regulations was effected, and the comparable steps that would have to be taken before they could be reinstated, combined with the years that have passed since the DMV last enforced those regulations against Linlor or anyone else, as well as the earlier ALJ\u2019s ruling, provide sufficient assurance that the \u201cnew policy [was] the kind of permanent change that proves voluntary cessation\u201d sufficient to moot Linlor\u2019s claims for relief with respect to the regulations. <em>Bell v. City of Boise, </em>709 F.3d 890, 901 (9th Cir .2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">Perhaps recognizing the lack of merit in his challenge to the repealed regulations, Linlor argues that the case is not moot because a Nevada statute, Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 482.3667(5), \u201cindependently authorizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>the DMV to prohibit the combination of letters deemed \u2018inappropriate.\u2019 \u201d While Linlor\u2019s claim based on section 482.3667(5) is not moot given that this statute has not been repealed, this claim fails on the merits. Linlor\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with a plain reading of that statute, which provides that the DMV \u201cmay limit by regulation the number of letters and numbers used and prohibit the use of inappropriate letters or combinations of letters and numbers.\u201d Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 482.3667(5). It does not authorize the DMV to act without going through the formal process of promulgating regulations prohibiting certain letters and combinations of letters and numbers. Indeed, while the regulations at issue here were in effect, the DMV did not interpret NRS section 482.3667(5) to authorize it to deny license plate applications as inappropriate. Rather, the DMV relied on its regulations, promulgated pursuant to NRS section 482.3667(5), to deny license plate applications, like Linlor\u2019s. The DMV maintains its position that the statute is \u201csimply a grant of rule-making authority to the DMV by the Nevada State Legislature,\u201d and Nevada courts \u201cgive deference to administrative interpretations.\u201d <em>Thomas v. City of N. Las Vegas, </em>122 Nev. 82, 127 P.3d 1057, 1070 (2006) (citing <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
