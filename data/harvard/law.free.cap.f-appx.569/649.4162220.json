Mr. Ervin alleged in his motion that the order of forfeiture entered by the district court was void as a matter of law because possession of the defendant res ($178,858.00 in United States currency) by the Jefferson County Circuit Court prevented a federal court from acquiring or exercising jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-24\">On February 16, 2006, officers of the Birmingham Police Department (BPD) were conducting surveillance of an apartment complex, where they suspected illegal drug activity. The officers observed three men leave an apartment; one of the men was carrying a black bag on his shoulder. An officer followed the three men and heard the sound of a vehicle being locked and unlocked and \u201ca handgun being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>\u2018chambered\u2019 with a round of ammunition.\u201d D.E. 1 at \u00b6 3(b). The officer approached a green GMC Denali truck, identified himself, and asked who had chambered the round. One of the individuals\u2014later identified as Mr. Ervin\u2014pulled a handgun from his waistband and fired multiple shots at the officer. The three men fled on foot and were later apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">BPD officers determined that the GMC Denali truck was registered to Mr. Ervin and impounded the vehicle. BPD officers obtained a search warrant for the truck from the Jefferson County Circuit Court for the vehicle in connection with suspects ed illegal drug activity. While executing the search warrant of the truck\u2019s interior, BPD detectives, in conjunction with agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), found a black bag containing $160,840.00, a shoe box containing $18,000.00, and $18 in cash. As a result of the search, law enforcement officers seized a total $178,858.00. <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6 3(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">That same day, BPD officers also obtained a search warrant for the apartment from which the three men had been seen leaving on the night of February 16, 2006. The officers found a gym bag containing ten packages of cocaine hydrochloride weighing 18 kilograms, a box containing ten bags of hydrochloride weighing 31 ounces, and 43 methylenedioxymethamphetamine pills (also known as Ecstasy or MDMA). <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6 3(h). Cocaine hydrochloride is classified as a \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d for purposes of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <em>et seq. See id. </em>at \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">On August 21, 2006, the United States filed a civil forfeiture action under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a)(6), seeking the forfeiture of the $178,858.00 found in the truck as proceeds of illegal drug activity. According to the civil forfeiture complaint, DEA special agents had probable cause to believe that the currency seized during the search of the truck was \u201cfurnished, or intended to be furnished in exchange for a controlled substance or listed chemical in violation of Title 21, United Sates Code, Chapter 13, Subchapter I.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5. <em>See also </em>D.E. 14 at \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">On March 30, 2007, Mr. Ervin filed a verified claim to the defendant property, which he later moved to withdraw on January 18, 2008. Finding that Mr. Ervin consented to forfeiture, that there were no other potential claimants to the defendant currency, and that the time for asserting any such interests had expired, the district court granted the United States\u2019 motion for consent judgment and ordered forfeiture of the defendant <em>res </em>to the United States under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a)(6). <em>See </em>D.E. 15. The forfeiture proceeds were disbursed via the federal \u201cequitable sharing\u201d program, with 80% awarded to the BPD and 20% retained by the United States. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. at 2; D.E. 20 at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">On June 10, 2013, Mr. Ervin filed the instant Rule 60(b)(4) motion to set aside the district court\u2019s judgment and order of forfeiture. The district court denied the motion, concluding that it had properly exercised <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction over the defendant currency. Specifically, the district court ruled that because no state court action related to the <em>res </em>had been instituted in the Jefferson County Circuit Court, \u201cno bar existed on the federal exercise of jurisdiction.\u201d D.E. 25 at 7. Referring to the doctrine of \u201cadoptive forfeiture\u201d\u2014under which a federal court can adopt a state or local seizure and subsequently deem the property to have been seized by the federal government\u2014the district court reasoned that \u201cthreats posed to federalism and comity by the usurpation of jurisdiction or the maintenance of parallel proceedings\u201d were \u201cnonexistent\u201d because the state court had made no attempt to assert <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Rule 60(b)(4) motions\u2014unlike motions under other subsections of Rule 60(b)\u2014 \u201cleave no margin for consideration of the district court\u2019s discretion as the judgments themselves are by definition either legal nullities or not.\u201d <em>Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We therefore review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 60(b)(4) motion. <em>See id. </em>Generally, a judgment is void under Rule 60(b)(4) \u201cif the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). It is well settled, however, \u201cthat a mere error in the exercise of jurisdiction does not support relief under Rule 60(b)(4).\u201d <em>In re Optical Technologies, Inc., </em>425 F.3d 1294, 1306 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Oakes v. Horizon Fin., S.A., </em>259 F.3d 1315, 1319 (11th Cir.2001)). Indeed, \u201c[fjederal courts considering Rule 60(b)(4) motions that assert a judgment is void because of jurisdictional defect generally have reserved relief for the exceptional case in which the court that rendered judgment lacked even an \u2018arguable basis\u2019 for jurisdiction.\u201d <em>United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, </em>559 U.S. 260, 271, 130 S.Ct. 1367, 176 L.Ed.2d 158 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">We have long recognized that a court\u2019s <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction \u201cmust be exclusive,\u201d and a state court and a federal court therefore \u201ccannot simultaneously exercise <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction over the same property.\u201d <em>United States v. $270, 000.00 in U.S. Currency, </em>1 F.3d 1146, 1147 (11th Cir.1993). In order to avoid this conflict, \u201cthe principle, applicable to both federal and state courts, is established that the court first assuming jurisdiction over the property may maintain and exercise that jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Mr. Ervin contends that \u201ccomplete jurisdiction\u201d over the defendant <em>res </em>attached first in the Jefferson County Circuit Court, thus barring subsequent jurisdiction within the federal court. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10-13. Specifically, he argues that, under Alabama law, jurisdiction was vested in the state court when the defendant <em>res </em>was seized pursuant to a state-issued search warrant and that\u2014contrary to the United States\u2019 argument\u2014the filing of a separate, third-party forfeiture complaint was not necessary to confer exclusive state court jurisdiction over the property. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">Mr. Ervin and the United States provide seemingly conflicting Alabama case law discussing the requirements for <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction to vest in an Alabama state court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We, however, need not address whether <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction attached within the state court prior to the federal forfeiture proceedings because, under the governing standard for a Rule 60(b)(4) motion, we cannot say that this is one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>\u201cexceptional case[s]\u201d that lacks even an \u201carguable basis\u201d for jurisdiction. <em>See United Student Aid Funds, </em>559 U.S. at 271, 130 S.Ct. 1367. The United States properly filed a complaint in the district court seeking civil forfeiture of the defendant property under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a)(6) as alleged proceeds of illegal drug activity in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <em>et seq. </em>The district court subsequently entered a consent judgment following Mr. Ervin\u2019s withdrawal of his verified claim and express consent to the forfeiture of the defendant <em>res </em>to the United States. <em>See </em>D.E. 15. Additionally, as explained by the district court, the notion that the federal government may adopt property seized pursuant to state process and give to it the same effect as if it had been first seized by federal authorities is embodied within the operative characteristics of the long-accepted doctrine of adoptive seizure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Given that the district court at the very least possessed arguable subject-matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 21 U.S.C. 881(a)(6), that Mr. Ervin consented to the forfeiture at the time of the judgment, that the record demonstrated that the state agreed to transfer the currency to federal authorities, and that no <em>in rem </em>proceedings had been instituted within the state court, we cannot say that the forfeiture judgment is void. Mr. Ervin therefore is not entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Ervin\u2019s 60(b)(4) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\">. Mr. Ervin cites to state and federal cases that suggest that seizure made pursuant to process issued by the state court is alone sufficient to vest <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction to the exclusion of other courts. <em>See Voorhees v.
