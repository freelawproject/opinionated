Then, based on its assessment of the relevant private interest and public interest factors, the district court also concluded that the Mexican judicial system would be a more convenient forum for Appellants\u2019 lawsuit. Accordingly, the district court granted Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">This appeal followed. As explained below, we conclude that the district court\u2019s balancing of the private interest and public interest factors did not constitute an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion. We nonetheless remand this case on two narrow grounds. First, the district court must clarify its order\u2019s return jurisdiction clause with respect to the possibility that Appellants\u2019 access to relief may now be time-barred in Mexico. Second, we direct the district court to consider whether any part of the <em>forum non conveniens </em>analysis in this case is altered by the recent seizure of Appellees\u2019 vessel in the Eastern District of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">On June 24, 2011, Appellants\u2019 vessel, the <em>SSV Iolair </em>(\u201cthe <em>Iolair\u201d), </em>was struck by Appellees\u2019 vessel, the <em>OSV HOS Beaufort </em>(\u201cthe <em>Beaufort </em>\u201d), approximately forty-four miles off the coast of Mexico in the Bay of Campeche.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In October 2011 and April 2012, Appellees preemptively filed two petitions in the Mexican courts to limit their liability for damage to the <em>Beaufort. </em>According to Appellants, certain Appellants were named and properly served with process in the Mexican limitation proceedings, while other Appellants were not named and properly served with process. The record reflects that Appellants have not yet participated in the limitation proceedings or in any other Mexican judicial proceedings in relation to the events of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">On December 15, 2011, Appellants filed a complaint against Appellees in the district court. Appellants raised a number of claims based on theories of negligence, gross negligence, and the unseaworthiness of the <em>Beaufort. </em>On May 11, 2012, Appellees filed a motion to dismiss on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens. </em>The district court granted this motion on March 29, 2013, after concluding that litigation would be more convenient in a Mexican forum. As the district court explained, Appellants\u2019 contributory negligence is a disputed issue in this case. Accordingly, the district court reasoned that the testimony of Mexican regulatory authorities and investigators, as well as the documentary records within the control of those entities, will be relevant to the issue of Appellants\u2019 contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">Appellants then brought this appeal. .Meanwhile, shortly before oral argument, Appellants seized the <em>Beaufort </em>pursuant to a warrant of arrest issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. On April 3, 2014, the district judge in that case denied Appellees\u2019 motion to vacate the arrest. Accordingly, while Appellants\u2019 original lawsuit against Appellees in the Southern District of Texas has now been dismissed, Appellants\u2019 action <em>in rem </em>against Appellees\u2019 vessel is still ongoing in the Eastern District of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-15\">This court will reverse the grant or denial of a motion to dismiss on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens </em>only where there has been a \u201cclear abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Where a district court has reasonably balanced the relevant private interest and public interest factors, the district court\u2019s decision \u201cdeserves substantial deference.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although a plaintiffs choice of forum is entitled to a presumption in favor of convenience, the presumption applies with less force \u201c[wjhen the plaintiffs choice is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>its home forum.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">As we explained in <em>Gonzalez v. Chrysler Corp., </em>301 F.3d 377, 379-80 (5th Cir.2002), the <em>forum non conveniens </em>inquiry consists of four steps that must be considered in sequence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">First, the district court must assess whether an alternative forum is available. An alternative forum is available if the entire case and all parties can come within the jurisdiction of that forum. Second, the district court must decide if the alternative forum is adequate. An alternative forum is adequate if the parties will not be deprived of all remedies or treated unfairly, even though they may not enjoy the same benefits as they might receive in an American court. If the district court decides that an alternative forum is both available and adequate, it next must weigh various private interest factors. If consideration of these private interest factors counsels against dismissal, the district court moves to the fourth consideration in the analysis. At this stage, the district court must weigh numerous public interest factors. If these factors weigh in the moving party\u2019s favor, the district court may dismiss the case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afh\">As the quoted passage indicates, and as is further clarified by <em>Empresa Lineas Maritimas Argentinas, </em>S.A. <em>v. Schichau-Unterweser, A.G., </em>955 F.2d 368, 371-72 (5th Cir.1992), the \u201cavailability and adequacy\u201d of the alternative forum are \u201cthreshold requirements\u201d that must be established before the private interest factors and public interest factors are considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">When considering the threshold requirements that an alternative forum must be adequate and available, district courts are obligated \u201cto ensure that plaintiffs can reinstate suits in American courts if the defendants obstruct jurisdiction in the alternative forum.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, when a district court dismisses a case on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>the \u201cfailure to include a return jurisdiction clause ... constitutes a <em>per se </em>abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the present case, the district court did include a return jurisdiction clause, but failed to address the parties\u2019 evidence in the record regarding this litigation\u2019s potential untimeliness in the Mexican forum. As explained below, we now remand so that the district court may consider that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">Where litigation in a particular forum has become time-barred, that forum is no longer an available forum for the purposes of a <em>forum non conveniens </em>analysis. As we observed in <em>Veba-Chemie A.G. v. MfV Getafix, </em>711 F.2d 1243, 1248 (5th Cir.1983), it would be \u201cexceedingly harsh\u201d to dismiss for <em>forum non conveniens </em>\u201cif no other forum is available to plaintiff at the time of dismissal\u201d due to the expiration of a time limit in a foreign jurisdiction. In the same decision, however, we also acknowledged that \u201cif the plaintiffs plight is of his own making\u2014for instance, if the alternative fo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>rum was no longer available at the time of dismissal as a result of the deliberate choice of an inconvenient forum\u2014the court would be permitted to disregard this consideration and dismiss.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Other courts have applied the same analysis.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In the present case, although the record suggests that untimeliness may become a significant issue in the Mexican judicial proceedings, the district court did not account for this possibility in its return jurisdiction clause. Instead, the district court simply stated that it would \u201ccondition ... dismissal on the [Appellees\u2019] stipulation that they will fully submit to jurisdiction in Mexico for purposes of this dispute.\u201d The district court then instructed Appellees to \u201cwaiv[e] any jurisdictional defenses they might normally possess.\u201d Based on the ambiguous record, however, it is unclear whether this instruction accords with our reasoning in <em>Veba-Chemie, </em>711 F.2d at 1248 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">One of the affidavits proffered by Appellants in the proceedings before the district court was authored by Mr. Jose-Davis Enriquez-Rosas, an expert on Mexican law. According to the affidavit, \u201cthe opportunity for Cotemar, S.A. de C.V. to appear in the limitation proceedings has already lapsed,\u201d although the affidavit does not mention the other two Appellants. We also observe that the record contains translations of Mexican court documents suggesting that ordinary creditors must \u201cpresent their claims for review within a period of thirty working days\u201d and that \u201cclaimants residing abroad ... shall be given a deadline of sixty working days to present their claims.\u201d It therefore appears possible that one or more Appellants no longer can obtain relief against Appellees in the Mexican courts based on untimeliness.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally, although the district court has instructed Appellees to \u201csubmit fully\u201d to the Mexican judicial proceedings, there is no indication of whether this instruction would also require Appellees to waive any legitimate defenses relating to untimeliness that Appellees may have acquired based on Appellants\u2019 lack of diligence under Ve<em>ba-Chemie, </em>711 F.2d at 1248 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">On remand, we direct the district court to make findings regarding the availability of the Mexican courts with respect to the untimeliness issue. The district court must then revise its return jurisdiction clause in accordance with our decision in <em>Veba-Chemie, </em>711 F.2d at 1248 n. 10. The district court should also consider Appellants\u2019 argument regarding the reasonableness of bringing their claims first in the United States, rather than simultaneously submitting to jurisdiction in Mexico initially by entering an appearance in the limitation proceedings. If access to relief in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Mexican courts has become time-barred for reasons not of Appellants\u2019 \u201cown making,\u201d then the Mexican courts are no longer an available alternative forum. If such is the case, then Appellants\u2019 lawsuit must proceed in the United States. On the other hand, if Appellants may still pursue relief in the Mexican courts, .or if any time bar now in effect has resulted from Appellants\u2019 \u201cdeliberate choice,\u201d then the district court may \u201cdisregard this consideration and dismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">We reject each of Appellants\u2019 other arguments regarding the adequacy of the Mexican courts as a forum<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the district court\u2019s evaluation of the private interest and public interest factors. Most notably, Appellants are wrong to suggest, based on our decision in <em>Baris v. Sulpicio, </em>932 F.2d 1540, 1550 n. 14 (5th Cir.1991), that Appellees failed to provide sufficient proof for the district court to believe that litigation in Mexico would improve access to witnesses and evidence. As explained in <em>Empresa Lineas, </em>955 F.2d at 371-72, \u201cthe <em>Baris </em>affidavit requirement\u201d is necessary only for \u201cdetermining forum availability and adequacy\u201d and does not apply to \u201call elements of defendant\u2019s burden.\u201d Rather, when the district court is faced with balancing the private interest and public interest factors, a defendant may successfully invoke <em>forum non conveniens </em>simply by producing \u201cenough information to enable the District Court to balance the parties\u2019 interests.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Here, the materials before the district court included documentary evidence showing that Mexican officials had investigated the events of the present case. It was reasonable for the district court to conclude that these investigators\u2019 testimony would be relevant to adjudicating Appellants\u2019 contributory negligence. Contrary to Appellants\u2019 suggestions, the district court need not assess whether Appellees\u2019 arguments regarding contributory negligence are likely to prevail. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the private interest factors weighed in favor of litigating in Mexico.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We also find that the district court did not abuse its discretion with respect to evaluating the public interest factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">We observe, however, that Appellants\u2019 seizure of Appellees\u2019 vessel in the Eastern District of Louisiana may constitute a supervening change of circumstances with respect to balancing the private interest and public interest factors. As we observed in <em>Concerned Citizens of Vicksburg v. Sills, </em>567 F.2d 646, 649-50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>(5th Cir.1978), and reaffirmed more recently in unpublished decisions,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> supervening changes of circumstances must be taken into account even where they materialize during the pendency of an appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">[A]n appellate court is obligated to take notice of changes in fact or law occurring during the pendency of a cas\u00e9 on appeal which would make a lower court\u2019s decision, though perhaps correct at the time of its entry, operate to deny litigants substantial justice.... [T]he preferred procedure is to remand to give the district court an opportunity to pass on the changed circumstances.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">In this regard, Appellants now suggest that the seizure of the vessel might potentially oblige the parties to litigate one action in Louisiana and another in Mexico at the same time. Without prejudging the result, therefore, we conclude that the district court should determine whether simultaneously pursuing an <em>in rem </em>action against Appellees\u2019 vessel in the Eastern District of Louisiana would render litigation in Mexico less convenient based on one or more of the private interest and public interest factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Accordingly, as set forth above, we AFFIRM in part and VACATE in part the judgment of the district court conditionally granting Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss for <em>forum non conveniens. </em>We REMAND for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
