We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-18\">Questions of subject matter jurisdiction are reviewed de novo. <em>Hoblock v. Albany Cnty. Bd. of Elections, </em>422 F.3d 77, 83 (2d Cir.2005). Even assuming that the district court erred in concluding it lacked jurisdiction based on the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, it correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction based on the probate exception to federal jurisdiction. <em>Lefkowitz v. Bank of New York, </em>528 F.3d 102, 107 (2d Cir. 2007). \u201c[T]he probate exception reserves to state probate courts the probate or annulment of a will and the administration of a decedent\u2019s estate; it also precludes federal courts from endeavoring to dispose of property that is in the custody of a state probate court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-19\">We have considered the remainder of Davis\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
