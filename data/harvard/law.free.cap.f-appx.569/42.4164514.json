Joint Venture v. Cacioli (In re Cacioli), </em>463 F.3d 229, 234 (2d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we review the court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>Id. </em>Student loans are presumptively nondischargeable in bankruptcy. <em>Easterling v. Collecto, Inc., </em>692 F.3d 229, 231-32 (2d Cir.2012). Because bankruptcy is both a right of the debtor, and a remedy for the creditor, a proper balancing of those competing interests requires the creditor to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that its claim is one that is not dischargeable. <em>Cazenovia Coll. v. Renshaw (In re Renshaw), </em>222 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The district court correctly held that the debt in question was excepted from discharge under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8)(A)(ii). Contrary to Desormes\u2019s argument, if a transfer of funds directly to the debtor is not necessary for the creation of a loan, there is little reason to think such a transfer is necessary for the loan to be received within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">We have considered Desormes\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED. Each side to bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
