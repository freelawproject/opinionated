This matter arises from the termination of Martinez\u2019s employment as a New York City correction officer. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-17\">We dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not filed in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-18\">\u201cFiling deadlines are mandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Univ. of Rochester Med. Ctr., </em>642 F.3d 121, 124 (2d Cir.2011). If an appellant does not file a timely notice of appeal, \u201cthis Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\u201d <em>Silivanch v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc., </em>333 F.3d 355, 363 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-19\">Here, the judgment was entered Wednesday, July 3, 2013. Therefore, the notice of appeal had to be filed no later than Friday, August 2, 2013. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1) (requiring appellant in civil case to file notice of appeal within 30 days after entry of judgment or order being appealed). In fact, the notice of appeal was not filed until Saturday, August 3, 2013-31 days after the district court judgment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-20\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A) provides three exceptions to the 30-day requirement. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) (requiring filing within 30 days \u201cexcept as provided in Rules 4(a)(1)(B), 4(a)(4), and 4(c)\u201d). None of these exceptions applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-21\">Accordingly, because the notice of appeal was untimely filed, this appeal is DISMISSED for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
