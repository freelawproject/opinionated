On appeal, Bedgood argues that: (1) the district court improperly enhanced his mandatory minimum sentence based upon a judicial determination of the fact that he was older than 18 when he committed the instant crimes, and his prior convictions, in violation of <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013); and (2) he suffered ineffective assistance counsel at trial. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">We review constitutional sentencing issues <em>de novo, </em>and reverse only if an error is harmful. <em>United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1306-07 (11th Cir.2001). A constitutional error \u201cmust be disregarded as not affect[ing] substantial rights, if the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1307 (citation and quotations omitted). \u201cThis standard is only met where it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-15\">First, we are unpersuaded by Bedgood\u2019s claim that the district court erred by enhancing his mandatory minimum sentence based upon a judicial determination of relevant facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that a prior conviction is not a fact that must be charged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 523 U.S. 224, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). The Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decisions in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), did not disturb the holding of <em>Almendarez-Torres. United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-16\">In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court overturned <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), and held that any factor that increases a defendant\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence is an element of the crime that must be found by a jury. <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2155. <em>Alleyne, </em>however, did not address prior-conviction sentencing enhancements. <em>See generally </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314. Instead, the Supreme Court explicitly said that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>was not revisiting the \u201cnarrow exception to this general rule for the fact of a prior conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2160 n. 1. The Supreme Court also carefully noted that its ruling in <em>Alleyne </em>left undisturbed judicial discretion in fashioning sentences under the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 2163 (\u201cOur ruling today does not mean that any fact that influences judicial discretion must be found by a jury. We have long recognized that broad sentencing discretion, informed by judicial factfinding, does not violate the Sixth Amendment.\u201d). We have said that \u201cSentencing Guideline issues are not subject to the <em>Apprendi </em>rule and, thus, there is no requirement that sentencing facts be submitted to a jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>248 F.3d 1065, 1105 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is still the law of this Circuit in the wake of <em>Alleyne. See United States v. Harris, </em>741 F.3d 1245, 1249-50 (11th Cir.2014) (concluding that judicial factfinding regarding defendant\u2019s prior convictions did not violate Sixth Amendment). Because the Supreme Court has yet to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we are bound to follow that case as binding precedent. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1035 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The career offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that, among other requirements, \u201c[a] defendant is a career offender if ... the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction[.]\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). Classification as a career offender allows a district court to increase a defendant\u2019s base offense level and sets a mandatory criminal history category of VI. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.1(b). In pertinent part, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) provides a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence for any person who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and has three previous convictions for violent felo-</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">ny or serious drug offenses. Section 4B 1.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines implements this statutory provision and provides for enhanced offense levels if its requirements are met. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.4 (a), (b), comment, (backg\u2019d.). Finally, defendants who violate 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 841(b)(1)(B) and have a single prior conviction for a felony drug offense face a mandatory minimum term of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Here, the district court did not err by making factual determinations regarding Bedgood\u2019s age or his prior convictions. First, the fact that Bedgood was older than 18 when he committed the instant offense goes to the requirements of \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines. Sentencing Guidelines issues do not need to be submitted to the jury and such determinations fall within the judicial factfinding protected in <em>Alleyne. Diaz, </em>248 F.3d at 1105; <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2163. Second, the district court\u2019s judicial factfinding regarding Bedgood\u2019s prior convictions supporting the mandatory minimum sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 was proper under <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">We also reject Bedgood\u2019s claim\u2014made for the first time on appeal\u2014that his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated in the proceedings before the district court. We do not generally consider on direct appeal a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that was not raised in the district court unless a factual record was developed. <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>595 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2010). The Supreme Court has noted that \u201cin most cases a motion brought under [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective assistance,\u201d even if the record contains some indication of deficiencies in counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Massaro v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). This is because the trial, record on direct appeal is often incomplete for the purpose of litigating ineffective assistance claims. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the evidence introduced at trial usually is devoted to guilt or innocence, not the facts required to undertake the ineffective-assistance analysis required under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>Id. </em>at 505, 123 S.Ct. 1690. The record would not include the reasons for counsel\u2019s actions, and the appellate court would have no way of knowing whether there was a sound strategic motive behind the action or whether counsel\u2019s alternatives were even worse. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, there would not be sufficient evidence to determine prejudice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Here, the record is not sufficiently developed so that this Court could review Bedgood\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. The record does not include, for example, any information as to why counsel did not object to the presentenee investigation report or why he did not make certain arguments at the sentencing hearing. The record does not indicate, as Bedgood now claims, that the government offered him a plea bargain or what actions his trial counsel took with regard to the alleged offer. Indeed, most of the evidence in the record (such as the transcript from his two-day trial) goes to Bedgood\u2019s guilt or innocence, and the record does not contain information necessary to determine if either or both of the <em>Strickland </em>prongs were satisfied. <em>See Massaro, </em>538 U.S. at 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690. We therefore decline to address whether Bedgood\u2019s counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-13\">. By citing to <em>Alleyne </em>by name and arguing that the facts at issue could not be found by the court at sentencing because they should have been presented to a jury, Bedgood properly preserved his constitutional objection at the sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. McKinley, </em>732 F.3d 1291, 1295 (11th Cir. 2013) (holding that to preserve a claim of <em>Alleyne </em>error, a defendant must make a timely constitutional objection).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
