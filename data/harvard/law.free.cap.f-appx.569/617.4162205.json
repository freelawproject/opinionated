GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b640-15\">Little but grief has come of the loan Michael Van De Weghe gave his girlfriend. After the relationship\u2019s end, he had to turn to small claims court to get his money back. Making matters worse, he discovered during the litigation that his ex-girlfriend had erased the word \u201cloan\u201d from the memo line of the checks he\u2019d written her. Finding this dishonesty more than he could bear, he made certain to rewrite the word on the checks before entering them in evidence. In the end, the small claims court sided with Mr. Van De Weghe, but that hardly proved the end of his troubles. Soon enough his ex-girlfriend answered by filing a police complaint alleging that he misled the small claims court by altering evidence. And soon after that investigating officers and prosecutors brought criminal charges against him. To be sure, the charges were dropped eventually\u2014after Mr. Van De Weghe\u2019s ex-girlfriend effectively admitted that she was the one who tampered with the evidence first. But Mr. Van De Weghe wants compensation for the trouble visited on him while those charges were pending. He seeks compensation, though, not from the troublesome ex-girlfriend but from the police officers and prosecutors who were taken in by her. This much the district court held it could not provide in light of the immunities the officers and prosecutors enjoy as a matter of law. And after careful review we are unable to say the court erred in holding as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-16\">Before us Mr. Van De Weghe asserts that officers Gregory Howden and Jason Walter and Deputy District Attorney Jay Williford maliciously pursued the ease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>against him. And he rightly notes that police officers and prosecutors who maliciously pursue charges without probable cause may indeed be liable under the federal constitution and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 to the innocents they injure. <em>See, e.g., Wilkins v. DeReyes, </em>528 F.3d 790, 799 (10th Cir.2008); <em>Pierce v. Gilchrist, </em>359 F.3d 1279, 1294-96 (10th Cir.2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">But to' this the defendants reply that under the doctrine of qualified immunity they are presumptively immune from lawsuits seeking damages for actions they took doing their jobs on behalf of the state. To overcome this presumption, they stress, Mr. Van De Weghe bears the burden of showing not only that (1) the defendants violated his constitutional rights but also that (2) the rights in question were clearly established at the time of the alleged violation. <em>Kerns v. Bader, </em>663 F.3d 1173, 1180 (10th Cir.2011); <em>see also Wood v. Moss, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2056, 2066-67, 188 L.Ed.2d 1039 (2014); <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). And, the defendants contend, Mr. Van De Weghe has failed to carry these dual burdens.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">With this much, we are constrained to agree. Mr. Van De Weghe\u2019s own complaint admits facts showing that the defendants <em>had </em>probable cause to pursue at least one charge against him\u2014tampering with evidence. To be sure, nothing compelled the defendants to bring the charge against Mr. Van De Weghe and many of the facts that emerged surely supported the defendants\u2019 discretionary decision to drop the charge. But it is also beyond question that, even in light of all the facts presented by Mr. Van De Weghe\u2019s complaint, the defendants possessed probable cause to pursue an evidence tampering charge at every point in the proceedings\u2014 and thus cannot be said to have engaged in malicious prosecution. In Colorado, after all, a person commits the crime of evidence tampering if, \u201cbelieving that an official proceeding is pending or about to be instituted and acting without legal right or authority, he ... [kjnowingly ... offers any false or altered physical evidence with intent that it be introduced in the pending or prospective official proceeding.\u201d Colo. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-8-610. Meanwhile, Mr. Van De Weghe\u2019s own complaint concedes that he \u201centered the cancelled checks into evidence after he restored the word \u2018loan\u2019 on the memo lines.\u201d Aplt.App. at 10. So it is that Mr. Van De Weghe all but agrees he knowingly offered altered physical evidence with the requisite intent and beliefs. He identifies no authority, moreover, suggesting his ex-girlfriend\u2019s alteration of the checks gave him \u201clegal right or authority\u201d to alter them once more. Rarely, after all, do two wrongs make a right in life or the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">Still, even if the officers and prosecutor had probable cause for thinking him guilty of evidence tampering, Mr. Van De Weghe insists they didn\u2019t have probable cause to believe he\u2019d committed some of the other crimes he was charged with\u2014including theft and perjury. But even if we assume this is just as Mr. Van De Weghe alleges, he still faces a problem. He still has not identified any clearly established law suggesting that a claim for malicious prosecution lies when one charge is supported by probable cause but other simultaneous charges arising from the same set of facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>are not. Put differently, he hasn\u2019t borne his burden of demonstrating that the law is clear that an individual may pursue a claim for malicious prosecution when at least <em>some </em>of the charges against him <em>were </em>supported by probable cause. The failure to carry that burden is fatal to his claim. <em>See, e.g., Derda v. City of Brighton, </em>53 F.3d 1162, 1164 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Though this court bears no obligation to conjure arguments for the parties, as it happens our own research has turned up little that might\u2019ve helped Mr. Van De Weghe carry his burden anyway. The Third Circuit has expressly held that probable cause to pursue one charge \u201cpreclude[s] the plaintiff from proceeding with [a] malicious prosecution claim with respect to any\u201d other charge brought simultaneously against her and arising from the same set of facts. <em>Kossler v. Crisanti, </em>564 F.3d 181, 193-94 &amp; n. 8 (3d Cir.2009) (en banc); <em>see also Ruff v. Eckerds Drugs, Inc., </em>265 S.C. 563, 220 S.E.2d 649, 651 (S1975) (\u201c[A]n action for malicious prosecution should not be available, where, as here, both charges arise out of the same set of circumstances.\u201d). True, at least two other circuits disagree, reasoning that \u201cwhen it comes to prosecution, the number and nature of the charges matters\u201d\u2014extra charges may impose extra costs and each may be attacked separately. <em>Holmes v. Vill. of Hoffman Estates, </em>511 F.3d 673, 682 (7th Cir.2007); <em>accord Posr v. Doherty, </em>944 F.2d 91, 100 (2d Cir.1991). But this court hasn\u2019t definitively spoken to the question either way. We have case law suggesting that a malicious prosecution claim arises when \u201cthere was no probable cause to support the ... prosecution,\u201d a formulation that at least arguably leans the Third Circuit\u2019s way. <em>Novitsky v. City of Aurora, </em>491 F.3d 1244, 1258 (10th Cir. 2007) (emphasis added). But in an unpublished decision we seem to have assumed something closer to the Second and Seventh Circuit\u2019s view, though without acknowledging or considering the split of authority. <em>See Miller v. Spiers, </em>339 Fed.Appx. 862, 867-68 (10th Cir.2009). In these circumstances\u2014without a binding opinion from the Supreme Court, with uncertain signals in this court, and with other courts unmistakably divided\u2014it becomes difficult to conjure how Mr. Van De Weghe might have cleared the \u201cclearly established law\u201d hurdle even if he had tried. <em>See, e.g., Wilson v. Layne, </em>526 U.S. 603, 618, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999) (\u201cIf judges thus disagree on a constitutional question, it is unfair to subject police to money damages for picking the losing side of the controversy.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">That leaves us with Mr. Van De Weghe\u2019s separate claim against Carol Chambers in her official capacity as District Attorney for Colorado\u2019s 18th Judicial District. According to Mr. Van De Weghe, Ms. Chambers \u201cknowingly established a policy that encouraged prosecutorial misconduct ... by paying a cash bounty in exchange for felony convictions without regard to how the convictions are obtained.\u201d Aplt.App. at 25. The district court dismissed this claim after determining that Ms. Chambers, in her role as District Attorney, qualified as an \u201carm of the state\u201d of Colorado entitled to sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment as it has been interpreted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>the Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>528 U.S. 62, 72-73, 120 S.Ct. 631, 145 L.Ed.2d 522 (2000); <em>Elwell v. Oklahoma ex rel. Bd. of Regents, </em>693 F.3d 1303, 1310 (10th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">We can find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion on this score either. In fact, its conclusion was compelled by this court\u2019s precedent. In <em>Rozek v. Topolnicki, </em>this court held unequivocally that Ms. Chambers\u2019s very office\u2014District Attorney for Colorado\u2019s 18th Judicial <em>District\u2014does </em>share in the state\u2019s sovereign immunity. 865 F.2d 1154, 1158 (10th Cir.1989). We reached that eqnclusion because, among other things, the 18th Judicial District encompasses multiple Colorado counties and because the Colorado Supreme Court has described the District Attorney as \u201can executive officer of the state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Beacom v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>657 P.2d 440, 445 (Colo.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Mr. Van De Weghe acknowledges our holding in <em>Rozek </em>but argues it no longer represents good law. He notes that whether an entity is entitled to state sovereign immunity turns, \u201cin large part, upon our analysis of the nature of the entity created by state law.\u201d <em>Steadfast Ins. Co. v. Agric. Ins. Co., </em>507 F.3d 1250, 1253 (10th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Arms of the state itself generally receive immunity; political subdivisions, including (paradigmatically) cities, usually do not. <em>Id. </em>Since <em>Rozek, </em>Mr. Van De Weghe says, the Colorado Supreme Court has clarified in <em>Davidson v. Sandstrom </em>that the office of District Attorney is a political subdivision under state law, not an instrumentality of the State\u2019s Executive. <em>See </em>83 P.3d 648, 656 (Colo. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The trouble is <em>Davidson </em>held no such thing. The decision held only that the state\u2019s <em>judicial districts </em>(not District Attorneys assigned to them) are political subdivisions of the state. <em>Id. </em>(\u2018We therefore hold that the plain meaning of \u2018any other political subdivision\u2019 in [Colo. Const. art. XVIII, \u00a7 11(1) ] encompasses <em>judicial districts.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Admittedly, on the way to this holding the court did say <em>District Attorneys </em>bear <em>one </em>\u201ccharacteristic of a political subdivision\u2014political control by some community other than the state as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But the court didn\u2019t question the many of its other decisions uniformly describing a Colorado District Attorney as a \u201cstate public officer\u201d who \u201cbelongs to the executive branch.\u201d <em>Tisdel v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>621 P.2d 1357, 1361 (Colo.1980); <em>People ex rel. VanMeveren v. Dist. Court, </em>186 Colo. 335, 527 P.2d 50, 52 (1974); <em>see also, e.g., Free Speech Def. Comm. v. Thomas, </em>80 P.3d 935, 937 (Colo.Ct.App.2003); <em>Anderson v. Cnty. of Adams, </em>41 Colo.App. 441, 592 P.2d 3, 4 (1978). Neither did the court question Colorado statutes expressly providing that District Attorneys appear on \u201cbehalf of the state\u201d and may appear in court outside their particular districts \u201con behalf of\u2019 and \u201crepresenting] the people of the state of Colorado\u201d as a whole. Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 20-1-102(1), (3). In fact, the court favorably quoted a passage from an earlier Colorado Supreme Court case holding squarely that \u201c[t]he district attorney is an executive officer of the state.\u201d <em>Davidson, </em>83 P.3d at 655 (quoting <em>Beacom, </em>657 P.2d at 445). Given all these features of the decision, we simply cannot say that <em>Davidson </em>meant to throw Rozek\u2019s analysis or conclusion overboard. <em>See Bragg v. Office of the Dist. Attorney, </em>704 F.Supp.2d 1032, 1064-67 (D.Colo.2009) (a thoughtful opinion by a district court colleague reaching same conclusion we have about <em>Davidson </em>).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>That Mr. Van De Weghe has been through a lot of trouble, if perhaps some of his own creation, we do not doubt. But neither can we say\u2014as we must for him to prevail\u2014that he has clearly overcome the immunities granted by law to officers and prosecutors charged with the often tricky job of sorting through conflicting evidence, choosing charges, and protecting the integrity of the legal process. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b640-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

Although Mr. Van De Weghe\u2019s complaint nominally raises a false arrest claim in addition to a malicious prosecution claim, he devotes all his appellate briefing to the latter and we accordingly treat the false arrest claim as waived. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Patterson, </em>713 F.3d 1237, 1250 (10th Cir. 2013) (\"By failing to develop any argument on this claim at this court, [the appellant] has waived the claim.\u201d (emphasis omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-5\">. Having held Mr. Williford, the prosecutor, entitled to qualified immunity, we have no need to reach his alternative argument that he is entitled to absolute immunity as \"a state prosecuting attorney who acted within the scope of his duties in initiating and pursuing a criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Kalina v. Fletcher, </em>522 U.S. 118, 124, 118 S.Ct. 502, 139 L.Ed.2d 471 (1997) (quoting <em>Imbler v.
