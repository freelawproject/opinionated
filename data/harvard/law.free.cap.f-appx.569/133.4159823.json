Cons. Stat. \u00a7 101 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cAct 6\u201d), and for tortious interference. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The Hammills owned a home in North East, Pennsylvania. Bank of America was the servicer on their mortgage. When the Hammills defaulted on their mortgage, Bank of America sent them a pre-foreclosure notice. The notice advised the Ham-mills that they could cure their default and avoid foreclosure by mailing to a law firm in Philadelphia the overdue amount (about $12,500) by cashier\u2019s check, certified check, or money order. When the Hammills failed to cure the default, Bank of America filed a foreclosure action in state court in Pennsylvania. Within seven months of filing the foreclosure action, Bank of America voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Soon after the dismissal, the Hammills filed this putative class action lawsuit. They alleged that Bank of America violated Act 6 and tortiously interfered with their mortgage contract by failing to notify them that they could cure their default by cash payment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the Ham-mills, before filing a foreclosure action, \u00a7\u00a7 403 and 404(b)(1) of Act 6 require lenders to issue a \u201cNotice of Intention to Foreclose\u201d that explains to borrowers that they may cure default by tendering all amounts due \u201cin the form of <em>cash, </em>cashier\u2019s check or certified check.\u201d 41 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 404(b)(1) (emphasis added). Because Bank of America failed to notify buyers that they could cure default by a cash payment, its foreclosure action was allegedly prohibited by Act 6. Of significance to this appeal, the Hammills did not allege they could have cured their default by making a cash payment. The only damages claimed by them were the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs they incurred in defending the \u201cillegal\u201d foreclosure action in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">The District Court granted Bank of America\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. It held that the Hammills\u2019 Act 6 claim failed because they did not plead legally cognizable damages under the Act. The District Court also noted, when determining whether to grant the Hammills leave to amend their complaint, that they \u201cfailed to allege that there was a causal connection between the purported defect in [Bank of America\u2019s] pre-foreclosure notice and their payment of attorney\u2019s fees to defend against the foreclosure action.\u201d <em>Hammill v. Bank of America, N.A., </em>2013 WL 4648317, at *6 (W.D.Pa. Aug.29, 2013). The Hammills timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\u201cOur review of a motion to dismiss is plenary.\u201d <em>Nuveen Mun. Trust ex rel. Nuveen High Yield Mun. Bond Fund v. WithumSmith Brown, P.C., </em>692 F.3d 283, 293 (3d Cir.2012). \u201cWe \u2018accept as true all well-pled factual allegations in the complaint- and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them, and we affirm the order of dismissal only if the pleading does not plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Fellner v. Tri-Union Seafoods, L.L.C., </em>539 F.3d 237, 242 (3d Cir.2008)). \u201cThe plausibility standard is not akin to a \u2018probability requirement,\u2019 but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). Factual allegations need only \u201craise a right to relief above the speculative level,\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, though we \u201care not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.\u201d <em>Papasan v. Allain, </em>478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S.Ct. 2932, 92 L.Ed.2d 209 (1986). \u201c[W]e can affirm on any basis appearing in the record.\u201d <em>Curay-Cramer v. Ursuline Acad. of Wilmington, Del, Inc., </em>450 F.3d 130, 133 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">On appeal, the opening brief of the Hammills focuses exclusively on challenging the District Court\u2019s conclusion that they failed to plead damages. While we make no determination as to the correctness of that conclusion by the Court, we affirm for the independent reason that the Hammills failed to allege there was a causal connection between Bank of America\u2019s failure to disclose that they could cure their default by cash payment and any injury or damages they suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Section 504 of Act 6 provides that \u201c[a]ny person affected by a violation of the act shall have the substantive right to bring an action ... for damages by reason of such ... violation ...\u201d 41 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 504. Under its plain language, the Hammills may only bring suit if Bank of America\u2019s violation of the Act actually caused some injury. <em>Cf. In re Smith, </em>866 F.2d 576 (3d Cir.1989) (finding a private right of action where lender sent notice of foreclosure to incorrect address in violation of Act 6 and the borrower, on learning of the foreclosure action, immediately attempted to cure the default). In their complaint, the Ham-mills allege no connection between Bank of America\u2019s violation of Act 6 and their damages. Specifically, they do not allege that, had they been informed that they could cure their default by a cash payment, they would have done so, thereby preventing a foreclosure action and the associated attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Given the Hammills\u2019 failure to plead a sufficient causal connection, their Act 6 claim was properly dismissed. Their tortious interference claim (based on Bank of America\u2019s sending an \u201cillegal\u201d pre-foreclosure notice in violation of the Hammills\u2019 contract with the holder of their mortgage) similarly fails to allege that the technical defect in the pre-foreclosure notice was causally related to the Hammills\u2019 alleged damages in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-11\">. The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b156-14\">. The Hammills also alleged violations of the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency Law, 35 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 1680.403c, but do not appeal dismissal of that claim. They similarly do not appeal the dismissal of their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
