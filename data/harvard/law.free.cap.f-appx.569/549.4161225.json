Mr. Shagoury has also filed a motion to proceed <em>informa pauper-is </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) on appeal and a document styled as a \u201cmotion to restrain the Appellee and/or persons working with the Appellee, from harming the Appellant and/or his family, physically, psychologically, financially, judicially, accidentally or mysteriously and/or any other form of harm\u201d (henceforth, \u201cmotion to restrain\u201d). For the reasons that follow, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed and the two pending motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">On January 9, 2014, Mr. Shagoury filed a one-page complaint in the District of New Mexico. The complaint was captioned <em>\u201cRobert Michael Shagoury v. The United States of America (Drug Enforcement Administration) (Michele M. Leon-hart).\u201d </em>R. at 3 (Compl., filed Jan. 9, 2014). Mr. Shagoury alleged in the complaint that the United States was trying to kill and injure him.' With his complaint, Mr. Shagoury filed an application to proceed IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The district court screened the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. In so doing, the district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The district court reasoned that the complaint was \u201ccompletely devoid of factual allegations\u201d and contained no averments \u201cshowing waiver of the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18 (Mem. Op. &amp; Order, filed Feb. 4, 2014). In the signature block .of the district court order, a magistrate judge signed her name in pen, indicating that she was signing \u201cfor\u201d a district court judge, whose name was type-written below. <em>Id. </em>at 19. The \u201cfinal order\u201d that later issued included the same notations. According to the district court docket, the order was \u201cby\u201d the district judge and was \u201centered at his direction by\u201d the magistrate. Mr. Shagoury filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">The discussion will proceed in three parts. First, we will explain why we have jurisdiction over the appeal. Second, we will discuss why the district court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed. Third, we will address the two pending motions and conclude that both must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">Although no party challenges our jurisdiction, we must sua sponte assure ourselves that we have the power to decide the appeal, if a \u201cpotential jurisdictional problem\u201d is present in the case. <em>Smith v. Rail Link, Inc., </em>697 F.3d 1304, 1312-13 (10th Cir.2012). As noted above, the order and final order in the district court dismissing the complaint were signed by a magistrate at the direction of a district court judge who did not himself sign the orders. Unless the parties consent, a magistrate judge may not issue a final, appealable order on behalf of the district court. <em>See Phillips v. Beierwaltes, </em>466 F.3d 1217, 1221-22 (10th Cir.2006); <em>Andrews v. Town of Skiatook, </em>123 F.3d 1327, 1328 n. 2 (10th Cir.1997). There is no indication that the parties<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> consented to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>magistrate judge\u2019s jurisdiction in this case. Therefore, we only have jurisdiction over the appeal if we can properly conclude that the district court judge rendered the decision to dismiss, even though the magistrate judge signed the orders on his behalf. We can do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Unlike the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure contain no requirement that district court judges sign judgments. <em>Compare </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(k)(1) (\u201cThe judge must sign the judgment, and the clerk must enter it.\u201d), <em>with </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(b)(1)(C) (\u201c[Ujnless the court orders otherwise, the clerk must, without awaiting the court\u2019s direction, promptly prepare, sign, and enter the judgment when ... the court denies all relief.\u201d), <em>and </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54 (setting forth the requirements for judgments in civil matters and not mentioning a signature by the district court judge). We held in 1939 that in civil cases \u201cit is not necessary for the court to sign a formal written judgment.\u201d <em>W. Union Tel. Co. v. Dismang, </em>106 F.2d 362, 363 (10th Cir. 1939). While <em>Dismang </em>obviously interpreted a much older version of the Rules, they have not changed in this regard and we have never overruled the opinion. Accordingly, even though the better practice is surely for a district court judge to sign his or her own orders, we do have jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Mr. Shagoury presents only two intelligible arguments that are responsive to the district court\u2019s sovereign-immunity analysis. Neither is availing.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">First, Mr. Shagoury suggests that the district court\u2019s sovereign-immunity analysis was erroneous because the named defendants \u201cused persons working with them and/or contracted persons to poison the Appellant.\u201d Aplt. Opening. Br. at 1. He offers no authority for this proposition, and no explanation beyond this bare sentence. As a result, the argument is inadequately presented to warrant reversal. <em>See United States v. Williamson, </em>746 F.3d 987, 993 (10th Cir.2014) (\u201c[W]e routinely have declined to consider arguments that are not raised, or are inadequately presented, in an appellant\u2019s opening brief.\u201d (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also James v. Wadas, </em>724 F.3d 1312, 1315 (10th Cir.2013) (\u201cBecause [the plaintiff] is pro se, we liberally construe his filings, but we will not act as his advocate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Second, Mr. Shagoury contends that under Supreme Court precedent \u201cCongress may organize \u2018sue and be sued\u2019 agencies\u201d and \u201csuch [an] agenc[y] may be sued in any Court of otherwise competent jurisdiction as if it were a private litigant as long as the agency is to pay out the judgment from its own budget, not from the U.S. Treasury.\u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 2. Mr. Shagoury did not articulate this theory to the district court and does not argue plain error on appeal. The theory is therefore forfeited. <em>See United States v. MacKay, </em>715 F.3d 807, 831 (10th Cir.2013) (\u201cIn this Circuit, the failure to argue for plain error and its application on appeal ... surely marks the end of the road for an argument for reversal not first presented to the district court.\u201d (omission in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1275, 188 L.Ed.2d 297 (2014); <em>cf. Rural Water Sewer &amp; Solid Waste Mgmt., Dist. No. 1 v. City of Guthrie, </em>654 F.3d 1058, 1068 (10th Cir.2011) (noting that sovereign immunity is jurisdictional); <em>McDonald-Cuba v. Santa Fe Protective Sens., Inc., </em>644 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>1096, 1102 (10th Cir.2011) (requiring plaintiffs to plead sufficient facts to establish jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Apart from the forfeiture, the authority Mr. Shagoury relies on for this <em>point\u2014Federal Housing Administration v. Burr, </em>309 U.S. 242, 60 S.Ct. 488, 84 L.Ed. 724 (1940)\u2014is unavailing. As it applies here, that case only stands for the proposition that the federal government <em>can </em>waive its sovereign immunity by subjecting its agencies to suit. <em>See Boehme v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>343 F.3d 1260, 1263 (10th Cir.2003) (discussing Burr); <em>accord FDIC v. Hulsey, </em>22 F.3d 1472, 1480 (10th Cir.1994). The only agency named by Mr. Shagoury was the Drug Enforcement Administration and Mr. Shagoury offers no reason to suppose that the federal government has waived the sovereign immunity that would otherwise attach to this agency. <em>Cf. Sarit v. DEA, </em>987 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir.1993) (finding no jurisdiction over a suit against the Drug Enforcement Administration because sovereign immunity had not been waived). As a consequence, he is not entitled to reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Mr. Shagoury has filed a motion to proceed IFP on appeal. As demonstrated above, he has no \u201creasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts,\u201d <em>Lister v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>408 F.3d 1309, 1312 (10th Cir.2005), and his motion to proceed IFP is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Mr. Shagoury\u2019s \u201cmotion to restrain,\u201d filed April 11, 2014, reiterates various allegations regarding the harm that the defendants are supposedly inflicting on him. In view of our affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment, the \u201cmotion to restrain\u201d is denied as moot. <em>Cf. Holt v. McBride, </em>539 Fed.Appx. 863, 866 (10th Cir.2013) (\u201cThe judgment of the district court is affirmed. [The plaintiffs] motion for injunction pending appeal is denied as moot.\u201d); <em>Doyle v. Archuleta, </em>370 Fed.Appx. 934, 937 (10th Cir.2010) (dismissing an appeal and denying a motion for an injunction as moot).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">For the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment, DENY Mr. Shagoury\u2019s request to proceed IFP, and DENY Mr. Shagoury\u2019s \u201cmotion to restrain.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b572-14\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-29\">This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>sive value consistent with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and Tenth Circuit Rule 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\">. Because Mr. Shagoury is proceeding pro se, we construe his filings liberally. <em>See Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam); <em>Garza v. Davis, </em>596 F.3d 1198, 1201 n. 2 (10th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-17\">. A summons was issued to the United States but the complaint was dismissed before it was returned. The United States therefore did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>appear in the district court, nor has it appeared here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
