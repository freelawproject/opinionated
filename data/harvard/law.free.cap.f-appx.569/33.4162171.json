He was sentenced principally to 60 months imprisonment by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Stein, <em>J.). </em>Flores now appeals from his July 31, 2013 judgment of conviction, entered on August 1, 2013. On appeal, he asserts that the district court erred in determining that burglary in the third degree under New York law, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 140.20, constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under Section 4B1.2(a)(2) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-21\">The argument Flores advances is foreclosed by our precedent. In <em>United, States v. Brown, </em>we concluded that a conviction for \u201cthird-degree burglary in violation of New York law was a crime of violence within the meaning of the last clause of [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).\u201d 514 F.3d 256, 269 (2d Cir.2008). The upshot for the defendant in <em>Brown </em>was that \u201chis record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>included two crimes of violence, making his base offense level 24.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The same result obtains here.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Flores recognizes our holding in <em>Brown, </em>but suggests that a trio of recent Supreme Court decisions have undermined our reasoning in that decision. We are not persuaded. Flores first points us to <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and to <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009). It is true that both <em>Begay </em>and <em>Chambers </em>interpreted the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), to require analysis of the risk posed by crimes which putatively fell under ACCAs residual clause, compared to the risk posed by enumerated crimes. <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 141-45, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (risk posed by driving under the influence is not comparable to risk posed by enumerated offenses of burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes involving explosives); <em>Chambers, </em>555 U.S. at 127-29, 129 S.Ct. 687 (failure to report for periodic imprisonment does not pose comparable risk as enumerated offenses). We relied on the parallel natures of the residual clauses of ACCA and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) in reaching our conclusion in <em>Brown. </em>514 F.3d at 266-68. But it does not follow that the reasoning of <em>Begay </em>and <em>Chambers, </em>which required a comparison between the potential risks of enumerated offenses and putative similar offenses falling under the residual clause, has cast doubt upon our approach in <em>Brown. </em>If anything, these cases have arguably strengthened it (as the government argues) because our conclusion in <em>Brown </em>was based on our determination that \u201cthird-degree \u2018burglary itself is a crime that inherently involves a risk of personal injury.\u2019\u201d 514 F.3d at 268 (quoting <em>United States v. Andrello, </em>9 F.3d 247, 249 (2d Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Nor are we persuaded that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), has undermined <em>Brown. </em>Flores correctly points out that <em>Descamps </em>concerned the appropriate reach of the \u201ccategorical\u201d approach to determining whether a state law crime might serve as an enumerated ACCA predicate. 133 S.Ct. at 2283-86. But <em>Brown </em>applied the categorical approach to New York\u2019s third-degree burglary statute. <em>Brown, </em>514 F.3d at 265. Flores apparently takes no issue with <em>Brown\u2019s </em>application of the categorical approach, and we thus fail to appreciate how, exactly, Flores believes <em>Brown </em>was undermined by <em>Descamps.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">We are \u201cbound by the decision of a prior panel unless the decision has been overturned either by the Supreme Court or this Court en banc.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>628 F.3d 64, 69 (2d Cir.2010). Finding no merit in Flores\u2019s argument that our holding in <em>Brown </em>has been disturbed (and cognizant that this Court has not revisited <em>Brown </em>en banc), we cannot find that the district court committed procedural error in determining Flores\u2019s baseline sentence under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">We have examined the remainder of Flores\u2019s arguments, and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
