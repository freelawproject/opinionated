We pretermit the question of whether the appeal waiver bars the instant appeal because Teets\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s ruling fails. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-22\">Teets contends that the district court denied the Government\u2019s motion pursuant to Rule 35(b)(2)(B) or (C) and argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the district court erred by requiring the Government to prove or allege when the information he provided became useful. Teets\u2019s argument rests on a faulty premise. The Government filed the motion within one year of the oral pronouncement of sentence. Therefore, the only applicable provision of Rule 35(b) was subsection (1). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The Government\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and Rule 35(b) motions relied on the same substantial assistance. The district court had already taken this substantial assistance into account when it granted the Government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Thus, the district court appropriately required the Government to show that Teets had offered additional substantial assistance to warrant a further sentence reduction. The Government failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b248-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
