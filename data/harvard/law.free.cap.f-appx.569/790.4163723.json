Brewster, who was convicted of use and possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime as well as conspiracy and attempt to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, contends that because he was sentenced based on 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base his Guidelines range was lowered by Amendment 750, which revised the crack cocaine quantity tables to conform to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750. We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-19\">At Brewster\u2019s sentencing, the court adopted all factual statements found in Brewster\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (PSR), including a statement attributing 4 kilograms of crack cocaine to the conspiracy, and gave Brewster a base offense level of 36. The court\u2019s finding as to the amount of crack Brewster was responsible for is not reviewable in a \u00a7 3582(c) resentencing. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (noting that, in a \u00a7 3582(c) resentencing, district courts \u201cmust maintain all original sentencing determinations apart from the original Guidelines range\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-20\">After Amendment 750, a defendant who is responsible for 2.8 to 8.4 kilograms of crack cocaine, receives a base offense level of 36\u2014the same base offense level Brewster, whose conspiracy involved 4 kilograms of crack, originally received. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2). Because the amendment does not impact the applicable Guidelines range, the district court correctly denied Brewster\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (noting that a \u00a7 3582(c) reduction is not authorized unless an amendment lowers a defendant\u2019s guideline range).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
