His counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-25\">Having carefully reviewed the record in accordance with our duty under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no basis for a nonfrivolous challenge to the conviction in this direct criminal appeal, and we also conclude that the sentence is not unreasonable, <em>see United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc) (appellate review of sentencing decision). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-26\">As for counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, we conclude that allowing counsel to withdraw at this time would not be consistent with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s 1994 Amendment to Part V of the Plan to Implement the Criminal Justice Act of 1964. We therefore deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as premature, without prejudice to counsel refiling the motion upon fulfilling the duties set forth in the Amendment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-21\">. The Honorable Gary A. Fenner, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
