Warner appeals pro se from an order of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsyl-</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">vania dismissing his complaint. Because the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-15\">In September 2012, Warner filed a complaint in the District Court against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, the Honorable Judge James J. Panchi k, and prosecutor Scott J. A ndreassi.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He asserted that, following a 2009 conviction for driving under the influence (\u201cDUI\u201d), the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation required him to install an ignition interlock device in his car, even though the terms of his plea agreement and sentence did not specify that he would have to use such a device. He argued that the plea agreement should be treated as a legally binding contract, and he sought the restoration of unrestricted driving privileges as well as monetary damages for \u201cmental anguish, loss of work and inconvenience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-16\">Three of the four defendants filed motions to dismiss, asserting immunity from suit, among other affirmative defenses. The District Court determined that all four of the defendants were immune from suit, and it dismissed Warner\u2019s complaint with prejudice. Warner appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-18\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>of Warner\u2019s complaint. <em>See Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999). We may affirm a judgment of the District Court on any basis supported by the record, <em>see Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 247 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam), and we may take summary action if an appeal does not present a substantial question, <em>see </em>3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6,</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The complaint must contain \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant[s are] liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955). A federal court may properly dismiss an action sua sponte under the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if \u201cthe action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d <em>Ball v. Famiglio, </em>726 F.3d 448, 452 (3d Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The District Court dismissed Warner\u2019s claims against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation on the basis of state sovereign immunity. The Eleventh Amendment provides a state with immunity \u201cfrom liability for damages in a suit brought in federal court by one of its own citizens.\u201d <em>Dellmuth v. Muth, </em>491 U.S. 223, 229 n. 2, 109 S.Ct. 2397, 105 L.Ed.2d 181 (1989). This immunity extends to state agencies. <em>See MCI Telecomm. Corp. v. Bell Atl. Pa., </em>271 F.3d 491, 503 (3d Cir. 2001). While states can waive their Eleventh Amendment immunity, <em>see id., </em>Pennsylvania has not done so, <em>see </em>42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 8521(b). Moreover, Congress did not abrogate Pennsylvania\u2019s sovereign immunity through the enactment of \u00a7 1983. <em>See Quern v. Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 345, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979). Accordingly, the District Court properly determined that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation were immune from Warner\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The District Court then relied on the doctrine of absolute judicial immunity to dismiss Warner\u2019s claim against Panchik. \u201cA judicial officer in the performance of his duties has absolute immunity from suit and will not be liable for his judicial acts.\u201d <em>Azubuko v. Royal, </em>443 F.3d 302, 303 (3d Cir.2006) (per curiam). Warner alleged that Panchik \u201cknowingly accepted] a Plea Bargain and impose[d] a Sentence that did not include all of the penalties that would be imposed by the State of Pennsylvania.\u201d Because this claim stems solely from Panchik\u2019s role as the judge who presided over Warner\u2019s DUI prosecution, the District Court correctly determined that Panchik was entitled to absolute judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">Lastly, the District Court dismissed Warner\u2019s claim against Andreassi under the doctrine of prosecutorial immunity. A prosecutor is immune from damages under \u00a7 1983 for his initiation of a prosecution and presentation of a state\u2019s case. <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). Warner\u2019s complaint alleged that Andreassi \u201cknowingly offer[ed] a Plea Bargain that did not include all of the penalties that would be imposed by the State of Pennsylvania.\u201d Because this conduct is related solely to Andreassi\u2019s initiation and prosecution of the Commonwealth\u2019s case against Warner, Andreassi also is entitled to prosecutorial immunity. To the extent that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>District Court did not expressly state that it was sua sponte dismissing Warner\u2019s claim against Andreassi pursuant to the screening provisions of \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), we make that clear now.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Thus, for substantially the same reasons set forth by the District Court, we will summarily affirm its order dismissing with prejudice Warner\u2019s complaint. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-11\">. Although Warner did not specify that he was filing suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the District Court construed his complaint as having been brought under that statute, and we do so as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-12\">. While Warner's appeal was filed more than 30 days after the District Court\u2019s order, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), the District Court failed to comply with Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 58; <em>LeBoon v. Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Ctr. Ass'n, </em>503 F.3d 217, 224 (3d Cir.2007). Warner\u2019s appeal is therefore timely. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 58(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
