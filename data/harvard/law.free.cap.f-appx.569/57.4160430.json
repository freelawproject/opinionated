Mr. &amp; Mrs. P. v. Newington Bd. of Educ., </em>546 F.3d 111, 118 (2d Cir.2008). We also assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The IDEA provides states with funds to ensure that \u201call children with disabilities\u201d receive a FAPE. <em>Cerra v. Pawling Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>427 F.3d 186, 192 (2d Cir.2005). A state receiving these funds must then create an individualized education plan (\u201cIEP\u201d) for each qualifying student, tailored to that child\u2019s abilities and needs, <em>see </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d), which is \u201creasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits,\u201d <em>Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 207, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982). If a parent believes that her child\u2019s IEP or the school\u2019s implementation of the IEP does not comply with the IDEA, the parent may file a \u201cdue process complaint\u201d with the appropriate state agency. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(b)(6). Districts are then permitted a thirty-day \u201cresolution period\u201d to address alleged deficiencies without penalty. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B). In light of the resolution period, a parent must assert all alleged deficiencies in the due process complaint lest a claimant be permitted to \u201csandbag\u201d school districts at a later stage in the proceeding. <em>See R.E. v. N.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>694 F.3d 167, 187-88 &amp; n. 4 (2d Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2802, 186 L.Ed.2d 861 (2013). Once the resolution period has run, a parent may continue to a due process hearing before an independent hearing officer (\u201cIHO\u201d) and appeal the resulting decision to a state review officer (\u201cSRO\u201d). <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f); N.Y. Educ. Law \u00a7 4404(2). Only after the state administrative process is exhausted may either party bring a civil action in state or federal court to challenge the SRO\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)-(g), (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">On appeal, B.M. primarily asserts that E.M.\u2019s teacher\u2019s lack of special education certification denied E.M. a FAPE, and that the district court erred in determining that it lacked jurisdiction over this claim due to B.M.\u2019s failure to include the claim in her due process complaint. We have repeatedly held that the \u201c[fjailure to exhaust the [IDEA\u2019s] administrative remedies deprives the court of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Cave v. E. Meadow Union Free Sch. Dist., </em>514 F.3d 240, 245 (2d Cir.2008) (citing <em>Polera v. Bd. of Educ. of Newburgh, </em>288 F.3d 478, 483 (2d Cir.2002)). In support of her claim, B.M. argues that we must abandon this precedent in light of Supreme Court decisions clarifying the nature of jurisdictional bars. <em>See, e.g., Gonzalez v. Thaler, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 641, 648, 181 L.Ed.2d 619 (2012) (directing that courts interpret statutory requirements to be jurisdictional only where \u201cthe [legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute\u2019s scope shall count as jurisdictional,\u201d whereas if \u201cCongress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We conclude, however, that the issue need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>not be decided here. The District has challenged B.M.\u2019s failure to exhaust from its first opportunity, mooting the determination whether the exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional or operates as an affirmative (and, here, successful) defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">B.M. argues to the contrary that she raised the certification issue in her complaint, thus exhausting the claim, and that the District \u201copened the door\u201d to her claim. However, none of the nine detailed claims in B.M.\u2019s due process complaint can be interpreted to encompass special education certification, and the District\u2019s only mention of the relevant teacher\u2019s qualifications at the hearing came during foundational questions, not in support of an affirmative, substantive argument. <em>See M.H. v. N.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>685 F.3d 217, 250 (2d Cir.2012) (applying \u201copening the door\u201d exception to exhaustion when the district made an affirmative argument in its opening statement and through its first witness, and the parents countered the argument in rebuttal). B.M. also argues that the issue of teacher certification is excused from the exhaustion requirement because it concerns the \u201cimplementation\u201d of E.M.\u2019s IEP and not its content. <em>See Polera, </em>288 F.3d at 488-89. However, B.M. did not raise this argument before the district court, and it is therefore waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Finally, B.M. asserts several procedural challenges that were raised in her due process complaint. However, B.M. offers no reason to depart from the IHO\u2019s finding that these claims were \u201csubstantially resolved\u201d during the resolution period, when the District was permitted to resolve B.M.\u2019s complaint without penalty. <em>See Gagliardo v. Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>489 F.3d 105, 113 (2d Cir.2007) (instructing courts to give \u201cdue weight\u201d to state IDEA proceedings). Moreover, at oral argument, B.M. stated that the only relief she sought was a remand to the IHO for a determination whether E.M. is entitled to corrective services. Because the IHO has already determined that E.M. is not entitled to corrective services on the basis of these claims, we also deem these claims to be moot and rightly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">We have considered all of B.M.\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the District.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
