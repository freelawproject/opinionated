We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act, <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039-40 (9th Cir. 2010), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on Lin\u2019s omission from his asylum application and declaration that the police urged fellow prisoners to beat him, and that the police made visits to his home after they released him from custody. <em>See Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201cMaterial alterations in the applicant\u2019s account of persecution are sufficient to support an adverse credibility finding.\u201d). Lin\u2019s explanations for the omissions do not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See id. </em>at 974. In the absence of credible testimony, Lin\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b507-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
