We review de novo a district court\u2019s determination that a plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and for an abuse of discretion its decision whether to apply equitable tolling or estoppel. <em>Leong v. Potter, </em>347 F.3d 1117, 1121 (9th Cir.2003). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The district court properly dismissed Anoruo\u2019s Title VII action because Anoruo failed to allege facts showing that he complied with the administrative exhaustion requirement of timely contacting an Equal Employment Opportunity (\u201cEEO\u201d) counselor. <em>See Kraus v. Presidio Trust Facilities Div./Residential Mgmt. Branch, </em>572 F.3d 1039, 1043 (9th Cir.2009) (federal employee must initiate contact with an EEO counselor within forty-five days of the alleged discriminatory act, and failure to do so is \u201c \u2018fatal to a federal employee\u2019s discrimination claim\u2019 in federal court\u201d absent waiver, estoppel, or equitable tolling (citation omitted)); <em>see also Lukovsky v. City &amp; County of San Francisco, </em>535 F.3d 1044, 1049 (9th Cir.2008) (federal employment discrimination claim \u201caccrues upon awareness of the actual injury, i.e., the adverse employment action, and not when the plaintiff suspects a legal wrong\u201d). Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion by determining that Anoruo was not entitled to equitable relief. <em>See Lukovsky, </em>535 F.3d at 1051 (discussing equitable tolling and estoppel).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Anoruo\u2019s motion The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Anoruo\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint because amendment would have been futile. <em>See Hartmann v. Cal. Dep\u2019t of Corr. &amp; Rehab., </em>707 F.3d 1114, 1129-30 (9th Cir.2013) (setting forth standard of review and explaining that leave to amend may be denied if amendment would be futile); <em>see also Munoz v. Mabus, </em>630 F.3d 856, 863-64 (9th Cir.2010) (under the Tucker Act, the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over contract claims against the United States for more than $10,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">We do not consider matters not specifically and distinctly raised and argued in the opening brief, or arguments and allegations raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Padgett v. Wright, </em>587 F.3d 983, 985 n. 2 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Anoruo\u2019s motion to consolidate, filed on December 10, 2012, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
