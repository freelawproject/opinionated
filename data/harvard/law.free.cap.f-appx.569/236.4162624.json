Schield, formerly Texas prisoner # 1717742, was serving a 10-year sentence following his 2011 conviction of possession of at least 400 grams of tetrahydrocannabinol and possession of marijuana weighing between 50 and 2000 pounds. Schield filed the instant 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint alleging that the defendants violated his Fourth Amendment rights in 2009 when they conducted an illegal search and seizure on his property, which resulted in the discovery of the aforementioned drugs and ultimately led to his 2011 conviction. He further alleged that the defendants committed perjury during the 2011 trial when they testified falsely regarding the circumstances of the search and seizure. Schield now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous or for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-20\">Because the district court dismissed Schield\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous or for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915A and \u00a7 1915(e)(2), this court\u2019s review is de novo under the same standard that is used to review a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-21\">To the extent that Schield\u2019s claims for damages imply the invalidity of Schield\u2019s conviction, they are barred by the doctrine of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>extent that Schield\u2019s claims are not barred by <em>Heck, </em>he has not demonstrated that the district court erred by dismissing the claims as time barred. <em>See Stanley v. Foster, </em>464 F.3d 565, 568 (5th Cir.2006). As Schield\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
