We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Knievel v. ESPN, </em>393 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir.2005). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The district court properly dismissed Langston\u2019s claims for damages against Judge Orr in his official capacity as barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Flint v. Dennison, </em>488 F.3d 816, 824-25 (9th Cir. 2007) (state officials sued for damages in their official capacities are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The district court properly dismissed Langston\u2019s claims against Judge Orr in his individual capacity on the basis of judicial immunity because Langston failed to allege facts showing that Judge Orr took nonjudicial actions against him, or that Judge Orr\u2019s judicial actions were taken in complete absence of all jurisdiction. <em>See Meek v. County of Riverside, </em>183 F.3d 962, 965 (9th Cir.1999) (explaining that \u201c[a] judge is not deprived of immunity because he takes actions which are in error ... or are in excess of his authority!,]\u201d and setting forth the two exceptions to judicial immunity); <em>Ashelman v. Pope, </em>793 F.2d 1072, 1075-76, 1078 (9th Cir.1986) (setting forth the factors to consider when determining whether a given action is judicial in nature and concluding that judicial immunity is a defense so long as \u201cthe judge\u2019s ultimate acts are judicial actions taken within the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Langston\u2019s reliance on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10 and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b510-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
