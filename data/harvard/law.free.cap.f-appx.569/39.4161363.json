We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u201cA \u00a7 1988 claim for false arrest, resting on the Fourth Amendment right of an individual to be free from unreasonable seizures, including arrest without probable cause, is substantially the same as a claim for false arrest under New York law.\u201d <em>Weyant v. Okst, </em>101 F.3d 845, 852 (2d Cir.1996) (internal citation omitted). Under New York law, a plaintiff asserting a false arrest claim must prove that \u201c(1) the defendant intended to confine the plaintiff, (2) the plaintiff was conscious of the confinement, (3) the plaintiff did not consent to the confinement and (4) the confinement was not otherwise privileged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 853 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). \u201cThe existence of probable cause to arrest constitutes justification and is a complete defense to an action for false arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 852 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u201cAn officer has probable cause to arrest when in possession of facts sufficient to warrant a prudent person to believe that the suspect had committed or was committing an offense.\u201d <em>Ricciuti v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., </em>124 F.3d 123, 128 (2d Cir.1997). This standard is objective and encompasses \u201cthe totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Patrick, </em>899 F.2d 169, 171 (2d Cir.1990). We \u201cmust consider those facts available to the officer at the time of the arrest and immediately before it.\u201d <em>Lowth v. Town of Cheektowaga, </em>82 F.3d 563, 569 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Zaniewska argues that the district court erred in finding the record presented no material question of fact because New York\u2019s trespassing statute contains a knowledge requirement, and that there is at least a \u201cdispute as to whether Zaniewska had the requisite knowledge in order to be capable of violating the statute.\u201d Under New York law, \u201c[a] person is guilty of trespass when he knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in or upon premises.\u201d N.Y. Penal L. \u00a7 140.05. The district court correctly concluded the police had probable cause to arrest Zaniewska for trespass. The police were familiar with the premises, which were the subject of previous police investigations that revealed that 555 Union Street was condemned and boarded up, that 557 Union Street was abandoned, and neither building was occupied by tenants. The status of the premises as abandoned properties inhabited by squatters was discussed at meetings attended by officers involved in Zaniewska\u2019s arrest. The 911 call reported that people were breaking into 555 Union Street with hammers and crow bars. When police arrived at the premises on the night of the arrest, the shared wall between the two buildings had a hole cut through it. The undisputed evidence supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that based on the information available to the police, there is no genuine dispute that the police reasonably believed that all of the partygoers at 555 and 557 Union Street were trespassing, and had probable cause to arrest plaintiff for trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">We have examined the remainder of Zaniewska\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the order of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
