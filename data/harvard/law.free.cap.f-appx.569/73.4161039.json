We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we review the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Mendoza v. United States, </em>690 F.3d 157, 159 (3d Cir.2012). Because Ridings\u2019s appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A. R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">Ridings was convicted in the District Court in 1994 of 84 counts of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, and the District Court sentenced him to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. The charges concerned Ridings\u2019s operation of American Precious Metals Corporation (\u201cAMPM\u201d), a business that Ridings co-owned. In short, Ridings convinced Jaydee Miller, the president of Pyromet, a company with whom AMPM conducted regular business, to advance money to AMPM under false pretenses. Ultimately, Pyromet lost $523,000 in these transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">Ridings appealed his conviction to this Court, and we affirmed. <em>See United States v. Ridings, </em>72 F.3d 124 (3d Cir.1995) (table). In 1995, Ridings filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the District Court. The District Court denied the motion, and we again affirmed. <em>See United States v. Ridings, </em>111 F.3d 128 (3d Cir.1997) (table). Next, in 1997, Ridings filed a document requesting a writ of co-ram nobis or relief under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The District Court denied relief, and we affirmed the denial of the petition for coram nobis and refused to issue a certificate of appealability to permit Ridings to appeal the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-15\">Over a decade later, in 2010, Ridings filed the petition for coram nobis that is at issue here, claiming that he had discovered new evidence establishing his innocence. The District Court denied the petition, and Ridings filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-16\">The writ of coram nobis may be used to attack an allegedly illegal conviction when the petitioner, like Ridings, is no longer in custody for purposes of \u00a7 2255. <em>Mendoza, </em>690 F.3d at 159. Coram nobis is reserved for the correction of a \u201cfundamental error\u201d for which \u201cthere was no remedy available at the time of trial and where \u2018sound reasons\u2019 exist for failing to seek relief earlier.\u201d <em>United States v. Stoneman, </em>870 F.2d 102, 105-06 (3d Cir.1989). This relief is available in only exceptional circumstances; indeed, the Supreme Court has stated \u201cit is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where a writ of coram nobis would be necessary or appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>priate.\u201d <em>Carlisle v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 416, 429, 116 S.Ct. 1460, 134 L.Ed.2d 613 (1996) (alteration, quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Ridings presents four types of information in support of his petition: (1) a report from a private investigator who recently interviewed members of the jury in Ridings\u2019s criminal case; (2) Miller\u2019s grand-jury testimony, which, Ridings argues, contradicts Miller\u2019s trial testimony; (3) a report from a certified public accountant who examined certain AMPM financial documents; and (4) an affidavit from Ridings in which he purports to remember a critical and exculpatory conversation that he had with Miller in 1988. We agree with the District Court that Ridings is not entitled to coram nobis relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">As an initial matter, we will accord no weight to the report from Ridings\u2019s private investigator. The District Court\u2019s Local Rules prohibit post-trial contact with jurors without Court authorization, and Ridings did not seek permission from the Court. <em>See </em>E.D. Pa. Cr. R. 24.1(c). This rule advances the important purpose of protecting jurors from harassment, <em>see Cuevas v. United States, </em>317 F.3d 751, 753 (7th Cir.2003), and we will thus strictly enforce the rule here.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Moreover, Ridings\u2019s claims based on Miller\u2019s grand-jury testimony and the accountant\u2019s report are essentially duplicative of claims that Ridings has previously raised. Ridings obtained the grand-jury testimony in 1995, and raised the precise claim he raises now concerning that testimony in both his appeal of the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion and in his joint petition for coram nobis/motion under Rule 60(b). Further, he possessed the AMPM financial records at the time of his trial, and claimed that those documents established his innocence in his \u00a7 2255 motion (and even included an affidavit from another accountant).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Coram nobis is \u201cavailable to bring before the court that pronounced the judgment errors in matters of fact which had not been put in issue or passed upon,\u201d <em>United States v. Addonizio, </em>442 U.S. 178, 186, 99 S.Ct. 2235, 60 L.Ed.2d 805 (1979); because Ridings\u2019s claims \u201camount to hardly more than regurgitation of the claims he has already presented in his \u00a7 2255 petition ... or claims that he reasonably could have raised in that petition, it cannot be said that he has made the necessary showing of a \u2018complete miscarriage of justice,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Esogbue, </em>357 F.3d 532, 535 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Finally, Ridings contends that he recently remembered, 22 years after the fact, a conversation that he had with Miller that led to \u201c[t]he entire case before the court today.\u201d Even putting aside the fact that Ridings\u2019s sudden remembrance stretches credulity, he is entitled to no relief. Ridings has not alleged any medical impairment that would affect his memory in this way; in these circumstances, his mere forgetfulness does not cause the type of fundamental error that can be remedied via coram nobis. <em>Cf. Walker v. Jastremski, </em>430 F.3d 560, 564 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that party\u2019s \u201cfailure to remember what he earlier knew\u201d did not present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>exceptional circumstances justifying equitable tolling).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\">. Moreover, we note that Ridings\u2019s accountant has no personal knowledge of the events at issue in this case and merely interpreted a variety of financial documents. On appeal of the District Court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion, Ridings relied on these same documents to attack his conviction. We were not persuaded, stating, \"the alternate interpretation of the balance sheets offered by Ridings is meaningless. Even if the balance sheets conformed to certain accounting principles, proper bookkeeping does not undercut the fact that receipt of Pyromet\u2019 money, however documented, was accomplished deceitfully.\u201d That same conclusion applies with full force here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
