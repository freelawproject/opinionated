R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b526-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-22\">Dashon Richardson appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for appointment of counsel in connection with his motion for a reduction of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-23\">\u201c[T]he Supreme Court has held ... that the constitutional right to counsel extends only through the defendant\u2019s first appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>After that, the decision whether to appoint counsel rests in the discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Townsend, </em>98 F.3d 510, 513 (9th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995)). Accordingly, Richardson is not entitled to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 512-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Nor is Richardson entitled to counsel under the Due Process Clause. The right to counsel in post-conviction proceedings, even those which touch on a significant liberty interest, is considered on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis, taking into consideration \u201cthe peculiarities of particular cases.\u201d <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 788-89, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973). Richardson\u2019s particular circumstances, however, \u201cpresented no specially troublesome points of law, either procedural or substantive.\u201d <em>Lassiter v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. of Durham Cnty., N.C., </em>452 U.S. 18, 32, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">All of the arguments Richardson claims he could have presented with the benefit of counsel have either been squarely rejected or severely undermined. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>739 F.3d 1222, 1225-26 (9th Cir.2014) (Separation of Powers argument); <em>Peugh v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2072, 186 L.Ed.2d 84 (2013) and <em>United States v. Johns, </em>5 F.3d 1267 (9th Cir.1993) (Ex Post Facto Clause argument); <em>United States v. Pleasant, </em>704 F.3d 808, 811 (9th Cir.2013), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 824, 187 L.Ed.2d 688 (2013) (interpreting <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011)); <em>United States v. Tercero, </em>734 F.3d 979, 981-84 (9th Cir. 2013) (rejecting argument that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 conflicts with the Fair Sentencing Act and holding that Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s arbitrary and capricious standard did not apply to promulgation of \u00a7 1B1.10). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision not to appoint counsel for Richardson did not violate his Due Process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">Richardson also contends that the district court was unaware that it had the discretion to appoint counsel, and he asks us to remand his case for further consideration. Absent a contrary indication, we \u201cassume that the district court knows and applies the law correctly\u201d when it has the power to make discretionary rulings. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Garcia-Garcia, </em>927 F.2d 489, 491 (9th Cir.1991). The district court\u2019s order, which noted that Richardson was not \u201centitled to appointed counsel,\u201d does not indicate that the district court failed to appreciate its power to appoint counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b526-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
