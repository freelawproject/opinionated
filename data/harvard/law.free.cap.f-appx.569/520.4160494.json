Having exhausted various arguments before the state courts, Kenner filed a habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court denied the petition, and this court granted a certificate of appealability on the narrow issue of whether defense counsel \u201cprovided constitutionally deficient representation by failing to consult with Kenner regarding the advantages and disadvantages of an appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A2i\">A district court\u2019s denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is reviewed de novo, and this court may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Varghese v. Uribe, </em>736 F.3d 817, 822-23 (9th Cir.2013) (citations omitted). Because the arguments raised have already been rejected by the Nevada Supreme Court, we may grant relief only if that decision was \u201ccontrary to, or [] an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law;\u201d or where the state court\u2019s conclusion was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). \u201cAs a condition for obtaining habeas corpus from a federal court, a state prisoner must show that the state court\u2019s ruling on the claim ... was so lacking in justification that there was an error ... beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786-87, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">After a thorough review of Kenner\u2019s case, we conclude that he is not entitled to relief. The state district court held an evidentiary hearing in which testimony was taken from four witnesses, including Kenner. Notwithstanding this fully developed record, the Nevada Supreme Court found no legal or factual support for Kenner\u2019s allegations of ineffective representation, and Kenner has not pointed us to any error in that record or the subsequent analysis. Nor do we find any. Consequently, because Kenner has not demonstrated that the state habeas adjudication was unreasonable or contrary to federal law, the decision \u201cwithstands scrutiny under \u00a7 2254(d).\u201d <em>Hibbler v. Benedetti, </em>693 F.3d 1140, 1150 (9th Cir.2012) (referring to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b542-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
