Ms. Pena does not dispute that the employer\u2019s liability exclusion precludes coverage for her claims against DBI (as Mr. Zambrana\u2019s employer), but rather argues that coverage is not precluded for the claims against the employees of DBI, namely Messrs. Leon, Ramos, and Ruiz.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Having carefully considered the parties\u2019 briefs and the record in this case and after having the benefit of oral argument, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards as the district court. <em>Hickson Corp. v. N. Crossarm Co., Inc., </em>357 F.3d 1256, 1259 (11th Cir.2004). Summary judgment is properly granted where \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">The interpretation of an insurance contract is a matter of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Dahl-Eimers v. Mut. of Omaha Life Ins. Co., </em>986 F.2d 1379, 1381 (11th Cir.1993). Because this is a diversity action, Florida law governs our interpretation of the CGL policy in this case. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. v. Beaver, </em>466 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">The parties\u2019 dispute centers on the proper interpretation of two provisions in the CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">Evanston contends that the plain language of the employer\u2019s liability exclusion precludes coverage for Mr. Zambrana\u2019s claims against DBI and the three named defendants. That provision provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-13\">Exclusion: Injury to Employees, Contractors, Volunteers and Workers</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad-\">... This Insurance does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIV\">e. Employer\u2019s Liability</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AND\">\u201cBodily injury\u201d to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-14\">(1) An \u201cemployee\u201d of any insured arising out of and in the course of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-15\">(a) Employment by any Insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-16\">(b) Performing duties related to the conduct of any insured\u2019s business!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-17\">... This exclusion applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-18\">(1) Whether any insured may be liable as an employer or in any other capacity ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-19\">Evanston argues that because it is undisputed that Mr. Zambrana was an employee of DBI (as defined in the CGL policy) who was performing duties related to DBI\u2019s business at the time he suffered injuries, the plain language of the employer\u2019s liability exclusion precludes coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-20\">Ms. Pena does not dispute that Mr. Zambrana was an \u201cemployee\u201d of DBI as defined in the employer liability exclusion or that he was performing duties related to DBI\u2019s business, but instead responds that the exclusion\u2019s terminology (\u201cany insured\u201d) must be read in light of the policy\u2019s separation of insureds provision (also commonly referred to as a \u201cseverability of interest\u201d provision), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-21\">7. Separation Of Insureds</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arl\">Except with respect to the Limits of Insurance, and any rights or duties specifically assigned in this Coverage Part to the first Named Insured, this Insurance applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-22\">a. As if each Named Insured were the only Named Insured; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-23\">b. Separately to each insured against whom claim is made or \u201csuit\u201d is brought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Florida courts have explained that sever-ability clauses, like the separation of insureds provision here, create separate insurable interests in each individual insured under a policy, such that the conduct of one insured will not necessarily exclude coverage for all other insureds. <em>See Mactown, Inc. v. Cont\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>716 So.2d 289, 292-93 (Fla. 3d DCA 1998). Thus, in Ms. Pena\u2019s view, the entire CGL policy must be read as if it applies separately to Messrs. Leon, Ramos, and Ruiz so that the language\u2014\u201can employee of <em>any in</em>sured\u201d\u2014in the employer\u2019s liability exclusion would not preclude coverage for Messrs. Leon, Ramos, or Ruiz because Mr. Zambrana was not \u201can employee of [Messrs.] [Leon], [Ramos], or [Ruiz].\u201d Rather, he was an employee of DBI only, such that the employer\u2019s liability exclusion would bar coverage only as to DBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">In support of her construction of the CGL policy, Ms. Pena relies on <em>Premier Ins. Co. v. Adams, </em>632 So.2d 1054 (Fla. 5th DCA 1994). In <em>Premier, </em>the Fifth District considered the effect of a severability of insurance clause in a homeowner\u2019s policy on the policy\u2019s exclusionary clause. <em>Id. </em>at 1056. The severability clause provided that \u201c[t]his insurance applies separately to each insured[,]\u201d <em>id., </em>and the exclusionary clause precluded coverage for bodily injury \u201cwhich is expected or intended by <em>any </em>insured,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1055. The Fifth District first noted that there were no Florida cases dealing with the \u201cinteraction of exclusionary clauses and severability clauses or the term \u2018any insured\u2019 as contrasted to \u2018an insured\u2019 or \u2018the insured,\u2019 in an exclusionary clause\u201d <em>id., </em>and thus looked to decisions in several other jurisdictions, <em>id. </em>at 1056-57. The Fifth District found persuasive the reasoning of the Massachusetts Supreme Court that the severability clause created \u201ca separate insurance policy for each insured,\u201d and thus the use of the term \u201cany insured\u201d in the exclusionary provision of the policy \u201creferred only to persons claiming coverage under the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1056 (describing the reasoning of <em>Worcester Mut. Ins. Co. v. Marnell, </em>398 Mass. 240, 496 N.E.2d 158 (1986)). The Fifth District agreed with the Massachusetts Supreme Court that this interpretation \u201cgave reasonable meaning to both the exclusionary clause and the severability clause[,]\u201d which it found preferable \u201cto one which leaves a part useless or inexplicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1057.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the Fifth District concluded that, to the extent the severability and exclusionary provisions created an ambiguity, the policy had to be construed strictly against the insurer as the drafter of the policy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Noting that the policy at issue \u201ccontains an exclusion for the intentional acts of \u2018any insured\u2019 and contains a severability clause creating a separate insurable interest in each individual insured,\u201d the Fifth District in <em>Premier </em>held that the \u201cthe most plausible interpretation is that the exclusionary clause is to exclude coverage for the separate insurable interest of that insured who intentionally causes the injury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">The reasoning and holding of <em>Premier </em>govern our interpretation of the severability and exclusionary provisions of Evanston\u2019s CGL policy in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>First, like the policy in <em>Premier, </em>Evans-ton\u2019s policy provides coverage for several insureds, including DBI and Messrs. Leon, Ramos, and Ruiz. Second, the separation of insureds provision in the Evans-ton CGL policy explicitly provides that the insurance applies \u201c[a]s if each Named Insured were the only Named Insured\u201d and just as the severability of insurance clause did in <em>Premier, </em>it states that it applies \u201c[separately to each insured.\u201d Because we are applying Florida law, we must interpret this language as requiring that each insured has separate insurance coverage, <em>Premier, </em>632 So.2d at 1057, and therefore read all provisions of the policy, including the employer\u2019s liability exclusion, as if coverage is for <em>only </em>DBI, or <em>only </em>Mr. Leon, or <em>only </em>Mr. Ramos, or <em>only </em>Mr. Ruiz.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Third, when applying this construction of the severability provision to the employer\u2019s liability exclusion in the Evans-ton CGL policy, we conclude that coverage is <em>not </em>precluded for Messrs. Leon, Ramos, or Ruiz. The exclusion states that the insurance does not apply to bodily injury to \u201c[a]n \u2018employee\u2019 of <em>any insured,\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Reading this provision as if Mr. Leon were the only insured, coverage would not be precluded because Mr. Zambrana is not an employee of Mr. Leon. The same construction is true for Mr. Ramos and for Mr. Ruiz. Moreover, we note that this reading does not render the inclusion of the employer\u2019s liability exclusion superfluous because, as Ms. Pena concedes, the exclusion applies to DBI, who for purposes of this exclusion is the employer of Mr. Zambrana.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Construing the separation of insureds provision and the use of the term \u201cany insured\u201d in the employer\u2019s liability exclusion as we have is consistent with the Fifth District\u2019s treatment of the two similar provisions at issue in <em>Premier. </em>The policy in <em>Premier </em>\u201ccontains an exclusion for the intentional acts of \u2018any insured,\u2019 \u201d meaning that coverage was excluded only \u201cfor the separate insurable interest of that insured who intentionally causes the injury.\u201d 632 So.2d at 1057. Likewise here, Evanston\u2019s CGL policy contains an exclusion for bodily injury to \u201can employee of any insured,\u201d meaning that coverage is excluded only \u201cfor the separate insurable interest of that insured\u201d who is the employer of the individual who suffered the injury. Essentially, the exclusion\u2019s use of the term \u201cany insured\u201d when read in conjunction with the severability clause creates a class of insureds who are excluded from coverage, i.e., employers of the injured claimant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Accordingly, as to other insureds who are not in the class of excludable insureds, but against whom a claim could be asserted, i.e., non-employers of the injured claimant, coverage is not precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><em>Premier </em>involved an exclusion for intentional torts in a homeowner\u2019s policy, rather than an employer\u2019s liability exclusion in a CGL policy. But that does not alter our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">First, the reasoning in <em>Premier </em>was not dependent on the type of insurance policy but instead was based on the meaning of the language in the severability clause and its effect on the use of the term \u201cany insured\u201d in the exclusion. Significantly, the Fifth District in <em>Premier </em>concluded that the severability clause, in and of itself, created a separate insurable interest in each individual insured under the policy, which when applied to the policy\u2019s use of the term \u201cany insured\u201d means that each insured must be treated independently from other insureds. This principle is applicable regardless of the type of insurance policy at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Second, another Florida appellate court has applied a severability of insurance clause to an employee exclusion in an automobile liability policy and concluded that \u201c[t]he exclusion as to employees of the insured is thus limited and confined to the employees of the employer against whom the claim is asserted.\u201d <em>Shelby Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schuitema, </em>183 So.2d 571, 574 (Fla. 4th DCA 1966), <em>approved </em>193 So.2d 435</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">(Fla.1967).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Like the Fifth District in <em>Premier, </em>the Fourth District in <em>Schuitema </em>recognized that \u201cthe principle that the severability of interests clause must be construed as intended to treat each insured independently from the other insured\u201d must be applied to other pertinent provisions of the policy. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, when applying this principle to the employee bodily injury exclusion, the court in <em>Schuitema </em>held that \u201cwhere the claimant is not the employee of the additional insured against whom the claim is made, then there is coverage.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">Evanston argues that coverage for Messrs. Leon, Ramos, and Ruiz is excluded based on the additional language in the employer\u2019s liability exclusion, which provides (emphasis added), \u201c[t]his exclusion applies: (1) [wjhether any insured may be liable as an employer <em>or in any other capacity.\u201d </em>We are not persuaded. As we have explained, the preliminary language of the exclusion in this policy\u2014\u201c[a]n employee of any insured\u201d\u2014read in conjunction with the separation of insureds provision, requires that the bodily injury claim be made by an employee of the insured employer who is claiming coverage. Only those insureds who are employers of the injured claimant are excluded from coverage. To read the subsequent language \u201cin any other capacity\u201d as including all insureds, even those who are not the employer of the claimant and hence, not precluded from coverage under the first part of this provision, would render not only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>separation of insureds provision but also the first part of the exclusion meaningless. Moreover, the language \u201cin any other capacity\u201d is not superfluous even when limited to an insured who is an employer of the claimant, because this language can be read to exclude coverage for an insured employer who may be sued in a role other than employer, such as an owner of a vehicle, as a general contractor, or as a state actor.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Evanston\u2019s reliance on <em>Mercury Ins. Co. of Fla. v. Charlie\u2019s Tree Serv., Inc., </em>29 So.3d 375 (Fla. 4th DCA 2010), does not sway us. There was no dispute that the insured at issue in that case was the claimant\u2019s employer, and thus the exclusion applied without reliance on the \u201cin any other capacity\u201d language. <em>Aetna Comm. Ins. Co. v. Am. Sign Co., </em>687 So.2d 834, 836 (Fla. 2d DCA 1996), likewise is inapplicable as it is silent as to whether the policy at issue contained a severability of interests clause and thus contains no analysis of what effect such a clause would have had on the interpretation of the exclusionary clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">We also reject Evanston\u2019s alternative argument that coverage for Messrs. Leon, Ramos, and Ruiz is excluded under the co-employee provision contained in \u201cSection II\u2014Who Is An Insured\u201d of the CGL policy. This provision provides that DBI\u2019s \u201cemployees,\u201d other than its executive officers, are insureds but that they are not covered for bodily injury to other co-employees. Evanston, however, has not shown at summary judgment that Mr. Zambrana was an \u201cemployee\u201d of DBI for purposes of this section of the policy, which defines \u201cemployee\u201d as follows: \u201c \u2018Employee\u2019 includes a \u2018leased worker.\u2019 \u2018Employee\u2019 does not include a \u2018temporary worker.\u2019 \u201d Although it is not disputed that Mr. Zambrana meets the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of the employer\u2019s liability exclusion, that provision of the CGL policy replaces the meaning of \u201cemployee\u201d from the Definitions Section with a separate and more expansive definition that is applicable only to the employer\u2019s liability exclusion. There is nothing in the record to support Evanston\u2019s argument that Mr. Zambrana was an \u201cemployee\u201d of DBI as that term is defined for purposes of the co-employee exclusion contained in Section II\u2014Who Is An Insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Based on precedent from Florida\u2019s appellate courts, we conclude that the employer liability exclusion in Evanston\u2019s CGL policy does not preclude coverage for Ms. Pena\u2019s claims against Messrs. Leon, Ramos, and Ruiz, as none of these insured individuals were Mr. Zambrana\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-11\">. Mr. Zambrana was critically injured while delivering a steel pipe to a construction site managed by DBI. Mr. Zambrana was delivering the pipe on behalf of Royal Plumbing Inc., a subcontractor of DBI. When he arrived at the site with the pipe, Mr. Zambrana was asked to help carry it to an upper level of the construction site. While on the upper level, he stepped on an unsupported drop ceiling and fell twenty feet to a concrete floor, sustaining serious injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b762-12\">. Mr. Leon is DBFs President, Mr. Ramos is Mr. Leon\u2019s partner, and Mr. Ruiz is a DBI employee. It is not disputed that the CGL policy provides coverage to DBI and also to DBFs officers and employees, subject to the policy\u2019s exceptions and/or exclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b762-18\">. The district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Evanston simply incorporated its earlier summary judgment order in a related, but separate, declaratory judgment action involving Nautilus Insurance Company, which had issued the primary insurance policy to DBI for $1,000,000.00 in coverage, against the same defendants. Evanston's CGL policy provided $1,000,000.00 of coverage in excess of the Nautilus policy and included a \"follow the form\u201d provision, in which all of the terms and provisions of the primary insurance policy, namely the Nautilus CGL policy, are incorporated into the Evanston policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b764-5\">. In reaching this conclusion, the Fifth District specifically rejected an alternative construction of the interplay of the severability and exclusionary clauses that would treat the use of the term \"any insured\u201d in an exclusionary clause as \"express[ing] a contractual intent to create joint obligations and to prohibit recovery by an innocent coinsured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1056 (describing the holding of <em>Chacon v. Am. Fam. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>788 P.2d 748 (Colo. 1990)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b764-11\">. In diversity cases, \"the rule is that, absent a decision from the state supreme court on an issue of state law, we are bound to follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>decisions of the state\u2019s intermediate appellate courts unless there is some persuasive indication that the highest court of the state would decide the issue differently.\u201d <em>McMahan v. Toto, </em>311 F.3d 1077, 1080 (11th Cir.2002). Moreover, the Florida Supreme Court has held that \u201d[t]he decisions of the district courts of appeal represent the law of Florida unless and until they are overruled by this Court. Thus, in the absence of interdistrict conflict, district court decisions bind all Florida trial courts.\" <em>Galindo v. ARI Mut. Ins. Co., </em>203 F.3d 771, 775 (11th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Pardo v. State, </em>596 So.2d 665, 666 (Fla.1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, neither the Florida Supreme Court nor other Florida district courts of appeal have addressed the interplay of a severability clause with the use of the term \"any insured\u201d in an exclusionary clause, so we follow <em>Premier </em>as the law of Florida.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b765-9\">. We recognize that our circuit, when interpreting a contract governed by Georgia law, explained that \"unlike the phrase 'the insured,\u2019 the phrase 'any insured\u2019 unambiguously expresses a contractual intent to create joint obligations and to prohibit recovery by an innocent co-insured.\u201d <em>Sales v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>849 F.2d 1383, 1385 (11th Cir.1988). In this case, however, we must apply Florida law, which, in <em>Premier, </em>holds to the contrary that the term \"any insured,\u201d when used in a severability of insureds provision, creates separate insurable interests in each insured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\">. Although the policy at issue in <em>Schuitema </em>used the term \"the insured\u201d as contrasted with <em>Premiers </em>use of the term \"any insured,\u201d both the Fifth District in <em>Premier </em>and the Fourth District in <em>Schuitema </em>treated the terms as being used severally as opposed to collectively or jointly. 183 So.2d at 573-74. In <em>Premier </em>the term \"any insured\u201d was treated as being used severally based on the Fifth District's interpretation of the severability of interests clause\u2019s effect on that term where it was used elsewhere in the policy, 632 So.2d at 1057, whereas in <em>Schuitema, </em>the term \"the insured\u201d was defined explicitly in the sever-ability of interests clause as being used \"severally,\u201d 183 So.2d at 572. Either way, in Florida the term \"any insured\u201d when used in an exclusionary provision of a policy containing a severability of interests provision is treated no differently from the meaning of the term \"the insured\u201d in <em>Schuitema.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\">.
