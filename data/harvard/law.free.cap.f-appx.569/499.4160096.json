We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-24\">Moore contends that the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(3)(B) by failing to make findings regarding a factual dispute that Moore raised for the first time during the sentencing hearing. We review the district court\u2019s compliance with Rule 32 for plain error. <em>See United States v. Christensen, </em>732 F.3d 1094, 1101 (9th Cir.2013). We need not decide whether Moore\u2019s oral objection was sufficient to trigger the district court\u2019s obligation under Rule 32(i)(3)(B), or whether the court met any obligation that it had under that provision by adopting the presentence report, because Moore has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>shown a reasonable probability that he would have received a different sentence absent the alleged error. <em>See id. </em>at 1101-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Moore also contends that the district court erred procedurally by failing to consider his'mitigating arguments and explain the sentence adequately. We review for plain error, <em>see United States v. Valencia-Barragan, </em>608 F.3d 1103, 1108 (9th Cir. 2010), and find none. The record shows that the district court heard Moore\u2019s mitigation arguments and sufficiently explained the below-Guidelines sentence. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 358-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b521-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
