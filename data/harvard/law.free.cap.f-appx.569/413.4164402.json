The question is whether, in applying the agreed-upon method of calculating fire loss coverage, the term \u201cobsolescence\u201d in the definition of \u201cactual cash value\u201d accounts for external changes in market value through the concept of \u201ceconomic obsolescence.\u201d A survey of the use of the relevant terms shows that the commonly understood meaning of the word obsolescence does not include market value decline. To the extent that the term is ambiguous, Michigan law requires that we construe it in favor of the insured. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the grant of summary judgment for the Plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b436-20\">The Cincinnati Insurance Company owes Whitehouse Condominium Group money to cover losses from a fire-destroyed condominium building in Flint, Michigan. The question is how much.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-21\">According to the insurance policy purchased by Whitehouse, Cincinnati Insurance must pay the \u201cactual cash value\u201d of the building at the time of the loss. \u201cActual cash value\u201d is defined in the contract as the \u201creplacement cost less a deduction that reflects depreciation, age, condition and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>obsolescence.\u201d The policy also included an option under which Whitehouse could get the full replacement cost of the building, but it appears that Whitehouse waived this option by declining to replace the building with one for the same general purpose and using the same general construction method.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The parties disagree on the meaning of the term \u201cobsolescence.\u201d Cincinnati Insurance would define it broadly to include the term \u201ceconomic obsolescence\u201d\u2014meaning a decrease in market value\u2014in which case Cincinnati Insurance claims the actual cash value would be only $1,187,660.38. Whitehouse would interpret the term more narrowly to include only \u201cfunctional obsolescence,\u201d in which case Whitehouse claims the actual cash value was $2,767,730.00. In other words, the dispute is over whether Cincinnati Insurance gets the benefit of a decrease in market values in Flint, Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Whitehouse sued Cincinnati Insurance, requesting a declaratory judgment on the proper construction of the term obsolescence. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The district court held as a matter of law that the term was unambiguous and that it did not include economic obsolescence. The court began its analysis by determining that the competing dictionary definitions offered by the parties did not resolve the question and that Michigan courts had never squarely settled the issue. Taking cues from a Southern District of New York ease involving very similar policy language, the district court concluded that nothing in the contract indicated that the parties intended to incorporate market value into the calculation of actual cash value. The contract did not state that the calculation required consideration of all pertinent evidence, as in the court-created broad evidence rule; the phrase \u201cdeduction\u201d suggested that market value was not included because markets can also increase; and the parties would have used the phrase \u201cmarket value\u201d if they intended it to be considered. As for unrelated case-law in the tax assessment and eminent domain contexts, the district court held that these cases were irrelevant to the meaning of this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The district court granted summary judgment to Whitehouse, and Cincinnati Insurance now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">A. Standard of Review and Applicable Law</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">As Cincinnati Insurance has appealed a grant of summary judgment on a legal issue, appellate review is de novo. <em>V &amp; M Star Steel v. Centimark Corp., </em>678 F.3d 459, 465 (6th Cir.2012). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant, here Whitehouse, is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). This case involves no factual disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">When interpreting a contract in a diversity case, the court applies the law, including the choice of law rules, of the forum state\u2014in this case, Michigan. <em>Uhl v. Komatsu Forklift Co., </em>512 F.3d 294, 302 (6th Cir.2008). The insurance policy here has no choice-of-law provision, so we must consider the following five factors, as instructed by the Michigan Supreme Court: place of contracting, place of negotiation, place of performance, location of the subject-matter of the contract, and place of incorporation of the parties. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Skyline Indus. Sens., </em>448 Mich. 113, 528 N.W.2d 698, 702 (1995); Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 188(2) (1971)). Here, all five elements point toward Michigan law, and the parties agree that Michigan law applies. In resolv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>ing questions of state law, this court looks first to final decisions of that state; if no decision directly on-point exists, then we must make an <em>Erie </em>guess as to how that court would resolve the issue. <em>Conlin v. Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., </em>714 F.3d 355, 358-59 (6th Cir.2013). In making this determination, intermediate state court decisions can be persuasive. <em>Id. </em>at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">In Michigan, an insurance contract is generally to be interpreted like any other contract, according to Michigan contract interpretation principles. <em>Stryker Corp. v. XL Ins. Am., </em>735 F.3d 349, 354 (6th Cir. 2012); <em>Rory v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>473 Mich. 457, 703 N.W.2d 23, 26 (2005). The meaning of a contract is a question of law, as is the question of whether contract language is ambiguous. <em>Wilkie v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., </em>469 Mich. 41, 664 N.W.2d 776, 780 (2003). The relevant contract interpretation principles are simple enough\u2014 courts should enforce contract language in accordance with its plain and commonly used meaning, being careful to enforce specific and well-recognized terms. <em>Henderson v. State Farm, </em>460 Mich. 348, 596 N.W.2d 190, 193-94 (1999); <em>Stryker, </em>735 F.3d at 354. A contract should be read as a whole instrument and with the goal of enforcing the intent of the parties. <em>Prestige Cas. Co. v. Mich. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>99 F.3d 1340, 1350 (6th Cir.1996); <em>see also Wilkie, </em>664 N.W.2d at 781-82 (holding that a term ambiguous on its .own became unambiguous in context).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">If an insurance contract provision is ambiguous\u2014meaning it is susceptible to two different reasonable interpretations\u2014it is strictly construed against the insurer. <em>Henderson, </em>596 N.W.2d at 194; <em>Stryker, </em>735 F.3d at 354. The parties incorrectly suggest that the district court should consider extrinsic evidence to construe ambiguous terms. This might be correct in the non-insurance context in which Michigan</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">courts use extrinsic evidence to determine the \u201cmeaning of an ambiguous contract\u201d as a question of fact. <em>See Klapp v. United Ins. Grp. Agency, Inc., </em>468 Mich. 459, 663 N.W.2d 447, 453-54 (2003). It might also be true where an insurance question involves a question of fact as to the \u201capplication of the term or phrase\u201d to the underlying events. <em>Henderson, </em>596 N.W.2d at 193. But where, as here, the issue only requires the court to construe an ambiguous insurance policy term, the Michigan Supreme Court has stated unexeeptionally that \u201cambiguous policy provisions in an insurance contract ha[ve] to be construed against the insurance company and in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Wilkie, </em>664 N.W.2d at 784. Interpretation techniques that look outside the insurance policy, such as the rule of reasonable expectations in which courts rewrite contracts in light of the parties\u2019 intent, \u201cis just a surrogate for the rule of construing against the drafter.\u201d <em>Wilkie, </em>664 N.W.2d at 782, 786-87. \u201c[S]tating that ambiguous language should be interpreted in favor of the policyholder\u2019s reasonable expectations adds nothing to the way in which Michigan courts construe contracts\u201d because \u201cit is already well established that ambiguous language should be construed against the drafter, i.e., the insurer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 787; <em>see also Raska v. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., </em>412 Mich. 355, 314 N.W.2d 440, 441 (1982); <em>see also Stryker, </em>735 F.3d at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The mere fact that a term is undefined in an insurance contract does not render the term ambiguous. <em>Henderson, </em>596 N.W.2d at 194. Undefined terms, too, should be construed according to their commonly used meaning unless it is apparent from the whole policy that a special meaning was intended. <em>Id. </em>at 193-94; <em>see also Prestige, </em>99 F.3d at 1350. And the words should not be parsed in isolation because they may convey a different meaning in context when used in conjunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>with other words. <em>Henderson, </em>596 N.W.2d at 194-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">B. Obsolescence</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The entire dispute in this ease involves the precise meaning of the term \u201cobsolescence,\u201d a term undefined in the insurance policy. The term appears within the contract definition of \u201cactual cash value,\u201d which is \u201creplacement cost less a deduction that reflects depreciation, age, condition, and obsolescence.\u201d More specifically, the question is whether the term obsolescence includes a reduction in market value due to factors external to the property itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Cincinnati Insurance would include in the term obsolescence two different components: functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence. Generally, functional obsolescence means a loss in value due to something inherent to the building itself such as old technology (think an electrical panel that is no longer acceptable under current codes) or bad design (think a five bedroom house that has only one bathroom). <em>See SR Int\u2019l Bus. Ins. Co. v. World Trade Ctr. Props., </em>445 F.Supp.2d 320, 348 (S.D.N.Y.2006) [hereinafter <em>WTC]; </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed.2009). Economic obsolescence means a reduction in value due to market factors entirely external to the building, such as neighborhood factors (this might occur if the neighborhood were suddenly under a noisy flight path) or the general market (the real estate market crash appears to be the factor in this case). <em>See Didder v. CIGNA Prop. &amp; Cas. Co., </em>957 F.2d 1088, 1100 (3d Cir.1992); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed.2009). Whitehouse calls Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s position \u201cdefinitional high jinks\u201d and argues that it is inconsistent with the common use of the term obsolescence and is offered merely to remedy the insurer\u2019s failure to include market value in the actual cash value definition. According to Whitehouse, economic obsolescence is a specialized concept used only in certain settings and does not fall within the generic meaning of obsolescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">We must first attempt to discern the commonly used meaning of these terms. Dictionaries support the position that economic obsolescence is a specialized concept not included in the commonly used definition of obsolescence. <em>See e.g., McNeel v. Farm Bureau Gen. Ins. Co., </em>289 Mich. App. 76, 795 N.W.2d 205, 214 (2010) (consulting a lay dictionary to attempt to discern common meaning of undefined contract term); <em>Twichel v. MIC Gen. Ins. Corp., </em>469 Mich. 524, 676 N.W.2d 616, 622 (2004) (citing to three different lay dictionaries to discern the primary features of \u201cownership\u201d). One dictionary defines obsolescence as \u201cthe condition of no longer being used or useful: the condition of being obsolete\u201d with \u201cobsolete,\u201d in turn, defined as \u201ca: no longer in use or no longer useful [as in] an obsolete word; b: of a kind or style no longer current: old-fashioned [as in] an obsolete technology.\u201d <em>Merriamr-Webster.com </em>(last visited May 21, 2014). Another defines it as \u201cbecoming obsolete,\u201d with obsolete defined as \u201cno longer produced or used; out of date: [as in] \u2018the disposal of old and obsolete machinery,\u2019 [and] \u2018the phrase was obsolete after 1625.\u2019\u201d <em>OxfordDictionaries.com </em>(last visited May 21, 2014). Webster\u2019s, the source cited below by Whitehouse, defines obsolescence as \u201c1. Becoming obsolete; passing out of use as a word. 2. Intending to become out of date, as machinery, etc.\u201d Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary (1997). All of these definitions point to a common understanding that something becomes obsolete when it becomes outdated due to some feature inherent to the thing itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Turning to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, as advocated by Cincinnati Insurance, complicates matters slightly because it includes both the generic definition and more specific variations of the term:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6\">obsolescence ... 1. The process or state of falling into disuse or becoming obsolete. 2. A diminution in the value or usefulness of property, esp. as a result of technological advances. \u2022 For tax purposes, obsolescence is usu. distinguished from physical deterioration....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alc\">economic obsolescence. Obsolescence that results from external economic factors, such as decreased demand or changed governmental regulations.\u2014 Also termed external obsolescence. Cf. functional obsolescence....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY7L\">functional obsolescence. Obsolescence that results either from inherent deficiencies in the property, such as inadequate equipment or design, or from technological improvements available after the use began. Cf. economic obsolescence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed.2009). This definition gives some legitimacy to Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s position that economic obsolescence is a recognized subset of the generic term, but the generic definition supports Whitehouse\u2019s position because it indicates that technological changes are the most commonly understood cause of obsolescence. As the district court pointed out, this definition does not clarify whether economic obsolescence is commonly understood as part of the generic term or whether it is a specialized term used in specialized contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">A survey of caselaw suggests that the term economic obsolescence is more of a specialized term. In Michigan Supreme Court opinions, the term economic obsolescence appears only in the tax assessment context where it is used to determine the \u201ctrue cash value\u201d or \u201cfair market value\u201d of</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">a property for taxing purposes. <em>See, e.g., Meadowlanes Ltd. Dividend Housing Ass\u2019n v. City of Holland, </em>437 Mich. 473, 473 N.W.2d 636, 643, 651 (1991); <em>see also Antisdale v. City of Galesburg, </em>420 Mich. 265, 362 N.W.2d 632, 637 n. 1 (1984); <em>C.A.F. Inv. Co. v. Twp. of Saginaw, </em>410 Mich. 428, 302 N.W.2d 164, 180-81 (1981) (Levin, J., concurring). This is generally consistent with other states, <em>see, e.g., WTC, </em>445 F.Supp.2d at 348 (consulting New York tax cases to discern meaning of the term), and with the federal courts of appeals, <em>e.g., Helmsley v. City of Detroit, </em>380 F.2d 169, 173 (6th Cir.1967) (considering economic obsolescence in valuation by tax assessor). In the only federal court of appeals case using the term economic obsolescence in the context of building insurance, the Third Circuit held that neither economic obsolescence nor functional obsolescence were components of depreciation within a building insurance contract that defined actual cash value as \u201creplacement cost less depreciation.\u201d <em>Dickler, </em>957 F.2d at 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Cincinnati Insurance asks the court to simply adopt an \u201cinclusive definition\u201d that includes all possible forms of obsolescence. This is contrary to Michigan law, which instructs employment of the commonly used meaning of the term, not a special meaning. <em>See Henderson, </em>596 N.W.2d at 193-94 (noting that terms should be given their commonly used meaning even though \u201cdictionary publishers are obliged to define words differently to avoid plagiarism\u201d). Indeed, it is not necessary to adopt any particular definition; we merely have to discern whether the common meaning includes market value decline. <em>See, e.g., Citizens Ins. Co. v. Pro-Seal Serv. Grp., </em>477 Mich. 75, 730 N.W.2d 682, 687 (2007); <em>Greenville Lafayette, LLC v. Elgin State Bank, </em>296 Mich.App. 284, 818 N.W.2d 460, 465 n. 4 (2012). On balance, it appears that the commonly understood use of the term obsolescence does not include a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>dine in market values. At most these sources might suggest that the term is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Next, as Michigan law instructs, we look to the whole contract and interpret the term in context. <em>Prestige, </em>99 F.3d at 1350. The term obsolescence appears within the contract definition of \u201cactual cash value,\u201d which is one of several methods insurers use to value a property in the event of a loss. Other methods are market value, reproduction value, and replacement value. <em>See, e.g., Haley v. Farm Bur. Ins. Co., </em>No. 302158, 2013 WL 4525924, at * 10 (Mich. Ct.App. Aug. 27, 2013) (explaining market value, reproduction value, and replacement value as compared to actual cash value); <em>Salesin v. State Farm, </em>229 Mich.App. 346, 581 N.W.2d 781, 790 (1998) (explaining that replacement cost is additional coverage allowing the insured to replace a building without deduction for depreciation and obsolescence). Many courts, including those in Michigan, have adopted what is known as the \u201cbroad evidence\u201d rule to determine the actual cash value when the term is undefined in a contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Davis v. Nat'l Am. Ins. Co., </em>78 Mich.App. 225, 259 N.W.2d 433, 438 (1977). Under the rule, factfinders or appraisers may consider \u201cany evidence logically tending to the formation of a correct estimate\u201d of the value of the property, including \u201cmarket or reproduction or replacement values.\u201d <em>Id,.; Evanston Ins. Co. v. Cogswell Props. LLC, </em>683 F.3d 684, 688 (6th Cir.2012). Specific forms of evidence that may be relevant under the broad evidence rule include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\u201cthe cost of restoration or replacement of the building less depreciation; the age of the property; the economic value of the property; the condition in which the property is maintained; the income derived from the building\u2019s use; the property\u2019s location; <em>the degree of obsolescence, both structural and functional; </em>the profit likely to accrue on the property; the material of which the building is composed; <em>the market value; </em>the opinions regarding value given by qualified witnesses; the potential gainful uses to which the building might have been or may be put; the building\u2019s value for purposes of rental; and any other facts disclosed by the evidence which may possibly throw light on the actual value of the building at the time of loss, including the property\u2019s salvage value, if any.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-9\"><em>Dickler, </em>957 F.2d at 1097 (quoting <em>Insuring Real Property </em>\u00a7 24.04(2) at 24-30 (Stephen A. Cozen, ed., 1989)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">While the broad evidence rule is not used when a policy defines actual cash value, like the policy at issue here, its existence helps elucidate the fact that terms like obsolescence, market value, and depreciation are all generally seen as <em>different </em>potentially relevant factors. Where a contract incorporates some of the factors and not others, it is reasonable to think that the others were left out intentionally. <em>E.g., Dickler, </em>957 F.2d at 1100 (\u201cAlthough \u2018economic obsolescence\u2019 may play a part in determining actual cash value under the \u2018broad evidence\u2019 rule, it should not be considered by a fact finder where, as here, the parties have precluded application of the \u2018broad evidence\u2019 rule by defin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ing actual cash value as replacement cost less depreciation.\u201d). In fact, it appears that Cincinnati Insurance used a similar argument in a case where it fought the <em>insured\u2019s </em>attempt to give actual cash value, as defined identically to the one here, a meaning that included market value, potentially raising estoppel concerns. <em>See Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Bluewood, Inc., </em>No. 06-04127-CV-C-NKL, 2007 WL 4365738, at * 3 (W.D.Mo. Dec. 12, 2007), <em>aff'd, </em>560 F.3d 798 (8th Cir.2009). More importantly for this court\u2019s purposes, an insured would be unlikely to think she was paying for insurance that accounted for a reduction in market value where the insurance contract did not specifically list it.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Another component of the relevant context is the full contract definition of actual cash value: \u201creplacement cost less a deduction that reflects depreciation, age, condition, and obsolescence.\u201d All three of the other terms listed\u2014depreciation, age, and condition\u2014reflect something inherent to the building itself rather than an external market condition, suggesting that obsolescence is similarly restricted. <em>See Bloomfield Estates Improvement Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. City of Birmingham, </em>479 Mich. 206, 737 N.W.2d 670, 675 (2007) (using doctrine of noscitur a sociis, meaning \u201ca word or phrase is given meaning by its context or setting,\u201d to interpret contract language).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Additionally, as the district court explained below, the contract definition only allows for <em>reductions </em>for various purposes, not for additions, possibly suggesting that market values, which can also increase, were not intended to be included. While Cincinnati Insurance rightly observes that the term \u201cobsolescence\u201d necessarily means a reduction, this does not undermine the main point. In light of the contract language, the insured would not likely believe, based solely on the term obsolescence, that she was purchasing insurance that included a deduction for declines in market value. <em>See Wilkie, </em>664 N.W.2d at 787 (noting that the policyholder cannot be said to have had an expectation not clear from the contract). This reasoning is consistent with the analysis of the New York district court in the World Trade Center case. <em>See WTC, </em>445 F.Supp.2d at 349-50.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">We conclude that the term obsolescence, as commonly understood, does not account for a decline in market value. To the extent that the term obsolescence is ambiguous as to whether it includes economic obsolescence, we strictly construe it against Cincinnati Insurance. <em>See Henderson, </em>596 N.W.2d at 194; <em>Stryker, </em>735 F.3d.at 354. This result preserves the benefit of the bargain of both parties. As other courts have noted, \u201c[i]t can hardly be said that an insured reaps a windfall by obtaining payment of actual cash value determined in a fair and reasonable manner when that is precisely what the insurer has agreed to pay under its policy in advance.\u201d <em>Gilderman v. State Farm, </em>437 Pa.Super. 217, 649 A.2d 941, 946 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">For the reasons explained above, we AFFIRM the grant of summary judgment to the Plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\">. Some lower Michigan courts have suggested that actual cash value means only replacement cost less depreciation. <em>Haley, </em>2013 WL 4525924, at *9 (affirming finding of actual cash value based on expert\u2019s opinion that it meant \" 'the replacement cost less physical and economic depreciation based on age and condition\u2019 \u201d); <em>GHD Operating, L.L.C. v. Emerson Prew, Inc., </em>No. 278857, 2009 WL 249399, at *5-6 (Mich.Ct.App. Feb. 3, 2009) (discussing experts who both agreed that actual cash value is generally replacement cost less depreciation); <em>Salesin, </em>581 N.W.2d at 790 (Insured \"agreed to pay the \u2018actual cash value,\u2019 which means 'repair or replacement cost less depreciation.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b442-6\">. Cincinnati Insurance argues that it was improper for the district court to consider <em>WTC </em>because its underlying insurance contract is distinguishable from the contract at issue here and because <em>WTC </em>is extrinsic evidence that the court could not consider when construing an unambiguous contract term. The district court committed no error by considering persuasive authority from another court that also had to discern the commonly understood meaning of the term obsolescence. Moreover, caselaw does not amount to extrinsic evidence. <em>See </em>Black's Law Dictionary (9th ed.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
