Upon our review, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-25\">Dr. Barton Joseph Adams, the husband of appellant Josephine Artillaga Adams (Mrs. Adams), owned and operated a \u201cpain management\u201d medical practice in West Virginia. In 2008, Dr. Adams was indicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>on charges of health care fraud for allegedly submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid. However, before he could be tried on those charges, the district court determined that Dr. Adams was \u201csuffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent\u201d to understand the proceedings against him. In June 2011, in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(d), the court committed Dr. Adams to the Attorney General\u2019s custody for hospitalization \u201cfor such a reasonable period of time, <em>not to exceed four months, </em>as is necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that in the foreseeable future he will attain the capacity to permit the proceedings to go forward.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In September 2011, Dr. and Mrs. Adams were charged in a single indictment alleging sixteen counts of obstruction of justice and related charges. These charges arose from Dr. and Mrs. Adams\u2019 acts occurring between 2007 and 2009 involving the alleged concealment of financial proceeds from the. underlying health care fraud. The district court severed the defendants\u2019 trials based on Mrs. Adams\u2019 speedy trial rights and the court\u2019s earlier determination that Dr. Adams was incompetent to stand trial. On November 1, 2011, the grand jury issued a superseding indictment against both parties that reflected only minor factual changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">On November 5, 2011, Mrs. Adams filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum seeking the presence of Dr. Adams to offer exculpatory evidence at her trial. Although the government did not oppose the petition, Dr. Adams\u2019 counsel filed a motion requesting that the petition be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">At a November 7, 2011 hearing, Dr. Adams\u2019 counsel informed the court that Dr. Adams repeatedly had indicated that he wanted to testify at Mrs. Adams\u2019 trial. According to Dr. Adams\u2019 counsel, Dr. Adams had concluded that \u201chis testimony would exonerate [Mrs. Adams] as it would tend to prove that she had no actual knowledge of the charged transactions.\u201d Nonetheless, Dr. Adams\u2019 counsel asserted that Dr. Adams \u201cwas not capable of rationally consulting with counsel\u201d to determine whether to waive his constitutional right against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">The district court denied Mrs. Adams\u2019 petition for writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum by order dated November 8, 2011. In its order, the court stated that \u201cgiven Dr. Barton Adams\u2019 current status as incompetent to stand trial and [his] inability to cooperate with his attorney,\u201d a decision permitting Dr. Adams to testify could potentially violate his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment, as well as his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Three days later, on Friday, November 11, 2011, Mrs. Adams filed a motion to continue her trial until Dr. Adams was declared competent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On Monday, November 14, 2011, the first day of Mrs. Adams\u2019 trial, the district court denied her continuance motion and concluded that the motion was \u201cfiled in bad faith.\u201d In explaining its ruling, the district court stated, in part, that Dr. Adams \u201chad been sent away for the four-month period\u201d and that \u201cit is not certain when or whether Doctor Adams would ever be competent to assist in the preparation of his defense.\u201d The court also observed that the motion to continue was filed \u201cimmediately before tri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>al,\u201d and that interpreters and jurors already had been designated.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">After a three-day trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all sixteen counts alleged in the indictment. The district court entered a judgment order, and later denied Mrs. Adams\u2019 post-trial motions for a new trial and for dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Two months after Mrs. Adams\u2019 trial, on January 24, 2012, the warden at the medical center where Dr. Adams had been committed filed a certificate with the district court in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(e), indicating, that Dr. Adams was \u201cnow competent to stand trial.\u201d After holding a hearing, the district court found Dr. Adams competent and ultimately accepted his guilty plea to a reduced number of charges. <em>See United, States v. Adams, </em>No. 13-4203, 560 Fed.Appx. 213, 214, 2014 WL 945012, at *1, 2014 U.S.App. LEXIS 4613, at *1-2 (4th Cir. March 12, 2014) (per curiam, unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In May 2013, the district court sentenced Mrs. Adams to a period of three years\u2019 probation for the obstruction of justice convictions. Mrs. Adams timely filed the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Mrs. Adams argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying her continuance motion, because the court improperly speculated that Dr. Adams remained incompetent on November 14, 2011, the date of Mrs. Adams\u2019 trial. In response, the government contends that Mrs. Adams failed to demonstrate two factors necessary to obtain a continuance for production of a witness. The government asserts that, under the holding in <em>United States v. Clinger, </em>681 F.2d 221, 223 (4th Cir.1982), Mrs. Adams was required, but failed, to show the content of Dr. Adams\u2019 expected testimony and that Dr. Adams could \u201cprobably be obtained\u201d to testify at Mrs. Adams\u2019 trial. We disagree with the government\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a continuance motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>445 F.3d 724, 739 (4th Cir.2006). And, even when a court engages in such an abuse, the defendant also must show that \u201cthe error specifically prejudiced her case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Hedgepeth, </em>418 F.3d 411, 419 (4th Cir.2005)). When a party requests a continuance to secure the attendance of a witness, the moving party must show: (1) the name of the witness; (2) the expected content of the witness\u2019s testimony; (3) how such testimony will be relevant to the issues at trial; (4) that the witness \u201ccan probably be obtained if the continuance is granted;\u201d and (5) that the moving party acted with due diligence to obtain the witness\u2019s attendance at trial. <em>Clinger, </em>681 F.2d at 223 (citation omitted). After reviewing the record, we easily conclude that Mrs. Adams satisfied the three <em>Clinger </em>factors that are not disputed on appeal, namely, identifying Dr. Adams, demonstrating that his testimony would be relevant, and acting with diligence to secure his presence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">We also conclude that Mrs. Adams sufficiently demonstrated the nature of her husband\u2019s expected testimony in light of the circumstances of this case. The parties did not dispute that Dr. Adams was prepared to provide exculpatory testimony addressing Mrs. Adams\u2019 lack of knowledge of her husband\u2019s alleged fraud, and his alleged concealment of fraud proceeds. Counsel for Mrs. Adams, as well as counsel for Dr. Adams, informed the court that Dr. Adams\u2019 expected testimony would exonerate Mrs. Adams and would demonstrate that she had no knowledge of the charged transactions. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>did not address the adequacy of Mrs. Adams\u2019 proffer in ruling on the request for a continuance. Accordingly, we conclude that Mrs. Adams satisfied this <em>Clinger </em>factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We therefore turn to address the remaining <em>Clinger </em>factor, namely, whether Mrs. Adams showed that Dr. Adams \u201cprobably\u201d could be obtained to testify if the trial were continued. At the outset, we recognize the obstacle posed to Mrs. Adams\u2019, ability to satisfy this factor due to her husband\u2019s civil commitment. As the government acknowledges, Mrs. Adams could not predict whether Dr. Adams would ever be restored to competence. However, when she filed her motion for a continuance on November 11, 2011, Mrs. Adams knew that the district court had ordered in June 2011 that Dr. Adams\u2019 commitment extend for a reasonable period not to exceed four months. After that time, the court would determine whether Dr. Adams\u2019 competency had been restored or was likely to be restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Although the record does not indicate when Dr. Adams actually was hospitalized, an updated report on his condition was required by the court\u2019s June 2011 order. Further, the facility\u2019s warden and medical personnel deemed Dr. Adams competent in January 2012, only two months after Mrs. Adams\u2019 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Rather than continuing Mrs. Adams\u2019 trial to obtain an updated status of Dr. Adams\u2019 mental condition, the district court denied the continuance based on the court\u2019s five-month-old finding regarding Dr. Adams\u2019 competency. While the court properly observed that Mrs. Adams\u2019 motion to continue was filed on the eve of trial, we nonetheless conclude that under the circumstances of this case, it was incumbent on the district court to continue the trial until the court could make an informed finding regarding the present state of Dr. Adams\u2019 condition. <em>See id. </em>at 224 (when a court cannot make a necessary finding with exactness, the court should grant a continuance to receive evidence on that subject).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">We further conclude that the district court\u2019s failure to continue the trial prejudiced Mrs. Adams. <em>See Williams, </em>445 F.3d at 739 (citation omitted). The evidence and arguments presented by the government at trial focused on Mrs. Adams\u2019 involvement in, and knowledge of, the financial transactions at issue, as well as her knowledge of Dr. Adams\u2019 underlying health care fraud. Therefore, Dr. Adams\u2019 expected testimony would have been highly probative regarding his wife\u2019s role in the charged offenses. Accordingly, we conclude that under the facts and circumstances presented, the district court abused its discretion in denying Mrs. Adams\u2019 motion for a continuance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">For these reasons, we vacate Mrs. Adams\u2019 conviction, and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\">. In her motion, Mrs. Adams waived application of the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161-3174.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\">. Because we vacate Mrs. Adams\u2019 conviction, we do not address the additional arguments that she raises on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
