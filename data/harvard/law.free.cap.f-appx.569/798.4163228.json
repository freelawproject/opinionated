The district court imposed the sentence consecutively with Castenada-Palaez\u2019s 24-month sentence from the Middle District of North Carolina, which he received for unlawful reentry of a deported alien, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b), one of the substantive crimes that triggered revocation. On appeal, he argues that his sentence upon revocation of supervised release, and its consecutive imposition, are substantively unreasonable in light of the applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-15\">We review the sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir. 2008), which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion,\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we must ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). After we determine whether a sentence is procedurally reasonable, we examine the substantive reasonableness based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>626 F.3d 566, 573 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-16\">The district court is required to consider certain factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when it determines a defendant\u2019s sentence upon revocation of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) intro., (e)(3). Those factors include the need to deter criminal conduct, protect the public from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>the defendant\u2019s future criminal acts, and provide the defendant with effective correctional treatment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B)(D), 3583(e) intro. The district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (4)-(7), 3583(e) intro., (e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">For revocation of supervised release, the Guidelines\u2019 pertinent policy statement provides that the sentence shall be ordered consecutive to any sentence of imprisonment the defendant is already serving, \u201cwhether or not the sentence of imprisonment being served resulted from the conduct that is the basis of the revocation.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f) (policy statement). Although the Guidelines and their policy statements are advisory, judges are still required to consider them. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 245-46, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756-57, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Federal statute provides that, generally, when a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment, the terms may run concurrently or consecutively. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). In determining whether the terms should run concurrently or consecutively, the court must again consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3584(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">While we do not presume that a sentence within the guideline range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). Furthermore, the weight given to any specific \u00a7 3553(a) factor is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). However, a court can abuse its discretion when it (1) fails to consider all factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives an improper or irrelevant factor significant weight, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment by balancing the proper factors unreasonably. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc). Unjustified reliance upon any one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors may also indicate an unreasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">In light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Castenada-Palaez fails to prove that his 24-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Turner, </em>626 F.3d at 573. The court\u2019s sentence of 24 months is within the guideline range, and we would ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Hunt, </em>526 F.3d at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">The sentence, and its consecutive imposition, also meet the goals encompassed within \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The court expressed concern over Castenada-Palaez\u2019s lengthy and violent criminal history, which included three deportations, and convictions for battering his wife\u2019s face with a bedframe, beating three people with a baseball bat, annoying or molesting a child (for which he failed to appear for sentencing), assault, illegal reentry, and driving under the influence. In light of his disregard for the law and propensity for recidivism, the additional two-year custodial sentence was needed to deter him from further criminal activity and protect the public. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B)-(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">Furthermore, while the court may have emphasized Castenada-Palaez\u2019s wrongdoings, it did not do so \u201csingle-mindedly\u201d to the detriment of mitigating \u00a7 3553(a)(1) factors. <em>See Crisp, </em>454 F.3d at 1292. The court explicitly stated that it (1) considered Castenada-Palaez\u2019s reasons for returning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>to the United States, which included escaping from threats in Mexico and providing for his family, (2) recognized that his family would face financial hardship while he is serving his sentence, and (3) \u201cheard\u201d his remaining arguments. Moreover, even if the court did not weigh Castenada-Palaez\u2019s history and characteristics, or the circumstances of the offense, as heavily as his criminal history, the weight to be given to a particular factor is within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743. As noted above, the sentence was supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the record. Therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion by giving an improper factor significant weight or by committing a clear error in judgment in balancing the proper factors. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Finally, the above considerations, in addition to \u00a7 3553(a)(5), support the court\u2019s decision to impose Castenada-Palaez\u2019s sentence upon revocation of supervised release consecutively to his sentence from the Middle District of North Carolina. While the Guidelines are not mandatory, \u00a7 3553(a)(5) still instructs courts to consider the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5); <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 245-46, 125 S.Ct. at 756-57. In this case, the Chapter 7 policy statement at issue stated that Castenada-Palaez\u2019s sentence for revocation of supervised release must be imposed consecutively to his existing sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f) (policy statement). Certainly then, the district court did not abuse its discretion by considering a consecutive sentence, which \u00a7 3584(a) authorized it to impose; and, because the court properly weighed the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as noted above, its ultimate conclusion to follow the policy statement and impose the sentence consecutively was reasonable. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3584(a)-(b); <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the totality of the circumstances support both the sentence upon revocation of supervised release and the court\u2019s decision to impose that sentence consecutively to the Middle District of North Carolina\u2019s sentence. <em>Turner, </em>626 F.3d at 573; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(b). Accordingly, we affirm Castenada-Palaez\u2019s 24-month sentence as substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
