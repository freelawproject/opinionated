We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-27\">The TILA allows claims against creditors. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a). Until 1982, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(f) defined \u201ccreditor\u201d as including \u201ccredit arrangers.\u201d In 1982, Congress amended the statute, eliminating credit arranger liability. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(f). The district court found that Banner was not a creditor under the current version of TILA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-28\">Banner does not meet the first condition that the individual or business must offer or extend credit. Although Banner has a credit department, it investigates credit histories, and it prepares forms; ultimately, Banner assigns the loan to GMAC, FMC, or another entity. It is that entity who \u201clends\u201d the money to the consumer to enable him to purchase a vehicle. If a vehicle buyer defaulted on monthly payments, Banner would have no right to repossess the vehicle, or to sue for the balance unpaid. That right would belong to the lienholder or the extender \u2019 of credit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>here GMAC, the sole lender/creditor in the transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The district court\u2019s holding is a correct application of the principles set out in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Cenance, </em>452 U.S. 155, 101 S.Ct. 2239, 68 L.Ed.2d 744 (1981). In <em>Cenance, </em>like this case, Ford Motor Credit gave auto dealers purchase forms, the dealer and buyer executed the form after Ford approved the buyers\u2019 creditworthiness, and the dealers simultaneously assigned the contract to Ford. The Supreme Court found that the dealers were arrangers of credit and that Ford was the extender of credit. <em>See id., </em>452 U.S. at 157-58. In this case, similarly, Banner Chevrolet is simply a credit arranger and is therefore not a creditor as defined in the controlling 1982 version of TILA.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Finding no error, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
