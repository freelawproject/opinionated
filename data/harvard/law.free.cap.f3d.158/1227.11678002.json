Appellant contends that the district court erred by including his prior conviction for simple assault in his criminal history calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-24\">Appellant argues that his simple assault conviction is similar to convictions for disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, hindering or failing to obey a police officer, and resisting arrest, all of which, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l), are not included in a defendant\u2019s criminal history calculation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s argument is without merit; assault is not similar to the offenses listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). <em>See United States v. Elmore, </em>108 F.3d 23, 26-27 (3d Cir.) (assault not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>similar to disorderly conduct), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. , 118 S.Ct. 110, 139 L.Ed.2d 63 (1997); <em>United States v. Russell, </em>913 F.2d 1288, 1294 (8th Cir.1990) (affirming district court\u2019s inclusion of convictions for assault and criminal damage to property in criminal history calculation; court stated that appellant \u201csubmitted no authority for the proposition that assault and criminal damage to property is akin to disorderly conduct or disturbing the peace\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Norman, </em>129 F.3d 1393, 1401 &amp; n. 12 (10th Cir.1997) (stating it would be an absurd result to exclude assault from the criminal history calculation pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l)); <em>United States v. Kemp, </em>938 F.2d 1020, 1023 (9th Cir.1991) (stating that \u201cthe crime of \u2018domestic violence\u2019 under Arizona law includes both disorderly conduct, which is excluded by the explicit language of the Guidelines, and assault, which is included\u201d (footnote omitted)); <em>United States v. Hoelscher, </em>914 F.2d 1527, 1537 (8th Cir.1990) (court noted that assault is not similar to offenses set out in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l) and (2)). We therefore affirm the judgment entered by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1285-25\">.
