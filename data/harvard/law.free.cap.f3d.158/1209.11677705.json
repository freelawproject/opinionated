After review, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">On June 24, 1996, Wilcox filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (the \u201cAEDPA\u201d), effective on April 24, 1996, governs Wilcox\u2019s petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">The AEDPA added a new subsection (d) to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244, providing that a one-year time bar applies to a state prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It also amended \u00a7 2255 to apply a similar one-year limitation to federal prisoners\u2019 \u00a7 2255 petitions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Neither \u00a7 2244(d) nor \u00a7 2255 directly addresses how the one-year deadline applies to prisoners convicted long before the AED-PA \u2014 whether the one-year limitation applies from the effective date of the AEDPA, or whether it applies retroactively from the date of conviction, which in some cases would mean the AEDPA\u2019s one-year deadline expired long before the AEDPA\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-18\">Adopting in full the reasoning and recommendation of the magistrate judge\u2019s report, the district court dismissed Wilcox\u2019s petition as time-barred under \u00a7 2244(d). Although Wilcox filed his petition two months after the AEDPA\u2019s effective date, the magistrate judge specifically concluded that Wilcox\u2019s petition was barred under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) because it was not filed within one year of July 2, 1992, the date on which the mandate issued and the state court\u2019s judgment became final after Wilcox\u2019s direct appeal of his state conviction and sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-20\">On appeal, Wilcox asserts that the magistrate judge erred by retroactively applying the AEDPA\u2019s one-year provision in \u00a7 2244(d) and requiring Wilcox to file his petition within one year after the date his pre-AEDPA conviction became final, even though the AEDPA was not enacted until over five years after that conviction became final. Wilcox asserts that he properly filed his petition within a reasonable time \u2014 here two months \u2014 after the effective date of the AED-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>PA\u2019s imposition of this new one-year requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">After review,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we agree that the district court erred in dismissing Wilcox\u2019s petition as untimely. When the district court entered its order, this Court had not yet addressed the retroactive application of the one-year time bar in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) to petitions of prisoners, like Wilcox, whose convictions became final long prior to the effective date of the AEDPA. However, while Wilcox\u2019s appeal was pending, this Court addressed this issue in <em>Goodman v. United </em>States, 151 F.3d 1335 (11th Cir.1998). In <em>Goodman, </em>this Court determined that federal prisoners whose convictions became final before the AEDPA\u2019s effective date of April 24, 1996, \u201cmust be given a reasonable time after the enactment of \u00a7 105\u2019s one-year \u2018period of limitation\u2019 to file their \u00a7 2255 motions, and, under these circumstances, a reasonable period is until April 23,1997, one year from the date of enactment of \u00a7 105 of the AEDPA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1337. <em>Goodman </em>also cited with approval the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that the one-year period of limitation included in the AEDPA amendment to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 \u201cd[oes] not begin to run against any state prisoner prior to the statute\u2019s date of enactment.\u201d <em>Goodman, </em>151 F.3d at 1337 (citing <em>Calderon v. United States District Court for the Central District of California, </em>128 F.3d 1283, 1287 (9th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 1389, 140 L.Ed.2d 648 (1998)). This Court declared that to hold otherwise and bar this prisoner group from filing habe-as corpus petitions \u201cwould be unfair and impermissibly retroactive.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-14\">Although involving a \u00a7 2255 petition, <em>Goodman </em>noted the similarity of the statute of limitations provisions that apply to petitions filed under \u00a7\u00a7 2254 and 2255. <em>See id. </em>at 1336 n. 2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We find the holding of <em>Goodman </em>should extend to \u00a7 2254 petitions and that Wilcox\u2019s petition was timely filed for purposes of the AEDPA because it was filed within a reasonable time \u2014 within one year from the AEDPA\u2019s effective date.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-15\">Wilson also asserts that he has exhausted .the state remedies available to him and that he should succeed on the merits of his involuntary confession claim. Because the other issues raised by Wilcox in this appeal were not relied on by either the magistrate judge or the district court as a basis for dismissal, we decline to reach those issues for the first time on appeal and remand for the district court to consider them first.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-16\">In conclusion, we reverse the district court\u2019s order dismissing Wilcox\u2019s petition as time-barred under the AEDPA and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-17\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1268-7\">.
