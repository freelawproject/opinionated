(Docs. 37, 38). Also pending are plaintiff's motions to exclude defense expert Michael Levine's testimony, and to strike the affidavit of the undercover officer who assisted in the operation. (Docs. 53, 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, I deny plaintiff's motions and grant defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 13, 2014, Toledo Police arrested Thomas at a local McDonald's. Thomas was \"highly intoxicated\" and had controlled substances on his person. State authorities charged him with several drug offenses and (on account of his daughter's presence) child endangerment. (Doc. 37-2, ID 616-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After his arrest, Sgt. Williams informed Thomas he could \"work off\" his charges if he agreed to act as an informant. Thomas took Sgt. Williams up on the offer and contacted her a week later with information concerning his supplier, Scott Warnka. (Doc. 40, ID 845-46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Warnka sold cocaine at Thomas' workplace, the Toledo Jeep assembly plant, using Thomas' car as the drop off point. Thomas would take money from purchasers inside the plant and leave it in his car. Then, Warnka \"would come up to the Jeep plant, take the money ... and replace it with dope.\" (Doc. 40, ID 847).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sgt. Williams arranged for an undercover officer to meet Warnka for an initial controlled buy on May 13, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 43, ID 917). Thomas told the undercover officer where to find his car and what to expect when Warnka arrived. (Doc. 43, ID 917-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The first buy went off without a hitch. The undercover officer dressed as a Jeep employee and purchased $50 worth of cocaine from Warnka. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Warnka testified that at the time, he was unaware his customer was working for the police. (Warnka Dep. at 13-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Less than a week later, Thomas called Sgt. Williams again. He told her Warnka was eager to \"get rid of\" his supply and planned to \"leave town\" for the weekend, prompting Sgt. Williams to arrange a second controlled buy on May 21, 2014. (Doc. 40, ID 848). This time, the undercover officer contacted Warnka directly, without using Thomas as a go-between. The two again met in Thomas' car outside the Jeep plant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When the undercover officer completed the deal, he remarked that \"everything [was] copasetic\"-signaling to a nearby surveillance team that it was time to move in and make an arrest. (Doc. 43, ID 919-20). Several masked officers rushed the car and arrested Warnka. They also \"arrested\" the officer so as not to blow his cover. (Doc. 40, ID 849-50; Doc. 43, ID 920-21; Warnka Dep. at 41-43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Warnka had realized immediately that Thomas had set him up. No one had explicitly told him as much, but Warnka deduced the connection first, because \"[p]eople who get high don't use th[e] word\" \"copasetic,\" and second, because an unidentified arresting officer told him \"right at the scene\" that he \"just sold to an undercover cop.\" (Warnka Dep. at 42-45).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Warnka bonded out of jail the next day (May 22), and began threatening Thomas via text message that same evening. Thomas reported the texts to Sgt. Williams, who called him within six hours of learning about the threats. (Doc. 37-1, ID 608-12; Warnka Dep. at 49, 59-61; Doc. 40, ID 853).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Sgt. Williams testified that during their conversation, Thomas \"was not concerned\" that Warnka would actually \"do the things that he was threatening\" to do. (Doc. 40, ID 852). He assured her that if Warnka came to his house, he would \"defend himself,\" though \"he said something about not having a CCW.\" (Doc. 37-1, ID 611). Sgt. Williams told him to save the text messages so the state could use them to charge Warnka with intimidation. (Doc. 40, ID 852).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Shifting the conversation back to his work as an informant, Thomas asked Sgt. Williams to get in touch with his employer about an upcoming drug test. He also offered to facilitate a third controlled buy for the Toledo Police \"for free.\" (Doc. 37-1, ID 612).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   That night, John Haugh (one of Warnka's associates) camped outside Thomas' home. When Thomas returned from work in the early morning hours of May 23, 2014, Haugh attacked Thomas, fatally stabbing him. An Ohio jury convicted Haugh of aggravated murder. Warnka pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter for his role in encouraging the attack.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Haugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-8008\">\n    2016-Ohio-8008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207102972\">\n    2016 WL 7102972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *1, *4 (Ohio App.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently filed this \u00a7 1983 action against the City of Toledo and several individual officers, including Sgt. Williams. She seeks damages and injunctive relief requiring defendants to implement \"additional training ... so that [officers] will be better prepared\" to safely conduct confidential-informant investigations. (Doc. 6, ID 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion to Strike the Undercover Officer's Affidavit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In support of their motion for summary judgment, defendants offered an affidavit\n   from the undercover officer who purchased cocaine from Warnka. Przybysz moves to strike that evidence on the theory that it amounts to a \"sham affidavit\"-one that impermissibly, under prevailing Sixth Circuit case law \"directly contradicts, without explanation,\" the officer's \"previous testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Aerel, S.R.L. v. PCC Airfoils, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3113026\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/899/#p908\">\n    448 F.3d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 908 (6th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The rule against sham affidavits prevents a party from submitting a post-deposition affidavit that contradicts his earlier sworn testimony.\n   <em>\n    France v. Lucas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353280\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/612/#p622\">\n    836 F.3d 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 622 (6th Cir. 2016). Plaintiff contends it applies here because the undercover officer gave conflicting accounts about his use of the term \"copasetic\" during the controlled buy leading to Warnka's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Specifically, in his affidavit, the undercover officer attested that he used the word \"copasetic\" during both the May 14, and May 21, transactions. (Doc. 37-3, ID 620-21). Yet, according to plaintiff, the officer \"never testified\" that he used \"copasetic\" during the May 14, purchase in his deposition. Rather, she claims the undercover officer testified that he used the term only during the May 21, purchase as a signal to initiate Warnka's arrest. (Doc. 54, ID 1323).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff is mistaken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although Przybysz's counsel did not specifically question him about the language he used during the May 14, purchase, the undercover officer volunteered that he did, in fact, use \"copasetic\" in on both occasions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Q: When you used the word 'copasetic' the first time, did Scott Warnka turn around and say, 'What did you say?'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A: Well, the first time that day was one thing. But I had used it the first time at the first buy. That's why we used it as this code word [during the second buy].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (Doc. 43, ID 920).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   I must strike a sham affidavit where a party uses it to create a disputed issue of fact in the face of previous testimony \"indicat[ing] that no such dispute exists.\"\n   <em>\n    Aerel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3113026\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/899/#p908\">\n    448 F.3d at 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"This is a far cry, however, from preventing a party who was not directly questioned about an issue from supplementing incomplete deposition testimony with a sworn [non-contradictory] affidavit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3113026\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/899/#p908\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Briggs v.

That is all defendants do here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Przybysz has not identified any contradiction, much less the type of \"clear, direct contradiction\" ordinarily necessary to exclude an affidavit.\n   <em>\n    Siewertsen v.

Motion to Exclude Defense Expert's Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Next, plaintiff moves to exclude the testimony of defendants' expert, Michael Levine. Levine testified that, \"in consideration of the totality of [the] circumstances,\" Sgt.

Ohio 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Przybysz challenges Levine's testimony on all three grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Levine's Qualifications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, plaintiff argues that Levine \"does not have the requisite, relevant law enforcement experience\" necessary to testify as an expert because he retired from the United States Drug Enforcement Agency in 1990. (Doc. 53, ID 1276, 1280). Her observation touches on only one aspect of Levine's resume while ignoring the larger whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Levine worked in federal law enforcement for approximately twenty-five years, splitting his time between the DEA and the United States Department of Justice. (Doc. 53-1, ID 1286). One of his \"primary positions\" was that of an \"undercover special agent ... working with informants, making street buys to much larger buys in ... the enforcement of narcotic laws.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1283). His investigations ranged from large international drug trafficking cases \"right down to street level\" cases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"A good portion\" of Levine's work included the \"flipping of informants\" from offenders into \"assets\" for government investigations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In 1973, Levine authored a DEA training manual on \"informant and undercover [investigation] tactics.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1285). Later, he supervised a group of fifteen to twenty agents, each of whom \"handl[ed] numbers\" of \"undercover cases ... generated from ... street level\" informants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1283).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Regarding his supervisory duties, Levine explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   During my 17 years supervisory service with the DEA, in accordance with Department of Justice and DEA training and [standard operating procedures], I was also made responsible for the initial investigation of all allegations and/or complaints emanating from the use of undercover tactics and/or informant handling procedures, occurring under my command ... I had occasion to investigate said incidents occurring in [the] DEA, NYPD, FBI, BATF, US Customs, New York State Police, Miami Police, US Immigration and Naturalization Officers and other police agencies involved in DEA task force organization units.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   (Doc. 50-3, ID 1005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On retiring in 1990, Levine became a trial consultant, representing both private\n   and government interests. (Doc. 53-1, ID 1284). His resume lists a plethora of cases he has worked on since 2007 alone, a number of which involved \"oversight of undercover investigative and informant handling practices.\" (Doc. 50-3, ID 1030-40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Apart from his work as a trial consultant, Levine also contracts with state and federal agencies to train law enforcement agencies and officers in \"informant handling and undercover tactics.\" (Doc. 53-1, ID 1284). Between 2008 and 2012, for instance, Levine taught courses on informant and undercover investigations for \"New York Police agencies throughout the state.\" In 2014, the State Department retained him to teach a similar course for the Brazilian federal police. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1285). And since 2003, two Georgia district attorneys' offices have had Levine on retainer as a trial consultant, case reviewer, and expert witness in police-involved shootings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 50-3, ID 1000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Given Levine's lengthy and relevant experience, defendants have carried their burden to prove his qualification as an expert in the \"discrete police-practice\" of street level undercover and informant investigations.\n   <em>\n    Champion v.

But the \"inaccuracies\" plaintiff identifies are well-supported in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For instance, Przybysz disputes Levine's claim that Thomas was \"eager\" to be an informant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1276). Thomas\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   eager to be an informant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   He contacted Sgt. Williams after his arrest, volunteering information about Warnka, and volunteering to introduce Warnka to the undercover officer. Thomas also warned Sgt. Williams that Warnka was looking to sell a larger amount of cocaine and could be leaving the area, encouraging her to initiate a second controlled purchase. And even after Warnka threatened him, Thomas offered to assist the police in another controlled buy \"for free.\" (Doc. 37-1, ID 612).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Przybysz also takes issue Levine's characterization of Thomas as an \"experienced 'street dealer.' \" (Doc. 53, ID 1276). Thomas\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   an experienced street dealer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   He told Sgt. Williams that he regularly helped Warnka sell cocaine at the Jeep Assembly Plant. This, moreover, was not Thomas' first foray into the local drug trade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In 2012, another undercover officer for the Toledo Police Department sought a warrant for Thomas' arrest after learning that he was selling suboxone, \"a drug heroin\n   users use to step down from heroin.\" (Doc. 37-4, ID 623).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Levine also had access to Thomas' criminal history report, which detailed a prior burglary in which Thomas made off with the victim's prescription drugs. (Doc. 50-3, ID 1029; Doc. 59-2, ID 1448-52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Where Przybysz does find factual errors in Levine's testimony, they are inconsequential to the expert's broader conclusions. Levine's report, for example, indicates that Thomas facilitated the second controlled buy for \"$700 worth of cocaine,\" when in fact the undercover officer purchased $300 worth of cocaine-an error Levine resolved at his deposition by explaining that he took the $700 figure from an arrest report. (Doc. 53, ID 1276; Doc. 53-1, ID 1291-92).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Levine likewise noted that Toledo Police arrested Thomas for selling suboxone in 2012. (Doc. 53, ID 1276). On the record before me, it is not clear that they did. But it is at least clear that authorities issued a warrant for such an arrest, because defendants attached that warrant to their motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 59, ID 1397; Doc. 37-4, ID 622-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Arrest or no arrest, the takeaway from this information is the same: the Toledo Police had probable cause to believe Thomas was selling prescription drugs in 2012. That fact, along with Thomas' admission to selling cocaine at the Jeep Assembly plant, reasonably informed Levine's characterization of Thomas as an \"experienced\" dealer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   I must exclude expert testimony based on \"mere guess or speculation.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Bearing that role in mind, I find that Levine adequately connected his experience to his conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Levine testified, for example, that Sgt. Williams planned to arrest Warnka immediately after the second buy based on what he described as \"exigent circumstances\"-\"exigent in the sense that it would put a police officer running this particular case in a circumstance where she should make an arrest, should take action to stop the man from leaving the jurisdiction.\" (Doc. 53-1, ID 1295). Thomas told Sgt. Williams that Warnka was planning to leave the area for the weekend. This, according to Levine, created a \"certain urgency to get [Warnka] before he left town with the quantity of drugs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Looking \"through the eyes of somebody who's been deeply involved with that level of narcotic enforcement,\" Levine also emphasized that threats to informants \"come along with about 90 percent of these cases.\" (Doc. 53-1, ID 1300). Not all are serious. While some threats may warrant protective measures, Levine recalled that he often \"took no action,\" or implemented \"no [protective] measures at all.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   He believed \"under the circumstances\" that Sgt. Williams' decision to call Thomas, but take no further action, was reasonable based on what she reported about their conversation. Levine noted that rather than asking Sgt. Williams for protection, Thomas was \"more interested in continuing his career as an ... undercover informant.\" (Doc. 53-1, ID 1300). Sgt. Williams could therefore reasonably believe that Thomas could, as he said, \"handle it\" himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1299).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   On the whole, Levine is qualified, his testimony is record-supported, and he explained how his experience led to his belief that Sgt.

According to the court in\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   No one advised Hilliard that she would have to, nor did she agree to, \"testify and reveal [her] status.\" She simply agreed to help the officer apprehend a drug dealer. There was no discussion of any future need for her help after the traffic stop that would lead to Raqib's arrest, nor was there any apparent likelihood that the police would publicly reveal her identity following Raqib's arrest. Thus, unlike the facts in\n   <em>\n    Summar\n   </em>\n   , Hilliard's voluntary election to serve as a confidential informant did not come with conditions that would have put her on notice that her identity would eventually become public under the agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Moreover, Officer Woloweic \"directly disclosed Hilliard's identity to the person he was supposed to protect her from by telling [Clark] about the setup.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 701. This \"placed Hilliard in special danger by increasing the likelihood that a private actor would deprive her of her liberty interest in personal security.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Przybysz notes that like Hilliard, Thomas' \"voluntary election to serve as a confidential informant did not come with conditions that would have put [him] on notice\" that his identity could be revealed to Warnka.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 700. She is correct; Sgt. Williams testified she and Thomas never discussed the possibility that he would testify against Warnka in court. (Doc. 40, ID 851).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Also like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , Przybysz claims that the Toledo Police \"created and increased\" the danger to Thomas by \"recklessly arresting\" Warnka and revealing that he sold drugs to an undercover officer. (Doc. 38, ID 682). Of course, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , no officer in this case actually told Warnka that Thomas \"informed on him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 698.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   But setting aside that distinguishing fact, Przybysz faces another, more substantial obstacle: in this case, there is no evidence that Sgt. Williams-the person plaintiff seeks to hold individually liable for her son's death-was the unidentified officer who told Warnka that he \"just sold to an undercover cop.\" (Warnka Dep. at 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In the \u00a7 1983 context, this defect is fatal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Section 1983 is an individual-liability statute. Thus, \"case law teaches that in order to impose individual liability upon a law officer engaging in unconstitutional misconduct, it is a plaintiff's burden to specifically link the officer's involvement to the constitutional infirmity.\"\n   <em>\n    Burley v.

Even if telling Warnka that he \"just sold to an undercover cop\" is comparable to the \"explicit[ ]\" identification in\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , 845 F.3d at 698, there is no evidence that Sgt.

Williams also completed an \"undercover survival\" training course, \"designed to allow students to observe and review undercover operations that culminated with violence against the undercover officer and arrest teams.\" The course included cases studies \"specifically selected for their relevance to the types of narcotic investigation[s] ... typically conducted\" by Toledo Police Officers. (Doc. 37-5, ID 625-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   And notwithstanding the tragic outcome in this case, the facts demonstrate that Sgt. Williams' training was constitutionally adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Sgt. Williams contacted Thomas within six hours of learning that Warnka was threatening him. Thomas told her, however, that he was not fearful of Warnka, and was \"able to protect himself.\" (Doc. 37-1, ID 608). He \"was not actually concerned for his safety for various reasons, one of them being\" his past friendship with Warnka, and another being his desire to continue to work as an informant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 609).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Sgt. Williams also ran a criminal background check on Warnka, and knew that Warnka's record \"contained no crimes of violence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). What is more, Sgt. Williams did not suggest that Warnka could threaten Thomas without consequence. She advised Thomas to save the text messages, with the hope of later pressing intimidation charges against Warnka.

In relevant part, political subdivisions are only liable in the following situations, as detailed in O.R.C. \u00a7 2744.02(B) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   (2) Except as otherwise provided in sections 3314.07 and 3746.24 of the Revised Code, political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by the negligent performance of acts by their employees with respect to proprietary functions of the political subdivisions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   (4) Except as otherwise provided in section 3746.24 of the Revised Code, political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property that is caused by the negligence of their employees and that occurs within or on the grounds of, and is due to physical defects within or on the grounds of, buildings that are used in connection with the performance of a governmental function, including, but not limited to, office buildings and courthouses, but not including jails, places of juvenile detention, workhouses, or any other detention facility, as defined in section 2921.01 of the Revised Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   (5) In addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B) (1) to (4) of this section, a political subdivision is liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property when civil liability is expressly imposed upon the political subdivision by a section of the Revised Code, including, but not limited to, sections 2743.02 and 5591.37 of the Revised Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Police services are defined as a governmental, rather than proprietary, function in Ohio. O.R.C. \u00a7 2744.01(C)(2)(a), and so the lower standard of negligence in the course of performing proprietary functions afforded by ORC \u00a7 2744.02(B)(2) cannot apply. Plaintiff alleges no violation of law meeting the other statutory exceptions to immunity, such as injury due to a government building's physical defect or other express imposition of civil liability under the Revised Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   As for Sgt. Williams, plaintiff contends she is not immune from suit because Sgt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Williams undertook her \"acts or omissions ... in a wanton or reckless manner.\" O.R.C. \u00a7 2744.03(A)(6)(b).
