Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioners have been involved in the oil and gas business in Kazakhstan for approximately 17 years. Between 1999 and 2000, petitioners purchased controlling shares in two Kazakh companies, Kazpolmunay LLP (\"KPM\") and Tolkynneftagaz LLP (\"TNG\"). Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 28-30. The companies owned the subsoil use rights to the Borankol oil field, the Tolkyn gas field, and the Tabyl exploration block in Kazakhstan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. Petitioners eventually came to own 100% of KPM and TNG, and in 2000, those companies obtained approval from Kazakhstan to explore and develop various oil and gas fields located in the country.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31; Arb. Award [Dkt. # 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4] (\"Award\") \u00b6 229. A year later, in 2001, petitioners, through KPM and TNG, invested more than one billion dollars in the development of the Borankol and Tolkyn fields, and the Tabyl Block. Pet. \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2008, Kazakhstan began a government investigation of Anatolie Stati and his companies, including his compliance with export tax laws. Award \u00b6\u00b6 296-99. Petitioners and respondent disagree on what followed. According to petitioners, the government of Kazakhstan began to intimidate and harass petitioners into selling their investments to the state-owned company KazMunaiGas at a substantial discount. Pet. \u00b6 33. Specifically, petitioners claim that Kazakhstan \"baselessly\" accused petitioners of fraud and forgery, levied more than $70 million dollars in back taxes, arrested KPM's general manager for \"illegal entrepreneurial activity,\" and ultimately seized all of KPM and TNG's assets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And on July 21, 2010, Kazakhstan terminated petitioners' subsoil use contracts. Award \u00b6 611.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Kazakhstan's version of events is that the Kazakh Tax and Customs Committee properly assessed $62 million dollars in taxes to petitioners, and that a lawful criminal investigation by the Kazakh authorities led to the arrest and imprisonment of KPM's General Director. Award \u00b6\u00b6 394, 430, 440, 492. Respondent maintains that it was the investigation that led to the termination of KPM and TNG's subsoil use contracts on July 21, 2010, and it disputes the claim that Kazakhstan expropriated petitioners' assets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 591-611. Instead, respondent takes the position that the Kazakh state oil company and its subsidiary placed petitioners' oil and gas fields into trust management on a temporary basis only.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 611.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 26, 2010, petitioners filed a Request for Arbitration with the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (\"SCC\") in Sweden. Req. for Arb., Ex. C. to Decl. of Charlene C. Sun [Dkt. # 2-6] (\"Req. for Arb.\"). The request states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Over the past two years, Kazakhstan has engaged in a campaign of harassment and illegal acts against [petitioners] that culminated on July 21, 2010 with the State's notice of unilateral termination of the companies' Subsoil Use Contracts, the illegal expropriation of [petitioners'] Kazakh investments, and the subsequent commandeering of [petitioners'] offices by personnel of State-owned\n   KazMunaiGas and the Kazakh Ministry of Oil and Gas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Petitioners further alleged that Kazakhstan's harassment \"clearly had expropriation as its ultimate goal, and it had the effect in the process of destroying both the market value and alienability of [petitioners'] investments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8. The request invoked the Energy Charter Treaty (\"ECT\"), an international agreement signed by the respondent, which allows investors to submit disputes to the SCC for arbitration. Energy Charter Treaty, art. 26(4)(c), Dec. 17, 1994, 2080 U.N.T.S. 95, 121-22. Accordingly, the arbitral proceedings were governed by the SCC's Arbitration Rules. Pet. \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 19, 2013, the SCC tribunal issued an award in favor of petitioners and against respondent. Pet. \u00b6 27. The tribunal determined that Kazakhstan breached its obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment under Article 10(1) of the ECT. Award \u00b6\u00b6 1085-95. It awarded petitioners $497,685,101 for the alleged expropriation of petitioners' assets in Kazakhstan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1859. This total included $277.8 million for the Borankol and Tolkyn oil and gas fields, $31.3 million for the subsoil use contracts, $199 million for an unfinished liquefied petroleum gas plant (\"LPG plant\"), and $8,975,496.40 in legal costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1856-61, 1885.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 30, 2014, petitioners asked this Court to confirm the arbitral award in the United States pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , which codifies the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, June 10, 1958, 330 U.N.T.S. 38, commonly known as the \"New York Convention.\" Pet. \u00b6 1.

Respondent opposed the petition to confirm based on five grounds under the New York Convention, focusing primarily on the SCC's appointment of respondent's arbitrator and its alleged failure to enforce the requirement that there be a three-month settlement period prior to the initiation of an arbitration. Resp't's Opp. to Pet. [Dkt. # 20] (\"Resp't's Opp.\"). Petitioners filed a reply, Pet'rs' Reply Mem. in Supp. of Pet. [Dkt. # 24] (\"Pet'rs' Reply\"), and the Court granted respondent leave to file a sur-reply. Resp't's Sur-Reply in Supp. of Resp't's Opp. [Dkt. # 28] (\"Resp't's Sur-Reply\").

Under Article V(2)(b) the Court could refuse recognition of the award because enforcement of a fraudulently obtained arbitral award would be contrary to United States public policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And respondent also asserted that \"the intentional giving of false evidence\" during the arbitration \"denied [respondent] the opportunity to present its case,\" thus rendering the arbitral award unenforceable under Article V(1)(b) of the New York Convention.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    at 5-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the absence of an applicable rule setting forth the standard to be applied to respondent's motion, the Court considered whether justice required permitting respondent to \"add new grounds to its opposition to the petition to confirm the award, more than a year after the original opposition was filed.\" Order (May 11, 2016) [Dkt. # 36] at 2-3 (\"Order\"). The Court reviewed the SCC arbitration award and denied the motion, reasoning that \"it [would] not be in the interest of justice to conduct a mini-trial on the issue of fraud here when the arbitrators expressly disavowed any reliance on the allegedly fraudulent material.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Pet'rs' Mem. of P. &amp; A. in Opp. to Resp't's Mot. for Recons. [Dkt. # 38] (\"Pet'rs' Opp.\"). Petitioners pointed out that Kazakhstan \"has the opportunity to litigate the very same fraud allegations in the courts of Sweden, which is the seat of the arbitration and primary jurisdiction in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Respondent confirmed that the parties were litigating the fraud issue in Sweden, where it was seeking to vacate the award, but it argued that the Swedish proceeding should not affect the Court's review of the petition to confirm, or the motion for reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Recons.

The Swedish proceedings to vacate the arbitral award.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In light of the pendency of the Swedish proceedings to vacate the award, this Court exercised its discretion to stay this\n   case pending the resolution of the proceedings before the Svea Court of Appeal in Sweden, noting that they \"could have a dramatic impact on the petition to confirm the arbitration award.\"\n   <em>\n    Stati\n   </em>\n   , 199 F.Supp.3d at 193. It observed that if \"respondent [was] successful in the set-aside proceeding [in Sweden], confirmation of the award [would] be unlikely\" in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , citing New York Convention, art. V(1)(e) (providing that enforcement of an award may be refused when the \"award ... has been set aside ... by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made\"). In that same ruling, the Court found that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute under the FAA and the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 184-190.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On December 9, 2016, the Svea Court of Appeal issued its decision upholding the Award and rejecting Kazakhstan's arguments, including the argument that the Award should be vacated in light of the alleged fraud. Svea Court of Appeal J., Exs. 1-3 to Joint Report (Dec. 30, 2016) [Dkt. # 45-1, 45-2, 45-3] \u00a7 5.3.1 (\"Svea Court of Appeal Opinion\"). Kazakhstan presented at least two theories of fraud before the Svea Court of Appeal. First, it argued, much as it had before this Court, that the Stati parties had submitted false evidence on the value of the LPG plant in the form of sworn testimony and expert reports during the arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.1.2.1. Second, respondent argued that the award was tainted by fraud that took place prior to the start of the arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It alleged that representatives for the Stati parties presented financial statements that falsely inflated the amounts invested in the LPG plant to a third-party company, KMG, and that KMG was fraudulently induced into bidding $199 million for the LPG plant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to respondent, since it was the KMG bid that was used by the tribunal to value the LPG plant, the arbitral award was procured by fraud.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Following a review of the full record, the Svea Court of Appeal rejected all of Kazakhstan's contentions. First, it concluded that \"[s]ince the arbitral tribunal based its assessment [of the LPG plant] on the indicative bid\" and not the allegedly false \"witness testimony, witness affidavits, and expert reports\" submitted by the Stati parties during the arbitration, this evidence did not have \"immediate importance for the outcome.\" Svea Court of Appeal J., Ex. 3 to Joint Report (Dec. 30, 2016) [Dkt. # 45-3] at 45.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Svea Court of Appeal recited the legal principle that \"there can be no question of declaring an arbitral award invalid solely on the ground that false evidence or untrue testimony has occurred, when it is not clear that such have been directly decisive for the outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Since \"even if [the evidence] were proven to be false,\" it would not have changed the outcome of the arbitration, the court deemed it insufficient to invalidate the award.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, the Svea Court of Appeal concluded that because the KMG indicative bid was made \"prior to the initiation of the\n   arbitration,\" the bid did not constitute \"\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   \" false evidence, even if \"possibly incorrect information regarding the amount invested in the LPG plant was among the factors that KMG took into account when calculating the size of its offer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46. It concluded that the allegedly false financial statements \"did not directly constitute any basis for the arbitral tribunal's assessment of the value of the LPG plant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In other words, any alleged dishonesty in business transactions that preceded the arbitration proceedings did not constitute a fraud on the tribunal and was too remote to warrant annulment of the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Kazakhstan then challenged the decision in the Swedish Supreme Court, arguing that the Svea Court of Appeal committed \"grave procedural error\" when it issued its decision. Ex. B. to Decl. of Alexander Foerster [Dkt. # 46-2] \u00b6 3. This Court continued its stay pending the resolution of that proceeding, Min. Order (Apr. 3, 2017); Min. Order (Aug. 15, 2017), and petitioners moved to lift the stay on September 29, 2017. Pet'rs' Mot. to Lift Stay [Dkt. # 60]. Before this Court ruled on that motion, the Swedish Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Stati parties on October 24, 2017. Pet'rs' Suppl. Status Report Concerning Status of Proceedings in Sweden [Dkt. # 64]. This marked the end of Kazakhstan's efforts to set aside the arbitral award in the jurisdiction with the sole authority to vacate the arbitral award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Since the Swedish award was now final and binding, the Court granted petitioners' motion to lift the stay on November 6, 2017, and it invited the parties to file supplemental briefs discussing what impact, if any, the decisions by the Swedish authorities should have on the resolution of Kazakhstan's pending motion for reconsideration of the Court's May 11, 2016, Order denying respondent's request to introduce additional defense grounds based upon its fraud allegations. Min. Order (Nov. 6, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Kazakhstan argued that the decisions by the Svea Court of Appeal and the Swedish Supreme Court based on Swedish law should have no impact on the issue presented in its motion for reconsideration because \"neither of these decisions made factual findings regarding the merits of Kazakhstan's fraud allegations, nor did they apply the New York Convention,\" as this Court is required to do. Kazakhstan's Resp. to Nov. 6, 2017, Min. Order [Dkt. # 65] (\"Resp't's Resp. to Nov. 6 Min. Order\"). Meanwhile, petitioners emphasized that respondent presented its \"fraud case in full\" to the Svea Court of Appeal, the seat of the arbitral award, which concluded \"[t]hat the Award was not the product of fraud,\" and its ruling was left undisturbed by the Swedish Supreme Court.

Petitioners also argued that the Court should deny respondent's motion based on the principles of preclusion and comity,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-10, and respondent argued in a sur-reply that the principles of preclusion and comity are inapplicable.

Furthermore, the Court did not err in evaluating the facts that\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   before it when respondent filed its initial motion,\n   and accordingly reconsideration on this ground is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In its initial motion to include additional defenses, respondent alleged that petitioners and their representatives had submitted false sworn testimony and expert reports \"during the SCC Arbitration\" that \"fraudulently and materially misrepresented the LPG Plant construction costs for which they claimed reimbursement.\" Initial Mot. at 3, 4. In other words, respondent accused petitioners of defrauding the tribunal directly. The Court found that since the arbitrators expressly disavowed reliance on either parties' valuations in determining the amount of the damages, the alleged fraud had no effect on the outcome of the arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order at 3-4, citing Award \u00b6\u00b6 1746-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Kazakhstan attempts to discredit the Court's finding by positing, without support, that the Court simply \"relied on the Stati party's representations in their Opposition Brief\" when it reached its conclusion.

Since the Court's ruling was expressly based upon the language in the arbitral award, this hypothesis does not warrant serious consideration, much less a revision of the terms of the Order.

Mot. for Recons. at 3, 9-10. Kazakhstan alleges that prior to the start of the arbitration, representatives for the Stati parties presented KMG with false financial statements that inflated the value of the plant and fraudulently induced KMG to offer $199 million for the plant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.

Mot. for Recons. at 1 n. 3. But it is apparent that these facts go to the very heart of respondent's current defense and that they support an entirely separate theory of fraud that respondent did not seek leave to introduce. Since respondent is not claiming that the evidence of KMG's fraudulent inducement was not available to it at the time it filed its initial motion, but rather that it simply elected not to raise it, the Court finds that those facts are improperly raised now.

This provision is referred to by the parties as the \"cooling-off period.\" Respondent claims that this requirement was a jurisdictional prerequisite to the tribunal's authority. Resp't's Opp. at 28. It asserts that the SCC's failure to enforce the cooling-off period prior to the arbitration means that Kazakhstan \"made no valid offer to [p]etitioners to arbitrate and certainly did not consent to arbitrate\" even though Kazakhstan participated in the arbitration for nearly three years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court's prior Memorandum Opinion concerning its subject matter jurisdiction in this case addressed the arguments brought by respondent under this defense.\n   <em>\n    Stati\n   </em>\n   , 199 F.Supp.3d at 184-90. Based on the language of the ECT, the Court concluded that Kazakhstan gave its unconditional consent to arbitrate subject\n   only to two exceptions that do not relate to the cooling-off period. The Court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   While it does appear that the contractual requirement to attempt to come to a negotiated resolution is mandatory [under the ECT], that provision does not serve as a condition precedent to the contracting parties' consent to international arbitration. Article 26(3)(a) of the ECT specifies: \"[s]ubject\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its\n   <em>\n    unconditional\n   </em>\n   consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30, art. 26(3)(a) (emphasis added). Although respondent is correct that article 26(3) requires arbitration to proceed in accordance with article 26's provisions, including the three-month settlement period, the international arbitration provision does not act as a condition precedent to a party's consent, which is \"[s]ubject\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to subparagraphs (b) and (c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 185-86.

This standard was satisfied by the two letters sent by the SCC dated August 5, 2010, and August 27, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Respondent does not dispute that it received the two SCC letters. Instead it argues that the content of the communications was inadequate because the letters did not state explicitly that Kazakhstan was supposed to appoint an arbitrator by a specific deadline. Resp't's Opp. at 16-17, 40. This is not borne out by the documents themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The first SCC letter dated, August 5, 2010, stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   In accordance with Article 5 of the SCC Rules, you are requested to submit and Answer to the SCC, by 26 August 2010 at the latest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   First Notification at 2. Article 5(1)(v) of the SCC Arbitration Rules provides that an Answer:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Shall include ... if applicable, the name, address, telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address of the arbitrator appointed by Respondent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Ex. 1 to Resp't's Opp. [Dkt. # 20-2] (\"SCC Arbitration Rules\") at 7. So the notice plainly informed respondent of the date by which it was to name an arbitrator. In the event there was any ambiguity about that, the SCC included two attachments with the letter: the Arbitration Rules and petitioners' Request for Arbitration, which laid out petitioner's proposal on how to constitute the tribunal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20L.%20Ed.%20865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Req. for Arb. \u00b6\u00b6 111-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Furthermore, Article 5(3) establishes that, \"[f]ailure by the [r]espondent to submit an Answer shall not prevent the arbitration from proceeding.\" SCC Arbitration Rules at 8. Both provisions were plainly applicable in this situation and the Court finds that the first letter along with its attachments reasonably put respondent on notice of its obligation to submit an Answer and proffer an arbitrator. Furthermore, the respondent received a second opportunity to be heard, when the SCC sent a second notification and extended its deadline. In the second letter, the SCC again directed respondent to \"submit an Answer in accordance with Article 5 of the SCC Rules\" and warned that \"failure to submit an Answer does not prevent the arbitration from proceeding.\" Second Notification at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Faced with respondent's failure to respond, the SCC Board reasonably went ahead and appointed an arbitrator on respondent's behalf as it is permitted to do under the SCC's default rules. Under Article 12 of the SCC rules, \"[w]here the parties have not agreed on the number of arbitrators, the Arbitral Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators ....\" SCC Arbitration Rules at 9. Article 13(1) of the SCC Arbitration Rules allows the SCC to set the time period by which to appoint an arbitrator if the parties have not agreed to a time period.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20L.%20Ed.%20865\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And Article 13(3) further provides that \"[w]here a party fails to appoint an arbitrator(s) within the stipulated time period, the Board shall make the appointment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Respondent later chose to object to the appointment of its arbitrator and the SCC took its arguments into consideration, along with petitioners' objections, and found that there were no grounds on which to disqualify the arbitrator appointed on behalf of respondent. Ex. 18 to Resp't's Opp. [Dkt. # 20-19].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Thus, the Court finds that respondent was \"reasonably\" informed of the proceeding and its obligation to appoint an arbitrator and given an \"opportunity to be heard.\"\n   <em>\n    Mullane,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"362818\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/339/306/#p314\">\n    339 U.S. at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"362818\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/339/306/#p314\">\n    70 S.Ct. 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Respondent's inability to appoint its arbitrator was not due to a lack of notice but rather a lack of timely participation on its part.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bernstein Seawell &amp; Kove v.

Respondent never sought an extension of time and the SCC gave it additional time on its own initiative. Moreover, the Court finds that the amount of time was reasonable particularly since the parties agreed to conduct the arbitral proceedings under the SCC rules, and respondent does not claim that the 32 day timeframe was inconsistent with those rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Given all of these reasons, the Court finds that respondent received \"proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator\" and it rejects its defenses under Article V(1)(b) of the New York Convention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Article V(1)(d) of the New York Convention is inapplicable.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Next, respondent asserts that the arbitral award is unenforceable under Article V(1)(d) of the New York Convention which allows a court to deny enforcement of an arbitral award if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   [T]he composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the alleged agreement of the parties, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   New York Convention, art. V(1)(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Respondent makes three arguments under this provision, two of which simply repeat prior arguments. First, respondent argues that the SCC failed to comply with its own rules relating to the appointment of arbitrators. Second, it asserts that the SCC failed to enforce the cooling-off period as it was required to do under the ECT. Last, it maintains that the tribunal committed other procedural errors relating to the admission and weight of evidence during the proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Court has already addressed the first two points in Sections II.A-B and finds that the same reasoning applies here. The Court finds that the SCC did not violate its rules when it appointed an arbitrator on respondent's behalf. The rules plainly allow for the SCC to do so when, as here, a party fails to appoint an arbitrator by the set deadline. And a party's failure to respond does not halt the proceedings, including the appointment of the arbitrator. As to the cooling-off period, the Court defers to the tribunal's conclusion that this procedural requirement was satisfied when the tribunal imposed a three-month stay at respondent's request. Furthermore, the Court notes that when a \"party's challenge involves an application of the arbitral institution's own rules, courts typically have deferred to the arbitral panel's interpretation of them.\"\n   <em>\n    Belize Bank Ltd. v.
