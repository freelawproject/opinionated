The Court has carefully considered the Complaint for Damages and Demand for Jury Trial [ECF No. 1] (\"Complaint\"), the responses and replies to the Motions, and the applicable law and is otherwise fully advised. For the reasons that follow, the Motions are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, Joseph Fischer, is a real estate investor who runs a small real estate investment business that purchases, repairs, and sells real property. Plaintiff obtained a loan from the \"Bank\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   secured by a mortgage on an investment property located in Pompano Beach, Florida (the \"Investment Property\"). Plaintiff made timely monthly payments and otherwise complied with all terms of his mortgage and note, including his obligation to make payments to an escrow account for use by the Bank to pay Plaintiff's creditors. Notwithstanding Plaintiff's timely escrow payments, the Bank failed to pay Plaintiff's property taxes for several years during the term of the loan. The Bank ultimately paid the taxes, fees, and accumulated interest to prevent a lien from being placed on the Investment Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Bank subsequently sought to charge Plaintiff for the incurred penalties, late fees, and underlying property taxes. Plaintiff notified the Bank that the charges were improper because he had already paid the amounts owed for his taxes into the designated escrow fund. However, the Bank continued to attempt to collect these amounts from Plaintiff. To that end, on May 7, 2013, the Bank filed a foreclosure lawsuit in Broward County, Florida, case number CACE-13-011475, alleging that Plaintiff failed to make required payments on the loan. On October 13, 2015, the Bank\n   ended the suit by filing a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. Despite the dismissal of the foreclosure action, the Bank continued to harass Plaintiff with phone calls and by reporting a deficiency on Plaintiff's credit report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 30, 2017, Plaintiff commenced this action. Plaintiff's Complaint asserts one federal claim under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (Count I), invoking federal question jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and six state law claims (Counts II-VII), invoking the Court's diversity jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 1] \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2.

In addition, Rushmore argues that the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act claim, alleged solely against Rushmore, fails because the debt at issue is not a consumer debt. The Court addresses the arguments below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

[ECF No. 1] \u00b6\u00b6 26-27. Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim under the FDCPA because Plaintiff's loan does not constitute consumer \"debt\" as it was obtained primarily for a business investment purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff responds by arguing that the loan constitutes consumer debt because the Investment Property was purchased as a \"personal investment in order to provide additional income to his household\" and that the residential nature of the property limits its use to \"personal, family, or household purposes.\" [ECF No. 40] \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. Plaintiff also argues that he entered\n   into the mortgage as an individual, not a business entity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.
