INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Paul Fritch, a career Foreign Service Officer employed by Defendant U.S. Department of State, filed this lawsuit under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), seeking review of the Foreign Service Grievance Board's rulings regarding two administrative grievances he filed. In his first grievance, Plaintiff complained that he was deprived of certain benefits, such as promotion consideration, during a five-year assignment to serve as Director of the Office of the Secretary General for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (\"OSCE\"). Defendant deemed Plaintiff ineligible for those benefits because his assignment to OSCE was done through a \"separation and transfer\" agreement, instead of a \"detail.\" The Foreign Service Grievance Board\n   (\"FSGB\" or \"Board\") affirmed the denial of Plaintiff's first grievance, and this court upheld that decision.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fritch v. U.S. Dep't of State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270996\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/220/51/\">\n    220 F.Supp.3d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2016) (granting partial summary judgment in favor of Defendant on Counts I and II of the Amended Complaint).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After the FSGB denied his first grievance, Plaintiff filed a second grievance in which he argued that he was entitled to certain benefits upon his re-employment with Defendant in June 2012, as a consequence of his separation and transfer to the OSCE. The Board, however, dismissed Plaintiff's second grievance based upon the common law doctrine of claim preclusion. That ruling is the subject of the dispute now before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon consideration of the parties' submissions and the present record, the court concludes that the Board's decision to dismiss Plaintiff's second grievance was neither arbitrary and capricious nor contrary to law. Accordingly, the court grants Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and denies Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

J., ECF No. 48 [hereinafter Pl.'s Cross-Mot.], at 3. In 2007, Plaintiff applied, and was ultimately selected, for the position of Director of the Office of the Secretary General of the OSCE. Def.'s Mot. at 6; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 4. After Plaintiff accepted the position, State determined that Plaintiff's assignment to OSCE was properly effectuated via a \"separation and transfer\" agreement, whereby Plaintiff was formally separated from State and transferred to OSCE but retained the right to resume his employment at State upon concluding his tenure with OSCE. Def.'s Mot. at 6-7; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 4. Importantly, Plaintiff was not \"detailed\" to work at OSCE, which would have resulted in Plaintiff remaining a State employee even while performing work for OSCE.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270996\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/220/51/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff served as Director of the Office of the Secretary General at the OSCE from September 2007 through March 2012, and was re-employed by State in June 2012. Def.'s Mot. at 7; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 4-5. On August 7, 2012, Plaintiff filed a grievance with State (\"First Grievance\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 7; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 5. In his First Grievance, Plaintiff primarily argued that the Department was incorrect in treating his time at OSCE as a separation and transfer, instead of a detail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 7-8; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 5. As a result of that error, he asserted, Defendant had improperly denied him consideration for promotion within the Foreign Service while working at OSCE.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270996\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/220/51/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Admin.

Def.'s Mot. at 8; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   State denied Plaintiff's First Grievance, and Plaintiff appealed to the FSGB. Def.'s Mot. at 8; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 6. In addition to the relief he requested at the agency level relating to promotion consideration, Plaintiff also sought reimbursement of housing expenses, as well as sick and home leave that he would have accrued if his assignment to OSCE had been effectuated via detail.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270996\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/220/51/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Admin. R. Part 4, ECF No. 36, at 56-57. The Board denied Plaintiff's appeal of his First Grievance in its entirety. Def.'s Mot. at 8; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 6-7. Plaintiff then filed a request for reconsideration. Def.'s Mot. at 8; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before the Board could rule on Plaintiff's request for reconsideration, Plaintiff filed a new grievance with State on April 21, 2014 (\"Second Grievance\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 10; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 9. In his Second Grievance, Plaintiff asked the Department \"to address violations of statute, regulation and published agency policy created by the Board's\" finding that Plaintiff was separated from State during his time at OSCE. Admin. R., ECF No. 44, at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-15. Specifically, Plaintiff alleged that the Department: (1) \"failed to comply with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20352.314\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7 352.314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) when it did not consider Plaintiff for promotion during the period of time when he was separated from the Department and transferred to OSCE\"; (2) \"acted inconsistently with Executive Order 11552 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203584\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   when it failed to give 'due consideration' to Plaintiff's qualifications gained during his service with the OSCE when determining the position and grade to which he was assigned upon his reemployment with the Agency,\" instead opting \"merely to reinstate him at the grade he had held prior to that service, three grades lower than the rank of the position he had held at the OSCE\"; and (3) \"failed to reimburse Plaintiff for housing expenses incurred when Plaintiff was separated and transferred from the Department and employed by the OSCE.\" Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 9-10;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among other remedies, Plaintiff sought an upward adjustment of his grade level and reimbursement of housing expenses. Def.'s Mot. at 10-11; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because the Department did not render a timely decision on Plaintiff's Second Grievance, Plaintiff \"referred\" his grievance directly to the FSGB, which the Board docketed as an appeal. Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But before ruling on the Second Grievance, the FSGB denied Plaintiff's request for reconsideration as to his First Grievance,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Admin. R. Part 6, ECF No. 38, at 268-77, which led Plaintiff to file the instant action under the APA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., ECF No. 21, \u00b6\u00b6 39-46 (reasserting Counts I and II, as pled in the original Complaint). Thereafter, the Department moved to dismiss the Second Grievance arguing, among other things, that it should be dismissed under the common law doctrine of claim preclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 12; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 15. On September 24, 2015, the Board dismissed the Second Grievance, agreeing with State that the doctrine of claim preclusion operated to bar Plaintiff's Second Grievance because it concerned the same operative set of facts as his First Grievance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 12; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Admin. R., ECF No. 44, at 104-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following that decision, Plaintiff amended his Complaint to add claims (Counts III and IV) challenging the Board's dismissal of his Second Grievance.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. In Count III, Plaintiff asks the court to set aside the Board's denial of his Second Grievance as \"arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not in accordance with law.\" Am.

Plaintiffs offers two arguments to support this claim. First, Plaintiff alleges that he could not have filed the Second Grievance seeking the benefits denied to him following his reemployment \"until it became clear that the Department would deny him those benefits.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 47. Thus, \"in essence,\" he filed the Second Grievance \"to enforce the Board's findings in the original grievance, not to relitigate them.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, Plaintiff claims that while the FSGB has applied\n   <em>\n    issue\n   </em>\n   preclusion in the past, FSGB deviated \"without explanation\" from prior decisions in the instant case by applying the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   preclusion, which it previously had never applied to dismiss a grievance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    \u00b6 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Count IV of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint asks the court to set aside the FSGB's denial for a different reason: the failure \"to consider all relevant evidence in the record and provide a reasonable explanation for its decision to dismiss the [second] grievance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that by dismissing the Second Grievance, the Board \"refus[ed] to require that Defendant provide to Plaintiff those benefits specifically guaranteed by law to those employees in the status (re-employment following a separation/transfer to an international organization)\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   had found applied to him.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    \u00b6 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This court previously granted summary judgment for the Department on Counts I and II of the Amended Complaint, which challenged the denial of Plaintiff's First Grievance.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fritch v.

Thereafter, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment challenging the remaining two counts of the Amended Complaint (Counts III and IV), both of which relate to the denial of Plaintiff's Second Grievance.

Accordingly, the fact that Plaintiff sought \"legally distinct\" benefits as part of his Second Grievance does not save him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Next, Plaintiff argues that the Board's application of claim preclusion was improper because the claims he raised in the Second Grievance could not have been included in his First Grievance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. The reason he could not grieve the claims simultaneously, Plaintiff states, is that the second contention-that he was entitled to benefits even as a separated employee under Executive Order 11552 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203584\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -could not be asserted until he officially \"returned\" to the agency and was \"re-employed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203584\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That assertion is difficult to follow. Plaintiff points to no valid impediment that prevented him from asserting alternative theories to his right to benefits when he filed his First Grievance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Put differently, Plaintiff could have argued, without inconsistency, that he was in fact detailed to the OSCE, but even if separated and transferred, he still was entitled to certain benefits upon his return. The only difference between the First and Second Grievance is that, before he filed the Second Grievance, the Board determined that he was on separated status while at the OSCE. But, as the Board explained, its decision resolving Plaintiff's status \"did not create any new facts,\" but simply \" 'left undisturbed' the agency's original decision to separate/transfer [Plaintiff] to the OSCE.\" Admin. R., ECF No. 44, at 112. That is, the Board's decision had no bearing on additional arguments Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   made in his First Grievance concerning the Department's alleged failure \"to award him certain benefits he felt he should have received upon his re-employment with the agency in June 2012.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111. Plaintiff did not make those arguments, and the Board therefore properly applied the doctrine of claim preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff challenges the Board's decision as arbitrary and capricious because \"it reveals considerable confusion\" over whether its \"decision [wa]s predicated upon collateral estoppel or claim preclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 32; Pl.'s Reply at 7-8. The court rejects this argument. True, the Board repeatedly characterized the doctrine it was applying as \"Collateral Estoppel (Claim Preclusion),\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Admin. R., ECF No. 44, at 110-12, even though collateral estoppel refers to\n   <em>\n    issue\n   </em>\n   preclusion,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailey v. Fulwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277680,6785577\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/127/\">\n    793 F.3d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 136 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 2015). But in dismissing Plaintiff's Second Grievance, the Board unquestionably applied the elements of claim preclusion. For example, the Board held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [Plaintiff] was obligated under the doctrine of collateral estoppel (claim preclusion), therefore, to bring all of his claims that relate to the same series of events during the first grievance. [Plaintiff] is precluded from making additional claims in a new grievance, based on those same facts that form the basis of the first grievance, after the Board reached a decision denying that grievance. To permit this would be tantamount to seeking a second Board reconsideration of the first grievance, without [Plaintiff] having met the criteria for reconsideration as set forth in 22 U.S.C. 4136(9) and CFR 910.1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111. Indeed, other than mistakenly characterizing claim preclusion as \"collateral estoppel\" instead of \"res judicata,\" there is no indication whatsoever that the Board confused the two doctrines.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 110-11 (\"We are not convinced that the two\n   <em>\n    claims\n   </em>\n   are separate and distinct ....\" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 112 (\"[Plaintiff] had the opportunity, and even\n   the obligation ... to raise during his argument of his first grievance\n   <em>\n    any and all claims\n   </em>\n   he had concerning Department violations of any kind that he deemed to flow from the separation/transfer action.\n   <em>\n    As he failed to raise these claims\n   </em>\n   ... he is barred from filing a new grievance now, based on the same underlying facts.\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, the court's conclusion that the Board did not improperly apply the doctrine of claim preclusion resolves Plaintiff's contention as to Count IV, which is that the Board failed to consider the merits of his Second Grievance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 49; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 2-3. Because the Board found the Second Grievance to be barred under the doctrine of claim preclusion, it appropriately dismissed the Second Grievance without considering its merits.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Res. Def. Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3567826,3164959\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/257/\">\n    513 F.3d at 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

FSGB's Rejection of Plaintiff's Judicial Estoppel Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   That leaves Plaintiff's argument concerning the Board's rejection of his plea to apply the equitable principle of judicial estoppel to prevent the Department from seeking dismissal on claim preclusion grounds. Plaintiff contends that Defendant pulled a bait and switch. He maintains that when the Department opposed his request for reconsideration of the First Grievance, the Department argued that the Board should not consider Plaintiff's claims regarding Executive Order 11552 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203584\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -one of the bases for his Second Grievance-in part because \"they did not concern the claims raised in the First Grievance,\" and \"in any event ... were fully addressed in the Second Grievance.\" Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 43 (citing Admin. R. Part 6, ECF No. 38, at 197). Having taken that position in the First Grievance proceedings, Plaintiff maintains that the Department was foreclosed-or judicially estopped-from subsequently arguing in the Second Grievance proceedings that Plaintiff could have brought his claims all at once.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203584\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203584\">\n    at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, in the administrative proceedings below, Plaintiff urged the Board not to invoke claim preclusion on the ground of judicial estoppel.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203584\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203584\">\n    at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Admin.

In doing so, the Board relied on the test set out in\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire v. Maine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/\">\n    532 U.S. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/\">\n    149 L.Ed.2d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), which articulates three factors that courts generally consider when determining whether to apply judicial estoppel in a particular case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   First, a party's later position must be clearly inconsistent with its earlier position. Second, courts regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or second court was misled. A third consideration is whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin.

Applying this test, the Board ultimately found \"no evidence that any of these three factors appl[ied], that the Department abused the legal system by any of the arguments it made in this case, or that its actions met any other prerequisites that might be used in determining applicability of this doctrine.\" Admin. R., ECF No. 44, at 113. The Board also concluded\n   that the Department's \"request that the first grievance be remanded if the Board decided to rule on the merits of new claims that [Plaintiff] made in his [motion to reconsider], on which the agency had not had a chance to be heard, [was] not contrary or inconsistent with its previous position.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, the Board reasoned that the Department's position had been \"both consistent and persuasive that the underlying facts are the same in both grievances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The court finds no error in the Board's ruling or its reasoning. Having closely reviewed all of the parties' relevant submissions to the Board during both proceedings, the court concludes that the Department's position in its opposition to Plaintiff's request for reconsideration of the First Grievance was not \"clearly inconsistent\" with the position it took later in its motion to dismiss the Second Grievance. As Defendant correctly points out, its opposition simply argued that Plaintiff's claims under the Executive Order and relevant statute \"had not been asserted during the proceedings on the merits, and therefore could not justify reconsideration of the Board's decision.\" Def.'s Reply at 24;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 42-43 (noting that, with respect to his argument regarding Executive Order 11552 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203584\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Board held that Plaintiff was \"presenting this as a new argument which, ... [the Board] will not consider on the merits or as grounds for reconsideration\" (quoting Admin. R. Part 6, ECF No. 38, at 275) ). The Department's position in its motion to dismiss the Second Grievance is premised on a similar ground: Plaintiff's failure to assert these claims when he filed the First Grievance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin. R., ECF No. 44, at 62-63. Moreover, as the Board recognized, there is no inconsistency in the Department's position that the Board remand the first grievance to the agency if the Board denied the request for reconsideration in all other respects, but allowed Plaintiff to pursue the new claims he raised for the first time in his request for reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203584\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203584\">\n    at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
