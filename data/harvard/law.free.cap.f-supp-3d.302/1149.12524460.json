Dana M. Sabraw, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case involves the Government's alleged practice of separating migrant parents and children held in immigration detention without a showing that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the minor child. According to Plaintiffs, prior administrations detained migrant families, but did not have a practice of forcibly separating fit parents from their young children. Plaintiffs allege there are reports the Government may soon adopt a formal national policy of separating migrant families, and placing the children in government facilities for \"unaccompanied minors\" to deter others from coming to the United States. The Government denies it has a family separation policy and concedes such a policy would be \"antithetical to the child welfare values\" imposed on government actors responsible for the care and custody of migrant children who are separated from their parents as a result of the Government's enforcement of criminal and immigration law. Instead, the Government asserts it considers each case on the facts available at the time a placement decision\n   is made, and that when separation occurs, it is the result of the Government taking lawful immigration enforcement and detention actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs Ms. L. and Ms. C. allege immigration officials separated them from their minor children without determining they were unfit or presented a danger to their children, and that hundreds of other migrant families have been subjected to the same treatment. Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and putative class members, allege the conduct at issue violates their due process rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Asylum Statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Government's alleged practice has garnered the attention of numerous groups interested in child advocacy and welfare, immigration law and constitutional law, as evidenced by the\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   briefs filed in this case.

The only issues presently before the Court are whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear the case, whether this Court is the proper venue for the case, and whether Plaintiffs Ms. L. and Ms. C. have alleged sufficient facts and a sufficient legal basis to state a \"plausible claim for relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

As explained below, the Court finds it has jurisdiction over the case and venue is proper in this Court. The Court also finds Plaintiffs have set forth sufficient facts and a sufficient legal basis to state a claim that separation from their children while they are contesting their removal and without a determination they are unfit or present a danger to their children violates due process. The Court further finds that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the APA or the Asylum Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Ms. L. is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She is Catholic. On November 1, 2017, she and her then 6-year-old daughter S.S. arrived at the San Ysidro Port of Entry seeking asylum based on religious persecution. Ms. L. and her daughter were detained by immigration officials at the border, and housed together until November 5, 2017, at which time immigration officials \"forcibly separated\" S.S. from her mother and sent S.S. to Chicago-over a thousand miles away-where \"she was housed in a detention facility for 'unaccompanied' minors run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement [ORR].\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 42.) \"When S.S. was taken away from her mother, she was screaming and crying, pleading with guards not to take her away from her mother.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) During their detention and while they were separated, Ms. L. was able to speak with her daughter only \"approximately 6 times by phone, never by video.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) Each time they spoke, S.S. \"was crying and scared.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Ms. L. was \"terrified that she would never see her daughter again.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After being separated from her daughter for nearly four months, Ms. L. filed the present case against numerous governmental entities and individual actors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Five\n   days after filing the original Complaint, Ms. L. filed a motion for preliminary injunction and motion to expedite hearing of the motion. Three days later, Ms. L. was \"paroled,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , released, from ICE detention. (\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   n.3 (discussing removal proceedings, asylum and parole) ). In response to Ms. L.'s motion to expedite hearing of her motion for preliminary injunction, the Government stated it was attempting to \"expeditiously resolve current doubts about whether [Ms. L.] is the mother of S.S. to the satisfaction of [ORR].\" (Opp'n to Mot. to Expedite at 1.) That effort involved ORR taking a DNA saliva sample (or swab) from S.S., which it did on March 7, 2018. On March 8, 2018, the Court held a telephonic status conference with counsel, and thereafter ordered the parties to collect a DNA sample from Ms. L. and to complete the DNA testing by March 14, 2018. The testing was completed on March 12, 2018, and established maternity. Four days later, and more than four months after they were separated, S.S. was released to her mother after ORR determined Ms. L. was capable of providing for S.S.'s physical and mental well-being. (\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   n.2 (discussing child welfare provisions relating to immigrant children) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While the DNA testing was underway, Ms. L. filed an Amended Complaint that realleges the claims in the original Petition/Complaint with minor modifications, and adds a new Plaintiff, Ms. C. Ms. C. is a citizen of Brazil, and unlike Ms. L., she crossed into the United States with her 14-year-old son J. \"between ports of entry[.]\" (Mem. of P. &amp; A. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 5.) Ms. C. and her son were apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol, and Ms. C. explained to the agent they were seeking asylum. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 55.) Ms. C. was prosecuted for entering the country illegally, and J. was taken away from her and sent to an ORR facility in Chicago-hundreds of miles away-for \"unaccompanied\" children. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) Ms. C. was convicted of misdemeanor illegal entry and served 25 days in federal custody. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) She completed her sentence on September 22, 2017, and was then taken into ICE detention for removal proceedings and consideration of her asylum claim. She was first held at the El Paso Processing Center before being transferred to the West Texas Detention Center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. C. was released on bond from ICE detention on April 9, 2018, after the Amended Complaint was filed, but she has yet to be reunited with her son. During the five months she was detained, Ms. C. did not see her son, and they spoke on the phone only \"a handful of times[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) Ms. C. \"is desperate\" to be reunited with her son, \"worries about him constantly and does not know when she will be able to see him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"J. has been having a difficult time emotionally since being separated from his mother.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) Indeed, \"[e]very day that J. is separated from his mother causes him greater emotional and psychological harm and could potentially lead to permanent emotional trauma.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) Plaintiffs allege \"[t]he government has no legitimate interest in separating Ms. C. and her child[,]\" there has been \"no evidence, or even accusation, that J. was abused or neglected by Ms. C.[,]\" and \"[t]here is no evidence that Ms. C. is an unfit parent or that she is not acting in the best interests of her child.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Together, Ms. L. and Ms. C. seek to represent the following nationwide class on all of their claims for relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   All adult parents nationwide who (1) are or will be detained in immigration custody by the Department of Homeland Security,\n   and (2) have a minor child who is or will be separated from them by DHS and detained in ORR custody, absent a demonstration in a hearing that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs seek, among other things, a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing Defendants from continuing to separate them and the other class members from their children, and an order requiring Defendants to either \"release class members along with their children, or to detain them together in the same facility[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Three motions are pending before the Court: Defendants' motion to dismiss, and Plaintiffs' motion for class certification and motion for classwide preliminary injunction. These motions came on for hearing on May 4, 2018. Lee Gelernt, Anand Balakrishnan and Bardis Vakili appeared for Plaintiffs, and Sarah Fabian and Nicole Murley appeared for Defendants. This Order addresses Defendants' motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs' motions for class certification and preliminary injunction will be addressed in separate orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants raise a number of arguments in their motion to dismiss. First, they argue Ms. L.'s claims are moot because she has been released from ICE detention and reunited with her daughter. Second, Defendants assert the Court lacks jurisdiction over Ms. C.'s habeas claim and that venue is improper for Ms. C.'s other claims. Third, Defendants claim the Court lacks jurisdiction to review ICE's decision to detain rather than parole Plaintiffs, and also lacks jurisdiction to review ICE's decision about where to detain Plaintiffs or to order ICE to detain Plaintiffs in a particular facility. Fourth, Defendants contend separation of Plaintiffs from their children does not violate the Fifth Amendment. Fifth, Defendants argue Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the APA. And finally, Defendants assert Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the Asylum Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Mootness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants' first argument in support of their motion to dismiss is that Ms. L.'s claims are moot in light of her release from detention and reunification with her daughter. Plaintiffs disagree that either of these events renders Ms. L.'s claims moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"A case becomes moot-and therefore no longer a 'Case' or 'Controversy' for purposes of Article III-'when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.' \"\n   <em>\n    Already, LLC v.

The mootness doctrine is subject to certain exceptions, however.

Specifically, they assert Ms. L.'s release and reunification with her daughter \"occurred through the operation of the applicable laws governing her detention and the custody of S.S.[,]\" (Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 1), namely Ms. L.'s parole from ICE detention and the release of S.S. in accordance with ORR procedures and the Trafficking Victims Protection and Reauthorization Act (\"TVPRA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Ninth Circuit has held that in order for the voluntary cessation exception to apply, \"the voluntary cessation 'must have arisen\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   the litigation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sze v.

Practice\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 101.99[2] ) (\" 'The voluntary cessation doctrine does not apply when the voluntary cessation of the challenged activity occurs because of reasons unrelated to the litigation.' \"). Here, both sides offer competing explanations for Ms. L.'s parole from detention and reunification with her daughter, with Plaintiffs asserting these actions were the result of \"Defendants' own decision to end\" Ms. L.'s separation from her daughter \"before this Court could rule[,]\" (Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss at 5), and Defendants arguing to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Neither party has presented any evidence, however, as to the reason for Ms. L.'s parole from detention and reunification with her daughter. The timing of Ms. L.'s release and reunification with her daughter, both of which occurred after this case was filed and after the Court ordered an expedited DNA test, support Plaintiffs' assertion. Defendants, meanwhile, have failed to present any evidence to support their assertion that they were simply complying with the statutes, and would have paroled Ms. L. and reunited her with her daughter pursuant to the TVPRA absent this litigation, such as declarations from individuals involved in those decisions who could attest that the decisions were in process prior to this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU of Mass.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658597\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/705/44/#p55\">\n    705 F.3d at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding voluntary cessation exception did not apply where contract at issue \"expired according to its terms.

Moreover, the expiration date, options, and task order extension were all built into the contract's terms before this litigation began.\"). Defendants also have failed to offer any evidence to explain why DNA testing of Ms. L. and S.S. was not completed during the four months that Ms. L. and S.S. were detained and during which time Ms. L. consistently maintained parentage, but occurred only after the Court ordered it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because Defendants have not shown that Ms. L. was released from detention and reunited with her daughter for reasons other than this litigation, the Court finds the voluntary cessation exception applies to this case.

Habeas Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants' second argument in support of dismissal is that the Court lacks jurisdiction over Ms. C.'s habeas claim because she did not name the warden of the institution in which she was detained. \"[L]ongstanding practice confirms that in habeas challenges to present physical confinement-'core challenges'-the default rule is that the proper respondent is the warden of the facility where the prisoner is being held, not the Attorney General or some other remote supervisory official.\"\n   <em>\n    Rumsfeld v.

Here, Ms. C. is not raising a \"core challenge.\" This is especially so now that she has been released on bond. Rather, her habeas claim, like her other claims, is directed to the continued separation from her child. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. at 12) (asking the Court to \"[o]rder defendants either to release class members along with their children, or to detain them together in the same facility[.]\"). Since Ms. C. is not raising a \"core challenge,\" she is not subject to the default rule set out above. Absent this showing, the Court has jurisdiction over Ms. C.'s habeas claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Venue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants' third argument in support of dismissal is that this Court is the improper venue for adjudication of Ms. C.'s claims because Ms. C. does not reside in this district nor did the events giving rise to her claim occur in this district. Plaintiffs respond that regardless of Ms. C.'s claims, this is the proper venue for Ms. L.'s claims, and that is sufficient in this putative class case against the Government.

Plaintiffs, therefore, must show that their generally held constitutional right to family integrity applies in the particular circumstances alleged here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In determining whether the right to family integrity encompasses the circumstances alleged here, it is important to note what Plaintiffs do not challenge. They do not challenge the Government's initial separation of parent and child when the parent is arrested for violating the nation's criminal laws. Nor do Plaintiffs challenge the Government's decision to separate families when there are legitimate questions regarding parentage, fitness, or danger to the child. Nor do they challenge the Government's powers to deport or detain aliens. What Plaintiffs challenge is the Government's separation of migrant parents and their minor children when both are held in immigration detention and when there has been no showing the parent is unfit or poses a danger to the child. Plaintiffs assert separation of parents and minor children under such circumstances violates their due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants argue the contours of the right to family integrity are different depending on the circumstances, and that under the circumstances of this case, which involve the Government's enforcement of criminal and immigration laws, there is no constitutional violation. Specifically, the Government argues that when a parent is detained for removal or criminal prosecution, the minor child becomes \"unaccompanied\" and must be placed in the \"care and custody\" of ORR. Separation of the family unit, therefore, is simply a consequence of the lawful detention of the parent. In support of this argument, Defendants rely on a number of cases dealing with immigration detainees and convicts who have been separated from their families without constitutional implication, but those cases are distinguishable from this case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Milan-Rodriguez v.

Appx. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2005) (stating right to family unity not violated when petitioner ordered removed after conviction of crime). Plaintiffs argue those cases involve challenges to a parent's detention and transfer away from children who were not themselves initially detained with their parents. According to Plaintiffs, the practice alleged here \"is not a necessary incident of detention; it is the result of an\n   <em>\n    unnecessary\n   </em>\n   governmental action intended to separate family units who\n   were arrested\n   <em>\n    together\n   </em>\n   [.]\" (Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Government also cites cases that subordinate the right to family integrity of citizen children when their non-citizen parents are deported.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gallanosa by Gallanosa v.

According to the allegations in the Amended Complaint, Ms. L. did everything right. She and her child presented at the port of entry and requested asylum. She passed a credible fear screening interview, was taken out of expedited removal proceedings, and placed in removal proceedings before an IJ to pursue her asylum claim. Ms. C., by contrast, did not do everything right. She committed a crime by entering the United States illegally, and was prosecuted and imprisoned for her transgression: 25 days in custody for misdemeanor violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (illegal entry). However, having served her sentence, Ms. C. was then returned to ICE detention to pursue her asylum claim, as she too had passed a credible fear screening. Ms. C., therefore, is on equal footing with Ms. L. for purposes of pursuing her due process claim. Ms. L.'s claim is based on the initial separation from her child, while Ms. C.'s claim is based on the continued separation from her child.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31, 34b.) A policy of family separation to serve \"ulterior law enforcement goals\" admittedly would be \"antithetical to the child welfare values\" imposed on government actors by the TVPRA. (Opp'n to Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 3, ECF No. 46.) Yet, Plaintiffs allege that practice is being implemented in full view of the \"devastating negative impact\" that separation has on a \"child's well-being, especially where there are other traumatic factors at work, and that this damage can be permanent.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 33.) (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Br. by\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   in Supp. of Pl.'s Habeas Corpus Pet. and Compl. at 2-3, ECF No. 17-3 (describing psychological and emotional trauma that is visited upon young children when they are separated from their parents) ). As for their own children, Plaintiffs allege S.S. was screaming, crying, and \"pleading with guards not to take her away from her mother[,]\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 43), and J. is struggling emotionally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) Plaintiffs also allege they, themselves, are consumed by feelings of desperation and worry.

This is especially so because Plaintiffs allegedly came to the United States seeking shelter from persecution in their home countries, and are seeking asylum here. For Plaintiffs, the government actors responsible for the \"care and custody\" of migrant children have, in fact, become their persecutors. This is even more problematic given Plaintiffs' allegations and assertions that there is a government practice, and possibly a forthcoming policy, to separate parents from their minor children in an effort to deter others\n   from coming to the United States. This alleged practice is being implemented even when parents like Ms. L. and Ms. C. have passed credible fear interviews, and therefore, are positioned to present asylum claims meriting consideration by an IJ in their removal proceedings. These allegations sufficiently describe government conduct that arbitrarily tears at the sacred bond between parent and child, and is emblematic of the \"exercise of power without any reasonable justification in the service of an otherwise legitimate governmental objective[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504410\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/833/\">\n    523 U.S. at 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504410\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/833/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such conduct, if true, as it is assumed to be on the present motion, is brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency.

The conduct at issue in this case, separation of parents from their minor children when both are in immigration detention and when there is no showing the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child, is not reviewable by statute.
