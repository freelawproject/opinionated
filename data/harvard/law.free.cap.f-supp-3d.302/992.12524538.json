Plaintiff Ruth Hamerski (hereinafter \"Hamerski\"), opposes the motion (Docs. 36). For the reasons explained below, the Court grants in part and denies in part BASSC's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Hamerski began her employment with BASSC on July 1, 2007, as an administrator for instructional programs (Doc. 37-1). At that time, she had twenty-six years of experience as a teacher and special education department chair at Mt. Vernon High School. (Doc. 35-4, pg. 15-17). BASSC is a federally funded special educational cooperative that implements and enforces the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (hereinafter \"IDEA\"). (Doc. 15, \u00b6 4). It provides special education services to children between elementary and high school levels that have qualified disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (hereinafter \"ADA\"), and whom are entitled to special education under the IDEA. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6). BASSC runs Pathways school, a K-12 school for emotional behavioral students (Doc. 35-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2008, Hamerski was assigned to be the interim principal of Pathways school following the resignation of the former principal in February of that year. (Doc. 15, \u00b6 7). During her time as interim principal, she oversaw all BASSC instructional programs and implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with state and federal law (Doc. 35-4, pg. 27). Also, Hamerski alleges that she was forced to suspend a Pathways paraprofessional, Melissa Stines following a confrontation between them (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 186). Ms. Stines was, and continues to be, married to Matt Stines, who at the time was allegedly \"being groomed to become a superintendent at Grant Illini\" school. (Doc. 15, \u00b6 9). Hamerski states that these events were the basis of the 2015 investigation of her (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 189).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In support of summary judgment, defendants offer the deposition testimony of Hamerski, Teresa Castello, Jeff Daugherty, Matthew Stines, Diane Warfield, Brent Whipple, Brian Arterberry, and Stephanie Cox (See Docs. 35-1 through 35-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2013, Hamerski announced that she intended to retire in 2017 or 2018. (Doc. 15, \u00b6 10). Thereafter, on October 16, 2013, Hamerski and BASSC entered into a four year written contract that stated she could only be discharged \"for just cause.\" (Doc. 15, \u00b6 11). If dismissal were to occur, Hamerski would be entitled to written notice of the charges, notice of hearing, a full hearing to confront and cross-examine witnesses and evidence, and representation by legal counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Between 2007 and January 2015, Hamerski received \" 'excellent' in virtually every category\" of her annual performance appraisals conducted by executive director Daugherty. (Doc. 15, \u00b6 12). In 2015, however, Hamerski alleges that she would have\n   \"latent, unresolved issues in the mind of Matt Stines, and his wife, Melissa Stines.\" (Doc. 15, \u00b6 13). The law firm Guin Mundorf, LLC was then hired to investigate Hamerski. (Doc. 15, \u00b6 14). Hamerski was subsequently informed on March 13, 2015, by executive director Daugherty that she was to appear at the law office of Barney Mundorf on Monday, March 16, 2015, regarding the aforementioned investigation. (Doc. 15, \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At said meeting, Mr. Mundorf accused Hamerski of the following violations:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (1) \"being negligent in her duties regarding training of teachers\"; (2) \"lying about eight (8) claimed work days in July, 2014\"; (3) \"her IDEA instructions on restraint and arrest of children from calendar year 2008 at Pathways\"; and, (4) \"whether she told a subordinate administrator to keep illegal, confiscated drugs in his desk.\" (Doc. 15, \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 18, 2015, Jeff Daugherty and Hamerski were then summoned to a full executive board meeting. (Doc. 15, \u00b6 19). At that meeting, the findings of the investigation were presented, and the full board went into a closed session, but took no action regarding Mr. Daugherty or Hamerski's employment. (Doc. 15, \u00b6 19). Following the meeting, Mr. Stines and Mr. Mundorf took Mr. Daugherty and Hamerski into a conference room. (Doc. 35-3, pg. 65-66). Hamerski alleges that Mr. Stines indicated that the most serious act of misconduct alleged against her was regarding student arrest (Doc. 35-4, pgs. 119;121). During the conversation Hamerski alleges that she was told that she had two options moving forward: (1) retire or (2) \"be demoted with a substantial decrease in pay, and we may look at further action being dismissal\". (Doc. 35-4, pg. 119). The following day, March 19, 2015, Hamerski received a written letter signed by Mr. Stines memorializing the two options and giving her four days to make a decision. (Doc. 15, \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Despite her stated intention to retire in 2017 or 2018, on March 19, 2015, Hamerski submitted a signed letter of resignation to the Executive Board and Governing Board members, with the intent to retire as of June 30, 2015 (Doc. 35-8). BASSC accepted her resignation (Doc. 35-9). Thereafter, on October 23, 2015, Hamerski filed a Charge of Discrimination against BASSC with the EEOC, specifically alleging retaliation in violation of Title VII (Doc. 15-3). On April 15, 2016, the EEOC issued a right to sue letter to Hamerski (Doc. 15-4). Subsequently, Hamerski filed the underlying lawsuit on July 14, 2016 (Doc. 1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings, discovery, and disclosures establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Winsley v.

More specifically, the facts reveal that Hamerski's working conditions were not intolerable, and instead, support a finding that she voluntarily resigned from her position. Conversely, Hamerski argues that this is a case of \"Cat's Paw Liability,\" because when faced with the choice between early retirement and an involuntary demotion to a position with substantially less pay and retirement benefits, Hamerski really had no choice. As a result of the written letter memorializing her two options, plaintiff asserts that her property interest was lost to \"a predetermined outcome\" (Doc. 37, pg. 10). She would have been \"reclassified from an administrator's salary to a lower paying teaching position....\" (Doc. 37, pg. 10), without the benefit of due process in her demotion. Plaintiff goes on to assert that \"no one in their right mind would choose to retire at a teacher's salary, when they had earned an administrator's retirement salary after thirty-four (34) years.\" (Doc. 37, pg. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Given the circumstances surrounding plaintiff's resignation, and construing the facts in plaintiff's favor, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether a reasonable person would have felt that his or her employment had become unbearable and, thus, compelled to resign. Plaintiff has presented evidence sufficient enough to create a reasonable inference that given her options following the May 18, 2015 meeting with Stines and Mundorf, her resignation was involuntary, thus creating a situation involving a possible constructive discharge.

In her deposition testimony, Hamerski admits that after retiring, she sought no additional employment opportunities and, therefore, was not turned down by any potential employer as a result of Taylor or Warfield's statements.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Q:\n   </strong>\n   Have you sought any type of employment using your certifications and endorsements?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    Hamerski:\n   </strong>\n   I have not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    Q:\n   </strong>\n   Have you turned in any resumes other than to Ms. Wilson?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    Hamerski:\n   </strong>\n   I have not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    Q:\n   </strong>\n   Did you turn in a resume to Ms. Wilson?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Hamerski:\n   </strong>\n   I did not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    Q:\n   </strong>\n   Have you made any phone calls seeking employment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    Hamerski:\n   </strong>\n   I have not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Doc. 35-4, pg. 85). Although Hamerski notes that she is currently employed to clean the home of Ms. Mardel Wilson, nothing indicates that she actually sought employment at any other education facilities following her retirement. Ultimately, Hamerski cannot demonstrate that her liberty has been infringed in the manner required by the case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that no reasonable jury could conclude that Hamerski was defamed or stigmatized for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment by the statements of any of the defendants referenced herein, and thus she was not deprived of her liberty interest in continuing her career in public school administration. Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment as to Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    d.\n    <em>\n     Count IV: Violations of Titles I and II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Retaliatory Discharge)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In Count IV, Hamerski contends that she was constructively discharged because \"she had created and enforced policies which advocated for students with disabilities under the IDEA and ADA.\" (Doc. 15, \u00b6 45). She allegedly \"enforced regulations and rules prohibiting the use of arrests, isolation, seclusion and restraint,\" which she believed violated the rights of students with disabilities under those statutes. (Doc. 15, \u00b6 45). Hamerski supports her claim by pointing out that Mr. Stines and Mr. Mundorf called her advocacy of those policies and practices that she created the \"most serious\" of her offenses. (Docs. 35-4; 35-5; 36). Further, Hamerski exhausted her administrative prerequisites by obtaining the right to sue from the\n   Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on April 15, 2016.

(Doc. 35, pg. 18)(citing\n   <em>\n    Cloe v. City of Indianapolis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556192\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/1171/#p1180\">\n    712 F.3d 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1180 (7th Cir. 2013). Because Hamerski voluntarily chose to resign, BASSC argues that she fails to establish an adverse employment action. Furthermore, BASSC argues that Hamerski fails to provide any evidence linking her advocacy to her discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Here, the Court finds that a question of fact exists surrounding not only the voluntariness of plaintiff's resignation, but also the but-for cause of the resignation. Hamerski's alleged facts fit squarely within the ADA's protections for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   individual who\n   <em>\n    opposed\n   </em>\n   an act or practice made unlawful by that statute, as plaintiff's policies were in response to the alleged arrests, isolation, seclusion and restraint of students. In fact Mr. Stines expressly stated in his deposition that of the four topics discussed in the conference room meeting with Hamerski prior to her resignation, \"[t]he most significant issue and the one that I recall the most was the issue of her directing staff to seize drugs from a student and hang on to them. That was the most significant issue in my mind.\" (Doc. 35-5, pg. 91, lines 16-19). In Hamerski's deposition, she also stated that \"Mundorf said, [ ] the most serious of the charges against you are regarding student arrest, and the fact that you were not providing appropriate-I'm trying to remember the word he used-guidance to the younger administrators; therefore, this is happening.\" (Doc. 35-4, pg. 119, lines 18-25). Further, there is a dispute of fact as to whether the student arrest policy was discussed in the meeting prior to Hamerski receiving the March 19, 2015, letter signed by Mr. Stines memorializing her two employment options. Not only does this claimed adverse action falls squarely within the employment examples cited in\n   <em>\n    Silk,\n   </em>\n   but plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to create a reasonable inference linking her advocacy to the alleged constructive discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Therefore, given the discrepancies surrounding the voluntariness of plaintiff's resignation, and construing the facts in\n   plaintiff's favor, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to the causal connection between her advocacy opposing the use of \"arrest, isolation, seclusion, and restraint,\" on the ADA students and the adverse action of being retaliated against. The Court denies summary judgment as to Count IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    e.\n    <em>\n     Count V: Breach of Employment Contract\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In Count V, Hamerski alleges that she entered into a written contract of employment through June of 2017 with BASSC. (Doc. 15, \u00b6 53). Despite the existence of said contract, she alleges a breach by way of constructive discharge. Defendant argues in favor of summary judgment because \"constructive discharge\" is not recognized as a stand-alone tort under Illinois law. (Doc. 35, pg.19) (citing\n   <em>\n    Dudycz v. City of Chicago,\n   </em>\n   133,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2558959\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/206/128/\">\n    206 Ill.App.3d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Ill.%20Dec.%2016\">\n    151 Ill.Dec. 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=563%20N.E.2d%201122\">\n    563 N.E.2d 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1126 (1990). Defendant also asserts that rather than a constructive discharge, Hamerski \"voluntarily resigned on her own accord as permitted under her employment contract and BASSC accepted\" the resignation. (Doc. 35, pg. 20). Hamerski, however, argues that she was not an at-will employee, but rather had a \"written, fixed-term contract requiring discharge only for 'just cause,' \" rather than at-will employment. (Doc. 36, \u00b6 5). Rather, she cites authority for the proposition that the \"at-will\" doctrine does not apply when there is a written contract, and that a demotion is a breach.

As to the last two elements-breach and damages-material facts remain in dispute. As the Court notes above, the voluntariness of Hamerski's resignation is a question of fact for the jury, and that question is critical to their determination of whether Hamerski's employment contract was breached.
