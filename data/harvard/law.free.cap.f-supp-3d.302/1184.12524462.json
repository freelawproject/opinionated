Defendants OMICS Group Inc. (\"OMICS\"), iMedPub LLC (\"iMedPub\"), Conference Series LLC (\"Conference Series\"), and Srinubabu Gedela (\"Gedela\") (collectively \"Defendants\") filed a response, (ECF No. 32), and the FTC filed a Reply, (ECF No. 34). Also pending before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. (ECF No. 31). The FTC filed a response, (ECF No. 35), and Defendants filed a reply, (ECF No. 36). For the reasons discussed herein, the FTC's Motion for Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED and Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The FTC brings this action pursuant to Section 5(a) of the FTC Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), alleging that Defendants engaged in unfair and deceptive practices with respect to the publication of online academic journals and organization of scientific conferences. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1). Defendants claim to operate hundreds of online academic journals on a wide variety of topics, including medicine, chemistry, nursing, engineering, and genetics. (Mot. for Prelim. Inj. 2:1-12, ECF No. 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss 4:21-28, ECF No. 31). According to the FTC, Defendants make numerous misrepresentations regarding the nature and reputation of their journals in order to attract consumers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, Defendants allegedly fail to disclose that they charge significant fees in exchange for their publication service.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, Defendants allegedly make numerous misrepresentations in connection with the marketing of their scientific conferences.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The FTC asserts that Defendants OMICS, iMedPub, and Conference Series (collectively \"Corporate Defendants\") have operated as a common enterprise in violating Section 5(a) and therefore are jointly and severally liable. (Compl. \u00b6 10). The FTC further asserts that Gedela has \"formulated, directed, controlled, had the authority to control, or participated in the acts and practices of the Corporate Defendants that constitute the common enterprise.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Based on these allegations, the FTC initiated the instant action and filed the Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (ECF Nos. 1, 9). Specifically, the FTC seeks a preliminary injunction that: (1) restrains Defendants from engaging in deceptive practices with respect to the marketing and sale of\n   academic journal publishing services and scientific conference services; (2) requires Defendants to identify assets and make an accounting of their present financial condition and certain business information; and (3) requires Defendants to preserve records. (Mot. for Prelim. Inj. 2:14-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A) Preliminary Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under Section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (\"FTC Act\"), the Court may grant the FTC a preliminary injunction \"[u]pon a proper showing that, weighing the equities and considering the Commission's likelihood of ultimate success, such action would be in the public interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2053\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Thus, the burden is on the FTC to demonstrate that it is likely to prevail on its claims that Defendants engaged in: (1) misrepresentations regarding journal publishing; (2) a deceptive failure to disclose publishing fees; and (3) misrepresentations regarding conferences. \"Because irreparable injury must be presumed in a statutory enforcement action, the district court need only ... find some chance of probable success on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    World Wide Factors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1820839\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/882/344/#p346\">\n    882 F.2d at 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court finds that the FTC has satisfied its burden of demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims, and considers each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    1) Misrepresentations Regarding Journal Publishing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The evidence produced by the FTC demonstrates that Defendants engaged in probable misrepresentations regarding journal publishing. On the OMICS website, for example, OMICS makes numerous representations indicating that it follows standard peer-review practices. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX12 Att. L at 657, 773, 748, Ex. 12 to Mot. for Prelim Inj., ECF No. 9-12).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under standard industry practice, the peer review process often takes several weeks or even months and involves multiple rounds of substantive feedback from experts in the related field. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX13 \u00b6\u00b6 9-10). In contrast, the FTC has provided evidence that Defendants' peer review practices, in numerous instances, took a matter of days and contained no comments or substantive feedback. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX04 \u00b6 4; PX07 \u00b6 4; PX06 \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; PX09 \u00b6 5; PX10 \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This inadequacy is further demonstrated by statements from purported \"editors,\" which indicate that they never received manuscripts to review or else even agreed to be listed as an editor. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX03 \u00b6\u00b6 3-4; PX11 \u00b6 7). In some instances, individuals listed as \"editors\" without permission requested removal from the website without success. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX02 \u00b6 4; PX08 \u00b6\u00b6 4-7; PX06 \u00b6 11). In other instances, Defendants sent out email solicitations on behalf of academics without their permission. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX11 \u00b6 7). With respect to the journals themselves, Defendants use names that are nearly identical to other respected journals, which has led to consumers mistakenly submitting articles to Defendants' journal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX07 \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The FTC has also submitted evidence demonstrating that Defendants misrepresent\n   the \"impact factor\" of their journals (i.e. the number of citations in other reputable journals). Notably, the term impact factor is understood in the community to mean the annual calculation released by Thomson Reuters. (PX13 \u00b6 12). Defendants, however, base their impact factor off of a Google Scholar search. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX12 Att. L at 770). Additionally, the FTC has submitted evidence that Defendants misleadingly represent that their publications are indexed in well-known, reputable indexing services. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX12 Att. L at 643, 657; PX13 \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 25-27). In opposition, Defendants have submitted evidence purporting to demonstrate the legitimacy of their businesses. However, the FTC has substantively responded to this evidence and demonstrated the numerous flaws and inaccuracies in Defendants' representations. The Court therefore finds that the evidence in the record is sufficient to support a preliminary conclusion that Defendants made misrepresentations regarding their journal publishing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    2) Deceptive Failure to Disclose Publishing Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The evidence produced by the FTC indicates that Defendants deceptively fail to disclose publishing fees. Notably, the FTC has provided evidence that Defendants send out emails soliciting the submission of articles to their service but make no mention of associated fees. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX04 Att. A at 6, PX09 Att. A at 4; PX10 Att. D at 16). Furthermore, the fee disclosures that are made on Defendants' websites are difficult to find. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX12 Att. L at 632). Moreover, as the email solicitations invite consumers to submit articles directly through email, a consumer may end up submitting an article without even viewing the website. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX04 Att. A at 6). The FTC has also submitted evidence indicating that industry practice when charging publication fees is to clearly disclose the fees before authors submit their articles. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX13 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6). A consumer could therefore reasonably and mistakenly assume that there is no charge for publishing in Defendants' journals. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX04 \u00b6 5). Furthermore, when consumers contest Defendants' publication fees and ask their articles to be withdrawn, Defendants have ignored those requests and continued demanding payment. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX04 \u00b6\u00b6 6-8; PX06 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8; PX07 \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8). In some instances, Defendants only removed the articles after the threat of legal action. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX07 \u00b6\u00b6 9-10). The FTC asserts that these practices not only cause financial harm to consumers, but also prevent consumers from resubmitting articles to more reputable journals. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Prelim. Inj. 12:23-27). The Court therefore finds that the evidence in the record is sufficient to support a preliminary conclusion that Defendants deceptively fail to disclose publishing fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    3) Misrepresentations Regarding Conferences\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The evidence produced by the FTC demonstrates that Defendants engaged in probable misrepresentations regarding their conferences. Notably, the FTC has provided evidence indicating that Defendants advertise the attendance and participation of prominent academics and researchers without their permission or actual affiliation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX05 \u00b6\u00b6 3,5; PX12 Att. U at 1045). In numerous instances, individuals have requested unsuccessfully to have their names removed from Defendants' conference advertising materials. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX03 \u00b6\u00b6 6-12). Often, Defendants do not remove an individuals' name until the threat of legal action. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PX05 \u00b6 7). Had consumers known of Defendants' misrepresentations, they may not have agreed to participate in or be affiliated with Defendants' conferences.

(Mot. for Prelim. Inj. 12:4-6). Furthermore, the FTC provided evidence showing that the websites belonging to the three corporations use similar language, often link to one another, and advertise some of the same journals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2:2-3:17). With respect to common ownership, the FTC has demonstrated that Defendant Gedela is the authorized signatory on the financial accounts of the Corporate Defendants, as well as the registrant for each of their websites. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The FTC has also provided evidence that each company is a beneficiary of and participant in the same shared business scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In opposition, Defendants point out perceived gaps in the FTC's evidence and incorrectly assume that the FTC needs to demonstrate each one of the above factors to show a common enterprise. For example, Defendants note that \"the FTC [has not] provided evidence which proves the type of address the principal place of business is.\" (Defs.' Resp 11:11-16, ECF No. 32). Defendants theorize, without citing to any evidence, that as internet companies \"it is highly likely that the address is simply a common registered agent similar to those based in the United States where companies have no actual relationship to each other ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court does not find this theoretical argument sufficient to counter the evidence that Defendants share a principal place of business and have common ownership. Based on the record, the Court finds that the FTC is likely to succeed in proving that the Corporate Defendants engaged in a common enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    5) Gedela's Liability for Injunctive and Monetary Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Personal liability for violations of the FTC Act fall into two categories: liability for injunctive relief and liability for monetary relief.

As detailed above, Gedela is the founder, principal, and owner of the Corporate Defendants. He has signatory authority over the corporations' financial accounts and is the billing contact for Defendants' websites. The OMICS website itself openly proclaims Gedela as the \"CEO and Managing Director,\" and states that iMedPub LLC and Conference Series LLC are subsidiaries of OMICS International. (PX12 Att. L at 937; PX22 Att. C at 17). Furthermore, Gedela's own sworn declaration does not dispute his participation in the Corporate Defendants' business. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants cite to a number of cases denying individual liability based on an individual's limited involvement in a company.

Balancing of the Public and Private Interests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In balancing the equities, public equities receive far greater weight than private equities.\n   <em>\n    Affordable Media\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"844459\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/179/1228/#p1235\">\n    179 F.3d at 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As discussed above, the FTC has sufficiently demonstrated that Defendants likely engaged in unlawful and deceptive representations regarding their publishing, fee scheme, and conferences. As a result, the evidence clearly demonstrates that the public equities-protection of consumers from Defendants' deceptive practices and effective enforcement of the law-weigh heavily in favor of granting injunctive relief. Absent such an injunction, the Court finds it likely that Defendants will continue to engage in deceptive practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In contrast, the Court does not find the private equities in this case compelling.

Here, an injunction is necessary to prevent potential harmful and illegal behavior and will not prohibitively impact any of Defendants' legitimate business activities. Defendants argue in their opposition that \"the practical effect of a preliminary injunction in the eyes of the\n   public would be that Defendants are guilty of fraud and other wrongful actions\" and therefore an injunction would be \"irreparably devastating\" to the Defendants. (Defs.' Resp. 16:13-17). Defendants' assertion is hardly unique-the same faulty argument could be made in regard to any preliminary injunction. Defendants argument is therefore unpersuasive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the balance of hardships favors a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandates that a court dismiss a cause of action that fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    North Star Int'l v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   5:15-22). For the reasons already stated in this Order, Defendants' argument concerning the sufficiency of the evidence against them fails. The issue then turns on whether the Complaint sufficiently states a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court notes that Defendants' Motion incorrectly focuses only on the paragraphs explicitly detailing the respective claims.

The\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   standard is particularly appropriate where the plaintiff is reasonably unable to obtain specific knowledge at the pleading stage regarding \"the particularized conduct of each defendant in the alleged corporate fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.

The allegations in the Complaint span across multiple years and involve a substantial number of allegedly wronged consumers. Moreover, the facts concerning Gedela's specific actions in the scheme were reasonably unattainable at the initial pleading stage. With respect to the Corporate Defendants, the Complaint meets the 9(b) standard by establishing that all allegations apply to each Defendant as part of an alleged joint scheme. Notably, the Complaint sufficiently alleges the same \"common enterprise\" theory as discussed above. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-10).
