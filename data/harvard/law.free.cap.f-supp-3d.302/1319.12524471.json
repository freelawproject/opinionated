(\"Hard Rock (USA)\"), Hamish Dodds, and Michael Beacham (collectively \"Defendants\") for violating the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"FDUTPA\") (Count I) and for civil conspiracy (Count II). Currently before the Court is Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. 109). Upon consideration and review of the record as cited by the parties in their respective briefs, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 is rock-and-roll-themed restaurant and retail business with locations around the world. (Doc. 118, \u00b6 1). The majority of Hard Rock businesses located outside of the United States are franchised locations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4). Hard Rock Limited-a non-party to this litigation-is a foreign entity that engages in the international franchising of Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 businesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2). Defendant Hard Rock (USA) is a Florida corporation formed in 1996 in part to provide franchise support services and management oversight to Hard Rock franchisees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff HRCC is a British Virgin Islands entity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). In June 2000, HRCC and Hard Rock Limited entered into a franchise agreement (the \"Franchise Agreement\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8). Under the Franchise Agreement, Hard Rock Limited licensed to HRCC the right to use the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 mark, and HRCC promised to establish and operate a Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 business in Nassau, the Bahamas, and to pay Hard Rock Limited a royalty on merchandise and food and beverage sales. (Doc. 105-3, p. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Due to certain business licensure restrictions in the Bahamas, HRCC sub-licensed its rights to operate the Nassau Hard Rock business to separate Bahamian companies. (Doyle Dep.1439:15-18). From 2000 to 2004, pursuant to a sub-franchise agreement with HRCC, Habacoe Limited (\"Habacoe\") owned and operated the Nassau Hard Rock business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1454:3-6). In 2004, when the business relationship between Habacoe and HRCC deteriorated, HRCC formed a separate Bahamian entity, HRCC (Bahamas) Ltd., to continue the Nassau Hard Rock business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1455:1-4). HRCC (Bahamas) Ltd. owned and operated the Nassau Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 business from April 2004 until March 31, 2014. (Doc. 118, \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Beginning in 2013, HRCC failed to pay Hard Rock Limited all of the royalties that were due under the Franchise Agreement. Hard Rock Limited warned HRCC that if the royalties were not paid as required, the Franchise Agreement would be terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Wolszczak Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 32-35; Lorenzo Aff., \u00b6\u00b6 5-7). HRCC did not pay all of the required loyalties, and Hard Rock Limited accordingly terminated the Franchise Agreement on January 6, 2014. (Doc. 118, \u00b6 10). HRCC (Bahamas) continued operating the Hard Rock restaurant in Nassau until a liquidator was appointed on March 31, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Throughout the operation of the Bahamian Hard Rock franchise, Hard Rock (USA) provided management and administrative services to HRCC. (Doc. 108-2, \u00b6 7). It is the nature of these \"services\" that gave rise to this lawsuit. HRCC contends that Hard Rock (USA) interfered with the management of the business and prevented HRCC from making a profit. In contrast, Hard Rock (USA) contends that any actions it took with regard to HRCC's Nassau business were based upon valid \"business decisions.\" (Doc. 109, p. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In December 2014, after HRCC lost its Bahamian franchise, HRCC filed this law suit under the Court's diversity jurisdiction. In its Second Amended Complaint, HRCC maintains that Hard Rock (USA), together with Hard Rock executives Hamish Dodds (\"Dodds\") and Michael Beacham (\"Beacham\"), caused the franchise to incur financial losses by refusing to provide concessions given to other franchisees; by failing to disclose that other Hard Rock stores were experiencing losses in food sales; by fabricating reasons to justify terminating the Franchise Agreement; and by wrongfully terminating the Franchise Agreement. (Doc. 38, \u00b6 95(a)-(h) ). Based on these actions, HRCC asserts two claims: In Count I HRCC alleges that Defendants committed deceptive and unfair practices in violation of FDUTPA. In Count II, HRCC alleges that Defendants Dodds and Beacham \"conspired with one another to drive HRCC out of business in an effort to wrongfully seize the franchises and re-sell such franchises to a third party for profit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99). HRCC seeks \"recovery of all monies tendered by HRCC in connection with the opening and operation of its Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 restaurant franchise.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 17). Defendants now move for summary judgment on both the FDUTPA claim and the civil conspiracy claim. (Doc. 109, p. 14-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Defendants move for summary judgment on the FDUTPA claim, arguing, among other things, that HRCC failed to provide any evidence of actual damages-a required element under FDUTPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   FDUTPA provides that \"[i]n any action brought by a person who has suffered a loss as a result of a violation of this part, such person may recover\n   <em>\n    actual damages\n   </em>\n   , plus attorney's fees and court costs ....\" \u00a7 501.211(2) (emphasis added).

July 14, 2014). Although \"actual damages\" is not defined in the statute, courts have consistently applied a narrow definition of the term:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Generally, the measure of actual damages is the difference in the market value of the product or service in the condition in which it was delivered and its market value in the condition in which it should have been delivered according to the contract of the parties. A notable exception to the rule may exist when the product is rendered valueless as a result of the defect-then the purchase price is the appropriate measure of actual damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Dem. Rep. Congo v. Air Capital Grp., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=614%20Fed.%20Appx.%20460\">\n    614 Fed.Appx. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 472 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rollins, Inc. v.

Thus, there are only two possible ways to measure actual damages in a FDUTPA claim: (1) the value between what was promised and what was delivered; or (2) the total price paid for a valueless good or service.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=614%20Fed.%20Appx.%20460\">\n    614 Fed.Appx. at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In their Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants state: \"HRCC deferred providing its 'actual damages' composition and proof until making its expert disclosures but unaccountably made no expert disclosure or supplementation.\" (Doc. 109, p. 19).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argue that HRCC cannot maintain its FDUTPA action because HRCC failed to provide any computations or estimates of actual damages-despite ample opportunity to do so through the discovery process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In order to survive Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, HRCC must point to evidence sufficient to allow a jury to reasonably find that it incurred actual damages, as measured under FDUTPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2839133\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/446/1160/#p1162\">\n    446 F.3d at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In its response to Defendants' summary judgment motion, however, HRCC makes no attempt to clarify the issue of damages and instead focuses its response on the\n   issue of whether the Defendants' actions can be considered \"unfair or deceptive.\" (Doc. 108, p. 18). Indeed, in a single paragraph, HRCC responded to Defendants' FDUTPA arguments without any mention of damages at all. Moreover, a careful review of the record reveals that HRCC has avoided providing any meaningful evidence that would satisfy the measure of damages needed for a successful FDUTPA claim. To be sure, HRCC makes several references in the record to damages in the form of lost profits and added expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such references have no bearing on the issue of damages in this case, however, because they do not fall within the two established measures for damages for a FDUTPA claim. Without any response from HRCC regarding its actual damages, the Court is left with nothing but conjecture as to what, if any, its actual damages are. HRCC's burden at this stage of the proceedings is well established: Where a nonmoving party fails to make a showing on an essential element of their claim, \"the plain language of Rule 56(c)\n   <em>\n    mandates\n   </em>\n   the entry of summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    477 U.S. at 322-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In this case, HRCC has failed to provide any evidence of its actual damages-an essential element under FDUTPA. Summary judgment is therefore mandated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Cases disposing of FDUTPA claims for failing to establish actual damages are numerous. For example, in\n   <em>\n    National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh v. Tyco Integrated Security., LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-CIV-80371,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203905018\">\n    2015 WL 3905018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Hanson Hams, Inc. v. HBH Franchise Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 03-61198-CIV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%205470401\">\n    2004 WL 5470401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.

In both cases, the plaintiffs provided at least some estimation of their alleged damages. Here, conversely, at no point does HRCC provide an estimation, calculation, or even explanation of what, if any, its damages are. As the aforementioned cases instruct, summary judgment of a FDUTPA claim is proper where a defendant fails to make a sufficient showing of actual damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because HRCC has failed to establish an essential element of its FDUTPA claim, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Similarly, the Third Circuit has held that the exception applies \"when the employees have acted for their\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   personal benefit and thus outside the course and scope of their employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Heffernan v. Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1733492\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/189/405/#p412\">\n    189 F.3d 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 412 (3d Cir. 1999) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buschi v.

As these cases instruct, the personal stake exception requires more than some incidental personal benefit-the exception applies only \"where corporate employees are shown to have been motivated\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   by personal bias.\"\n   <em>\n    Hartman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11932109\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/4/465/#p470\">\n    4 F.3d at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   According to HRCC, the personal stake exception applies to this case because Dodds and Beacham both had bonus-earning potential tied to Hard Rock's success. (Doc. 121, p. 18). Such an interpretation, however, is contrary to a line decisions that have held that higher compensation to a corporate employee is not a sufficient \"personal interest\" to trigger application of the personal stake exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailey v.

Va. 1999). As explained by the court in\n   <em>\n    Gwinn\n   </em>\n   , \"any 'personal stake' defendants had in increased commissions was incidental to their employment relationship with [the corporation] because their commissions were determined and paid by [the corporation].\"\n   <em>\n    Gwinn\n   </em>\n   , at *25. Such interests are not \"wholly independent\" from the corporation's interest, and therefore cannot be considered a \"personal stake.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11554482\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/70/626/#p633\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This analysis is persuasive. Where, as here, a corporate agent's compensation is directly related to the corporation's success, the two interests cannot be separated and the personal stake exception does not apply. In this case, the personal interest HRCC alleges is a bonus-earning potential \"based upon Hard Rock's performance.\" (Doc. 121, p. 19). By HRCC's own account, the bonus-earning potential is directly related to the corporation's success. Because these interests cannot be separated, the personal stake exception does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   HRCC's only other argument for application of the personal stake exception is that Beacham's own emails \"prove that he had a motive to rid the Hard Rock system of Kevin Doyle, who he described as a cancer.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). HRCC provides neither an explanation nor legal support for this assertion. Nonetheless, the personal animosity that HRCC suggests is woefully inadequate to support application of the personal stake exception. As previously stated, the personal stake exception requires more than some incidental personal benefit. Any personal satisfaction that Beacham would receive from \"ridding\" Hard Rock of its interaction with Kevin Doyle simply does not rise to an independent personal gain that would warrant application of the personal stake exception. And other courts agree. In\n   <em>\n    Cox v. Cache County\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:08-cv-124 CW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204854450\">\n    2013 WL 4854450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (D. Utah Sept. 11, 2013), the district court found that the defendant's personal animosity against the plaintiff was not a personal stake for civil conspiracy purposes. Also, in\n   <em>\n    Jones v. City of College Park\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3714563\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/540/1300/\">\n    540 F.Supp.2d 1300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ga. 2007), the district court found that racial animosity against the plaintiff was not a sufficient personal interest, explaining that the exception \"would only apply to defendants with independent\n   <em>\n    economic\n   </em>\n   stake in the conspiracy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3714563\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/540/1300/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1321 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    On-Site Dev.

Similarly here, Beacham's personal animosity-if any-is not a sufficient personal interest to warrant application of the personal stake exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To support its personal stake argument, HRCC directs the Court to only one case,\n   <em>\n    Regions Bank v. Kaplan\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:12-CV-1837-T-17MAP,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205088889\">\n    2014 WL 5088889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Fla. Sept. 30, 2014). That case involved a motion to dismiss a civil conspiracy claim in a suit against multiple LLCs, all of which consisted of the same sole managing member.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. The defendant LLCs argued that each entity consisted of the same sole member and, therefore, they collectively lacked the multiplicity of actors necessary for the formation of a conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court held otherwise, finding that each limited liability company was a separate entity capable of conspiring.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the holding in\n   <em>\n    Regions Bank\n   </em>\n   does nothing more that reiterate the well-established principle that, for a conspiracy claim, there must be two or more parties. Here, both Defendants\n   named in the conspiracy claim were executives of Hard Rock (USA) at all relevant times. Any actions they took within the scope of their employment are attributed to the corporation. No claims have been made, and no facts suggest, that Dodds or Beacham were acting outside the scope of their employment. As it is firmly established: \"[E]mployees, when acting in the scope of their employment, cannot conspire amongst themselves.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%202708308\">\n    2005 WL 2708308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    McAndrew v.

Defendants' Counter Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court's ruling on Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment resolves all remaining claims raised by HRCC in its Second Amended Complaint. There still remains unresolved the counterclaim raised by Defendants in their answer to HRCC's Second Amended Complaint. (Doc. 70). In their counterclaim, Defendants seek recognition under the Florida Uniform Out-of-Country Foreign-Money Judgment Recognition Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2055.601\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 55.601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -.607, of two judgments issued in the Royal Court of Jersey. Defendants explain in their Motion for Summary Judgment that they seek recognition not for collection of the judgment, but because the judgments are \"fatal to HRCC's claims against Hard Rock (USA)\". (Doc. 109, p. 23). In light of the Court's ruling on summary judgment, Defendants are asked to advise the Court as to the status of this remaining counterclaim. Moreover, if Defendants wish to pursue the counterclaim, Defendants are advised to provide the Court with copies of the judgments issued by the Royal Court of Jersey. Although Defendants attempted to attach the judgments to their counterclaim, they appear to have inadvertently provided the Court with only one of the judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
