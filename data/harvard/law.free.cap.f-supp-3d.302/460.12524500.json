(\"Madico\"). She brought this action against the defendants, Omron Scientific Technologies, Inc. and Omron STI Machine Services, Inc. (collectively \"Omron\"), alleging that Omron had been negligent in its inspection, testing and/or servicing of the laminating machine. Omron brought a Third-Party Complaint against Madico for contractual indemnification and breach of contract. This matter is presently before\n   the court on \"Defendants Omron Scientific Technologies, Inc.'s and Omron STI Machine Services, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.\" (Docket No. 78). Therein, Omron is seeking judgment on all counts of the Amended Complaint on the grounds that Madico's modification of the equipment after Omron's work was completed constituted an intervening and superseding cause as a matter of law, and that Omron owed no duty of care to the plaintiff as a matter of law. Because this court finds that there are material facts in dispute, Omron's motion for summary judgment is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Madico's Retention of Omron\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Madico is a manufacturer of laminating and coating films for windows and other applications. It has a facility in Woburn, Massachusetts. Omron is a machine and safeguarding consulting company. It is hired by manufacturing customers to, among other things, conduct safety training, evaluate equipment, and recommend, design and install safety improvements. See PF \u00b6 36; DR \u00b6 36. In August 2009, Madico retained Omron to perform a machine safeguarding assessment on equipment at the Woburn facility, including a composite coating/laminating line, known internally at Madico as LC-3. SF \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. Specifically, Omron was retained to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Perform on-site machine safeguarding assessment pursuant to relevant OSHA, ANSI, and NFPA standards and other applicable guidelines as identified by the customer for the equipment specified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Identify risk level based on intended operator interface and maintenance requirements and recommend commensurate risk reduction measures for the associated equipment.

SF \u00b6\u00b6 3-5. Ms. Brettell was aware that Omron had come to Madico to perform a safety evaluation of the laminating machine \"to see what needed to be fixed or modified to make it safer.\" PR \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Semenchuk prepared an initial assessment report in which he identified the risk of serious injury to employees working the LC-3 laminating machine as \"HIGH.\" SF \u00b6 7; PR \u00b6 7. After the initial report was issued, Mr. Semenchuk returned to Madico, met with various Madico employees to review his initial report, and issued a revised assessment report dated December 23, 2009. SF \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. It is disputed whether during these meetings Madico advised Mr. Semenchuk that workers\n   needed access to the laminating area with the machine running to clean the roll. PF \u00b6 51; DR \u00b6 51. It is also disputed whether the parties discussed (and agreed to the possibility of) enclosing the laminating area entirely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PF \u00b6 56; DR \u00b6 56. The revised report proposed an alternative safeguarding recommendation for the laminating platform of the LC-3. SF \u00b6 10; PR \u00b6 10. Of significance, the parties dispute whether either the initial report or the revised report identified the area where Ms. Brettell was injured as a potential area of injury. PF \u00b6 54; DR \u00b6 54. The parties also dispute whether Omron identified the risk to which Ms. Brettell was exposed. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges, and the defendant denies, that Omron \"never identified the transport idlers where Ms. Brettell was entrapped as a crush point or potential in-running nip point.\" PF \u00b6 55; DR \u00b6 55. Furthermore, the parties dispute whether Omron's suggested safety recommendations were viable or would adversely affect the operation and utility of the machine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SF \u00b6 10-11; PR \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Madico did not retain Omron to do any further work after it issued its revised assessment report. SF \u00b6 12. Rather, Paul Malburg, Madico's controls engineer, was responsible for implementing any safety modifications.

PR \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15. It is also undisputed that Madico, with the assistance of an outside mechanical engineering consultant, Gary Blaney, designed and installed a \"clean air enclosure\" around an area of the LC-3 machine. PR \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. While Omron contends that the clean air enclosure modified the work area and contributed to Ms. Brettell's injury, the plaintiff contends that the clean air enclosure did not involve the area where Ms. Brettell was hurt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PR \u00b6 16. The plaintiff also contends that since Omron never identified the area where Ms. Brettell was injured as a potential in-running nip or crush point, Madico was deprived of the opportunity to take steps to protect that area of the machine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PF \u00b6 58; DR \u00b6 58; PR \u00b6\u00b6 16-19. Mr. Blaney was not aware of Omron's work, including its reports, and Omron was not aware of Mr. Blaney's work, including his designs. SF \u00b6\u00b6 20-22. The clean air enclosure was completed in late 2009. SF \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In January 2011, Madico purchased two Omron-branded safety mats and installed one in the area of the laminating platform of the LC-3 machine, and the other on the concrete floor alongside the LC-3 machine. SF \u00b6 24. Omron contends that this installation was designed by Malburg of Madico and was not based on Omron's reports or recommendations. SF \u00b6 25. The plaintiff, however, alleges that the safety mats were installed with Omron's approval.

She observed a defect in the laminate surface and held a solvent soaked rag against the roll to clean it. PR \u00b6 28. It is undisputed that as she was cleaning the idler roller, either the plaintiff's rag or rubber glove became caught against the film, and the moving web pulled her arm into the machine just before her elbow. SF \u00b6 30. As a result, she suffered a crush injury to her right hand and arm. PR \u00b6 30.

Stone &amp; Webster Eng'g Corp.\n   </em>\n   , quoted above. In\n   <em>\n    Parent\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff, an electrician, was injured while testing the voltage in an electrical distribution panel. He claimed that he would not have conducted the test as he did if the panel had been appropriately labelled \"Danger High-Voltage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=974%20N.E.2d%2034\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=974%20N.E.2d%2034\">\n    at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=556%20N.E.2d%201009\">\n    556 N.E.2d at 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Stone &amp; Webster had been hired by Parent's employer as a project manager for a project which involved updating the electrical system, and was responsible for preparing an evaluation of the electrical system, including the distribution panel where Parent was injured.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114-15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=556%20N.E.2d%201009\">\n    556 N.E.2d at 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reversing summary judgment in favor of the defendant, the SJC held that Stone &amp; Webster had \"failed to demonstrate that it owed no duty to Parent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=556%20N.E.2d%201009\">\n    556 N.E.2d at 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Court ruled,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Thus, there is an indication in the record that Stone &amp; Webster, pursuant to the performance of its contractual duties, either did discover, or should have discovered, the fact that the distribution panel at issue here carried 2,300 volts and was not properly labeled. Further, the language of the 1982 contract contains support for the proposition that Stone &amp; Webster should have corrected this hazard or brought it to the attention of Montaup. In view of these considerations, Stone &amp; Webster has not demonstrated\n   that a jury could find it unforeseeable to Stone &amp; Webster that any negligent performance of its duties could pose serious risks to plant employees such as Parent, including the particular risk which actually materialized.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=556%20N.E.2d%201009\">\n    556 N.E.2d at 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in the instant case \"there is an indication in the record\" that in furtherance of its contractual duties, Omron should have discovered the condition that caused the plaintiff's injuries, and brought it to the attention of Madico. Like Stone &amp; Webster, Omron \"has not demonstrated that a jury could find it unforeseeable to [Omron] that any negligent performance of its duties could pose serious risks to plant employees such as [Ms. Brettell], including the particular risk which actually materialized.\" Therefore, summary judgment is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Omron has attempted to avoid this conclusion by arguing that\n   <em>\n    Parent\n   </em>\n   cited to the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 324A in support of the proposition that \"a claim in tort may arise from a contractual relationship\" and that Ms. Brettell cannot satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 324A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Omron Reply (Docket No. 107) at 2-3. Assuming, arguendo, that \u00a7 324A is controlling, summary judgment is still unwarranted. Section 324A provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   One who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of a third person or his things, is subject to liability to the third person for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to protect his undertaking, if\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (a) his failure to exercise reasonable care increases the risk of such harm, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (b) he has undertaken to perform a duty owed by the other to the third person, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (c) the harm is suffered because of reliance of the other or the third person upon the undertaking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 324A (1965). Despite Omron's protestations to the contrary, a jury might find that by negligently failing to identify the risk at the site where Ms. Brettell was injured, Omron increased the risk of harm. A jury could determine that Madico took no steps to render that area safer, although it would have taken such steps if the risk had been properly identified. Thus, if \u00a7 324A controls, Omron may still be found to have owed a duty of care to the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Omron argues that it has no duty of care to the plaintiff because she cannot establish that she relied on Omron's services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Omron Mem. (Docket No. 79) at 15, 18-19. There is case law to the effect that tort liability to a potential beneficiary of a contractual obligation is limited \"to cases where the plaintiff's harm was the foreseeable result of the defendant's negligence in that the plaintiff rightfully relied on the defendant and the defendant knew that the plaintiff would rely on his services or the defendant should have anticipated the plaintiff's reliance and resulting harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. James L. Cooney Ins. Agency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3769556\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/66/156/#p163\">\n    66 Mass. App. Ct. 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 163,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=845%20N.E.2d%201187\">\n    845 N.E.2d 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1193-94 (2006) (internal punctuation and citations omitted). Assuming that these principles are applicable here, a jury may find that Madico's employees, including the plaintiff, relied on Omron to identify safety risks, and Omron, at a minimum, should have anticipated that the employees would rely on it to identify the safety risks. There is also evidence in the record that Ms. Brettell, in particular, knew that Omron was engaged in a safety study at the plant. Under such circumstances, a jury may find there was sufficient reliance to establish that Omron\n   owed a duty of care to the plaintiff. Summary judgment is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For all the reasons detailed herein, the Omron Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket No. 78) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Unless otherwise indicated, the facts are derived from Omron's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"SF ----\"); Plaintiff's Response to Omron's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"PR ----\"); Plaintiff's Statement of Additional Material Facts (\"PF ----\"); and the Omron Defendants' Response to Plaintiff's Statement of Additional Material Facts (\"DR ----\").
