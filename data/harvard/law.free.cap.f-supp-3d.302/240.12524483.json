Spiller and McCray allege that they were unlawfully arrested, injured, and detained, and that Spiller was maliciously prosecuted, after police officers observed them laughing at a fight outside a nightclub in Washington, D.C.

The Court recently held, for example, that \"the Fourth Amendment governs a claim for unlawful pretrial detention even beyond the start of legal process.\"\n   <em>\n    Manuel v.

Similarly, the Court's earlier holding in\n   <em>\n    Wallace v.

The Court is persuaded that only a minimal restriction of the plaintiff's liberty is required to state a claim, but nonetheless concludes that the allegations in Spiller's complaint do not satisfy even that modest demand. Indeed, putting aside legal conclusions, he merely pleads, without any elaboration, that he was required to appear in court. In his\n   opposition brief, however, Spiller adds that he was \"released [following his arraignment] on personal recogniz[ance] with release conditions under the supervision of the Pretrial Services Agency.\" Dkt. 19 at 21-22. He describes those conditions as being \"laborious and life[-]altering requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.

Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Count VIII alleges \"that the grossly negligent misconduct by the Defendant Police Officers\" and the general \"misconduct\" of the Defendants \"directly and proximately caused Plaintiff Spiller to lose his sole source of employment, suffer serious physical injury including bodily injury, pain and suffering, shock, anxiety, sleeplessness, and extreme emotional distress, and humiliation.\" Dkt. 1 at 16 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75-76). The complaint is unclear whether this count alleges a violation of \u00a7 1983 or the common law, and Defendants initially moved to dismiss as to both theories of liability for failure to state a claim. In their reply, however, Defendants withdrew their motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claim of common law negligent infliction of emotional distress, and now seek only to dismiss Plaintiffs' claim to the extent it is premised on \u00a7 1983. Dkt. 21 at 5. They argue, in particular, that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim because \"negligence causing a deprivation of property cannot give rise to a constitutional due process violation pursuant to \u00a7 1983.\" Dkt. 13 at 21; Dkt. 21 at 5. This argument is a non sequitur; Plaintiffs do at times allege monetary loses\n   stemming from a loss of employment, but the complaint makes clear that they are also alleging \"shock, anxiety, sleeplessness, and extreme emotional distress, and humiliation\" resulting from a loss of liberty, rather than property. Dkt. 1 at 16 (Compl. \u00b6 76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs' opposition further complicates the matter by abandoning the \u00a7 1983 argument as it relates to the individual officers, and instead arguing that the negligence resulting in their emotional distress stemmed from MPD's maintenance of \"a policy, practice, or custom\" regarding arrests of innocent onlookers. Dkt. 19 at 24-25. Plaintiffs then repeat that their \"unlawful arrest\" resulted in \"the application of unnecessary an[d] excessive force\" directly attributable \"to the training and supervision of the Defendant Officers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267623\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/24/#p35\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267623\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/24/#p35\">\n    at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because these claims all allege that the District of Columbia's training, policies, and procedures led to the deprivation of Plaintiffs' civil rights in violation of \u00a7 1983, the Court will dismiss Count VIII-insofar as it seeks to advance a distinct claim under \u00a7 1983-on the same grounds discussed in the context of Counts IV and V below. To the extent Count VIII alleges a common law claim, however, Defendants do not seek dismissal, and thus that more limited claim stands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Negligent Training and Supervision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs allege in Counts IV and V that the District of Columbia's negligent training and supervision of its police force led to Plaintiffs' injuries.

The complaint does not specify whether these claims are brought under the common law or \u00a7 1983. Defendants argue that any common law claim must be dismissed for failure to comply with the D.C. notice statute, and they further argue that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for negligent supervision and training, whether framed as arising under the common law or \u00a7 1983.

Code, states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [A]n action may not be maintained against the District of Columbia for unliquidated damages to person or property unless, within six months after the injury or damage was sustained, the claimant, his agent, or attorney has given notice in writing to the Mayor of the District of Columbia of the approximate time, place, cause, and circumstances of the injury or damage.
