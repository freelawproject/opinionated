DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Farmacia Medina defendants challenge the amended complaint on two\n   fronts. First, they argue that the amended complaint alleges a litany of violations pursuant to the ADA without averring that the Farmacia Medina defendants own the facility. Second, the Farmacia Medina defendants contend that the amended complaint contains no factual allegations that they \"could even investigate in order to defend themselves.\" (Docket No. 18 at p. 6.) Both arguments are unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Allegations that Defendants Own the Facility\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Farmacia Medina defendants assert that they do not own the facility. (Docket No. 18 at p. 1.) This argument contests the factual validity of the amended complaint. Medina alleges specifically that the Farmacia Medina defendants \"own, operate, and/or lease the [f]acility,\" and that \"defendants have possessed and enjoyed sufficient control and authority to modify the [f]acility.\" (Docket No. 27 at pp. 2 &amp; 6.) In the Rule 12(b)(6) context, \"[n]on-conclusory factual allegations in the complaint must be treated as true, even if seemingly incredible.\"\n   <em>\n    Rocket Learning, Inc. v. Rivera-Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3548928\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/851/384/#p389\">\n    851 F.Supp.2d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 389 (D.P.R. 2012) (Besosa, J.) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court will not make factual findings at this stage of the litigation. At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court must accept as true the factual allegations set forth in the amended complaint. Accordingly, the Farmacia defendants assertion that they do not own the facilitate is an insufficient basis upon which to premise dismissal of the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Amended Complaint Sets Forth Sufficient Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Without citing precedent, the ADA or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Farmacia Medina defendants cursorily argue that the amended complaint is devoid of factual allegations necessary for them to oppose the Title III cause of action. (Docket No. 18 at p. 6.) The Court disagrees. Indeed, the amended complaint sufficiently sets forth a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that [Medina] is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Congress enacted the ADA to \"address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Dudley v.

Medina also asserts that because of his walking abnormality, he is unable to sit, stand, and walk.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050002\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/659/182/#p187\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In sum, Medina alleges that his impairment substantially limits major life activities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050002\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/659/182/#p187\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants do not dispute that Medina is impaired within the meaning of the ADA. The Court is satisfied that Medina adequately has alleged that he is an individual with a qualified disability pursuant to the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Place of Public Accommodation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The second requirement pursuant to Title III of the ADA is that a defendant \"owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Pursuant to the ADA, public accommodation encompasses \"a bakery, grocery store, clothing store, hardware store, shopping center, or other sales or rental establishment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012181\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7)(e). Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion does not address this element of a Title III claim. Medina, however, avers that the facility falls within the statutory definition of public accommodation because it is \"open to the public.\" (Docket No. 27 at p. 3.) Accordingly, Medina has fulfilled the second requirement by asserting that the property is a place of \"public accommodation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Discriminated Against\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Lastly, an ADA plaintiff must establish that he or she was discriminated against because of his or her disability.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Title III outlines prohibited activities that constitute discrimination. Disability discrimination includes,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"a failure to remove architectural barriers, and communication barriers that are structural in nature, in existing facilities [...] where such removal is readily achievable.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(iv). Plaintiffs must demonstrate that the removal of architectural barriers on defendants' property is \"readily achievable,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , is easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(iv) ;\n   <em>\n    Disabled Ams. for Equal Access, Inc. v.

He alleges in the amended complaint that four physical barriers obstruct access\n   to the facility.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at pp. 3-4. Moreover, Medina contends that he is aware that an additional eleven barriers exist at the facility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 4 &amp; 5. These barriers, Medina claims, render the building unsafe, deter him from returning, and deprive him of the \"ability to use and enjoy the goods, services, privileges and accommodations offered at the [f]acility.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2.

Feb. 1, 2016) (denying motion to dismiss even where plaintiff only stated that the removal of twenty-three barriers was readily achievable because that claim was plausible considering the violations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The burden of providing evidence pertaining to architectural barriers at the facility rests with Medina. The Court acknowledges that \"whether the plaintiff can ultimately carry that burden is not material to the question of whether the complaint has adequately alleged a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Melo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20393258\">\n    2016 WL 393258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2011583\">\n    2016 U.S. Dist.

For the limited purposes of ruling on the Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss before the Court, the Court finds it plausible that removing the alleged barriers is readily achievable. Because the complaint describes four architectural barriers in violation of the ADA, each of which may be removed plausibly, Medina has pled sufficient facts to bring a Title III ADA claim.

(Docket Nos. 19 and 20.) The Court will not adopt these motions. The arguments raised by the Farmacia Medina defendants in the motion to dismiss for lack of standing relate to matters currently before Magistrate McGiverin; for instance, calling attention to the \"number of scattershot suits\" filed by V\u00e9lez-Col\u00f3n. (Docket No. 16 at p. 19.) The Farmacia Medina defendants may move for summary dismissal as to the amended complaint in a separate filing. The Court notes that the Farmacia Medina defendants failed to attach a statement of uncontested material facts to the summary judgment motion. (Docket No. 20.) Subsequent motions for summary judgment shall comport with Local Rule 56, requiring that parties include \"a separate, short, and concise statement of material facts, set forth in numbered paragraphs, as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue of material fact to be tried.\" Loc.
