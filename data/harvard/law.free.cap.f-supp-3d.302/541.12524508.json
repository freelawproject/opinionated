The answer to both questions is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Our analysis proceeds as follows. We first set forth the background facts regarding Twitter as a platform, the @realDonaldTrump account that is the center of this dispute, the plaintiffs, and this case's procedural history. Because defendants object to our adjudication of this case based on plaintiffs' lack of standing, we then turn-as we must-to the consideration of those jurisdictional arguments. We conclude that the plaintiffs have established the prerequisites to our jurisdiction: they have experienced a legally cognizable injury, those injuries are traceable to the President and Daniel Scavino's conduct, and a favorable judicial decision on the merits is likely to redress those injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We then proceed to the substance of plaintiffs' First Amendment claims. We hold that portions of the @realDonaldTrump account-the \"interactive space\" where Twitter users may directly engage with the content of the President's tweets-are properly analyzed under the \"public forum\" doctrines set forth by the Supreme Court, that such space is a designated public forum, and that the blocking of the plaintiffs based on their political speech constitutes viewpoint discrimination that violates the First Amendment. In so holding, we reject the defendants' contentions that the First Amendment does not apply in this case and that the President's personal First Amendment interests supersede those of plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Finally, we consider what form of relief should be awarded, as plaintiffs seek both declaratory relief and injunctive relief. While we reject defendants' categorical assertion that injunctive relief cannot ever be awarded against the President, we nonetheless conclude that it is unnecessary to enter that legal thicket at this time. A declaratory judgment should be sufficient, as no government official-including the President-is above the law, and all government officials are presumed to follow the law as has been declared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The facts presented below are drawn almost entirely from the stipulation of facts between the parties,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Stipulation, Sept. 28, 2017, ECF No. 30-1, which \"applies\n   exclusively to this litigation and does not constitute an admission for purposes of any other proceeding,\" Stip. at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Twitter Platform\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Twitter is a social media platform with more than 300 million active users worldwide, including some 70 million in the United States.\" Stip. \u00b6 13. A \" 'user' is an individual who has created an account on the platform.\" Stip. \u00b6 14. \"A Twitter user must have an account name, which is an @ symbol followed by a unique identifier (e.g., @realDonaldTrump), and a descriptive name (e.g., Donald J. Trump). The account name is called the user's 'handle.' \" Stip. \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Twitter \"allows users to post short messages,\" Stip. \u00b6 13, which are called \"tweets,\" Stip. \u00b6 14. Tweets may be \"up to [280] characters in length,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   may \"include photographs, videos, and links,\" and are posted \"to a webpage on Twitter that is attached to the user's account.\" Stip. \u00b6 14. \"An individual 'tweet' comprises the tweeted content (i.e., the message, including any embedded photograph, video, or link), the user's account name (with a link to the user's Twitter webpage), the user's profile picture, the date and time the tweet was generated, and the number of times the tweet has been replied to ..., retweeted by ..., or liked by ... other users.\" Stip. \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Twitter webpage that displays the collection of a user's tweets is known as the user's \"timeline.\" Stip. \u00b6 15. \"When a user generates a tweet, the timeline updates immediately to include that tweet,\" and \"[a]nyone who can view a user's Twitter webpage can see the user's timeline.\" Stip. \u00b6 15. \"A user's Twitter webpage may also include a short biographical description; a profile picture, such as a headshot; a 'header' image, which appears as a banner at the top of the webpage; the user's location; a button labeled 'Message,' which allows two users to correspond privately; and a small sample of photographs and videos posted to the user's timeline, which link to a full gallery.\" Stip. \u00b6 16. \"By default, Twitter webpages and their associated timelines are visible to everyone with internet access, including those who are not Twitter users. However, although non-users can view users' Twitter webpages (if the accounts are public), they cannot interact with users on the Twitter platform.\" Stip. \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A defining feature of Twitter is a user's ability \"to repost or respond to others' messages, and to interact with other Twitter users in relation to those messages.\" Stip. \u00b6 13. \"Beyond posting tweets ..., Twitter users can engage with one another in a variety of ways.\" Stip. \u00b6 21. First, \"they can 'retweet'-i.e., repost-the tweets of other users, either by posting them directly to their own followers or by 'quoting' them in their own tweets. When a user retweets a tweet, it appears on the user's timeline in the same form as it did on the original user's timeline, but with a notation indicating that the post was retweeted.\" Stip. \u00b6 21. Second, \"[a] Twitter user can also reply to other users' tweets. Like any other tweet, a reply can be up to [280] characters in length and can include photographs, videos, and links.\" Stip. \u00b6 22. This reply may be viewed in two places:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   when a user sends a reply, \"the reply appears on the user's timeline under a tab labeled 'Tweets &amp; replies.' \" However, the reply may also be accessed from the feed of the user sending the tweet being replied to: \"by clicking on the tweet that prompted the reply[,] the reply will appear below the original tweet, along with other users' replies to the same tweet.\" Stip. \u00b6 22. Third, \"[a] Twitter user can also 'favorite' or 'like' another user's tweet by clicking on the heart icon that appears under the tweet. By 'liking' a tweet, a user may mean to convey approval or to acknowledge having seen the tweet.\" Stip. \u00b6 24. Fourth, \"[a] Twitter user can also 'mention' another user by including the other user's Twitter handle in a tweet. A Twitter user mentioned by another user will receive a 'notification' that he or she has been mentioned in another user's tweet.\" Stip. \u00b6 25. Finally, \"Twitter users can subscribe to other users' messages by 'following' those users' accounts. Users generally can see all tweets posted or retweeted by accounts they have followed.\" Stip. \u00b6 19. \"Tweets, retweets, replies, likes, and mentions are controlled by the user who generates them. No other Twitter user can alter the content of any retweet or reply, either before or after it is posted. Twitter users cannot prescreen tweets, replies, likes, or mentions that reference their tweets or accounts.\" Stip. \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Because a retweet or a reply to a tweet is itself a tweet, each retweet and reply, recursively, may be retweeted, replied to, or liked. \"A Twitter user can also reply to other replies. A user whose tweet generates replies will see the replies below his or her original tweet, with any replies-to-replies nested below the replies to which they respond. The collection of replies and replies-to-replies is sometimes referred to as a 'comment thread.' \" Stip. \u00b6 23. \"Twitter is called a 'social' media platform in large part because of comment threads, which reflect multiple overlapping 'conversations' among and across groups of users.\" Stip. \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition to these means of interaction, Twitter offers two means of limiting interaction with other users: blocking and muting. First, \"[a] user who wants to prevent another user from interacting with her account on the Twitter platform can do so by 'blocking' that user. (Twitter provides users with the capability to block other users, but it is the users themselves who decide whether to make use of this capability.) When a user is signed in to a Twitter account that has been blocked, the blocked user cannot see or reply to the blocking user's tweets, view the blocking user's list of followers or followed accounts, or use the Twitter platform to search for the blocking user's tweets. The blocking user will not be notified if the blocked user mentions her or posts a tweet; nor, when signed in to her account, will the blocking user see any tweets posted by the blocked user.\" Stip. \u00b6 28. \"If, while signed in to the blocked account, the blocked user attempts to follow the blocking user, or to access the Twitter webpage from which the user is blocked, the blocked user will see a message indicating that the other user has blocked him or her from following the account and viewing the tweets associated with the account.\" Stip. \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   While blocking precludes the blocked user from directly interacting with the blocking user's tweets-including from replying or retweeting those tweets, blocking does not eliminate all interaction between the blocked user and the blocking user. \"After a user has been blocked, the blocked user can still mention the blocking user. Tweets mentioning the blocking user will be visible to anyone who can view the blocked user's tweets and replies. A blocked user can also reply to users who have replied to the blocking user's tweets,\n   although the blocked user cannot see the tweet by the blocking user that prompted the original reply. These replies-to-replies will appear in the comment thread, beneath the reply to the blocking user's original tweet.\" Stip. \u00b6 30. Further, \"[i]f a blocked user is not signed in to Twitter, he or she can view all of the content on Twitter that is accessible to anyone without a Twitter account.\" Stip. \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As distinguished from blocking, \"[m]ut[ing] is a feature that allows [a user] to remove an account's Tweets from [his or her] timeline without unfollowing or blocking that account. Muted accounts will not know that [the muting user has] muted them and [the muting user] can unmute them at any time.\"\n   <em>\n    How to Mute Accounts on Twitter\n   </em>\n   , Twitter (last visited May 22, 2018), https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-mute [hereinafter\n   <em>\n    How to Mute\n   </em>\n   ].\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Muted accounts can follow [the muting user] and [the muting user] can follow muted accounts.

The @realDonaldTrump Account\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Donald Trump established @realDonaldTrump in March 2009. Before his inauguration, he used this account to tweet about a variety of topics, including popular culture and politics. Since his inauguration in January 2017, President Trump has used the @realDonaldTrump account as a channel for communicating and interacting with the public about his administration. He also has continued to use the account, on occasion, to communicate about other issues not directly related to official government business.\" Stip. \u00b6 32. \"The Twitter page associated with the account is registered to Donald J. Trump, '45th President of the United States of America, Washington, D.C.' \" Stip. \u00b6 35. \"The @realDonaldTrump account is generally accessible to the public at large without regard to political affiliation or any other limiting criteria.\" Stip. \u00b6 36. \"[A]ny member of the public can view his tweets without being signed in to Twitter, and anyone who wants to follow the account can do so. President Trump has not issued any rule or statement purporting to limit (by form or subject matter) the speech of those who reply to his tweets.\" Stip. \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Since the President's inauguration, the @realDonaldTrump account has been operated with the assistance of defendant Daniel Scavino, \"the White House Social Media Director and Assistant to the President [who] is sued in his official capacity only.\" Stip. \u00b6 12. \"With the assistance of Mr. Scavino in certain instances, President Trump uses @realDonaldTrump, often multiple times a day, to announce, describe, and defend his policies; to promote his Administration's legislative agenda; to announce official decisions; to engage with foreign political leaders; to publicize state visits; to challenge media organizations whose coverage of his Administration he believes to be unfair; and for other statements, including on occasion statements unrelated to official government business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   President Trump sometimes uses the account to announce matters related to official government business before those matters are announced to the public through other official channels.\" Stip. \u00b6 38. \"For example, the President used @realDonaldTrump to announce on June 7, 2017, for the first time, that he intended to nominate Christopher Wray for the position of FBI director.\" Stip. \u00b6 38. Since the parties' stipulation, the President has also used the @realDonaldTrump account in removing then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and then-Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, \"[t]he National Archives and Records Administration has advised the White House that the President's tweets from @realDonaldTrump ... are official records that must be preserved under the Presidential Records Act.\" Stip. \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Mr. Scavino in certain instances assists President Trump in operating the @realDonaldTrump account, including by drafting and posting tweets to the account. Other White House aides besides Mr. Scavino will, in certain instances, also suggest content for @realDonaldTrump tweets. President Trump also sometimes dictates tweets to Mr. Scavino, who then posts them on Twitter. President Trump and/or Mr. Scavino sometimes retweet the tweets of those who participate in comment threads associated with the @realDonaldTrump account.\" Stip. \u00b6 39. \"Mr. Scavino has access to the @realDonaldTrump account, including the access necessary to block and unblock individuals from the @realDonaldTrump account,\" Stip. \u00b6 12, and has explained that @realDonaldTrump is a channel \"through which 'President Donald J. Trump ... [c]ommunicat[es] directly with you, the American people!' \" Stip. \u00b6 37 (alterations and omissions in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Twitter users engage frequently with the President's tweets. \"Typically, tweets from @realDonaldTrump generate thousands of replies from members of the public, and some of those replies generate hundreds or thousands of replies in turn.\" Stip. \u00b6 41. \"For example, on July 26, 2017, President Trump issued a series of tweets ... announcing 'that the United States Government will not accept or allow ... Transgender individuals to serve' in the military, and after less than three hours, the three tweets, collectively, had been retweeted nearly 70,000 times, liked nearly 180,000 times, and replied to about 66,000 times.\" Stip. \u00b6 41 (second omission in original). \"This level of engagement is typical for President Trump's tweets,\" Stip. \u00b6 42, which \"frequently receive 15,000-20,000 retweets or more,\" Stip. \u00b6 42, and \"are each replied to tens of thousands of times,\" Stip. \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Individual Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Rebecca Buckwalter, Philip Cohen, Holly Figueroa, Eugene Gu, Brandon Neely, Joseph Papp, and Nicholas Pappas (collectively, the \"individual plaintiffs\"), are all Twitter users. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 2-8. They each tweeted a message critical of the President or his policies in reply to a tweet from the @realDonaldTrump account. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 46-52. Each individual plaintiff had his or her account blocked shortly thereafter, and each account remains blocked. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 46-52. Defendants do \"not contest Plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   allegation that the Individual Plaintiffs were blocked from the President's Twitter account because the Individual Plaintiffs posted tweets that criticized the President or his policies.\" Stip. at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"As a result of the President's blocking of the Individual Plaintiffs from @realDonaldTrump, the Individual Plaintiffs cannot view the President's tweets; directly reply to these tweets; or use the @realDonaldTrump webpage to view the comment threads associated with the President's tweets while they are logged in to their verified accounts.\" Stip. \u00b6 54. However, \"[t]he Individual Plaintiffs can view tweets from @realDonaldTrump when using an internet browser or other application that is not logged in to Twitter, or that is logged in to a Twitter account that is not blocked by @realDonaldTrump.\" Stip. \u00b6 55. Additionally, \"[s]ome of the Individual Plaintiffs have established second accounts so that they can view the President's tweets.\" Stip. \u00b6 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Blocking does not completely eliminate the individual plaintiffs' ability to interact with the President's tweets. \"The Individual Plaintiffs can view replies to @realDonaldTrump tweets, and can post replies to those replies, while logged in to the blocked accounts. Replies-to-replies appear in the comment threads that originate with @realDonaldTrump tweets and are visible to users who have not blocked (or been blocked by) the Individual Plaintiffs.\" Stip. \u00b6 57. \"Although the Individual Plaintiffs who have been blocked have the ability to view and reply to replies to @realDonaldTrump tweets, they cannot see the original @realDonaldTrump tweets themselves when signed in to their blocked accounts, and in many instances it is difficult to understand the reply tweets without the context of the original @realDonaldTrump tweets.\" Stip. \u00b6 58. While \"[i]n the past, Plaintiffs Holly Figueroa, Eugene Gu, and Brandon Neely used a third-party service called Favstar that could be used by blocked users to view and reply to a blocking account's tweets if the blocked user established a Favstar account and followed certain steps[,] [t]he parties' understanding is that it is no longer possible for blocked users to use the Favstar service to view and reply to a blocking account's tweets.\" Stip. \u00b6 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   These workarounds \"require [the individual plaintiffs] to take more steps than non-blocked, signed-in users to view the President's tweets.\" Stip. \u00b6 55. \"All of the Individual Plaintiffs have found these various 'workarounds' to be burdensome and to delay their ability to respond to @realDonaldTrump tweets. As a result, four of the Individual Plaintiffs do not use them and the others use them infrequently.\" Stip. \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

In contrast to the individual plaintiffs, \"[t]he Knight Institute has not been blocked from the @realDonaldTrump account.\" Stip. \u00b6 61. However, \"[t]he Knight Institute desires to read comments that otherwise would have been posted by the blocked Plaintiffs, and by other accounts blocked by @realDonaldTrump, in direct reply to @realDonaldTrump tweets,\" Stip. \u00b6 61, and \"[t]he @knightcolumbia account follows Professor Cohen's account, @familyunequal,\" Stip. \u00b6 62. \"As of August 22, 2017,\" however, \"the Knight Institute did\n   not follow the other six Individual Plaintiffs on Twitter.\" Stip. \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

The causation analysis as to the Knight Institute largely follows that applicable to the individual plaintiffs: the Knight Institute's injury-the inability to read the individual plaintiffs' direct replies to the President's tweets-is a direct consequence of the individual plaintiffs being unable to reply directly to the President's tweets, which is, in turn, a direct consequence of the individual plaintiffs having been blocked. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 28, 54, 59, 61. The Knight Institute's injuries are similarly redressable-if the individual plaintiffs were unblocked, they would be able to tweet direct replies to tweets sent by @realDonaldTrump and the Knight Institute would again be able to fulfill its desire to read those direct replies. While the individual plaintiffs would need to choose to reply in order for the Knight Institute to read a reply, certain individual plaintiffs' attempts to circumvent blocking's limitation on direct replies, Stip. \u00b6 59, and the individual plaintiffs' identification of the burdens posed by blocking as prompting their reduced engagement, Stip. \u00b6 60, strongly suggests that at least some of the individual plaintiffs are likely to reply if they were to have the capacity to do so.

Though Twitter is a private (though publicly traded) company that is not government-owned, the President and Scavino nonetheless exercise control over various aspects of the @realDonaldTrump account: they control the content of the tweets that are sent from the account and they hold the ability to prevent, through blocking, other Twitter users, including the individual plaintiffs here, from accessing the @realDonaldTrump timeline (while logged into the blocked account) and from participating in the interactive space associated with the\n   tweets sent by the @realDonaldTrump account, Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 28-32, 39, 54. Though Twitter also maintains control over the @realDonaldTrump account (and all other Twitter accounts), we nonetheless conclude that the extent to which the President and Scavino can, and do, exercise control over aspects of the @realDonaldTrump account are sufficient to establish the government-control element as to the content of the tweets sent by the @realDonaldTrump account, the timeline compiling those tweets, and the interactive space associated with each of those tweets.

Taken together, these factors support the conclusion that replies to the President's tweets remain the private speech of the replying user.

As Twitter explains, \"[m]ut[ing] is a feature that allows [a user] to remove an account's Tweets from [the user's] timeline without unfollowing or blocking that account.\"\n   <em>\n    How to Mute\n   </em>\n   . For muted accounts that the muting account does not follow on Twitter, \"[r]eplies and mentions will not appear\" in the muting account's notifications, nor will mentions by the muted account.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780225\" index=\"408\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/463/#p466\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is, muting allows a user to ignore an account with which the user does not wish to engage. The muted account may still attempt to engage with the muting account-it may still reply to tweets sent by the muting account, among other capabilities-but the muting account generally will not see these replies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Critically, however, the muted account may still reply directly to the muting account, even if that reply is ultimately ignored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Blocking, by contrast, goes further. The blocking user \"will not see any tweets posted by the blocked user\" just as a muting user would not see tweets posted by a muted user, but whereas muting preserves the muted account's ability to reply to a tweet sent by the muting account, blocking precludes the blocked user from \"see[ing] or reply[ing] to the blocking user's tweets\" entirely. Stip. \u00b6 28. The elimination of the blocked user's ability to reply directly is more than the blocking user merely ignoring the blocked user; it is\n   the blocking user limiting the blocked user's right to speak in a discrete, measurable way. Muting equally vindicates the President's right to ignore certain speakers and to selectively amplify the voices of certain others but-unlike blocking-does so without restricting the right of the ignored to speak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Given these differing consequences of muting and blocking, we find unpersuasive defendants' contention that a public official's muting and blocking are equivalent, and equally constitutional, means of choosing not to engage with his constituents. Implicit in this argument is the assumption that a reply to a tweet is directed only at the user who sent the tweet being replied to. Were that so, defendants would be correct in that there is no difference between the inability to send a direct reply (as with blocking) and the inability to have that direct reply heard by the sender of the initial tweet being responded to (as with muting). But this assumption is not supported in the record: a reply is visible to others, Stip. \u00b6 22, and may itself be replied to by other users, Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 57-58. The audience for a reply extends more broadly than the sender of the tweet being replied to, and blocking restricts the ability of a blocked user to speak to that audience. While the right to speak and the right to be heard may be functionally identical if the speech is directed at only one listener, they are not when there is more than one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In sum, we conclude that the blocking of the individual plaintiffs as a result of the political views they have expressed is impermissible under the First Amendment. While we must recognize, and are sensitive to, the President's personal First Amendment rights, he cannot exercise those rights in a way that infringes the corresponding First Amendment rights of those who have criticized him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   To be sure, we do not suggest that the impact on the individual plaintiffs (and, by extension, on the Knight Institute) is of the highest magnitude.

Plaintiffs lack standing, however, to sue Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who is dismissed as a defendant. Hope Hicks is also dismissed as a defendant, in light of her resignation as White House Communications Director.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Turning to the merits of plaintiffs' First Amendment claim, we hold that the speech in which they seek to engage is protected by the First Amendment and that the President and Scavino exert governmental control over certain aspects of the @realDonaldTrump account, including the interactive space of the tweets sent from the account. That interactive space is susceptible to analysis under the Supreme Court's forum doctrines, and is properly characterized as a designated public forum. The viewpoint-based exclusion of the individual plaintiffs from that designated public forum is proscribed by the First Amendment and cannot be justified by the President's personal First Amendment interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In sum, defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted in part and denied in part, and plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment is granted in part and denied in part.
