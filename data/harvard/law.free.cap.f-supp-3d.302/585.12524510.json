FORREST, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   When the Copyright Act was amended in 1976, the words \"tweet,\" \"viral,\" and\n   \"embed\" invoked thoughts of a bird, a disease, and a reporter. Decades later, these same terms have taken on new meanings as the centerpieces of an interconnected world wide web in which images are shared with dizzying speed over the course of any given news day. That technology and terminology change means that, from time to time, questions of copyright law will not be altogether clear. In answering questions with previously uncontemplated technologies, however, the Court must not be distracted by new terms or new forms of content, but turn instead to familiar guiding principles of copyright. In this copyright infringement case, concerning a candid photograph of a famous sports figure, the Court must construe how images shown on one website but stored on another website's server implicate an owner's exclusive display right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Today, many websites embed Twitter posts into their own content; for those familiar with digital news or other content, this is common knowledge. Here, plaintiff Justin Goldman's copyrighted photo of Tom Brady went \"viral\"-rapidly moving from Snapchat to Reddit to Twitter-and finally, made its way onto the websites of the defendants, who embedded the Tweet alongside articles they wrote about Tom Brady actively helping the Boston Celtics recruit basketball player Kevin Durant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, claiming he never publicly released or licensed his photograph, filed suit against the defendant websites, claiming a violation of his exclusive right to display his photo, under \u00a7 106(5) of the Copyright Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   With the consent of the parties, this Court divided the litigation into two phases-the first to determine whether defendants' actions violate the exclusive right to display a work (here an embedded Tweet), and the second to deal with all remaining issues, such as the liability (or non-liability) for other defendants and any defenses that have been raised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants filed a motion for partial Summary Judgment on October 5, 2017. (ECF No. 119.) The Court heard oral argument on January 16, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Having carefully considered the embedding issue, this Court concludes, for the reasons discussed below, that when defendants caused the embedded Tweets to appear on their websites, their actions violated plaintiff's exclusive display right; the fact that the image was hosted on a server owned and operated by an unrelated third party (Twitter) does not shield them from this result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Accordingly, defendants' motion for partial Summary Judgment is DENIED. Partial Summary Judgment is GRANTED to the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties agree that the principle issue briefed on this motion is a legal one and amenable to summary judgment. The following facts are materially undisputed and all inferences are drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p255\">\n    477 U.S. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 255,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p255\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p255\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Tom Brady Photo\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 2, 2016, plaintiff Justin Goldman snapped a photograph of Tom Brady (the \"Photo\"), Danny Ainge, and others on the street in East Hampton. (ECF No. 149, Goldman Declaration (\"Goldman Decl.\") \u00b6 2.) Shortly thereafter, he uploaded the photograph to his Snapchat Story.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) The Photo then went \"viral,\" traveling through several levels of social media platforms-and finally onto Twitter, where it was uploaded by several users, including Cassidy Hubbarth (@cassidyhubbarth), Bobby Manning (@RealBobManning), Rob H (@rch111), and Travis Singleton (@SneakerReporter). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6-10; ECF No. 120, Defendants' Statement of Undisputed Facts Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1 (\"Defs.' 56.1 Statement\") \u00b6 28.) These uploads onto Twitter are referred to as \"Tweets.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants in this case are online news outlets and blogs who published articles featuring the Photo. Each of defendants' websites prominently featured the Photo by \"embedding\" the Tweet into articles they wrote over the course of the next forty-eight hours; the articles were all focused on the issue of whether the Boston Celtics would successfully recruit basketball player Kevin Durant, and if Tom Brady would help to seal the deal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   It is undisputed that plaintiff holds the copyright to the Photo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Embedding\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   None of the defendant websites copied and saved the Photo onto their own servers. Rather, they made the Photo visible in their articles through a technical process known as \"embedding.\" Some background is helpful to an understanding of the embedding process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A webpage is made up of a series of instructions usually written by coders in Hypertext Markup Language (\"HTML\"). These instructions are saved to a server (a computer connected to the internet), and when a user wishes to view a webpage, his or her computer's browser connects with the server, at which point the HTML code previously written by the coder instructs the browser on how to arrange the webpage on the user's computer. The HTML code can allow for the arrangement of text and/or images on a page and can also include photographs. When including a photograph on a web page, the HTML code instructs the browser how and where to place the photograph. Importantly for this case, the HTML code could instruct the browser either to retrieve the photograph from the webpage's own server or to retrieve it from a third-party server.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Embedding\" an image on a webpage is the act of a coder intentionally adding a specific \"embed\" code to the HTML instructions that incorporates an image, hosted on a third-party server, onto a webpage. To embed an image, the coder or web designer would add an \"embed code\" to the HTML instructions; this code directs the browser to the third-party server to retrieve the image. An embedded image will then hyperlink (that is, create a link from one place in a hypertext document to another in a different document) to the third-party website. The result: a seamlessly integrated webpage, a mix of text and images, although the underlying images may be hosted in varying locations. Most social media sites-Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, for example-provide code that coders and web designers can easily copy in order to enable embedding on their own webpages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, it is undisputed that none of the defendant websites actually downloaded the Photo from Twitter, copied it, and stored it on their own servers. Rather, each defendant website merely embedded the Photo, by including the necessary embed code in their HTML instructions. As a result, all of defendants' websites included articles about the meeting between Tom Brady and the Celtics, with the full-size Photo visible without the user having to click on a hyperlink, or a thumbnail, in order to view the Photo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II. LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Summary Judgment Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This Court applies the well-known summary judgment standard set forth in Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Summary Judgment may not be granted unless a movant shows, based on admissible evidence in the record, \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating \"the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

The district court addressed two different questions: 1) did the thumbnail images that automatically pop up when a user types in a search term constitute direct infringements of the display right; and 2) did the full size images that appeared on the screen after a user clicked on a thumbnail constitute direct infringements of the same display right. In answer, the court made a sharp distinction between the two based upon where the images were hosted.\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10 v.

Outside of the Ninth Circuit, however, the Server Test has not been widely adopted. Even a quick survey reveals that the case law in this area is somewhat scattered. Of the other Circuits, only the Seventh Circuit has weighed in thus far-in\n   <em>\n    Flava Works, Inc. v. Gunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3501022\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/689/754/\">\n    689 F.3d 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2012), the question before the court was whether the defendant was a\n   <em>\n    contributory\n   </em>\n   infringer. Defendant in that case, a \"social bookmarker,\" whose service involved enabling individuals who share interests to point each other towards online materials (in this case, videos) that cater towards that taste, through embedding the code for the video onto its website. The videos remained hosted on the original servers. As with\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10\n   </em>\n   , upon arriving on defendant's website, thumbnails would appear; after clicking on one, the user would retrieve content from plaintiff's website.

Sept. 12, 2016), the issue before the court was the distribution right, not the display right. Defendant argued that a distribution had not occurred, since the alleged infringing content was hosted on a third-party server, and not its own. The court noted that defendant cited no legal authority for this proposition, but stated that \"such authority\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   exist,\" citing\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.

The court cited\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10\n   </em>\n   and then found that, due to the fact that\n   <em>\n    plaintiff's\n   </em>\n   servers \" 'actually disseminated' the copies of [plaintiff's] copyrighted games, [defendant] cannot be held liable for infringing on [plaintiff's] distribution rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *14.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendants' argument is simple-they have framed the issue as one in which the\n   physical location and/or possession of an allegedly infringing image determines liability under the \u00a7 106(5) exclusive display right. Defendants argue that-despite the seamless presentation of the Brady Photo on their webpages-they simply provided \"instructions\" for the user to navigate to a third-party server on which the photo resided. According to defendants, merely providing instructions does not constitute a \"display\" by the defendants as a matter of law. They maintain that\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10's\n   </em>\n   Server Test is settled law that should determine the outcome of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff maintains both 1) that to apply the Server Test leads to results incongruous with the purposes and text of the Copyright Act; and 2) even if the Server Test is rightfully applied in a case such as\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10\n   </em>\n   , or another case in which the user takes a volitional action of his own to display an image, it is inappropriate in cases such as those here, where the user takes no action to \"display\" the image. He and his amici\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   caution that to adopt the Server Test broadly would have a \"devastating\" economic impact on photography and visual artwork licensing industries, noting that it would \"eliminate\" the incentives for websites to pay licensing fees, and thus \"deprive content creators of the resources necessary to invest in further creation.\" (ECF No. 145-1 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court agrees with plaintiff. The plain language of the Copyright Act, the legislative history undergirding its enactment, and subsequent Supreme Court jurisprudence provide no basis for a rule that allows the physical location or possession of an image to determine who may or may not have \"displayed\" a work within the meaning of the Copyright Act. Moreover, the Court agrees that there are critical factual distinctions between\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10\n   </em>\n   and this case such that, even if the Second Circuit were to find the Server Test consistent with the Copyright Act, it would be inapplicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Copyright Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Nowhere does the Copyright Act suggest that possession of an image is necessary in order to display it. Indeed, the purpose and language of the Act support the opposite view. The definitions in \u00a7 101 are illuminating. First, to display a work publicly means to \"to transmit ... a ... display of the work ... by means of\n   <em>\n    any device or process\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 USC \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To transmit a display is to \"communicate it by\n   <em>\n    any device or process\n   </em>\n   whereby images or sounds are received beyond the place from which they are sent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Devices and processes are further defined to mean ones \"now known or later developed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is plainly drafted with the intent to sweep broadly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Here, defendants' websites actively took steps to \"display\" the image. A review of just a few of the declarations proffered by defendants illustrates the point. For defendant Heavy.com:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [I]n order to embed the SneakerReporter Tweet, Heavy.com navigated to Twitter and copied the SneakerReporter Tweet's URL. Heavy.com then used out of the box content management functionality provided by WordPress to embed the SneakerReporter Tweet within the Heavy.com Article.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   (ECF No. 130, Nobel Decl. \u00b6 5.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendant Boston Herald \"pasted a code line into its blog/article that contains Twitter HTML instructions.\" (ECF No. 137, Emond Decl. \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant The Big Lead submitted a declaration in which the managing editor\n   stated, \"My entering the URL for the RealBobManningTweet into the field for embedded content in the CMS [content management system] caused this URL to be inserted into embedding code that became part of the HTML code for the Big Lead Article.\" (ECF No. 127, Lisk Decl. \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendant Gannett submitted a declaration in which the Vice President stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [I]f I wanted that web page to\n   <em>\n    display\n   </em>\n   a photo that a third party user had posted to a site like Twitter, I could do so without me ever having to make a copy of the photo. I would simply include in my HTML code some additional coding containing a link to the URL of the Twitter page where the photo appeared.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (ECF No. 126, Hiland Decl. \u00b6 6) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   It is clear, therefore, that each and every defendant itself took active steps to put a process in place that resulted in a transmission of the photos so that they could be visibly shown. Most directly this was accomplished by the act of including the code in the overall design of their webpage; that is, embedding. Properly understood, the steps necessary to embed a Tweet are accomplished by the defendant website; these steps constitute a process. The plain language of the Copyright Act calls for no more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Indeed, and as discussed above, the Copyright Act's authors intended to include \"each and every method by which images ... comprising a ... display are picked up and conveyed;\" moreover they went as far as to note that an infringement of the display right could occur \"if the image were transmitted by\n   <em>\n    any method\n   </em>\n   (... for example, by a computer system) from one place to members of the public elsewhere.\" H.R. Rep. 94-1476, 64, 70 (1976). Persuasive as well is the warning of the Register of Copyrights that a \"basic right of public exhibition\" was necessary to the 1976 Amendments precisely because \"information storage and retrieval devices ... when linked together by communication satellites or other means ... could eventually provide libraries and individuals throughout the world with access to a single copy or a work by transmission of electronic images.\"\n   <em>\n    H. Comm. On the Judiciary\n   </em>\n   , 89th Cong.,\n   <em>\n    Copyright Law Revision Part 6: Supplementary Report of the Register of Copyrights on the General Revision of the U.S. Copyright Law: 1965 Revision Bill\n   </em>\n   , at 25 (Comm. Print. 1965).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In sum, this Court sees nothing in either the text or purpose of the Copyright Act suggesting that physical possession of an image is a necessary element to its display for purposes of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Aereo's Impact\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Moreover, though the Supreme Court has only weighed in obliquely on the issue, its language in\n   <em>\n    Aereo\n   </em>\n   is instructive. At heart, the Court's holding eschewed the notion that Aereo should be absolved of liability based upon purely technical distinctions-in the end, Aereo was held to have transmitted the performances, despite its argument that it was the user clicking a button, and not any volitional act of Aereo itself, that did the performing. The language the Court used there to describe invisible technological details applies equally well here: \"This difference means nothing to the subscriber. It means nothing to the broadcaster. We do not see how this single difference,\n   <em>\n    invisible to subscriber and broadcaster alike\n   </em>\n   , could transform a system that is for all practical purposes a traditional cable system into a 'copy shop that provides patrons with a library card.' \"\n   <em>\n    Aereo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581690\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2498/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Of course, in\n   <em>\n    Aereo\n   </em>\n   there was no argument about the physical location of the antennae, which were without dispute located in Aereo's warehouses; similarly\n   there was no dispute that Aereo's servers saved data from the on-air broadcasts onto its own hard drives. On the other hand, Aereo was arguably a more passive participant in transmitting the performance right than is a user in the case here-who has no choice in what is displayed to him when he navigates to one of defendant's webpages. Furthermore, the principles that undergird the\n   <em>\n    Aereo\n   </em>\n   decision-chief among them that mere technical distinctions invisible to the user should not be the lynchpin on which copyright liability lies-apply with equal vigor here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As noted above, even the dissent implies that\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   Aereo to engage in any sort of curatorial process as to content, that liability might lie: \"In sum, Aereo does not perform for the\n   <em>\n    sole and simple reason\n   </em>\n   that it does not make the choice of content.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581690\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2498/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581690\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2498/\">\n    at 2514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Scalia, J., dissenting). This adds credence to the notion that where, as here, defendants are choosing the content which will be displayed, that they would indeed be displaying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In sum, this Court reads\n   <em>\n    Aereo\n   </em>\n   , while not directly on point, as strongly supporting plaintiff's argument that liability should not hinge on invisible, technical processes imperceptible to the viewer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court declines defendants' invitation to apply\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    's\n   </em>\n   Server Test for two reasons. First, this Court is skeptical that\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10\n   </em>\n   correctly interprets the display right of the Copyright Act. As stated above, this Court finds no indication in the text or legislative history of the Act that possessing a copy of an infringing image is a prerequisite to displaying it. The Ninth Circuit's analysis hinged, however, on making a \"copy\" of the image to be displayed-which copy would be stored on the server. It stated that its holding did not \"erroneously collapse the display right in section 106(5) into the reproduction right in 106(1).\"\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10 II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046751\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1146/\">\n    508 F.3d at 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But indeed, that appears to be exactly what was done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Copyright Act, however, provides several clues that this is not what was intended. In several distinct parts of the Act, it contemplates infringers who would not be in possession of copies-for example in Section 110(5)(A) which exempts \"small commercial establishments whose proprietors merely bring onto their premises standard radio or television equipment and turn it on for their customer's enjoyment\" from liability. H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476 at 87 (1976). That these establishments require an exemption, despite the fact that to turn on the radio or television is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to make or store a copy, is strong evidence that a copy need not be made in order to display an image.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Second, even if it correctly interprets the Act, to the degree that defendants interpret\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10\n   </em>\n   as standing for a\n   <em>\n    broadly-construed\n   </em>\n   Server Test, focusing on the physical location of allegedly infringing images, this Court disagrees. Rather,\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10\n   </em>\n   was heavily informed by two factors-the fact that the defendant operated a search engine, and the fact that the user made an active choice to click on an image before it was displayed-that suggest that such a broad reading is neither appropriate nor desirable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10\n   </em>\n   , the district court's Opinion, while not strictly cabining its adoption of the Server Test to a search engine like Google, nevertheless relied heavily on that fact in its analysis. It stated, for example, that adopting the Server Test \"will merely preclude\n   <em>\n    search engines\n   </em>\n   from being held directly liable for in-line linking and or framing infringing contents stored on third-party websites.\"\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10 I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1010332\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/416/828/#p839\">\n    416 F.Supp.2d at 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). It went on: \"\n   <em>\n    Merely to index the web so that users can more readily find the information they seek\n   </em>\n   should not constitute direct\n   infringement....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1010332\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/416/828/#p839\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). On appeal, the Ninth Circuit began its statement of the case by saying, \"we consider a copyright owner's efforts to stop an\n   <em>\n    Internet search engine\n   </em>\n   from facilitating access to infringing images.\"\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10 II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046751\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1146/\">\n    508 F.3d at 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In addition, the role of the user was paramount in the\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10\n   </em>\n   case-the district court found that users who view the full-size images \"\n   <em>\n    after clicking\n   </em>\n   on one of the thumbnails\" are \"engaged in a\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   connection with third-party websites, which are themselves responsible for transferring content.\"\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10 I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1010332\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/416/828/#p839\">\n    416 F.Supp.2d at 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In this Court's view, these distinctions are critical. In\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10\n   </em>\n   , Google's search engine provided a service whereby the user navigated from webpage to webpage, with Google's assistance. This is manifestly not the same as opening up a favorite blog or website to find a full color image awaiting the user, whether he or she asked for it, looked for it, clicked on it, or not. Both the nature of Google Search Engine, as compared to the defendant websites, and the volitional act taken by users of the services, provide a sharp contrast to the facts at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In sum, the Court here does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   apply the Server Test. It is neither appropriate to the specific facts of this case, nor, this Court believes, adequately grounded in the text of the Copyright Act. It therefore does not and should not control the outcome here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Defenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Defendants warn that to find for plaintiff here would \"cause a tremendous chilling effect on the core functionality of the web.\" (ECF No. 121, Defs.' Mem. of Law in Supp. at 35) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Perfect 10 I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1010332\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/416/828/#p839\">\n    416 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   840 ). Their amici\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   warn that not adopting the Server Test here would \"radically change linking practices, and thereby transform the Internet as we know it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court does not view the results of its decision as having such dire consequences. Certainly, given a number as of yet unresolved strong defenses to liability separate from this issue, numerous viable claims should not follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In this case, there are genuine questions about whether plaintiff effectively released his image into the public domain when he posted it to his Snapchat account. Indeed, in many cases there are likely to be factual questions as to licensing and authorization. There is also a very serious and strong fair use defense, a defense under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and limitations on damages from innocent infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In sum, for all the reasons discussed above, the Court DENIES defendants' motion for partial summary judgment and GRANTS partial summary judgment to the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For the reasons stated above, defendants' motion for partial Summary Judgment is DENIED. The Court GRANTS partial Summary Judgment to the plaintiff.
