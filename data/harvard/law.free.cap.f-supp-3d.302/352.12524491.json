This case deals with decisions by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (\"BIA\") and the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior (\"DOI\") that recognized one faction within the Cayuga Nation-now referring to itself as the \"Cayuga Nation Council,\" though alternatively referred to in the administrative record as the \"Halftown Group\"-as the governing body of the Cayuga Nation for the purposes of certain contractual relationships between that Nation and the United States federal government. These decisions were the product of an adversarial process between the Cayuga Nation Council and Plaintiffs, a rival faction within the Cayuga Nation who assert that they represent the Nation's rightful government. Plaintiffs have filed this lawsuit seeking to overturn the BIA and DOI decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court shall address two pending motions in this Memorandum Opinion: Federal Defendants' [16] Partial Motion to Dismiss, and Plaintiffs' [23] Motion to Supplement the Administrative Record. Upon consideration of the pleadings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the relevant legal authorities, and the record as a whole, the Court GRANTS Federal Defendants' Partial Motion to Dismiss and DENIES Plaintiffs' Motion to Supplement the Administrative Record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case arises from a long-standing dispute between rival factions within the Cayuga Nation. Plaintiffs allege that the Cayuga Nation has long been governed by a Council of Chiefs selected and overseen by \"Clan Mothers,\" whom Plaintiffs purport to represent in this litigation. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. Plaintiffs assert that \"Cayuga Nation leaders are selected pursuant to the Great Law of Peace, which gives that responsibility of nomination and removal to the women who serve as Clan Mothers, based on input from the members of their clans.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. According to Plaintiffs, this is a \"deliberative and consensus-based\" process for selecting leaders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Plaintiffs allege that the United States federal government had previously recognized this form of governance for the Cayuga Nation, and rejected efforts over the years by a faction known as the \"Halftown Group\" to secure support for the use of a mail-in survey to reconfigure the Cayuga Nation's government.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   However, in June 2016, Defendant Bruce W. Maytubby, the Eastern Regional Director of the BIA, revealed to Plaintiffs that the Halftown Group intended to conduct a mail-in survey in order to create a new government for the Cayuga Nation,\n   and that it was Mr. Maytubby's view that the proposed survey \"would be a viable way of involving the Cayuga people in a determination of the form and membership of their government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 40. Plaintiffs contend that this determination was the result of secret meetings between the BIA and the Halftown Group, from which Plaintiffs were excluded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. Plaintiffs objected to the proposed survey, arguing that, among other things, it violated Cayuga law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 15, 2016, Defendant Maytubby issued a decision \"(1) recognizing the Halftown Group as the government of the Cayuga Nation for purposes of entering into a contract under the ISDEAA [Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act] and declining to recognize Plaintiffs for such purposes; (2) awarding an ISDEAA contract grant to the Halftown Group, on behalf of the Cayuga Nation; and (3) declining to award an ISDEAA contract to [Plaintiffs] on behalf of the Cayuga Nation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. Plaintiffs characterize this decision as a reversal of \"longstanding federal policy,\" and challenge it on a number of substantive and procedural grounds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant Maytubby's December 15, 2016 decision indicated that it constituted final agency action,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A at 15, and was accompanied by a delegation of authority to Mr. Maytubby to take such action,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. Nonetheless, Plaintiffs did not file a lawsuit challenging this decision when it was issued. Instead, Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Interior Board of Indian Appeals (\"IBIA\") arguing that additional administrative review was appropriate because the delegation of authority to Defendant Maytubby to take final agency action was ineffective.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-83. The IBIA docketed the appeal and requested briefing on the delegation issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84-85. Shortly thereafter, Defendant Michael Black, the then-Acting Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs, withdrew the contested delegation to Mr. Maytubby, and himself assumed jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' administrative appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86-87. The parties submitted briefs on the merits of the dispute to Defendant Black, who ultimately issued a decision on July 13, 2017, denying Plaintiffs' appeal of Defendant Maytubby's decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 93-95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 20, 2017, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit, claiming that Defendants had violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and Plaintiffs' constitutional right to due process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 100-65. As relief, Plaintiffs ask that both Mr. Maytubby's decision and Mr. Black's decision be declared unlawful and vacated, that the Court enjoin Defendants from relying on the vacated decisions for any action by the DOI, that the individuals involved in rendering these decisions be enjoined from further adjudicating the questions in this case, that this matter be remanded to the BIA \"for government to government consultation and, as appropriate, decision by a neutral decision-maker on recognition and the Plaintiffs' ISDEAA application,\" and that they be granted costs and attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Opp'n at 3-4 (arguing that the individual capacity claim is based on,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Defendant's participation in BIA proceedings and hearing an appeal as the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs for the DOI). In their Opposition, Plaintiffs make conclusory references to \"ultra vires\" conduct, and speculate that it is \"not clear\" whether Defendant Black was acting in his official capacity, Pls.' Opp'n at 4, but the Court is not persuaded. There is simply no plausible allegation that Mr. Black's involvement in the administrative proceedings below was undertaken in an individual capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Moreover, the relief Plaintiffs seek cannot be obtained from Defendant Black in his individual capacity. It can only be obtained from the Defendants in their official capacities. Plaintiffs ask that the Defendants not rely on the challenged decisions for any DOI actions going forward, such as awarding or disbursing federal funds. Those are actions that only the official Defendants in their official capacities can take or refrain from taking. The official-capacity Defendants are also the parties who would decide what officials are involved in the further adjudication of the federal government's recognition of the governance of the Cayuga Nation, and who would conduct \"government to government consultation and, as appropriate, decision by a neutral decision-maker on recognition and the Plaintiffs' ISDEAA application.\" Compl. at 27. Finally, the decisions Plaintiffs ask the Court to vacate and declare unlawful are official decisions from government agencies, not of Defendant Black personally. In short, Plaintiffs are asking this Court to declare unlawful and restrain official government actions, not actions of Defendant Black in his personal capacity. The case is thus one against the government, not Mr. Black as an individual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dugan v.

Their motion is primarily based on the argument that Defendant\n   <em>\n    Maytubby\n   </em>\n   considered the documents at issue when making his December 15, 2016 decision. But Plaintiffs' focus on this preliminary decision is misplaced, because it is not the final agency action subject to judicial review by this Court. As described above, although Defendant Maytubby's December 15, 2016 decision purported to be a final agency action, Plaintiffs did not file a lawsuit challenging the decision when it was issued. Instead-perhaps for strategic reasons-they appealed that decision administratively. And, despite the purported finality of Defendant Maytubby's decision, Plaintiffs were successful in obtaining additional administrative review. The delegation of authority that had been issued to Mr. Maytubby to take final agency action was withdrawn. Plaintiffs were given an additional opportunity to argue the merits of their case. Their appeal was considered, and eventually a new decision on the merits of this dispute was issued by Defendant Black.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because Plaintiffs were able to, and did, appeal Defendant Maytubby's decision and receive additional administrative process, that decision was not \"final\" for the purposes of APA review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jicarilla Apache Nation v.

Accordingly, the Court must ensure that the administrative record in this case includes those materials-and only those materials-that were considered when\n   <em>\n    that decision\n   </em>\n   was rendered. Federal Defendants represent that the administrative record as certified \"represent[s] the universe of documents considered by [Defendant Black] in rendering his final decision.\" Fed. Defs.'

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In sum, the Court GRANTS Federal Defendants' Partial Motion to Dismiss and dismisses Plaintiffs' claims against Defendant Black in his individual capacity. Those claims are improper because this case challenges official government actions, and the relief sought can only be obtained by Defendants in their official capacities. In addition, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs' Motion to Supplement the Administrative Record. Plaintiffs have not satisfied their burden of demonstrating that the documents they seek to add to the administrative record were considered when the final agency action under review was taken.
