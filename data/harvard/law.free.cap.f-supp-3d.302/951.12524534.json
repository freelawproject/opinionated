Plaintiff opposed Defendant's Motion (Doc. 22) and Defendants replied in support (Doc. 23). This matter is now ripe for review. For the following reasons, Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case stems from alleged medical malpractice against the United States, filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 2671 - 2680. Plaintiff claims that Dr. Cynthia Gray performed an unnecessary exploratory procedure that directly caused the miscarriage, or spontaneous abortion, of her pregnancy. Dr. Gray is employed by Change, Inc., a federally funded community health center under the Federally Supported Health Centers Assistance Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20233\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) - (n).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 2, 2013, Davis visited Change, Inc.'s clinic in Wintersville, Ohio for an ultrasound. (Doc. 21-1, Stefanski Dep. at 32-33; Doc. 21-2, Russell Decl. at \u00b6 4). Davis was approximately four weeks pregnant at this time, but Davis mistakenly believed she was approximately eight weeks pregnant and relayed this information to the ultrasound technician. (Doc. 21-1, Stefanski Dep. at 37, 39-40, 80-81). The ultrasound revealed no signs of an intrauterine pregnancy, which was alarming to the technician administering the ultrasound. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-38). Davis further reported either having pain in her left side or cramping similar to menstrual cramping. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33; Doc. 21-3, Davis Dep. at 47-48). The ultrasound findings were reported to Dr. Kara O'Karma, who was the attending doctor in the clinic. (Doc. 21-1, Stefanski Dep. at 87-88). Dr. O'Karma reviewed the ultrasounds and sent Davis to Trinity Hospital in Steubenville, Ohio, for a possible ectopic pregnancy on the left side. (Doc. 21-4, Snodgrass Dep. at 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Dr. Gray performed a mini-laparotomy on Davis but found no evidence of an ectopic pregnancy. (Doc. 21-7, Gray Decl. at \u00b6 2). This procedure requires a three to four centimeter incision through the abdominal wall and peritoneum to gain access to the pelvic cavity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After the 20-minute procedure, Davis was doing well and was released to go home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4). Davis had to make a return trip to the hospital to address some urinary retention issues, which were resolved without any complications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After experiencing some mild persisting pain, Davis returned to work approximately a week and a half after the procedure. (Doc. 21-3, Davis Dep. at 64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the weeks following Davis' procedure, embryonic development was monitored\n   and found to be appropriate. Davis' hCG levels rose appropriately and a December 5 ultrasound (three days after the procedure) revealed that a gestational sac had developed in the uterus. (Doc. 21-6, Gray Dep. at 77, 90, 97). Another ultrasound was conducted on December 20 and, again, normal embryonic development was observed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99). The embryo had a normal heartbeat and measured at a gestational age of seven weeks and one day. (Doc. 21-2, Russell Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6, 7). Another ultrasound was conducted approximately five weeks after the procedure, on January 6. Unfortunately, no heartbeat was detected and measurements reflected that the fetus stopped growing during the eighth week of Davis' pregnancy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). A follow-up ultrasound on January 8 confirmed these findings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11). This was Davis' third and final pregnancy. She had a child in 2004 and had a miscarriage a few years before the miscarriage at issue here. (Doc. 21-9, Pl.'s Resp. to Def's. First Interrogs. at Resp. No. 1). Davis experienced a history of infertility problems and underwent unsuccessful fertility treatment after her first miscarriage. (Doc. 21-3, Davis Dep. at 73). Davis' final potentially relevant health factor is that she had a thyroid abnormality during the pregnancy at issue. (Doc. 21-9, Pl.'s Resp. to Def's. First Interrogs. at Resp. No. 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff brought suit in this case under the FTCA, alleging that Dr. Gray's December 2, 2013 procedure constituted negligent medical malpractice that resulted in a miscarriage and injuries to Plaintiff. Defendant now seeks summary judgment as to whether Dr. Gray's actions were the proximate cause of Plaintiff's miscarriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The Court's purpose in considering a summary judgment motion is not \"to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter\" but to \"determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

A genuine issue for trial exists if the Court finds a jury could return a verdict, based on \"sufficient evidence,\" in favor of the nonmoving party; evidence that is \"merely colorable\" or \"not significantly probative,\" however, is not enough to defeat summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p249\">\n    at 249-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p249\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The party seeking summary judgment shoulders the initial burden of presenting the court with law and argument in support of its motion as well as identifying the relevant portions of \" 'the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,' which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

In considering the factual allegations and evidence presented in a motion for summary judgment, the Court must \"afford all reasonable inferences, and construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"573108\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/53/146/#p150\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether the December\n   2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   procedure was the direct and proximate cause of Davis' miscarriage. Defendant's primary argument in support of granting partial summary judgment is that Plaintiff has not produced, nor can she produce, evidence \"showing that it is more likely than not that Davis' spontaneous abortion directly resulted from the [procedure].\" (Doc. 23, Reply at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff's claims are before this Court under the FTCA, which \"does not\n   <em>\n    create\n   </em>\n   liability, it merely waives sovereign immunity to the extent that state-law would impose liability on a 'private individual in similar circumstances.' \"\n   <em>\n    Mason v.

Therefore, the Court will apply Ohio substantive law and federal procedural law \"to determine whether a private person would be liable to Plaintiff under these circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201594577\">\n    2016 WL 1594577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Admissibility of Plaintiff's Expert's Opinion Letters and Certificate of Merit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the outset, the Court will briefly address Defendant's argument that the opinion letters of Dr. David Burkons, Plaintiff's medical expert, are inadmissible hearsay and cannot be considered by the Court at the summary judgment stage. Plaintiff also posits that Dr. Burkons' Certificate of Merit is inadmissible for the purposes of opposing summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In support of its position with respect to the opinion letters, Defendant cites several Sixth Circuit cases that applied Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 as it existed prior to the significant 2010 amendments of that rule. In\n   <em>\n    Shaffer v. CSX Transp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=462%20Fed.%20Appx.%20597\">\n    462 Fed.Appx. 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 602 fn. 2 (6th Cir. 2012), the Sixth Circuit ruled that the district court did not commit error by refusing to consider an unsworn expert report submitted by a nonmoving party opposing summary judgment. In coming to this conclusion, the Sixth Circuit relied on its earlier holdings in\n   <em>\n    Sigler v. Am. Honda Motor Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031217\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/532/469/\">\n    532 F.3d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2008) and\n   <em>\n    Pack v. Damon Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931670\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/810/\">\n    434 F.3d 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2006). In\n   <em>\n    Sigler\n   </em>\n   , the movant submitted three unsworn expert reports in support of its motion for summary judgment. The court ruled that \"the district court improperly considered Honda's unsworn, hearsay evidence in deciding to grant Honda's motion for summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Sigler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031217\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/532/469/\">\n    532 F.3d at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Pack\n   </em>\n   , the court held that the district court erred by relying on the summary judgment movant's unsworn expert report.\n   <em>\n    Pack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931670\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/810/\">\n    434 F.3d at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On the flip side of that argument, Defendant also noted a decision from the Eastern District of Michigan which concluded that unsworn expert reports submitted by a nonmoving party (as is the present case) may be considered at the summary judgment stage. That court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff has objected to the R &amp; R's finding that Dr. Bacon's expert report is inadmissible. Generally, a court may not consider inadmissible evidence on a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Alpert v.

The Court refers to this task as \"difficult\" because, as Defendant points out, \"[t]he law and the medical literature have long confirmed the\n   lay understanding that spontaneous abortion is common and has many different causes such that cause in any particular case is usually unknown.\" (Doc. 21, Mot. at 10 (citing Lesley Regan et al.,\n   <em>\n    Influence of Past Reproductive Performance on Risk of Spontaneous Abortion\n   </em>\n   , 299 Brit. Med. J. 541, 541 (1989), attached to Doc. 21-8, Griffin Dep. at Ex. 3) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant's medical expert, Dr. Larry Griffin, submitted an eight-page report, a full page and a half of which was devoted to the issue of causation. (Doc. 21-8, Griffin Dep. at Ex. 2). Dr. Griffin cited to several pieces of medical literature and discussed the expected harm that would occur (fetal demise within a matter of days) if the procedure was a significant insult to the pregnancy. Instead, Dr. Griffin noted that Plaintiff's hCG levels rose appropriately, an intrauterine gestational sac containing a fetal pole developed, and normal fetal cardiac activity was observed. Dr. Griffin reasoned-and noted that other teratologists share the same opinion-that an insult occurring so early in pregnancy will either cause cell death to a degree incompatible with further fetal development or no harm at all because of the low number of overall cells and the rapid rate of cell division during this early period of development. This evidence sufficiently demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As a result of Defendant's showing, the burden of proof shifts to Plaintiff to prove that a genuine issue of material fact exists. Consistent with the medical malpractice standards set forth above, Plaintiff must make this showing through medical expert testimony that establishes that the injury was, more likely than not, caused by the defendant's negligence. In attempting to do so, Plaintiff relies on three opinion letters from Dr. Burkons. The majority of the opinion letters' content is related to the actual care Plaintiff received. These facts have been sufficiently set forth above and do not bear repeating here. However, a brief summary of each letter, to the extent each deals with the issue of causation, is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The first letter, dated May 31, 2016, generally states that Dr. Burkons has reviewed the relevant materials and notes that he has practiced obstetrics and gynecology since 1973 and has \"evaluated literally hundreds of patients for the possibility of ectopic pregnancy and have treated ectopics on many occasions,\" (Doc. 22-3, Burkons 1st Op. Ltr. at 1). Dr. Burkons further opines that \"[d]uring the operation, it is clear that there must have been manipulation of the uterine fundus....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Without stating any further basis for his opinion, Dr. Burkons later concludes, \"[a]s a viable intrauterine pregnancy develops, and then became non-viable, it is my opinion, to a high degree of medical probability, that the trauma of the surgery and the anesthesia involved, was the proximate cause of this viable pregnancy not continuing to a normal delivery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The second letter, dated June 15, 2016, is largely silent as to causation with the exception that Dr. Burkons concludes, \"[t]hus, after reviewing the above mentioned depositions, my opinion regarding deviation from the standard of care and their impact on Mrs. Davis' preganancy and subsequent psychological problems, are not only confirmed, but strengthened.\" (Doc. 22-4, Burkons 2d. Op. Ltr. at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The third and final letter, dated August 17, 2016, was issued by Dr. Burkons as a rebuttal to Defendant's expert report and contains the most causation-related statements of any of the three letters. Dr. Burkons opined that his opinion was indeed strengthened by one of the medical articles relied upon by Dr. Griffin. Dr. Burkons cited the following sentence from that article's conclusion: \"A false positive\n   diagnosis of a non-viable pregnancy early in the first trimester-incorrectly diagnosing pregnancy failure in a woman with intrauterine gestational sac or ruling out viable intrauterine gestation in a woman with a pregnancy of unknown location-can prompt interventions that damages a pregnancy that might have had a normal outcome.\" (Doc. 22-5, Burkons 3d Op. Ltr. at 1). Dr. Burkons concluded, \"[t]his is exactly what happened in this case.\" Later in his third opinion letter, Dr. Burkons' attempts to establish a nexus between his substantial experience in performing similar procedures throughout his medical career and the procedure presently at issue. He states that in his experience, these procedures \"involved excessive manipulation of the uterus, tubes an ovaries\" and the same \"would have to have been done in Mrs. Davis' case.\" Dr. Burkons continued, \"In these cases, there is ample opportunity to partially disrupt the corpus luteum on the ovary and the implementation of the fetus in the uterus which\n   <strong>\n    can\n   </strong>\n   result in sub optimum development of the pregnancy and fetal demise.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"It is well settled that a Rule 26(a)(2)(B) expert report 'must set forth facts and, in doing so, outline a line of reasoning arising from a logical foundation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Express Energy Servs. Operating, L.P. v.

While the Court is aware of Dr. Burkons' failure to cite to any medical literature to support his position, this omission alone does not necessarily render his opinion meritless. The Court's greater concern lies with Plaintiff's argument that Dr. Burkons' provided \"how\" and \"why\" he reached his conclusions by virtue of the fact that he has extensive personal experience\n   on the subject. While the Court has no reason to question the competency of Dr. Burkons as a surgeon, the Court does not agree with Plaintiff's position. Dr. Burkons' extensive experience certainly speaks to his exposure to ectopic pregnancy-related procedures, but the Court cannot rely on that information alone. His letters do not provide any facts explaining how or why his personal experiences led him to his conclusions under this particular set of facts. All that remains are conclusory statements that leave the Court to wonder how Dr. Burkons' experience with ectopic pregnancies is applicable to the specific issue of causation. Dr. Burkons stated that he performed procedures to rule out ectopic procedures \"many, many times\" but his letters do not inform the Court of how these cases resulted (e.g., how many, if any, of these procedures ultimately led to miscarriage and how long after the procedures the miscarriages occurred). Dr. Burkons also failed to address \"how\" and \"why\" Dr. Griffin's opinions pertaining to Plaintiff's normal rise in hCG levels, appropriate fetal development, normal fetal heart rate, Plaintiff's past infertility issues, Plaintiff's past miscarriage, or Plaintiff's thyroid abnormality during the pregnancy ultimately did not affect his conclusion that the December 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   procedure was more likely than not the cause of Plaintiffs miscarriage.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Austin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20422484\">\n    1996 WL 422484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2 (finding insufficiency of expert testimony in part because the expert did not \"explain why he excluded the myriad of other potential sources of the [alleged harm]\"). If Plaintiff is going to rely on the personal experience of its expert, these facts are critical to establish a nexus between Dr. Burkons' experience and the present case. Without these facts, the Court would be relying solely on\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   of Dr. Burkons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Nor is the Court persuaded by Dr. Burkons' multiple claims that the medical literature relied upon by Dr. Griffin in fact bolsters his opinion that the procedure was the proximate cause of Plaintiff's miscarriage. Each of the articles contains variables or elements that render them inapposite with the propositions that Dr. Burkons contends they stand for. Further, Plaintiff points out that \"neither [expert] could identify a controlled study, let alone one that was random and double blinded, to determine the cause and effect, if any between surgery and miscarriage[ ]\" and \"there are no controlled studies available to assist the parties' medical experts or the fact finder [sic] determine whether the subject surgery caused Plaintiff's miscarriage.\" (Doc. 22, Resp. at 5, 6). These arguments are not availing to Plaintiff. If anything, they underscore the difficulty of the evidentiary hurdle that Plaintiff is faced with in opposing summary judgment. Finally, Plaintiff argues that Dr. Griffin \"cannot rule out with 100% certainty that there is a link between surgery and miscarriage.\" Given the uncertain nature of miscarriages, this position should come as no surprise to Plaintiff. Of course, it is not Defendant's burden to rule out a causal link with 100% certainty. Rather, Plaintiff bears the burden of proof to show that it is more likely than not that the December 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   procedure was the proximate cause of Plaintiff's miscarriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In sum, the expert medical testimony relied upon by Plaintiff fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact because Dr. Burkons' opinion letters fail to state the \"how\" and \"why\" it is more likely than not that the December 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   procedure was the proximate cause of Plaintiff's miscarriage. Plaintiff asks this Court to give great weight to factually unsupported speculation, conclusory statements, and\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit.\n   </em>\n   While it is possible that the December 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   procedure may have led to Plaintiff's miscarriage, this mere possibility-in the absence of evidence showing that a jury could find was more likely than not-is not\n   enough for Plaintiff to avoid summary judgment. Accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Based on the foregoing, Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   The Clerk shall\n   <strong>\n    REMOVE\n   </strong>\n   Document 21 from the Court's pending motions list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
