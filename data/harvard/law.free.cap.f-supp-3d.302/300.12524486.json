EARM includes personal identifiers, photographs, and details of removal case proceedings to aid ERO in carrying out the removal of aliens from the United States, in accordance with the law. Through EARM, ERO accesses records related to the investigation, arrest, booking, detention, and removal of persons encountered during immigration and criminal law enforcement investigations and operations conducted by ICE, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the three agencies within DHS immigration enforcement responsibilities.

The Court concludes that ICE's search for responsive records was reasonable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff challenges the adequacy of ICE's search on two grounds. First, plaintiff contends that ICE did not search \"the location [where he] indicated that responsive records [were] originally[ ] requested, processed, located and withheld;\" nor did it produce \"his copy of the transcripts it withheld in 2003.\" Pl.'s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. and for Orders Allowing Him to Conduct Discovery and Requiring Defs. To Process his Requests In Accordance [with the] Freedom of Information Act, ECF No. 36 (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\") at 6. According to plaintiff, his May 30, 2016 and June 17, 2016 emails to the ICE FOIA Office \"gave the location of 880 Front Street, Suite 1234, San Diego, CA 92101-8834 as the INS branch office where his June 3, 2003 request was mailed,\" Mem. of P. &amp; A. in Support of Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Summ.

Because the May 30, 2016 request, No. 2016-ICFO-38593, is the operative FOIA request in this case, the 2003 FOIA request is not relevant. The fact that plaintiff informed ICE that he had\n   previously requested the same or similar information from the San Diego office of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service did not give rise to an obligation on the part of ICE to search that location in response to the new request, and the fact that it did not so does not make the search inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff's second challenge presumes that ICE previously maintained a copy of the state court transcripts he seeks, and that it improperly destroyed or otherwise wrongfully withheld them from him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Opp'n at 6; Pl.'s Mem. at 9 \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.

However, that ruling arose in the context of a case in which the district court exercised its discretion under the Local Rules to treat a summary judgment motion\n   as conceded when the non-moving party failed to file any opposition at all.

And then a district court must always determine for itself whether the record and any undisputed material facts justify granting summary judgment. These standards cannot be satisfied if, as allowed by Local Rule 7(b), the District Court simply grants judgment \"as conceded\" when the nonmoving party fails to meet a deadline.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 507 (internal citations, quotation marks, and edits omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   But that is not what happened in this case.

And here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Winston &amp; Strawn\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff filed a timely opposition to the motion for summary judgment. Thus, plaintiff availed himself of the opportunity provided in Rule 56(c) to address all of defendant's assertions of fact, and, pursuant to Rule 56(e), the Court may consider facts \"undisputed for purposes of the motion\" when \"a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact....\" Fed.
