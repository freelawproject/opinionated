Underhill, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before me is a consolidated class action against Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (\"Teva\") and three of its executives. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements that concealed the fact that Teva was engaged in violations of United States antitrust laws. When the falsity of such statements was revealed, Teva's stock price decreased and the plaintiffs suffered damages as a result. Currently pending are three motions for appointment as lead plaintiff, filed by (1) a group calling itself the \"Teva Investor Group,\" which consists of (i) the Oregon Public Employees' Retirement System (\"Oregon Fund\"), (ii) the Public School Teachers' Pension and Retirement Fund of Chicago (\"Chicago Fund\"), and (iii) individual investor, Dan Kleinerman; (2) TIAA (f/k/a Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund), which consists of various retirement funds that are owned and managed by TIAA; and (3) Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board (\"Ontario Fund\"), which is a single entity. For the following reasons, I appoint the Ontario Fund as lead plaintiff and approve of its choice of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Amram Galmi filed the instant suit in the Central District of California against Teva and two of its executives, Erez Vigodman, and Eyal Desheh, on November 6, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint alleged two counts\n   of securities violations based on alleged false and/or misleading statements issued by Teva on February 9, 2015, and February 11, 2016. The underlying misstatements were contained in Teva's 2014 20-F and 2015 20-F forms, which were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Those forms allegedly concealed the fact that Teva was conspiring with other name-brand manufacturers to fix drug prices, in violation of United States antitrust law. The complaint alleges that, on August 4, 2016, a portion of Teva's prior false statements were disclosed when Teva filed a Form 6-K with the SEC that disclosed the fact that Teva had received a subpoena from the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"). The subpoena requested documents and information relating to the marketing and pricing, and communications with competitors concerning, certain generic drugs manufactured by Teva. On that same day, Teva also announced that it had received an additional subpoena from the Connecticut Attorney General seeking documents and other information relating to potential antitrust law violations. The complaint alleges that, as a result of those disclosures, the price of Teva's American Depositary Receipts (\"ADRs\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   fell from $55.45 to $54.21, per share, in the trading day following the disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 3, 2016, Teva suffered another decrease in the price of its ADRs, allegedly as a result of an article by\n   <em>\n    Bloomberg News\n   </em>\n   , titled, \"U.S. Charges in Generic-Drug Probe to be Filed by Year-End.\" The article indicated that Teva was a potential target of the DOJ's investigation and that it and its executives were at risk of being criminally charged. Immediately following release of the article, the price of Teva's ADRs dropped from $43.33 to $39.20, per share.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 6, 2016, Galmi filed the instant suit on behalf of himself and others similarly situated. All agree that the class period at issue is from February 10, 2015, the first trading day following Teva's filing of the initial allegedly misleading Form 20-F, to November 3, 2016, the date of the final corrective disclosure alleged in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 5, 2017, five plaintiff groups filed competing motions for appointment as lead plaintiff. Since then, two plaintiff groups have withdrawn from consideration. Accordingly, the remaining plaintiffs seeking appointment as lead plaintiff are: (1) the Teva Investor Group, which claims an aggregated loss of $47,843,638; (2) TIAA, which claims an aggregated loss of $42,525,807; and (3) Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board (\"Ontario Fund\"), which claims a loss of $23,236,807.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 3, 2017, the instant action was transferred from the Central District of California to this court. The Central District of California did not address the pending motions, so they are ripe for consideration at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The PSLRA provides that the presumptively most adequate plaintiff is the \"person or group of persons\" that: (1) \"has either filed the complaint or made a motion in response to a notice,\" (2) \"in the determination of the court, has the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class,\" and (3) \"otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I). The presumption of most adequate plaintiff is only rebutted upon a showing that \"the presumptively most adequate plaintiff ... will not fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class; or ... is subject to unique defenses that render such plaintiff incapable of adequately representing the class.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(II) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Topping\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4337045\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/95/607/#p615\">\n    95 F.Supp.3d at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   It is undisputed that each of the proposed lead plaintiffs has satisfied the first prerequisite of filing a motion in response to a class action notice.

Once I determine that a plaintiff satisfies those factors, I will appoint that plaintiff as lead plaintiff unless another movant can rebut the presumption that it will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of the class. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Largest Financial Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Aggregation of the Teva Investor Group\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Teva Investor Group asserts that it has the largest financial interest in the litigation.

The PSLRA expressly allows a \"group of persons\" to be appointed as lead plaintiff, 15 U.S.C. section 78u-4(a)(3)(b)(iii)(I), but it does not provide any guidance for what a group \"can or should be, nor how its members must be related to one another.\"\n   <em>\n    Varghese\n   </em>\n   , 589 F.Supp.2d at 392. Plaintiffs with a relationship that pre-dates the litigation may aggregate their financial interests and form a putative lead plaintiff group with minimal court scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maliarov v.

Factors indicating the group's ability to function cohesively and separately from its lawyers include evidence of: \"(1) the existence of a pre-litigation relationship between group members; (2) involvement of the group members in the litigation thus far; (3) plans for cooperation; (4) the sophistication of its members; and (5) whether the members chose outside counsel, and not vice versa.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Courts have also considered the size of the group and have recognized the SEC's position that an investor group should generally not exceed 3-5 members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Network Assocs., Inc., Sec.

Cal. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Teva Investor Group consists of two institutional investors, the Oregon and Chicago Funds, and an individual investor, Kleinerman, none of whom has a preexisting relationship with the others. The institutional investors hail from different states and Kleinerman lives in a different country. Each entity admits that it formed the group in order to position itself as the presumptive lead plaintiff in this action. Doc. # 17-8 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-3. In an attempt to provide an additional reason for their formation, they attest that they joined forces in order to \"ensure this action is led by sophisticated investors with experience overseeing counsel in complex litigation,\" and \"to gain the advantages of joint decision-making,\" including the advantage of \"combini[ing each group member's] knowledge, experience, sophistication[,] and resources.\" Doc. # 49 at 12 (quoting Joint Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 5-6). They point out that their diverse backgrounds will bring a wide variety of experience and resources to the table, which will hopefully produce better litigation strategies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With regard to the plan for communication, the group states that it discussed each party's respective role during a single conference call that was held prior to the filing of the instant motion. Doc. # 48 at 11. The group discussed the potential that conflicts within the group would arise, but proposed no mechanism for resolving such disputes. The parties only agreed that, in the event of a dispute, the parties would work diligently to reach a \"consensus,\" and that each party would work in the best interests of the class. Doc. # 16 at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although each member has established that it is a sophisticated investor, the members have not adequately explained how they came to meet each other. Without such an explanation, one must assume that the group was arranged-or at least introduced-at the direction of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Two elements of the Teva Investor Group's relationship stand out as troubling. First, the lack of a preexisting relationship and the lack of an explanation for how the members were introduced to each other indicates that the group has been arranged by counsel. Evidence that the proposed class counsel chose the entities comprising the proposed lead plaintiff group creates a likelihood that the attorneys, not the clients, will control the action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Petrobras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6837929\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/104/618/#p621\">\n    104 F.Supp.3d at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the group's plan for conflict resolution appears too general and not the product of sufficient pre-litigation planning. Although the lack of a specific voting plan is not fatal to the ability of parties to operate as a group,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Cardinal Health, Inc. Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1361490\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/226/298/#p308\">\n    226 F.R.D. 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 308 (S.D. Ohio 2005) (approving decisionmaking by \"consensus\"), it does not provide much comfort to a court that is already skeptical of the parties' relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Tarragon Corp.

Dec. 6, 2007). Conclusory statements such as \"each group member shares a common purpose or goal in obtaining a recovery in the lawsuit\" are not evidence of a group's cohesiveness.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204302732\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the fact that the group's plan for cooperation was devised at a single conference call does not give the court confidence of its ability to manage conflicts that may arise in the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Khunt v.

Finally, the group does not submit any information regarding how the appointment of two law firms as co-lead counsel is necessary, let alone preferred, nor has it identified the division of authority or the responsibility between the two firms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Petrobras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6837929\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/104/618/#p621\">\n    104 F.Supp.3d at 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Even if a group is able to show that it is able to function cohesively and effectively manage the litigation, courts will not permit aggregation of their financial interests if it apparent that the group \"has been assembled as a makeshift by attorneys for the purpose of [obtaining lead plaintiff status].\"\n   <em>\n    Varghese\n   </em>\n   , 589 F.Supp.2d at 392-93 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Tarragon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204302732\">\n    2007 WL 4302732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 ).

The Teva Investor Group challenges TIAA's ability to form as group under the PSLRA but it does not provide any authority to suggest that TIAA, an individual nonprofit organization that manages various investment funds, should be considered as a group rather than an individual investor. Even if considered a group, the grouping of various investment funds that TIAA manages would not offend the purposes of the PSLRA. Unlike the Teva Investor Group, the nine funds operated by TIAA were formed and are operated by the same entity. In other words, the funds had a preexisting relationship with each other prior to the initiation of this action. Moreover, there is nothing to suggest that the funds are unable to function as a cohesive unit. TIAA is the entity acting on behalf of each of the funds, which have interests that are closely aligned with each other. To the extent that the PSLRA would consider the nine funds as a group of investors, as opposed to viewing TIAA as the individual investor who has multiple different types of holdings, such grouping would be consistent with the proposes of the PSLRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    TIAA's Financial Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The PSLRA \"offers no guidance\" with respect to how to measure a proposed lead plaintiff's financial interest in the litigation.\n   <em>\n    Varghese v.

There are no allegations in any of the complaints regarding false earning reports, Medicaid fraud, or pay-for-delay anticompetitive practices.

The September 9, 2015 disclosure that Israeli antitrust authorities were investigating a Teva subsidiary for potential price fixing reveals nothing about whether Teva itself was engaged in such price fixing. The complaint does not allege anything with respect to Teva's drug distribution subsidiaries and there is no allegation that Teva ever made false statements or omissions about their alleged anticompetitive practices. The November 4, 5, and 9, 2015 disclosures bear a slightly closer relationship to the facts alleged in the complaint. Those disclosures related to potential anticompetitive drug overcharging by Cephalon, a company that Teva has acquired. Still, there is not sufficient information to conclude that such disclosures are plausibly related to the misconduct alleged in the complaint. From the barebones statement in the reply brief, there is no indication of when Teva acquired Cephalon. If Teva did not own Cephalon in November 2015, the fact that Cephalon was engaged in antitrust violations is irrelevant. Even if Teva had acquired Cephalon prior to November 2015, the mere fact that Cephalon might have been engaged in antitrust violations does not reveal the existence of Teva's own misconduct. In that respect, even the November 2015 disclosures are a far cry from the \"plausible and legitimate\" partial disclosures that are required to support an in-and-out trader's lead plaintiff motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gentiva\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282313\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/281/108/#p120\">\n    281 F.R.D. at 115-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Gentiva\n   </em>\n   , the complaint alleged that Gentiva had falsely concealed the fact that it was engaged in Medicare fraud.

In contrast, the statements put forward by TIAA at most indicate that some of Teva's affiliates were being investigated for potential anticompetitive practices. Although such investigations might have contributed to a decline in Teva's stock price, the factual allegations are not sufficient for me to conclude that those statements revealed any indication that Teva itself was engaged in a price fixing conspiracy with other drug manufacturers that it fraudulently concealed. Accordingly, I will not permit TIAA to rely on the partial disclosures identified in its reply brief. Without such additional partial disclosure allegations, TIAA cannot establish recoverable trading losses of $42.5 million for the purposes of their lead plaintiff motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Because I conclude that TIAA has not plausibly alleged any partial disclosures prior to August 4, 2016, I do not consider any losses attributed to shares that were sold prior to that date. Doing so requires me to disregard any trading losses suffered by the five TIAA funds that retained no shares as of August 4, 2016. That reduces TIAA's recoverable losses from approximately $42.5 million to approximately $22.6 million. Doc. # 33 at 25. TIAA's recoverable losses are further reduced to approximately $20.3 million, which represents an elimination of $2.3 million in losses TIAA incurred as a result of ADR purchases\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the full extent of the fraud was disclosed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.

Although TIAA points out the frequency with which subsequent disclosure dates are alleged, which would permit recovery for ADRs purchased following the November 3, 2016 disclosure, I cannot consider hypothetical subsequent disclosures that have not yet been alleged. Finally, TIAA's losses are further reduced to take into account losses allegedly incurred by the remaining four eligible funds prior to August 4, 2016. An evaluation of the trading losses suffered by the four TIAA funds still holding shares on August 4, 2016, shows that the majority of those losses were realized prior to that date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 34-6. In fact, only $7.6 million in losses incurred by the remaining TIAA funds can be traced to the two disclosures alleged in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. # 33 at 30.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, when considering TIAA's financial interest in the litigation, I will only consider $7.6 million of its losses as recoverable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   I now consider the\n   <em>\n    Lax / Olsten\n   </em>\n   factors using the revised calculation of TIAA's recoverable losses. TIAA has the greatest number of total shares purchased, 6.3 million, net shares purchased, 1.8 million, and net funds expended, $108.6 million. Doc. # 35 at 9. The remaining movant, Ontario Fund, only had 1.4 million total shares purchased, 1 million net shares purchased, and $58 million net funds expended.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   From an analysis of\n   the first three factors, it appears that TIAA retains the largest financial interest in the litigation. However, the final, and consistently most important factor, weighs against TIAA. TIAA's recoverable losses total approximately $7.6 million.
