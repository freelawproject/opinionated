(Doc. 34). Plaintiff filed a response on February 3, 2017, and Defendant Maxum Indemnity Company (Maxum)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a reply on February 16, 2017.

Relevant Facts Viewed in the Light Most Favorable to Plaintiff\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff provides title and escrow services for real estate closings and is an agent for title insurance underwriter Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company (Commonwealth). (Doc. 1-1) at 19-22; (Doc. 34-1) at 2-3, depo. at 9-10. Under the agency agreement with Commonwealth, if Plaintiff is grossly negligent in its provision of title services, Plaintiff may be liable to Commonwealth for any loss it suffers as a result of the gross negligence. (Doc. 1-1) at 20. This lawsuit involves Commonwealth's request for indemnification from Plaintiff for an error in its provision of title services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    a. Chronology of Events\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2008, Sweetwater Farms (Sweetwater) obtained a mortgage from Zions First National Bank (Zions) to encumber a parcel of land next to a peanut processing plant. (Doc. 34) at 3, \u00b6 5; (Doc. 34-1) at 4, depo. at 18-19. Plaintiff's closing officer, Jennifer Hardin, handled the closing of the transaction, and Plaintiff issued a title insurance policy underwritten by Commonwealth. (Doc. 34-1) at 2 and 4, depo. at 9, 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2009, Sweetwater obtained a mortgage from Excel National Bank (Excel) to encumber the property upon which the peanut processing plant was situated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, depo. at 19. Hardin, likewise, handled the closing of that transaction for Plaintiff, and Plaintiff issued a title insurance policy underwritten by Commonwealth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In December 2010, Excel sought to foreclose on its Sweetwater mortgage and discovered that Zions was asserting that its Sweetwater mortgage was senior to a portion of the property where the peanut processing plant was located, property subject to the Excel mortgage. (Doc. 34) at 3, \u00b6 7; (Doc. 34-1) at 17. Consequently, in a letter dated December 22, 2010, Excel notified Commonwealth of Zions' claim to Excel's property and indicated that it had contacted Plaintiff about the problem, which Plaintiff was researching. (Doc. 34-1) at 17. This letter was copied to Hardin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under the terms of the title insurance policy, Commonwealth provided Excel with counsel to defend its interest in the disputed property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In February 2011, Commonwealth advised Plaintiff, by letter, about the claim Excel presented to Commonwealth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. Commonwealth requested that Plaintiff provide a copy of its file on the Sweetwater transactions and any other information which would help Commonwealth's \"investigation or resolution of this matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In March 2011, Plaintiff's president, Bessie Engram, responded to Commonwealth explaining that a mistake in the legal descriptions in the two Sweetwater transactions occurred and that \"[r]e-recording the Zions National Bank mortgage with corrected legal [description] or filing a modification with the corrected legal [description] of that mortgage should remedy the problem.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Plaintiff also enclosed the requested Sweetwater files.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Engram admits that filing a mortgage with an incorrect legal description of the property is a negligent act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, depo. at 40-41. Moreover, Engram knew, in March 2011, that it was possible that the error in legal descriptions could result in a loss of collateral.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, depo. at 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In June 2012, Plaintiff, through Engram, applied for professional errors and omissions (E &amp; O) liability insurance with Maxum.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. Question 38 of the application asks whether the applicant is \"aware of any incident or circumstance which MAY RESULT in a CLAIM being made against the Applicant ...?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. Plaintiff responded \"no.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Maxum subsequently issued the E &amp; O insurance policy with an inception date of July 1, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In October 2012, Engram learned, from Hardin, about the foreclosure proceeding involving the Sweetwater property and that there was an issue with respect to Zions and Excel's mortgages, i.e., a possible overlap of the mortgages. (Doc. 37-1) at 1, depo. at 26, 28, and 29. In fact, Hardin testified at the October 2012 trial of the foreclosure proceeding. (Doc. 34-1) at 8, depo. at 41. In December 2012, the state court determined in the foreclosure proceeding that Zions had the first lien on the disputed property while Excel had a second lien on that property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, depo. at 46. Excel, thus, lost the value of the collateral with respect to the disputed property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After Hardin testified at the foreclosure trial in October 2012, Engram had concerns about whether Plaintiff erred with respect to the Sweetwater mortgages. (Doc. 38-1) at 4, depo. at 44. Consequently, prior to the state court's determination in December 2012, Engram obtained a copy of the foreclosure trial transcript and asked Hardin if there was a claim against Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, depo. at 42, 44. Hardin told Engram \"no.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, depo. at 44. Following the 2012 foreclosure trial, Engram waited for Commonwealth to contact her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, depo. at 45. Engram explained at her deposition that, \"If there was going to be a claim against me, they would have made it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a result of the state court's decision, Commonwealth indemnified Excel for \"the loss incurred as a result of a portion of [Excel's] Insured Property being subject to the superior Zions Mortgage.\" (Doc. 34-1) at 33. Commonwealth resolved Excel's claim by paying Excel the title insurance policy limit of $275,000.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In December 2014, Commonwealth wrote a letter to Plaintiff asserting that Plaintiff \"knew or should have known that the legal descriptions were conflicting\" and that the conflicting legal descriptions resulted in a loss to Excel and Commonwealth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Hence, Commonwealth demanded that Plaintiff indemnify it for the losses and expenses it incurred due to the conflicting legal descriptions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Commonwealth suggested that Plaintiff file a claim with its E &amp; O insurer, Maxum, for indemnification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Engram acknowledged she had received \"some\" correspondence from Commonwealth prior to the December 2014 letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12, depo. at 57-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In January 2015, Plaintiff made a claim to Maxum for indemnification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. In addition to indemnification, Engram expected Maxum to defend Plaintiff from a possible lawsuit by Commonwealth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, depo. at 68. In anticipation of such a lawsuit, Plaintiff retained counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, depo. at 67. Commonwealth, however, has not filed any legal proceedings against Plaintiff in this matter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11, depo. at 56. Indeed, Commonwealth has agreed not to sue Plaintiff for negligence with respect to the Excel mortgage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, depo. at 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In October 2015, Maxum denied coverage explaining that the E &amp; O insurance policy did not apply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. Maxum specifically cited the prior knowledge exclusion provision which states that the policy does not apply to \"[a]ny 'claim' arising out of or resulting from any 'wrongful act' \" which the insured \"had knowledge of\n   or information related to, prior to the first inception date of the continuous claims-made coverage with [Maxum], and which may result in a 'claim.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37. According to Maxum, Plaintiff was aware of the legal descriptions error in 2010 and 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38. Maxum, therefore, concluded that Plaintiff \"was aware of wrongful acts which might result in a claim against it prior to July 1, 2012,\" the inception date of the E &amp; O insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    b. Other Relevant Provisions of the E &amp; O Insurance Policy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The policy provision on the duty to defend states that Maxum has the \"duty to defend any 'insured' against any 'suit' seeking ... 'damages.' \" (Doc. 34-2) at 2. \"Damages\" are those sums an insured is \"legally obligated to pay ... because of a 'wrongful act' in the rendering of or failure to render 'professional services' by any 'insured' ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Maxum, however, has no duty to defend if \"this insurance does not apply.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Maxum, at its discretion, may \"investigate any 'wrongful act' and settle any 'claim' or 'suit' that may result.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The policy further defines \"damages\" as \"compensation only in the form of money for a 'claim' to which this insurance applies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. A \"claim,\" in turn, is defined as \"a written or verbal demand received by any 'insured' for money....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A \"suit\" is \"a civil proceeding in which 'damages' because of the rendering of or failure to render 'professional services' to which this insurance applies are alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. A \"wrongful act\" is \"any actual or alleged negligent act, error or omission in the rendering or failure to render 'professional services.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    2. The Complaint Against Maxum\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In December 2015, Plaintiff filed suit against Maxum, Commonwealth, and a survey company in state court. (Doc. 1-1) at 7. Maxum removed the case to federal court in February 2016. (Doc. 1). Only Maxum remains as a Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stipulated Order of Dismissal of Claims Against Defendants Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Co. and Lydick Engineers &amp; Surveyors. (Doc. 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In Count III of the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Maxum breached the E &amp; O insurance policy by denying Plaintiff's request for a defense and indemnification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In Count IV, Plaintiff alleges that Maxum breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by (1) not applying the E &amp; O insurance policy to the Commonwealth matter, (2) not \"promptly and fairly investigat[ing], process[ing], determin[ing], and decid[ing] Plaintiff's claims,\" and (3) not providing prompt coverage under the policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, \u00b6 56. The parties refer to this claim as the bad faith claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, in Count V, Plaintiff alleges that Maxum violated the New Mexico Unfair Claims Practices Act by (1) \"[f]ailing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly\" with respect to Plaintiff's claim for coverage, (2) \"[f]ailing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt investigation and processing of\" Plaintiff's claim for coverage, (3) \"[f]ailing to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements\" of Plaintiff's claim for coverage \"in which liability has become reasonably clear,\" (4) \"[f]ailing to promptly provide [Plaintiff] a reasonable explanation of the basis\" for denying Plaintiff's claim for coverage, and (5) \"[f]ailing and refusing to mediate, resolve, and settle\" Plaintiff's claim for coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16, \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Maxum moves for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims against it. Maxum asserts that it is entitled to summary judgment on the breach of contract claims for two reasons. First, Maxum argues that\n   it did not owe Plaintiff a duty to defend because there was no \"suit,\" as defined under the E &amp; O insurance policy, which \"legally obligated\" Plaintiff \"to pay as 'damages' any sum for any wrongful act in the rendering of or failure to render professional services.\" (Doc. 34) at 8. Second, Maxum argues that Plaintiff's request for indemnification is excluded under the E &amp; O insurance policy's prior knowledge provision because Plaintiff, prior to the inception of the E &amp; O insurance policy, had knowledge of a wrongful act which could result in a claim by Commonwealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Maxum further contends that it is entitled to summary judgment on the bad faith and the New Mexico Unfair Claims Practices Act claims for two reasons. Maxum specifically argues that there are no bases for those claims because (1) it properly denied insurance coverage, and (2) in the event the Court determines that Maxum improperly denied insurance coverage, its coverage position, nonetheless, was reasonable as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff opposes the Motion for Summary Judgment in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    C. Summary Judgment Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party shows \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Once the moving party meets its initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schneider v. City of Grand Junction Police Dep't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575205\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/760/#p767\">\n    717 F.3d 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 767 (10th Cir. 2013). A dispute over a material fact is \"genuine\" only if \"the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    477 U.S. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986).

Whether Maxum had a Duty to Defend Plaintiff\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Maxum argues first that it did not owe Plaintiff a duty to defend under the E &amp; O insurance policy because that duty only arises if there is a \"suit\" seeking sums that Plaintiff is \"legally obligated to pay\" due to a wrongful act in either \"the rendering of or failure to render 'professional services.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 34-2) at 2. It is undisputed that no one has sued Plaintiff for indemnification arising from the overlapping legal descriptions in the Sweetwater mortgages. The question, then, is whether the term \"suit,\" defined as a \"civil proceeding,\" unambiguously means only a civil lawsuit filed in a court of law. The Court recognizes that if an insurance contract \"is unambiguous, the court is bound to enforce its terms\" and construes an unambiguous insurance contract \"in [its] usual and ordinary sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanchez v.

Because Commonwealth has not sued Plaintiff and does not plan to do so, Maxum did not, as a matter of law, have a duty to provide Plaintiff with a defense, let alone an obligation to conduct an investigation to determine if it had a duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In addition to a \"suit,\" the duty to defend under the E &amp; O insurance policy requires that the suit seek damages which the insured is \"legally obligated to pay ... because of a 'wrongful act' in the rendering of or failure to render 'professional services' ....\" (Doc. 34-2) at 2. It is undisputed that there has been no \"suit\" or proceeding, of any kind, legally obligating Plaintiff to indemnify Commonwealth. For this additional reason, Maxum was not required, as a matter of law, to provide a defense to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, Maxum is entitled to summary judgment on the\n   breach of contract claim based on a failure to provide a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    b. Whether Plaintiff's Request for Indemnification is Excluded Because of Prior Knowledge of a Wrongful Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Maxum further argues that the E &amp; O insurance policy did not provide Plaintiff coverage because, prior to the inception of the E &amp; O insurance policy in July 2012, Plaintiff had \"knowledge of or information related to\" the overlapping legal descriptions \"which may result in a 'claim' \" by Commonwealth. (Doc. 34-2) at 3. Plaintiff asserts that although correspondence between Commonwealth and Plaintiff prior to July 2012 \"set forth Commonwealth's belief that [Plaintiff] could be responsible for the errors in the land transaction,\" Commonwealth did not present Plaintiff a \"claim,\" i.e., demand for money, until Commonwealth's December 2014 demand letter, written well after the inception of the E &amp; O insurance policy. (Doc. 37) at 5. Plaintiff also argues that Engram's deposition testimony creates a genuine issue of material fact on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   A prior knowledge exclusion applies if, prior to the inception of the policy, the insured \"had knowledge of an error that\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have resulted in a demand for damages against it.\"\n   <em>\n    McDowell Bldg., LLC v.

Thus, a prior knowledge exclusion like the one in this case, which refers to knowledge of wrongful acts \"which\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   result in a 'claim,' \" should not be interpreted to \"exclude only coverage for ripened claims that had already been made or were certain to be made as of the time of policy inception.\"\n   <em>\n    Lexington Ins.

A reasonable jury could find from the above\n   undisputed evidence that prior to July 2012 Plaintiff had knowledge of a negligent act or error made by one of its employees, i.e., a \"wrongful act,\" that \"may result\" in a loss of collateral, i.e., a \"claim\" or demand for money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiff seems to argue, however, that the potential \"claim\" in this case would be a demand for money from Commonwealth for a \"gross\" negligent act, as provided in the agency agreement between Plaintiff and Commonwealth. Plaintiff notes that Commonwealth's demand letter did not specify that the legal descriptions error was a grossly negligent act. The E &amp; O insurance policy's definition of a \"claim\" does not state that the claim must be valid. The \"may result in a 'claim' \" language in the prior knowledge exclusion provision, likewise, does not require that the insured determine the validity of the claim beforehand, i.e, that the \"wrongful act\" will result in a claim. Also, the undisputed evidence demonstrates that prior to Commonwealth's December 2014 demand letter, Engram had concerns that Commonwealth would sue Plaintiff, presumably under the agency agreement for gross negligence. A reasonable jury viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff could still find that prior to July 2012 Plaintiff had knowledge of a negligent act or error made by one of its employees, i.e., a \"wrongful act,\" that \"may result\" in a loss of collateral, i.e., a \"claim\" or demand for money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff has not presented any facts showing that, prior to July 2012, Commonwealth had assured Plaintiff it would not sue it over the legal descriptions error or that the matter was somehow settled or resolved. Although Engram suggested to Commonwealth in March 2011 to re-record the Zions' mortgage with the correct legal description as a way to remedy the problem, Plaintiff has not provided any evidence that this was done or that such an action would have necessarily prevented Excel from incurring damages as a result of the legal descriptions error. Viewing all of the above circumstances in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, no reasonable jury could find that the prior knowledge exclusion did not apply and that the E &amp; O insurance policy, therefore, covered Plaintiff's indemnification claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Alternatively, Plaintiff contends that it \"had a reasonable expectation of coverage and at a minimum an adequate investigation into the underlying claim and the facts surrounding the issue of prior knowledge.\" (Doc. 37) at 5. To support this reasonable expectation theory, Plaintiff again cites\n   <em>\n    G &amp; G Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   and its discussion of the insurer's obligation to investigate the duty to defend. As discussed above,\n   <em>\n    G &amp; G Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   clearly refers to lawsuits when discussing the obligation to investigate the duty to defend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"106539\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/128/434/\">\n    2000-NMCA-003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6\u00b6 28 and 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"106539\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/128/434/\">\n    128 N.M. 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"106539\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/128/434/\">\n    993 P.2d 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As before, the Court notes that there is no underlying lawsuit in this case. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    G &amp; G Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   examines the obligation to investigate the duty to defend, it does not examine any obligation to investigate an underlying claim or the applicability of a prior knowledge exclusion provision.\n   <em>\n    G &amp; G Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , therefore, fails to support Plaintiff's reasonable expectation argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In New Mexico, \"the doctrine of reasonable expectations applies if the language of an insurance policy would lead the insured to reasonably expect coverage\" or \"when the language of a policy is ambiguous.\"\n   <em>\n    Hinkle v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334107\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nmca/2013/084/4334107/\">\n    2013-NMCA-084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20P.3d%201009\">\n    308 P.3d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the reasonable expectations doctrine, the court asks what a \"hypothetical reasonable insured would glean from the wording of the policy and the kind of insurance at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20P.3d%201009\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With respect to an expectation of a defense, the wording of\n   the E &amp; O insurance policy indicates that a \"suit\" or civil proceeding which seeks damages, i.e., a legal obligation to pay \"sums\" because of a \" 'wrongful act' in the rendering of or failure to render 'professional services,' \" is required before Maxum is obligated to provide a defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 34-2) at 2. Even viewing the language of the policy in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, no reasonable jury could find that a reasonable insured would glean from that language that Maxum owes a defense when the insured is not being sued or is not involved in some kind of civil proceeding which could \"legally obligate\" the insured to pay money for a wrongful act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   With respect to an expectation of indemnification, that expectation must be viewed in light of the prior knowledge exclusion provision which excludes a claim if the insured, prior to the inception of the insurance policy, had knowledge of a wrongful act that \"may result in a 'claim.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 34-2) at 3. Viewing the language of the prior knowledge exclusion in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, no reasonable jury could find that a reasonable insured would glean from the prior knowledge exclusion language that only a prior demand for money triggers that exclusion or that the potential claim must necessarily be determined valid, as Plaintiff argues. In addition, if the prior knowledge exclusion applies, the unambiguous language of the E &amp; O insurance policy provides that Maxum does not owe the insured a defense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (Maxum has no duty to defend against \" 'suit' seeking 'damages' for a 'wrongful act' to which this insurance does not apply.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Furthermore, the E &amp; O insurance policy unambiguously states that Maxum \"may\" at its \"discretion\" investigate a \"wrongful act.\" (Doc. 34-2) at 2. A reasonable jury could not find that a reasonable insured would glean from that language that Maxum is required to investigate underlying indemnification claims or exclusions. Plaintiff's reasonable expectations arguments simply fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In sum, Maxum is entitled to summary judgment on the Count III breach of contract claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    2. Bad Faith and New Mexico Unfair Claims Practices Act (Counts IV and V of the Complaint)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Next, Maxum argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on the bad faith and New Mexico Unfair Claims Practices Act claims because the E &amp; O insurance policy did not cover Plaintiff's claim for a defense and indemnification. Maxum further argues, in the alternative, that even if it erroneously denied Plaintiff a defense and indemnification under the E &amp; O insurance policy, \"not every mistaken denial of coverage constitutes bad faith or a statutory violation.\" (Doc. 34) at 11. Interestingly, Plaintiff does not respond to any of Maxum's arguments in favor of summary judgment on the claims of bad faith and under the New Mexico Unfair Claims Practices Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Courts have held that a court should dismiss bad faith and New Mexico Insurance Practices Act claims if there is no duty to defend and no right to indemnification under an insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New Mem'l Assocs. v.
