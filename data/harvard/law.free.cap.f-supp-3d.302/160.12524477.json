Reply at 4-5, 20, citing Hunter and Goodman Statement of Reasons. It is true that in a footnote to their separate statement, Vice Chair Hunter and Commissioner Goodman expressed concerns that Commissioner Weintraub had \"publicly prejudged\" plaintiffs' guilt and \"pre-supposed facts and intent without investigation.\" Hunter and Goodman Statement of Reasons at 3 n.8. But plaintiffs make too much of these comments, and their efforts to highlight the footnote obscure the fact that there is nothing in the body of the two Commissioners' Statement of Reasons that militates against disclosure under the FEC policy. The Hunter and Goodman five-page letter makes several points: 1) that the legal theory underlying the OGC's \"reason to believe\" recommendation concerning plaintiffs was unclear, and that more factual investigation on the question of intent was needed because \"the Commission had circumstantial evidence but not direct evidence,\" and \"time was running out;\" 2) the statute of limitations concerning the original respondents was close to expiring, and expanding the matter to include plaintiffs could delay the case further, so \"we believed the most efficient prosecutorial path forward was to finalize the case against the 3 Respondents\" as efficiently and expeditiously as possible;\" 3) the agency's decision to conciliate with the named respondents and avoid \"the procedural, legal, and investigative complexities\" of adding plaintiffs was well within the agency's prosecutorial discretion; and 4) the decision was in the public interest since the conciliation agreement established precedent and secured a large penalty.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Hunter and Goodman Statement of Reasons. None of this suggests that the allegations of plaintiffs' involvement or the fact that the agency declined to enforce its own subpoena were not integral to the proceeding or its termination.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
