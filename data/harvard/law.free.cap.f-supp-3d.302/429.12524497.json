Qualified organizations can receive grants for up to 80% of Head Start program costs.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209835\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The grants are administered by a division of HHS, the Administration of Children and Families' Office of Head Start (\"OHS\"). Dkt. 19 at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff, the Navajo Nation, is a federally recognized Indian tribe whose reservation spans parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Compl. \u00b6 11, Dkt.1. It runs Head Start and Early Head Start programs to provide education services to its young members and residents and their families. Dkt. 19 at 13. The programs are funded primarily by a federal grant, No. 90C19889 (\"the Grant\"), which is at the center of this case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209835\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Grant's budgetary period, or fiscal year, starts on March 1 each year and runs through February of the next year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209835\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Navajo Nation must submit an annual renewal application for the Grant, which is due on December 1 before the new fiscal year starts. Compl. \u00b6 18. In recent fiscal years, the Navajo Nation has received $23,075,043 annually pursuant to the Grant. Dkt. 19 at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under the Head Start Act, however, grants are not static from year to year. Section 641a(h) of the Act provides specific procedures for adjusting grants to Head Start programs that suffer from \"chronic underenrollment.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9836a(h). Grantees must self-report enrollment each month,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209835\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9836a(h)(2), and HHS must conduct a semiannual review to determine which grantees have been under-enrolled for four consecutive months,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209835\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9836a(h)(3). HHS and each under-enrolled grantee must then develop a plan and timetable for remediating under-enrollment, and the grantee \"shall immediately implement the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209835\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9836a(h)(3), (4). If the grantee does not reach at least 97% enrollment within twelve months, HHS may designate the grantee as chronically under-enrolled and \"recapture, withhold, or reduce\" the base grant by a percentage calculated as the difference between funded and actual enrollment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209835\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9836a(h)(5)(A).

If HHS adjusts funding for an Indian Head Start program, HHS must redistribute the resulting funds to other Indian Head Start programs by the end of the following fiscal year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209835\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9836a(h)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Navajo Head Start program failed to reach its funded enrollment in many recent years in the 2000s and 2010s.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11-1 at 2-3. Due to under-enrollment, HHS decided to reduce the Navajo Nation's funding in 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18-1 at 4, 7; Unedited Hr'g Tr. at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, the Nation filed an appeal before the HHS Departmental Appeals Board (\"DAB\"), but the Nation and HHS ultimately reached a settlement agreement through a tribal consultation process, so they jointly moved the Departmental Appeals to dismiss the appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18-1 at 1-7; Unedited Hr'g Tr. at 3. Even so, under-enrollment continued to be a problem. For example, the Navajo Nation did not meet Head Start funded enrollment in every month from March 2015 to January 2018. During\n   that time period, funded Head Start enrollment was 2,068 students, but the Nation's self-reported student numbers generally ranged from approximately 1,000 to 1,600 students.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11-2 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Due to the continuing under-enrollment problems, HHS and the Navajo Nation began discussing remediation in 2015. Dkt. 11-1 at 4. Then, throughout 2016 and 2017, they implemented a detailed remediation plan, as required by Section 641a(h) of the Head Start Act. Dkt. 11-2 at 2-3. The remediation plan involved extensive coordination and communication between the Nation and HHS, including meetings, calls, on-site visits, and training.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209835\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209835\">\n    at 4-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Remediation, however, was unsuccessful. By letter on September 26, 2017, HHS informed the Nation that HHS found Navajo Head Start to be \"chronically underenrolled\" and HHS reduced the Navajo Grant to $15,766,194 for fiscal year 2018, which runs from March 1, 2018 to February 28, 2019. Dkt. 11-2 at 14-15. This reduction was based on an enrollment level of 1,396 students in Navajo Head Start, not the previously funded enrollment of 2,068 Head Start students. Dkt. 11-2 at 12-15. The 672-student change \"represented the average number of vacant slots over a 12 month period.\" Dkt. 11-1 at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11-2 at 1 (listing enrollment reported by the Navajo Nation for each month from March 2015 to January 2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite notifying the Navajo Nation that funding had been reduced, the HHS letter also provided the Navajo Nation with the opportunity to present certain countervailing considerations within 30 days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11-2 at 15 (\"If there are significant causes of underenrollment that OHS was not made aware of over the 12 month period, please inform your regional office within 30 days of the delivery of this notice.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In additional letters on October 5, November 22, and December 4, 2017, HHS reiterated the reduced funding level. Dkt. 19 at 13-14. Even so, on January 12, 2018, the Navajo Nation submitted a funding application for fiscal year 2018 seeking $23,075,043.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209835\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209835\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By letter one week later, HHS again advised the Navajo Nation that the Grant would be the reduced amount for the reduced funded enrollment level.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209835\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the same letter, however, HHS committed to restoring $2 million if the Nation meets certain conditions, the most stringent of which appear to be (1) maintaining enrollment levels of only 1,396 Head Start students and (2) creating a waitlist of children eligible to fill the approximately 180 to 200 additional seats to be supported by the restored funding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11-2 at 32-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 2, 2018, the Navajo Nation filed its complaint in this action. Dkt. 1. On the same day, the Nation moved for a preliminary injunction, Dkt. 2, and requested a decision before the end of the month,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 2-1 at 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 28,\n   2018, the Court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction and set an expedited schedule for resolving the case on its merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 13; Dkt. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   HHS now moves for dismissal under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ; in the alternative, HHS moves for summary judgment under Rule 56. Dkt. 17. In turn, the Navajo Nation moves for summary judgment, arguing that HHS violated the Head Start Act and the Administrative Procedure Act by reducing the Nation's funding without providing an appeal and hearing required by the Head Start Act.

That definition encompasses funding adjustments for chronic under-enrollment such as the adjustment in this case, which diminished the Nation's funding from approximately $23 million to $15 million. Dkt. 19 at 13. Furthermore, HHS clearly labeled the funding adjustment as a \"reduction\" under Section 641a(h).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Perhaps most tellingly, however, the Head Start Act itself explicitly deems funding adjustments due to chronic under-enrollment to be \"reductions.\" The provision governing such adjustments, Section 641a(h), is titled \"\n   <em>\n    Reduction\n   </em>\n   of grants and\n   redistribution of funds in cases of underenrollment.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9836a(h) (emphasis added). Section 641a(h) authorizes HHS to adjust funding due to chronic under-enrollment by permitting the agency to \"recapture, withhold, or\n   <em>\n    reduce\n   </em>\n   the base grant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9836a(h)(5)(A)(ii) (emphasis added).

It is true that, as HHS points out, the Act not only authorizes HHS to \"reduce\" funding due to under-enrollment, but also authorizes HHS to \"withhold\" or \"recapture\" funding. 42 \u00a7 9836a(h)(5)(A)(ii). According to HHS, Section 646's appeal and hearing requirements do not mention (and thus does not apply to) a \"withholding\" or a \"recapture,\" so the requirement should not extend to their functional analogue: \"reductions.\" But these points steer the Court in the opposite direction. If anything, the fact that \"recapture, withhold, and reduce\" are similar actions to decrease financial assistance under a provision titled \"Reduction of grants\" indicates that\n   <em>\n    all three\n   </em>\n   trigger appeal and hearing rights under Section 646, not that\n   <em>\n    none\n   </em>\n   of them do. Otherwise, the appeal and hearing rights would hinge on the technical label attached to similar actions to decrease financial assistance. Therefore, the Court reads Section 646 to require an appeal and hearing for all funding adjustments for chronic under-enrollment under Section 641a(h), regardless of whether the adjustments are styled reductions, withholdings, or recaptures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Contrary to HHS's assertions, this reading does not violate the anti-surplusage canon. Even if the three actions are functional analogues, that does not mean the actions are entirely identical. The Act might reasonably specify similar actions in Section 641a(h), and then-in a different section of the Act-use the umbrella term \"reductions\" to cover all three actions for purposes of appeal and hearing rights, just as Section 641a(h) identifies all three actions under the title \"reductions.\" In other words, treating all three actions as \"reductions\" within the meaning of Section 646 does not make surplusage of the terms\n   \"recapture\" and \"withhold\" within Section 641a(h).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Further examining the Head Start Act's context, the detailed procedures for dealing with under-enrollment under Section 641a(h) do not bar the Act from also contemplating an appeal and hearing under Section 646 in cases of under-enrollment. Struggling Head Start programs have the opportunity to go through a lengthy remediation process-with extensive notice and interaction with HHS-before being designated as chronically under-enrolled and losing funding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9836a(h)(3), (4), (5).

As a result, Sections 641a(h) and 646 do not conflict, and both can be given their full effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This is especially true because the designation procedures are not automatic; thus, contrary to HHS's arguments that the procedures leave nothing to appeal, the procedures are consistent with appeals on various grounds. If a program's remediation plan fails, HHS \"may\"-not \"shall\"-designate the program as chronically under-enrolled and reduce funding. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9836a(h)(5)(A). \"The word 'may' customarily connotes discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Jama v.

Also, the Act provides that HHS may exercise discretion to waive or limit reductions in certain circumstances, which is also consistent with appeal rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5884234\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/335/#p346\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9836a(h)(5)(B) (\"The Secretary may, as appropriate, waive or reduce the percentage recapturing, withholding, or reduction otherwise required by [Section 641a(h)(5)(A) ], if, after the implementation of the [remediation plan], the Secretary finds that [certain circumstances exist].\"). This discretion means that the Act's chronic under-enrollment procedures are not so highly prescribed as to leave nothing to appeal. And, even if limited discretion were involved, the Act could reasonably provide an appeal to ensure that a \"second set of eyes\" reviews the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In sum, the context of the Head Start Act does not rebut the presumption of consistent usage. Rather, the context confirms that a funding adjustment for chronic under-enrollment under Section 641a(h) is clearly a reduction that merits an appeal and a hearing under Section 646. The Head Start Act thus \" 'unambiguously foreclose[s] the agency's statutory interpretation' ... by prescribing a precise course of conduct other than the one chosen by the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Vill. of Barrington v.

Under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   Step One, \" '[t]hat is the end of the matter,\" so the Court does not address whether HHS's interpretations are sufficiently reasonable to merit deference under Step Two.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 661.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Given that the Head Start Act requires the opportunity for an appeal and a hearing in this case, it is clear that HHS has not met this requirement. HHS has promulgated regulations that prescribe appeal and hearing procedures for certain\n   actions that reduce funding, but the regulations do not apply to reductions based on chronic under-enrollment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201304.1\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1304.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and HHS has not used less formal measures to establish appeal and hearing procedures for reductions based on chronic under-enrollment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In addition, HHS did not provide for an individualized appeal and hearing before adjusting funding in the Navajo Nation's particular case. HHS suggests briefly that its interactions with the Nation\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   in fact constitute the appeal and hearing required by Section 646(a)(3).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Unedited Hr'g Tr. at 19, 32. It is true that, in the letter reducing the Nation's funding, HHS added: \"If there are significant causes of underenrollment that [HHS] was not made aware of over the 12 month period, please inform your regional office within 30 days of the delivery of this notice.\" Dkt. 11-2 at 16. In response to this invitation, the Nation submitted a letter regarding its program's enrollment challenges,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11-2 at 18, but HHS ultimately decided against changing the reduction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11-2 at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Without the benefit of briefing on this issue, the Court does not express a comprehensive view on the full meaning of an \"appeal\" and \"hearing\" in Section 646(a)(3), but it is clear that these HHS actions do not qualify. The reduction letter did not clearly convey appeal rights: it did not use the word \"appeal,\" nor did the letter state that additional information could change HHS's initial decision. And to the extent that the reduction letter\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   suggest that HHS might reconsider its initial decision, that reconsideration would not be a general appeal; instead, it would be limited to \"significant causes of underenrollment\" of which HHS was previously unaware. Also, even if the letter did provide for an appeal, it made no mention of a hearing. Finally, it appears from the record before the Court that the same HHS official-the OHS Acting Director-reduced the Nation's funding and later decided against changing that reduction based on the Nation's enrollment challenges.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11-2 at 16 (reduction letter signed by OHS Acting Director Ann Linehan),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11-2 at 26 (letter deciding against changing the reduction, also signed by OHS Acting Director Ann Linehan). It would be an odd \"appeal\" that asks the initial decision-maker to also sit as the appellate body reviewing the initial decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, HHS's actions to date have not provided the appeal and hearing rights required by Section 646(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant the relief requested by the Navajo Nation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 16 at 7; Dkt. 16-1 at 1; Dkt. 20 at 4. In particular, the Court will (1) declare that HHS's reduction of the Navajo Nation's Head Start funding for fiscal year 2018 was not in accordance with the requirements of Section 646(a)(3) of the Head Start Act; (2) set aside the reduction of the funding; and (3) declare that HHS cannot reduce the Navajo Nation's Head Start funding under the Grant unless and until the Navajo Nation is afforded the notice, appeal, and hearing rights to which it is entitled under Section 646(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court takes no position on the manner in which HHS must afford the Navajo Nation its rights under Section\n   646(a)(3). The parties debate whether Section 646(a)(3) requires HHS to \"prescribe [the appeal and hearing] procedures\" via notice-and-comment rulemaking, via less formal processes, or via an\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   procedure specific to the Navajo Nation. Regardless, \"it is the prerogative of the agency to decide in the first instance how best to provide relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

Cir. 2013). \"Only in rare cases ... does the court direct the agency how to resolve a problem,\" and the Nation does not request that the Court do so here, so the Court takes no position on the manner in which HHS must afford the Nation its rights under Section 646(a)(3).\n   <em>\n    Allina Health Servs. v.

Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, the Court declines the Navajo Nation's request that the Court retain jurisdiction over this dispute. \"When a district court reverses agency action and determines that the agency acted unlawfully, ordinarily the appropriate course is simply to identify a legal error and then remand to the agency, because the role of the district court in such situations is to act as an appellate tribunal.\"\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869656,3661386\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/582/\">\n    703 F.3d at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court sees no reason to depart from the ordinary course, nor does the Court have any reason to think that HHS will not proceed in accordance with this opinion. Therefore, the Court will not retain jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment, Dkt. 17, is denied, and Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. 16, is granted.
