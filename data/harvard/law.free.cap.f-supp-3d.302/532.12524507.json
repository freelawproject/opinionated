Grynberg and Grynberg Petroleum Company (together, \"Grynberg\"). Grynberg seeks documents collected by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (\"USAO\") in connection with its investigation and prosecution of James Giffen. The Government claims that these documents are exempt from production. For the reasons that follow, the Government's motion for summary judgment is granted and this action is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Grynberg's litigation exploits verge on the legendary. Over the past fifteen years, Grynberg and entities he controls have filed hundreds of lawsuits seeking to recover a 20% stake in a major oil field located in the Caspian Sea near Kazakhstan.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Grynberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270736\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/197/#p199\">\n    223 F.Supp.3d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 199 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (application to conduct discovery for use in a Swiss proceeding);\n   <em>\n    Grynberg v.

In November 2010, Giffen pled guilty to a single misdemeanor count of willfully failing to supply information regarding foreign bank accounts on his tax returns. (Judgment in a Criminal Case, No. 3-cr-404, ECF No. 214.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In May 2013, Grynberg submitted a FOIA request to the Department of Justice seeking all of the USAO's files related\n   to the Giffen prosecution in this District. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Tricia Francis, ECF No. 48 (\"Francis Decl.\") Ex. A.) That request was denied. (Francis Decl. Ex. C) In August 2013, Grynberg made a second request, narrowing the scope to: (1) public records; (2) corporate records; and (3) bank records. (Francis Decl. Ex. G.) In October 2013, the USAO conducted a preliminary search and concluded that it had no responsive documents. (Francis Decl. Ex. K.) Grynberg appealed, and the Office of Information Policy remanded his FOIA request back to the USAO for an additional search. (Francis Decl. Exs. N, O.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While that review on remand was underway, in September 2015, Grynberg further cabined his request to: (1) bank records; (2) records from British Petroleum (\"BP\"), and (3) court transcripts. (Francis Decl. Ex. R.) Between December 2015 and November 2016, the USAO searched intermittently for responsive documents. (Francis Decl. \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In October 2016, Grynberg filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, alleging that the Government was wrongfully withholding the requested documents. (Compl. \u00b6 20). The Colorado District Judge ordered an initial review and production of certain documents, and thereafter granted the parties' request to transfer the case to this Court. (Order, ECF No. 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Subsequently, the Government conducted a broad review of approximately 230 bankers' boxes containing documents collected during the Giffen prosecution. (Francis Decl. \u00b6 44.) Documents not identified as exempt under FOIA on an initial review were scanned and logged into a 300-page index. (Francis Decl. \u00b6 45.) Later, on closer examination, the Government determined that the majority of the logged documents were exempt. (Francis Decl. \u00b6 46-47.) It therefore withheld all documents except publicly available records. (Francis Decl. Exs.

Grynberg's motion papers make clear that he seeks only bank records and records from BP. The Government asserts that this limited request was not clearly established and that it assumed Grynberg continued to press his request for the entire Giffen file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[N]o statute requires a court to allow FOIA modifications during the course of litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Serv.

(Compl. at 4.) But Grynberg modified his request during the administrative stage of the FOIA process prior to filing this lawsuit. (Francis Decl. Ex. R.).

In that case, the FOIA requester only narrowed the FOIA request when confronted with a motion for summary judgment. Since September 2015, Grynberg has maintained the same circumscribed request. Accordingly, this FOIA action addresses only Grynberg's requests for bank records and records from BP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Grand Jury Materials\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Initially, the Government invoked five exemptions to what it considered to be Grynberg's request for all Giffen-related documents.

The Government avers that producing records subpoenaed by the grand jury would \"publicly reveal the scope and secret aspects of the grand jury investigation by showing where the Government sought its evidence, the sources of information it had relied on to develop the facts of its investigation, and the steps that the Government anticipated taking and actually took in furtherance of the investigation.\" (Francis Decl. \u00b6 54.) Grynberg fails to rebut this proposition. In the context of this criminal investigation, the Government's possession of these records establishes a strong likelihood that they were produced pursuant to a grand jury subpoena. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 17:13-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   According to the Government, the documents are readily identifiable as responsive to grand jury subpoenas based on their Bates numbers.

Turning to whether the MLAT also qualified as a withholding statute within Exemption 3's parameters, the court found that it fell within the exemption's final clause because it \" 'refer[red] to particular types of matters to be withheld,' namely, requests for assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Dongkuk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20F.%20Supp.%203d%2018\">\n    204 F.Supp.3d at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) ). In other words, the MLAT limited what was to be kept confidential: \"a request and its contents if such confidentiality is requested by the Central Authority of the Requesting State.\"\n   <em>\n    Dongkuk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20F.%20Supp.%203d%2018\">\n    204 F.Supp.3d at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This was specific enough to qualify as a \"particular type of matter\" for Exemption 3.\n   <em>\n    Dongkuk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20F.%20Supp.%203d%2018\">\n    204 F.Supp.3d at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This conclusion was reinforced by the fact that Congress specifically ratified the U.S.-Korea MLAT with the understanding that it required the \"United States to use its 'best efforts' to maintain confidentiality.\"\n   <em>\n    Dongkuk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20F.%20Supp.%203d%2018\">\n    204 F.Supp.3d at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Dongkuk\n   </em>\n   is persuasive. Like the U.S.-Korea MLAT, the U.S.-Swiss MLAT is a Senate-ratified self-executing treaty. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MLAT, art. 41 (\"The Treaty shall enter into force 180 days after the date of the exchange of the instruments of ratification.\").) It therefore has the force of law and qualifies as a statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitney v. Robertson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3524633\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/124/190/#p194\">\n    124 U.S. 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 194,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3524633\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/124/190/#p194\">\n    8 S.Ct. 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3524633\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/124/190/#p194\">\n    31 L.Ed. 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1888) (\"[A] treaty is placed on the same footing, and made of like obligation with an act of legislation.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Also like the MLAT analyzed in\n   <em>\n    Dongkuk\n   </em>\n   , the U.S.-Swiss MLAT establishes a particular type of matter to be withheld. Article 10 requires Switzerland to produce \"evidence or information which would disclose facts which a bank is required to keep secret or are manufacturing or business secrets\" if the United States's request concerns a prosecution of a serious offense, the disclosure would provide significant facts in that proceeding, and the United States already made reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to obtain the same evidence. (MLAT, art. 10, \u00b6 2.) Article 15 provides that evidence disclosed pursuant to Article 10 \"shall, if\n   <em>\n    in the opinion of that state its importance so requires and an application\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    to that effect is made\n   </em>\n   , be kept from public disclosure to the fullest extent compatible with constitutional requirements in the requesting state.\" (MLAT, art. 15 (emphasis added).) Article 5, which provides that any documents obtained pursuant to the MLAT \"shall not be used for investigative purposes nor be introduced into evidence ... in any proceeding relating to an offense other than the offense for which assistance has been granted\" is also relevant. (MLAT, art. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Like the MLAT in\n   <em>\n    Dongkuk\n   </em>\n   , this MLAT's description of what is to be withheld is limited to a particular type of matter narrow enough for Exemption 3: documents provided under Article 10, when accompanied with \"an application\" requesting the documents be kept private.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The only remaining question is whether the Giffen materials were produced pursuant to this language. A Department of Justice attorney responsible for processing Swiss MLAT requests asserts that \"it is understood that all of the articles contained in the U.S.-Swiss MLAT, even if not specifically invoked, apply to all evidence and information provided by either country.\" (Ford Decl. \u00b6 8.) This understanding is entitled to deference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sumitomo Shoji Am. v. Avagliano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186995\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/176/#p184\">\n    457 U.S. 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184-85,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186995\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/176/#p184\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186995\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/176/#p184\">\n    72 L.Ed.2d 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982). Further, the documents obtained in this case were bank records, meaning they were subject to both Article 5 and Article 10, paragraph 2. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ford Decl. \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, and most importantly, the Government determined that all MLAT materials obtained in the Giffen prosecution contained cover letters \"includ[ing] the standard language used when the Swiss Federal Office of Justice transmits evidence to the United States pursuant to the [MLAT].\" (Hodge Decl. \u00b6 21.) This language states that the materials are \"provided for by art. 5 of the [MLAT]\" and that \"any public disclosure ... including disclosure pursuant to Freedom of Information Act requests ... would violate the laws applicable to [the Swiss authorities].\" (Ford Decl. \u00b6 7.) While Grynberg challenges the Government's failure to produce these cover letters to substantiate this representation, his \"purely speculative claims\" are not enough to supersede the \"presumption of good faith.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grand Cent. P'ship, Inc. v. Cuomo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397107\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/473/#p488\">\n    166 F.3d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488-89 (2d Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Switzerland produced these documents pursuant to the MLAT's confidentiality provisions, with an understanding that they would not be used in other proceedings or produced in response to FOIA requests. It also included an application requesting they be kept private, as shown through the cover letters. And \"the emphasis on maintaining confidentiality of assistance requests\" seen throughout the U.S.-Swiss MLAT makes this Court \"doubt that Congress intended for [these documents] to be available under FOIA.\"\n   <em>\n    Dongkuk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20F.%20Supp.%203d%2018\">\n    204 F.Supp.3d at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Government's motion for summary judgment dismissing this FOIA action is granted.
