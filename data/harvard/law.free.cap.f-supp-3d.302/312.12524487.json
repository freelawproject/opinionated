According to Sevier, display of the flag violates the Establishment Clause, discourages him from lobbying Congress, and violates his rights to equal protection and substantive due process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-32 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 65-91). Sevier has made similar claims in, by his count, \"more than [fifteen]\" other lawsuits. Dkt. 25 at 3. In addition, Sevier asks that the Court \"declare that the holdings in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Windsor\n   </em>\n   , ... and\n   <em>\n    Obergefell v. Hodges\n   </em>\n   , ... are intellectually dishonest and amount to acts of judicial tyranny and judicial malpractice.\" Dkt. 1 at 36 (Compl. Prayer for Relief).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Currently pending before the Court are Defendants' motion to dismiss, Dkt. 8, Sevier's motion for leave to amend his complaint, Dkt. 25, a motion to intervene, Dkt. 5, and numerous other motions. For the reasons explained below, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss, will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the motion to amend, will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the motion to intervene, and will dispose of the remaining motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sevier's complaint consists largely of his views regarding homosexuality and criticisms of the Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   decision.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 1 at 3, 6, 10-28 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, 14, 19, 21, 23-31, 33, 35-45, 51-52, 56-58, 62-64). It also recounts Sevier's efforts to \"put[ ] [\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   ] to the test\" by marrying inanimate objects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (Compl. \u00b6 12);\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49-54). The present action appears to focus, however, on the following allegations: Defendants, who are four members of the U.S. House of Representatives, have allegedly \"authorized and installed [one or more] Gay Pride Rainbow Colored Flag[s]\" in the hallways outside their offices,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-11 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-19), which Sevier \"frequently encounter[s],\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (Compl. \u00b6 12). Given Sevier's \"religious worldview\" that \"homosexuality is obscene, immoral, [and] subversive to human flourishing,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6, 11-12 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 21), he \"[i]s offended by [the flags'] presence,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5, 23 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 55). The flags, he says, make him \"feel[ ] unwelcome[ ],\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (Compl. \u00b6 12), because he does not \"adhere to [Defendants'] particular\n   religious orthodoxy,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (Compl. \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The \"religious ideology\" that Sevier has in mind is homosexuality itself.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (Compl. \u00b6 32) (\"[H]omosexuality is a religion ....\"). He contends that \"the [h]omosexual church\" is \"the largest denomination\" of \"the overall church of 'western expressive individualism postmodern moral relativism,' \"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3, 28, 29 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 69, 74), which posits that \"nobody's version of morality as a basis of law matters except for the private moral code that [the adherent] personally advocat[es],\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (Compl. \u00b6 22). In Sevier's view, then, the gay pride flag \"is a 'religious symbol' for the homosexual denomination,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3 (Compl. \u00b6 4), and its \"placement ... amounts to [Defendants'] endorsement of a particular religion,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28 (Compl. \u00b6 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The public display of these flags, moreover, allegedly \"treats different sects within the church of moral relativism with different degrees of favorability.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25 (Compl. \u00b6 59). Sevier says he belongs to \"a less popular sect\" of the church of moral relativism,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 59), which he calls the \"machinist sect[ ],\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29 (Compl. \u00b6 72). As a \"machinist,\" Sevier's \"sex-based self-asserted identity narrative is that he prefers to be married to an inanimate object.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 (Compl. \u00b6 49). So, according to Sevier, unless Defendants \"install a flag that represents people who self-identify as polygamists, machinists, zoophiles, and heterosexuals,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21 (Compl. \u00b6 47), their actions \"treat ... the homosexual denomination of ... the church of moral relativism with disproportionate favor,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29 (Compl. \u00b6 72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Based on these allegations, Sevier alleges violations of the Establishment, Equal Protection, and Due Process clauses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-32 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 65-91). He seeks an injunction requiring that Defendants remove the flags, or, in the alternative, \"fly the [f]lags that represent the people in the zoophile, polygamy, and machinism sects [of] the overall church of moral relativism.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36 (Compl. Prayer for Relief). He also seeks declaratory judgments that (1) Defendants' display of the flags \"is unconstitutional;\" (2) that\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Windsor\n   </em>\n   are \"intellectually dishonest ... acts of judicial tyranny and judicial malpractice;\" and (3) that \"homosexuality is a 'religion' ... [that the] government cannot legally recognize.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Compl. Prayer for Relief).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sevier's initial lawsuit was filed on March 23, 2017, Dkt. 1, and on August 9, 2017, he filed a motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 4. On August 15, 2017, John Gunter Jr., Whitney Kohl, and Joan Grace Harley-\"three self-identified polygamists\" who appear to be coordinating with Sevier in this and other cases-moved to intervene as of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2), or alternatively, to intervene permissively under Rule 24(b)(1)(B). Dkt. 5 at 8. Gunter, Kohl, and Harley allege Equal Protection, Due Process, and Establishment Clause claims that are similar in form to those advanced by Sevier, although their allegations of injury focus even more on their opposition to gay marriage generally and their \"feel[ing] deeply offended\" by \"[t]he Defendants['] display of the gay pride flag for self-serving political reasons.\" Dkt. 5 at 8-10, 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 22, 2017, Defendants-four members of the House of Representatives who have displayed the flags outside their offices-moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) on the grounds that Sevier lacks standing and that the case presents a nonjusticiable political question; under Rule 12(b)(5) for insufficient service of process; and under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8. They ask also that the Court treat their motion to dismiss as an opposition to the motion to intervene and Sevier's\n   motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 n.2. Because Defendants' motion raises a number of threshold issues, the Court denied Sevier's motion for summary judgment as premature, Minute Order (Sept. 24, 2017), and ordered him to respond to Defendants' motion to dismiss, Dkt. 9. Instead, he filed two \"affidavits\" in support of his complaint. Dkt. 10; Dkt. 11. Then, on October 2, 2017, he moved to stay these proceedings pending the resolution of his motion to intervene in\n   <em>\n    Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-111, a case currently before the Supreme Court. Dkt. 12. The Court denied that motion, Minute Order (Oct. 4, 2017), and Sevier continued to file affidavits in support of his complaint, Dkt. 15; Dkt. 16; Dkt. 17; Dkt. 18; Dkt. 19. On October 7, 2017, Sevier filed a \"motion for the court to make an expedited ruling on the intervention motion.\" Dkt. 20 at 1. Although not styled as such, this document responds to the arguments made in Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 4, 2017, Sevier moved to amend his complaint, elaborating on his earlier objections to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   and incorporating additional arguments in response to the motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 25; Dkt. 26. Sevier filed this document-he refers to it as a combined motion to amend, statement in support of the motion to intervene, and response to the motion to dismiss-twice, but with different exhibits attached.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 25,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26. Defendants, in turn, filed a reply to the portion of the document opposing the motion to dismiss, Dkt. 27, and a response to the portion seeking to amend the complaint, Dkt. 28. Sevier then sought leave to file an overlength reply in support of his motion to amend, Dkt. 30, and an overlength surreply to the motion to dismiss,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 32, in addition to filing shorter versions of both, Dkt. 30-2; Dkt. 32-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Since the conclusion of briefing on the motion to dismiss and motion to amend, two of the proposed intervenors filed motions for summary judgment, Dkt. 34; Dkt. 47, one of which is \"essentially the same document\" as Sevier's proposed surreply, Dkt. 32 at 2. Sevier has continued to file additional \"affidavits\" or \"notices\" not clearly relevant to any of the pending motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29; Dkt. 35; Dkt. 37; Dkt. 38; Dkt. 42; Dkt. 43; Dkt. 44; Dkt. 45; Dkt. 50. He has also moved for a scheduling conference, Dkt. 36, to strike a filing that the Clerk of the Court identified as having been entered in error, Dkt. 40, and to supplement his earlier pleadings with filings he or the proposed intervenors have made in other cases, Dkt. 41; Dkt. 46. Finally, the National Alliance of Black Pastors, Dkt. 48, and the Coalition of Doctors Defending Reparative Therapy, Dkt. 49, have sought leave to file amicus briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss, Dkt. 8;\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the motion to intervene, Dkt. 5;\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the motion to amend the complaint, Dkt. 25;\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   the motion for leave to file an overlength reply in support of the motion to amend the complaint, Dkt. 30;\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the motion for leave to file an overlength surreply to the motion to dismiss, Dkt. 32;\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the motions for summary judgment filed by proposed intervenors, Dkt. 34; Dkt. 47,\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the motion for a scheduling conference, Dkt. 36;\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the motion to strike, Dkt. 40;\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the motions to supplement, Dkt. 41; Dkt. 46; and\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   the motions for leave to file amicus briefs, Dkt. 48; Dkt. 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Nor has Sevier alleged that participants in the gay rights movement consider it \"religious\" or, indeed, that there are any self-identified adherents to the \"religion\" he posits.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22940\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/760/447/#p449\">\n    760 F.2d at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (refusing \"to recognize as a 'religion' what the religion's alleged adherents have not identified as such\"). That Sevier's\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   beliefs may derive from his religion does not transform any contrary view of the subject into religious expression.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Altman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11112965\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/245/49/#p79\">\n    245 F.3d at 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he Establishment Clause is not transgressed merely because a statement either is in agreement with, or is in disagreement with, a given religious tenet.\"). Sevier does make passing reference to \"secular humanism,\" \"moral relativism,\" \"individualism,\" and other concepts that could conceivably constitute a set of religious beliefs for the purposes of an Establishment Clause claim. He has not, however, alleged any plausible link between those more general moral philosophies and the \"Gay Pride Rainbow Colored Flags\" he argues have actually caused his injury, leaving his claims untethered from anything resembling a religion for Establishment Clause purposes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 1 at 28 (Compl. \u00b6 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In short, Sevier's argument proves way too much. If the mere acceptance of homosexuality-or support for gay rights-constitutes a \"religion\" for Establishment Clause purposes, then the same conclusion would presumably follow for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   value judgment about how people should or should not live their lives.

Even without passing on Sevier's right to human-laptop marriage, it is safe to say that government activities that remind Sevier of his alleged constitutional injury do not create new constitutional injuries in their own right. These claims, accordingly, will be dismissed for lack of standing. Finally, this Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain Sevier's request for a declaratory judgment that\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Windsor\n   </em>\n   amount to \"acts of judicial tyranny.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20Seton%20Hall%20Const.%20L.J.%2023\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20Seton%20Hall%20Const.%20L.J.%2023\">\n    at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Compl.

The latter allegations, as noted above, are unrelated to any particular injury identified by Gunter, Kohl, and Harley, and thus fail to establish standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The strongest case for standing rests on Gunter's single, unsupported statement that \"[h]e is a D.C. lobbyist,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22, and the proposed intervenors' suggestion\n   that they do not \"feel welcomed or comfortable walking the halls of the legislative buildings with the gay pride rainbow colored flags on display,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. These assertions are less detailed than those made by Sevier, whose argument for standing at least alleged personal contact with the flags in question. The lack of any further detail regarding interactions with the flags at issue, or past lobbying or legislative efforts, combined with the proposed intervenors stating that they live in Utah, not Washington, D.C.,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, leaves the Court without any basis to conclude that they have alleged facts sufficient to establish standing to sue. Moreover, unlike Sevier, their motion places its heaviest emphasis on grievances that are substantially more generalized, including opposition to homosexuality, gay rights, and-again-the\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   decision. Taken together, the Court concludes that Gunter, Kohl, and Harley have failed to establish that they possess Article III standing to challenge the display of the flags displayed by Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Even if the proposed intervenors did have standing, however, the Court would still deny them leave to intervene. Gunter, Kohl, and Harley have advanced the same legal theories and arguments as Sevier, down to-frequently-the very wording of their motion to intervene and subsequent motions for summary judgment. In light of this congruence, the Court concludes that the proposed intervenors have failed to identify any way in which Sevier fails to represent their interests in this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bldg. &amp; Const.

Sevier's interpretation of the Court's Minute Order (Sept. 24, 2017), is incorrect. \"While the Court has the authority to extend both the time period for filing an opposition to a motion and the 21-day time period for filing an amended complaint as a matter of course under Rule 15, the simple fact that the Court granted an extension of the former time period does not automatically effect an extension of the latter and fuse these two separate deadlines into one, as plaintiff contends.\"\n   <em>\n    Hayes v.

The Court, accordingly, holds that its September 24, 2017 order did not extend Sevier's time to amend his complaint and will deny his \"motion\" under Rule 15(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Sevier has moved, in the alternative, to amend his complaint with leave of the Court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Sevier's amended complaint, however, does nothing to cure the deficiencies in his original pleadings. Because the proposed amendment is therefore futile, the Court will deny Sevier leave to file the amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Willoughby v. Potomac Elec.

Dkt. 30. Defendants have not opposed that request, and the Court, accordingly, will grant it. Sevier also seeks leave to \"file a reply to the Defendants' reply\" to his opposition to the motion to dismiss, preferably at a length beyond that specified in Local Rule 7(e). Dkt. 32 at 1. \"[S]urreplies are generally disfavored, and the determination as to whether to grant or deny leave is entrusted to the sound discretion of the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Banner Health v.

Here, the proposed surreply merely repeats earlier arguments and discusses the proposed intervenor's motion for summary judgment, which at the time of the motion had not yet been filed.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 32 (filed November 23, 2017),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 34 (filed November 28, 2017).

He requests oral argument on his motion for summary judgment and requests, in the alternative, that the Court set a schedule for discovery. Because the Court concludes that oral argument is unnecessary and that the case should be dismissed, it will deny that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Strike\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Sevier has also moved to strike from the docket a document that the Clerk of the Court found to have been entered in error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 40; Dkt. 39; Notice of Error (Dec. 28, 2017). Because the filing was already deemed to have been entered in error and removed from the docket, nothing remains to strike. The Court will therefore deny the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Supplement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Sevier has moved to supplement many of his earlier filings with documents either he or the proposed intervenors have filed in other cases. Beyond reiterating arguments already made, these filings add nothing material to the Court's consideration of the pending motions. Under Rule 15(d), the Court retains discretion over when and whether to permit supplementation of earlier pleadings, but declines to do so in the present case given that the filings are duplicative of those already contained in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   7.\n   <em>\n    Motion for Leave to File Amicus Brief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The National Alliance of Black Pastors, Dkt. 48, and Coalition of Doctors Defending Reparative Therapy, Dkt. 49, have both moved for leave to file amicus briefs.
