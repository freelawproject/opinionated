Mehta, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The now infamous \"Trump Dossier\" is a collection of memoranda prepared by former British intelligence operative Christopher Steele during the 2016 presidential election concerning then-candidate Donald J. Trump. As has been reported extensively in the media, the 35-page Dossier contains, among other things, allegations that the government of Russia possesses compromising personal and financial information about President Trump.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Though the Dossier and its contents animate this case, the case's actual subject matter concerns a related document-a two-page synopsis of the Dossier (the \"Synopsis\") that certain executive branch officials presented to President-elect Trump in January 2017. After media reports surfaced that President-elect Trump had received the Synopsis, Plaintiffs James Madison Project and Josh Gerstein filed a Freedom of Information Act request with various executive branch agencies seeking a copy of the Synopsis, as well as any documents related to any \"final determinations\" reached by those agencies regarding the factual accuracy of the allegations in the Synopsis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Not surprisingly, none of the agencies made any meaningful disclosures. Three agencies-the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (\"ODNI\"), the Central Intelligence Agency (\"CIA\"), and the National Security Agency (\"NSA\")-acknowledged that they possess the Synopsis, but refused to produce it. Additionally, these agencies declined to confirm or deny whether they have any \"final determinations\" regarding the allegations contained in the Synopsis or related investigative files-an answer known as a \"\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response.\" Another agency-the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\")-took a slightly different approach: It issued a blanket\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response to the entirety of Plaintiffs' request. That is, the FBI refused to confirm or deny that it has any of the requested records. Plaintiffs contend that these\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   responses are improper because President Trump and two past executive branch officials-former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former Director of the FBI James Comey-have publicly acknowledged, through tweets and other statements, the existence of the Synopsis and related records. The agencies stand by their\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before the court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. For the reasons set forth below, the court holds that none of the President's statements, whether made by tweet or otherwise, constitute the type of official acknowledgement of the existence of the requested records that is necessary to overcome the agencies'\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   responses. The same holds true for the statements of the former executive branch officials. Finally, the court finds that ODNI, CIA, and NSA properly withheld the Synopsis, and that neither President Trump nor former FBI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Director Comey has officially disclosed its contents. Accordingly, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is granted and Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    1. The Synopsis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following the 2016 presidential general election, President Barack Obama assigned Director of National Intelligence James Clapper the task of preparing an intelligence report addressing the activities of the Russian government in connection with the election. Director Clapper delegated this task to the National Intelligence Council (\"NIC\"), a component of ODNI comprised of senior analysts and national security policy experts. The NIC coordinated with and drew intelligence from the CIA, the NSA, and the FBI to draft a classified analytical assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 6, 2017, ODNI released to the public a declassified version of that assessment, entitled \"Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 14 [hereinafter Defs.' Mot.], Ex. E, ECF No. 14-7. The declassified assessment covers \"the motivation and scope of Moscow's intentions regarding US elections and Moscow's use of cyber tools and media campaigns to influence US public opinion.\" Defs.' Mot., Ex. E, ECF No. 14-7, at i.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At about the same time, intelligence officials shared a classified version of the assessment with President-elect Trump. On January 11, 2017, CNN reported that senior intelligence officials appended to the classified assessment a two-page synopsis of the allegations contained in the Dossier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot., Ex. G, ECF No. 14-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    2. Plaintiffs' FOIA Request\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff James Madison Project is a non-partisan organization established to promote government accountability and the reduction of secrecy on issues relating to intelligence and national security. Am. Compl., ECF No. 7 [hereinafter Am. Compl.], \u00b6 3. Plaintiff Josh Gerstein is the senior White House reporter for Politico and a news media representative. Am. Compl. \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Referring to the above-cited CNN report for context, Plaintiffs submitted a Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request by letters dated January 11, 2017, to ODNI, CIA, FBI, and NSA seeking production of the Synopsis and any documents or investigative files related to any final determinations reached regarding the factual accuracy of the allegations contained in the Synopsis. Noting the considerable public interest in shedding light on the degree to which any federal intelligence or law enforcement agency viewed the allegations contained in the Dossier as credible, Plaintiffs specifically requested Defendants produce the following records:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (1) The two-page \"synopsis\" provided by the U.S. Government to President-Elect Trump with respect to allegations that Russian Government operatives had compromising personal and financial information about President-Elect Trump (\"Item One\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (2) Final determinations regarding the accuracy (or lack thereof) of any of the individual factual claims listed in the two page synopsis (\"Item Two\"); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (3) Investigative files relied upon in reaching the final determinations referenced in [Item Two] (\"Item Three\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

At the time of the filing of this action, none of the agencies had provided a substantive response to\n   Plaintiffs' FOIA demand. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32, 35, 38, 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On January 23, 2017, Plaintiffs brought this action under FOIA, naming as Defendants the Department of Justice, as the parent agency of the FBI; the Department of Defense, as the parent agency of the NSA; the CIA; and the ODNI (collectively, \"Defendants\"). Compl., ECF No. 1. Before Defendants filed a responsive pleading, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on February 13, 2017. Am. Compl. Their suit seeks an order compelling Defendants to produce the requested records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants now move for summary judgment, although they part ways in their approaches. The FBI relies on a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response to all three items of Plaintiffs' request, thereby refusing to confirm or deny the existence of any responsive records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Citing FOIA Exemption 7(A),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(A), the FBI contends that merely acknowledging the existence or non-existence of responsive records in the FBI's files would \"require the FBI to confirm or deny whether it has and is investigating the alleged 'dossier' and synopsis, either in a separate investigation or as part of its Russian interference investigation,\" which itself could hamper and interfere with any such investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl. The FBI therefore asserts a blanket\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The remaining Defendants-ODNI, CIA, and NSA (the \"Intelligence Community Defendants\")-also invoke\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   responses, but their response departs from the FBI's in one important respect: They confirm that they have identified a two-page document responsive to Item One of the Plaintiffs' FOIA request. They contend, however, that the document must be withheld in full pursuant to FOIA Exemption 1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), and Exemption 3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot., Ex. B, ECF No. 14-4 [hereinafter Gistaro Decl.].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As for Items Two and Three, like the FBI, the Intelligence Community Defendants invoke FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3 to justify their\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   responses. In their view, the mere act of confirming whether they even have such records would reveal a classified fact-whether the Intelligence Community has verified or attempted to verify the truth of the Dossier's allegations. Gistaro Decl. at 8-10. Specifically, the Intelligence Community Defendants assert that confirming or denying the existence of responsive records as to Items Two and Three would \"reveal that the two-page synopsis played some role in the [Intelligence Community's] conclusions [in the classified analytical assessment], which would, in turn, be revealing of the analytic process employed for this intelligence assessment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So, although the Intelligence Community Defendants concede they have the Synopsis, they refuse to admit the existence of any other responsive records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs oppose Defendants' Motion largely on one ground.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp. to Defs.' Mot., ECF No. 17; Pls.' Cross-Mot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   for Partial Summ. J., ECF No. 18 [hereinafter Pls.' Cross-Mot.]. Plaintiffs do not challenge Defendants' invocation of any of the FOIA Exemptions upon which their\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   responses are predicated. Stated differently, they do not contest that the fact of the existence or non-existence of the requested records is subject to FOIA Exemptions 1, 3, and 7(A). Rather, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants'\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   responses are vitiated because President Trump has officially acknowledged the existence of the records Plaintiffs seek in his tweets and other public statements. So, too, have two past executive branch officials, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former Director of the FBI James Comey. Plaintiffs also assert that official public disclosures of some of the specific information contained in the Synopsis create a genuine issue of material fact that precludes granting summary judgment in favor of the Intelligence Community Defendants as to their withholding of the Synopsis itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Most FOIA cases are appropriately decided on motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Brayton v.

Cir. 2011). Summary judgment is appropriate when the record shows \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The agency can carry its burden on summary judgment if it submits affidavits or declarations that \"describe the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail, demonstrate that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and are not controverted by either contrary evidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Larson v.

Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Ultimately, an agency's justification for invoking a FOIA exemption is sufficient if it appears 'logical' or 'plausible.' \"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

First, what is the applicable legal standard to determine whether the existence of the Synopsis, \"final determinations,\" and related records have been \"officially acknowledged?\" Second, what weight, if any, should the court give to the public statements of\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   executive branch officials who have commented on the Dossier and Synopsis since leaving their government posts? The court addresses each of these questions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A. \"Official Acknowledgment\" in the\n    <em>\n     Glomar\n    </em>\n    Context\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The court starts with the basics. A\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response is \"an exception to the general rule that agencies must acknowledge the existence of information responsive to a FOIA request and provide specific, non-conclusory justifications for withholding that information.\"\n   <em>\n    Roth v. U.S. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383192,3555731\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/1161/\">\n    642 F.3d 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1178 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Thus, a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response is allowable only \"when confirming or denying the existence of records would itself 'cause harm cognizable under an FOIA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   exception.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383192,3555731\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/1161/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383192,3555731\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/1161/\">\n    at 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wolf v.

In other words, a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response is appropriate when revealing the very fact that an agency possesses responsive records would itself be subject to a FOIA exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A dissatisfied requester may challenge a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response in \"two distinct but related ways.\"\n   <em>\n    Agility Pub.

First, a requester can challenge the agency's assertion that confirming or denying the existence of records would cause harm under the FOIA exception invoked by the agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363453\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/313/#p326\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, a requester can demonstrate that the agency has previously \"official acknowledged\" the fact of the existence of a requested record.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363453\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/313/#p326\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If the requester take the second approach and shows that the agency has \"officially acknowledged\" that it possesses records responsive to the FOIA request, \"the agency can no longer use a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response\" and therefore must either \"(1) disclose the record to the requester or (2) establish that its contents are exempt from disclosure and that such exemption has not been waived.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

They do not contest the agencies' reliance on Exemptions 1, 3, and 7(A) as the grounds for those responses.

As the court explained in\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   : \"In the\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   context ... if the prior disclosure establishes the\n   <em>\n    existence\n   </em>\n   (or not) of records responsive to the FOIA request, the prior disclosure necessarily matches both the information at issue-the existence of records-and the specific request for that information.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n    473 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   378-79 (citing\n   <em>\n    Fitzgibbon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5676379,10537511\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/911/755/\">\n    911 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   765-66 ).

As support for their position, Plaintiffs point to the court's holding that the CIA's refusal to confirm the existence of records concerning drone strikes was \"neither logical nor plausible\" in light of public statements made by President Obama, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism John Brennan, and CIA Director Leon Panetta.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

They urge the court to apply the \"logical nor plausible\" standard here instead of the \"specificity\" requirement of\n   <em>\n    Fitzgibbon\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The court declines to do so for two reasons. First, as Defendants point out, the Circuit has applied\n   <em>\n    Fitzgibbon\n   </em>\n   's three-pronged test in the\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   context subsequent to\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   , demonstrating that the Circuit plainly has not jettisoned the specificity requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mobley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358664,12310054\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/568/\">\n    806 F.3d at 583-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Plaintiffs read\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   too broadly. They conflate the specificity requirement of the official acknowledgement doctrine with the standard by which an agency's invocation of a FOIA exemption is judged. In the\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   context, the specificity requirement concerns the \"fit\" between the particular records sought and the records that are the subject of the public official statements. So, as in\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   , if a requester seeks records about drone strikes, and the agency refuses to confirm or deny the existence of those records, the public acknowledgment\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   bear out the existence of records concerning drone strikes, not something different, to overcome that\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response. Thus, the records sought must match the records whose existence the plaintiff claims are publicly acknowledged through official statements. The \"logical nor plausible\" language of\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   , by contrast, and which the court discusses further below, is used to evaluate an agency's justification for invoking a FOIA exemption to withhold records or issue a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response.\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662885,6047405\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/937/\">\n    715 F.3d at 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That standard is apparent from the\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning that an agency's \"justification\" for invoking a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response \"is\n   <em>\n    sufficient\n   </em>\n   if it appears 'logical' or 'plausible.' \"\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    710 F.3d at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying that standard, the court in\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   found, based on the public statements of the President and key intelligence community officials, that it was \"neither logical nor plausible\" for the CIA to justify its refusal to confirm or deny whether it possessed records relating to drone strikes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    at 429-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, while\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   establishes a standard relevant to the\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   context, it does not displace the specificity requirement of\n   <em>\n    Fitzgibbon\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Quantum of Proof\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The discussion above begs the question: What type of proof is required to establish that the existence of a document has been officially acknowledged? The Circuit has provided guidance on this issue in two types of cases: (1) where the existence of responsive records is plain on the face of the official statement,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n    473 F.3d at 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and (2) where the substance of an official statement and the context in which it is made permits the inescapable inference that the requested records in fact exist,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    710 F.3d at 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants emphasize the former, while Plaintiffs emphasize the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The first type of case is best illustrated by\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   . In that case, Wolf, an historian, requested from the CIA \"all records about Jorge Eliecer Gaitan,\" an assassinated Colombian politician.\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n    473 F.3d at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The CIA issued a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response to the request, claiming that the fact of the existence or nonexistence of records regarding a foreign national was itself classified.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After the agency moved for summary judgment, Wolf asserted that the CIA had waived its right to issue a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response because then-CIA Director Admiral R.K. Hillenkoetter \"officially acknowledged\" the existence of responsive records by reading from official CIA dispatches referencing Gaitan during a 1948 congressional hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n    at 373-74, 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Drawing from\n   <em>\n    Fitzgibbon\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit confirmed the applicability of the \"official acknowledgment\" doctrine in the\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   context and concluded that Director Hillenkoetter's testimony acknowledged the \"specific information at issue\"-the \"existence\n   <em>\n    vel non\n   </em>\n   of records about Jorge Eliecer Gaitan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n    at 378-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Director Hillenkoetter read directly from CIA dispatches concerning \"Gaitan, his followers, and their associates in connection with possible communist activity in Colombia,\" his official statements disclosed the existence of responsive records and waived the CIA's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n    at 378-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Critically, though, the court's ultimate\n   holding was quite narrow. The court held that the Director's official acknowledgment waiver related\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to the existence or nonexistence of the records about Gaitan disclosed by Hillenkoetter's testimony. As a result, Wolf was entitled to disclosure of that information, \"namely the existence of CIA records about Gaitan that ha[d] been previously disclosed\"-the officially acknowledged dispatches-\"\n   <em>\n    but not\n   </em>\n   any others.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n    at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, even though Wolf had requested \"all records\" about Gaitan, and the CIA's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response was to the \"all records\" request, the court held that the CIA was not required to confirm or deny the existence of any other records that it might have in its possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The second type of\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   case is best exemplified by\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   . In that case, the ACLU requested from the CIA \"records pertaining to the use of use of ... drones ... by the CIA and the Armed Forces for the purpose of killing targeted individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    710 F.3d at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The CIA issued a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response, arguing that confirming or denying whether it had responsive documents would reveal \"whether or not the CIA is involved in drone strikes or at least has an intelligence interest in drone strikes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The ACLU challenged the CIA's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response, arguing that the existence of such records had already been officially acknowledged by President Obama, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism John Brennan, and CIA Director Leon Panetta, in various public statements and speeches.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    at 429-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though none of these official statements \"specifically stated that the CIA has documents relating to drone strikes,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted), the D.C. Circuit held that the public statements left \"\n   <em>\n    no doubt\n   </em>\n   that some U.S. agency\" possessed such records,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). According to the D.C. Circuit, the CIA was one such agency because, after all, \"it strains credulity to suggest that an agency charged with gathering intelligence affecting the national security does not have an 'intelligence interest' in drone strikes\"-the narrow interest the CIA sought to protect by invoking a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response-\"even if that agency does not operate the drones itself.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    at 429-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, the court observed that, in light of various public statements made by the CIA Director about the precision of targeted drone strikes, the level of collateral damage they cause, and their comparative usefulness to other weapons, \"it is implausible that the CIA does not possess a single document on the subject of drone strikes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Unless we are to believe that the Director was able to \"assure\" his audience that drone strikes are \"very precise and ... very limited in terms of collateral damage\" without having examined a single document in his agency's possession, those statements are tantamount to an acknowledgment that the CIA has documents on the subject.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original). Accordingly, the court concluded that, even though none of the public statements expressly acknowledged the existence of documents, the substance of those statements made it \"neither 'logical' nor 'plausible' to maintain that the Agency does not have any documents relating to drones.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Though distinct, these two types of cases are animated by the same principles.

It is far from clear in what material ways Comey's statements \"supplement\" President's Trump's. True, Comey testified to facts that President Trump did not directly utter (or tweet). But so what? An official acknowledgment on behalf of a government agency must come from an \"authoritative source,\"\n   <em>\n    Afshar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3640642,1847947\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/1125/\">\n    702 F.2d at 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a limitation that recognizes the fact that \"in the arena of intelligence and foreign relations there can be a critical difference between official and unofficial disclosures,\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

Plaintiffs' proposed use of unofficial statements to reinforce an official statement would blur that distinction. Even less clear is how Comey's unofficial statements can create a genuine dispute of material fact about the President's official statements. After all, statements from a non-authoritative source cannot possibly bolster or undermine statements from an authoritative source. The official statement must stand on its own-it either rises to the level of a public acknowledgment or it does not. The court therefore does not consider Comey's unofficial statements made to the SSCI as corroborative or supplemental evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    3.

On January 11, 2017, ODNI issued a press release from Director Clapper, which stated that he had \"discussed the private security company document, which was widely circulated in recent months among the media, members of Congress and Congressional staff even before the [Intelligence Community] became aware of it.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. to Defs.' Reply, Ex. A, ECF No. 20-2 [hereinafter Clapper Statement]. The press release further reported that Director Clapper had advised President-elect Trump that the document \"is not a product of the U.S. Intelligence Community\" and that the Intelligence Community had \"not made any judgment that the information in [the referenced document] is reliable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076968,3553786\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/612/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As Director Clapper issued this press release during his service as Director of ODNI, it constitutes an official statement of ODNI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The same cannot be said, however, of a second statement attributed to the former Director.

Reply, Ex. E, ECF No. 20-6. Here, again, Plaintiffs invite the court to consider Clapper's statement made as a private citizen as \"supplemental\" information relevant to the official acknowledgment inquiry.

Plaintiffs contend that, based on the President's statements and tweets and Director Comey's testimony to Congress confirming the existence of an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, it \"is neither logical nor plausible that the Nation's premier law enforcement agency would not have an interest in (let alone possess) a document such as the [Synopsis].\" Pls.' Reply at 4. The court disagrees that the cited statements compel such a conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   For starters, none of the statements expressly reference the Synopsis. To be sure, President Trump has acknowledged that the FBI has knowledge of the\n   <em>\n    Dossier\n   </em>\n   's contents, notably telling the\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   that Director Comey \"brought it [the Dossier] to me.\" Trump\n   <em>\n    NY Times\n   </em>\n   Interview at 16. But even in that interview the President did not say that Director Comey presented him with\n   <em>\n    the Synopsis\n   </em>\n   . This is not hair-splitting. Distinguishing between the two documents is critical, for the D.C. Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   teaches that the record demanded must \"match\" exactly the record that is publicly acknowledged. In\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   , the Circuit held that only those dispatches that Director Hillenkoetter's expressly read into the congressional record were officially acknowledged, but not any other.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n    473 F.3d at 373-74, 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, though related, the Dossier and the Synopsis are distinct records, and none of President Trump's statements or tweets acknowledge the existence of the Synopsis, let alone that he received a copy of it from the FBI. Therefore, there has been no express recognition of the Synopsis' existence by either the President or any other official acting on behalf of the FBI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Sec.

Here, the President acknowledged in his\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   interview that, at most, he received\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   information about the Dossier's contents from Director Comey, i.e., allegations concerning a trip to Russia for the Miss Universe pageant, which the President characterized as \"phony\" and \"made-up junk.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trump\n   <em>\n    NY Times\n   </em>\n   Interview at 16. It does not inexorably follow from that statement, however, that the FBI possesses the Synopsis. To be sure, a document purported to be the Dossier is in the public domain and the media has reported on some of its more salacious allegations, but no official statement from any authoritative source has revealed its precise contents. The same holds true for the government-drafted Synopsis. Thus, to conclude that the President's statements to the\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   constitute an official acknowledgment of the Synopsis, the court would have to speculate that the connection the President drew between his meeting with Director Comey regarding the Dossier, on the one hand, and with the Miss Universe pageant in Russia, on the other, is derived not only from the Dossier as presented by Director Comey, but from the Synopsis itself. The official acknowledgment doctrine does not countenance so great an inferential leap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Moreover, this case differs from\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   in a critical respect.

The court framed the question presented in that way because, given the nature of the plaintiff's FOIA request, the sole relevant justification for the CIA's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response was \"to keep secret whether the CIA\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   \" has \" 'at least has an intelligence interest in drone strikes.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    at 428-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). The court's holding in\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   was that, in light of the President's and CIA Director's public statements about drone strikes, \"it is neither logical nor plausible for the CIA to maintain that it would reveal anything not already in the public domain to say that the Agency 'at least has an intelligence interest' in such strikes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Contrary to Plaintiffs' contention,\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   's narrow holding is not controlling here because the FBI in this case asserts a broader justification for issuing a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response than merely concealing an \"interest\" in the Synopsis.

Pls.' Mot. at 13; Pls.' Reply at 5. To that end, Plaintiffs ask the court to apply a \"presumption of regularity\" to the President's statements and tweets. As Plaintiffs see it, because even presidential tweets are \"official statements of the President of the United States,\" Defs.'

So, according to Plaintiffs, when the President tweets that the Dossier is \"discredited\" or \"fake,\" absent contrary evidence, the court should presume that the President's tweet is based on record information presented by the FBI or the Intelligence Community.

First, the presumption of regularity is inapposite in this context. And, second, unlike the statements at issue in\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   , the public statements in this case do not render Defendants' justification for issuing a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response \"neither logical nor plausible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The presumption of regularity applies to a public official's discharge of official duties, not to his or her uttering of official statements. \"The presumption of regularity supports the official acts of public officers, and, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Applying the presumption is most appropriate where a government official or entity conducts official acts in the manner provided by statute, regulation, or policy.

Plaintiffs point to no case law that expands the presumption to official statements such that, absent contrary evidence, courts must presume that an official statement is premised upon documents in the government's possession. Accordingly, the court declines to apply the presumption of regularity to this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Nor are the public statements in this case \"tantamount to an acknowledgment that the [agency] has documents on the subject\" of the veracity or credibility of the Synopsis' factual contentions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    710 F.3d at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Start with the President's tweets. Plaintiffs themselves concede that \"[i]t may be the case that President Trump issued his tweets based strictly and exclusively upon his own personal knowledge independent of what he has learned as President of the United States, as well as what he may have seen on cable television.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Plaintiffs' concession is a wise one, because none of the tweets inescapably lead to the inference that the President's statements about the Dossier are rooted in information he received from the law enforcement and intelligence communities. Take for instance the following three tweets, which the President posted on October 19, 2017; October 21, 2017; and November 29, 2017, respectively:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   Workers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th.

Big stuff. Deep State. Give this information NOW! @foxnews\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Oct. 19 Tweet; Oct. 21 Tweet; Nov. 29 Tweet. All three tweets reference an ongoing news event,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   as opposed to information that only could be gleaned from government records.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    710 F.3d at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding it implausible that statements about drone strikes could be made without \"having examined a single document in [the] agency's possession\"). In such circumstances, there is little reason to believe that the President's characterization of the Dossier as \"fake\" and \"discredited\" is necessarily premised on information found in government records. Moreover, the November 29, 2017 tweet does not, as Plaintiffs insist, acknowledge the existence of \"key documents\" responsive to Items Two and Three of their request. Pls.' Fourth Notice of Suppl. Info., ECF No. 31 at 2-3. The referenced \"key documents ... which could shed light on surveillance of associates of Donald Trump\" do not \"match\" Plaintiffs' demand for records relating to \"final determinations\" made about the factual allegations contained in the Synopsis. Therefore, none of the above three tweets constitutes an official disclosure of the requested records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The same holds true for the President's most recent tweet cited by Plaintiffs. That tweet, posted on December 26, 2017, describes the Dossier as \"bogus\" and asserts that the \"FBI CANNOT (after all this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER.\" That tweet, however, explicitly refers to the Twitter handle for the morning news show Fox &amp; Friends (\"@foxandfr[i]ends\") and appears to quote statements made on that program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. 26 Tweet. Indeed, at least one media outlet reported that persons appearing on Fox &amp; Friends on that date made statements similar to those contained in the President's tweet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the President's latest tweet about the Dossier\n   does no more to confirm the existence of \"final determinations\" and related documents than the earlier three tweets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Other statements demonstrate quite plausibly that the President's characterizations of the Dossier's charges likely come from yet another source-his personal knowledge. The\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   interview is illustrative. There, the President explained that he knew the Dossier to be \"phony\" because-at least with respect to the Miss Universe pageant in Russia-he was \"just there for a very short time\" and he had \"witnesses,\" including his bodyguard, who the President said could debunk any allegations relating to that trip.\n   <em>\n    NY Times\n   </em>\n   Interview at 16. The President's statements to the\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   -or to any other news outlet-do not leave the court firmly convinced that the defendant agencies possess records concerning any \"final determinations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   To make their case, Plaintiffs lean heavily on two cases,\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Both are readily distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   , the court considered a series of public statements made by President Obama; the President's head counterterrorism advisor, John Brennan; and CIA Director Leon Panetta, all of which acknowledged that the United States uses drones to target al-Qaeda terrorists.\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    710 F.3d at 428-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, in sharp contrast to the statements evaluated in\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   , it does not \"beggar belief\" to think that the President made statements and tweets about the Dossier without having examined, or received, information contained in documents held by the FBI or the Intelligence Community. As already discussed, the President's statements may very well be based on media reports or his own personal knowledge, or could simply be viewed as political statements intended to counter media accounts about the Russia investigation, rather than assertions of pure fact. But the same simply cannot be said about the CIA Director's statement concerning the accuracy of drone strikes.

The court, however, rejected the\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response, holding that the existence of documentation was officially acknowledged by President Obama in a speech in which he asserted that \"Israel can defend itself against any conventional danger\" \"partly due to American military and intelligence assistance, which my administration has provided at unprecedented levels.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274544\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/28/#p31\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274544\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/28/#p31\">\n    at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Relying on\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   , the court explained that it was neither logical nor plausible for the CIA to deny that it had line items related to intelligence assistance, as the President's statements readily gave rise to an inference that the CIA was providing intelligence support to Israel and therefore established the existence of\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   budgeted amounts reflected in line items for supplying such assistance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274544\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/28/#p31\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274544\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/28/#p31\">\n    at 33-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Stated differently, it \"beggar[ed] belief\" that the CIA-the federal agency tasked with providing intelligence support abroad-would not have budget line items for providing intelligence assistance to Israel after President Obama had touted doing so at \"unprecedented levels.\" Here, in comparison, no ready inference can be drawn between President Trump's statements and records concerning any \"final determinations\" made about the Synopsis. For reasons that need not be repeated, the President's statements in this case do not\n   incontrovertibly give rise to the inference that such records must exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   In the end, Plaintiffs' position boils down to this: President Trump's public statements about the Dossier must be based on extant government documents because it is implausible to believe that the President would make \"official\" statements about issues pertaining to national security unless tethered to information contained in government records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Resp. to Defs.' Suppl. Submission, ECF No. 30, at 7 (arguing that \"[i]t borders on axiomatic that if we take the President at his word his official disclosures are based upon information he gleaned from official U.S. Government documents\"). The weakness of that position is readily laid bare when viewed in a different context. Take the following recent tweet issued by the President on January 2, 2018:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   Crooked Hillary Clinton's top aid[e], Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailor[']s pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey &amp; others\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   @realDonaldTrump, Twitter (Jan. 2, 2018, 4:48 AM), https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948174033882927104. Applying Plaintiffs' logic to this tweet, the court would have to find that federal law enforcement agencies have determined that Secretary Clinton's former aide, Huma Abedin, gave foreign agents classified passwords and that documents exist to support that conclusion. But no reasonable jurist would so hold based on the President's tweet alone. To be sure, a presidential tweet could satisfy the stringent requirements of the official acknowledgement doctrine. But it does not follow that just because a tweet is an \"official\" statement of the President that its substance is necessarily grounded in information contained in government records. In this instance, the court agrees with Defendants that regardless of the medium by which the President communicates with the public, \"the significance of any statement ... depend[s] on its substance.\" Defs.' Mem. re: Tweets, at 5-6 n.4. And, in this case, nothing about the substance or context of the President's statements-or the official statements of Director Comey or Director Clapper-convinces the court that the President or any executive branch officer has officially acknowledged the existence of documents responsive to Items Two and Three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Finally, in the alternative, Plaintiffs assert that a factual dispute exists as to the President's basis for describing the Dossier as \"discredited,\" \"phony,\" and \"fake,\" thereby precluding the entry of summary judgment and \"requir[ing] an inquiry by this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. There is, however, no factual dispute on this record. Plaintiffs offer little more than wishful thinking that the documents they request must exist. But wishful thinking does not create a genuine dispute of fact in a FOIA case.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SafeCard Servs., Inc. v. SEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546712,3488360\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1197/\">\n    926 F.2d 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1201 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (\"Mere speculation that as yet uncovered documents may exist does not undermine the finding that the agency conducted a reasonable search for them.\"). In short, there is nothing in the record that \"controvert[s]\" Defendants' justification of their\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response or otherwise indicates \"agency bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n    473 F.3d at 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, no factual dispute precludes the granting of summary judgment in favor of Defendants as to their\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Improper Withholding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   At last, the court turns to the propriety of the Intelligence Community\n   Defendants' invocation of Exemptions 1 and 3 to withhold the Synopsis from production. Plaintiffs do not substantively challenge the agencies' reliance on Exemptions 1 and 3. Instead, they argue that Comey's\n   <em>\n    unofficial\n   </em>\n   testimony before the SSCI-specifically, that the President denied that he had \"been involved with hookers in Russia\"-disclosed some of the specific content contained in the Synopsis, thereby creating a genuine issue of material fact that precludes granting summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. at 15-16; Comey SSCI Written Testimony at 6. An unofficial statement cannot, however, be used to show that the contents of a withheld record have been officially acknowledged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Afshar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3640642,1847947\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/1125/\">\n    702 F.2d at 1133-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And even absent this fatal shortcoming, the former FBI Director's unofficial statements are not imputable to the Intelligence Community Defendants,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mobley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358664,12310054\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/568/\">\n    806 F.3d at 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Disclosure by one federal agency does not waive another agency's right to assert a FOIA exemption.\"), and are wholly insufficient to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Fitzgibbon\n   </em>\n   's three-pronged test. The Intelligence Community Defendants therefore are entitled to summary judgment as to their withholding of the Synopsis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
