INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs Victor Vasquez, Nadeem Sheikh, Katia Sadoudi, Svetlana Bautista, Ibrahima Ba, Nicholas Miano, Pa M. Njie, Michael Amegnaglo, and David Berger (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") are former Store Team Leaders for various Whole Foods grocery stores in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. They bring this action against Defendants Whole Foods Market, Inc. (\"WFMI\"), Whole Foods Market Group, Inc. (\"WFM Group\"), Whole Foods Market Services, Inc. (\"WF Services\"), and Whole Foods spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan (collectively, \"Defendants\" or \"Whole Foods\"), alleging that they were terminated in retaliation for blowing the whistle on the improper manner in which Whole Foods conducted its \"Gainsharing\" program, a bonus program designed to incentivize individual grocery store departments to operate under budget by sharing cost savings with employees. Plaintiffs also assert that, following their terminations, Defendants falsely accused them through published news stories of manipulating the Gainsharing program for their own benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the court are the following motions: (1) Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint; (2) Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint; and (3) Defendants' Motion to Stay. For the reasons herein, the court grants in part and denies in part Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. The court dismisses all claims against all Defendants, except Plaintiffs' claims for defamation and false light invasion of privacy, which may proceed against WFM Group and WF Services only. Additionally, the court grants Plaintiffs' Motion to File a Second Amended Complaint and denies Defendants' Motion to Stay as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Each of the nine Plaintiffs in this action worked as a Store Team Leader-the highest level of leadership at a store location-for a Whole Foods grocery store in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area before his or her termination in December 2016. Am. Compl., ECF No. 11, \u00b6 24. During Plaintiffs' employment, Whole Foods used a profit-sharing program-what Whole Foods referred to as its \"Gainsharing\" program-in its stores to incentivize department productivity and revenue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 28. Under the program, Whole Foods awarded bonuses to employees whose departments performed under budget by distributing the surplus savings among the employees in that department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, Whole Foods' corporate leadership undermined the Gainsharing program by imposing a nationwide scheme of \"shifting\" labor costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. Under this practice, if a department came in over budget, Whole Foods corporate leadership instructed store leadership-including Store Team Leaders-to \"shift\" the labor costs of that department to a department that had a budget surplus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Payroll Specialists at each Whole Foods store then effectuated labor cost shifting by manually altering employee time records and submitting the manipulated records to corporate headquarters for payroll processing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. As a result of this practice, the Gainsharing bonuses owed to employees of departments that performed under budget were reduced by the costs unlawfully \"shifted\" to those departments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. Plaintiffs allege that Whole Foods corporate leadership imposed this practice of \"shifting\" labor costs in every Whole Foods grocery store to steal bonuses earned by employees and pad company profits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In October 2016, a Whole Foods employee from the Mid-Atlantic region submitted an anonymous complaint to Whole Foods' employee tip line, complaining that he or she did not receive the proper Gainsharing bonus because labor costs had been shifted from another department to the employee's department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Whole Foods thereafter launched an investigation into this complaint. According to Plaintiffs, however, the investigation was a sham. Its true goal was \"to concoct support for Whole Foods' pre-determined outcome that the 'shifting of labor costs' was limited to the store complained about\" in the anonymous tip.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In early November 2016, Whole Foods investigators interviewed each Plaintiff about the Gainsharing program implemented in his or her respective store. Each Plaintiff explained that shifting labor costs was a standard practice throughout Whole Foods stores and some Plaintiffs stated they received explicit instructions from corporate officials to do so. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-37. After these meetings, Plaintiffs were immediately placed on administrative leave. Am. Compl. \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Soon thereafter, Plaintiffs were fired. On November 30, 2016, Plaintiffs were instructed to meet at Whole Foods' regional office on the following day. Am. Compl. \u00b6 38. Each Plaintiff met individually with Regional President Scott Allshouse, Regional Vice-President Nicole Wescoe, and Human Resources Executive Coordinator David Gearhart. Each Plaintiff was terminated, purportedly (according to Whole Foods) for shifting labor costs and falsifying documents in violation of company policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The firings made the news. On December 13, 2016, the Associated Press reported in an article titled \"Whole Foods Fires 9 Store Managers Over Bonus Manipulation\" that nine store managers of Whole Foods stores in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia were dismissed after a company-wide investigation determined that the managers \"engaged in a policy infraction that allowed the managers to benefit from a profit-sharing program at the expense of store employees.\" Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 12 [hereinafter Defs.' Mot], Ex. C-2, ECF No. 12-7 [hereinafter AP Article]. The Associated Press article attributed Whole Foods' statements and details about the investigation to Defendant Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for Whole Foods. Two days later, The Washington Post published a news article titled \"Whole Foods Fires Managers in\n   Md., Va., and D.C. for Manipulating Bonus System.\" Defs.' Mot., Ex. C-3, ECF No. 12-8 [hereinafter Washington Post Article]. In the article, Whole Foods confirmed that nine managers of Whole Foods stores in Maryland, Virginia, and the District were fired for manipulating a store bonus program. Washington Post Article, at 1. Whole Foods stated that the conduct was still under investigation but was isolated to a relatively small number of its 457 stores. Speaking on behalf of Whole Foods, Brooke Buchanan stated that \"[Whole Foods] took swift action, but, relative to the rest of company, this manipulation only happened in nine of our locations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this action in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia on December 20, 2016, and Defendants removed the case to this court on January 17, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1.

Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49-91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint on April 3, 2017. Defs.' Mot. Defendants WFMI, WF Services, and Buchanan moved to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for lack of personal jurisdiction, and, in the alternative, for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Defs.' Mot. at 1 n.1. WFM Group moved to dismiss the complaint solely under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs opposed Defendants' Motion and simultaneously sought leave from the court to amend their Amended Complaint to add a whistleblower retaliation claim under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-6, against all Defendants except Buchanan. Pls.' Mem. in Opp'n. to Defs.' Mot., ECF No. 17 [hereinafter Pls.' Opp'n]; Pls.' Mot. for Leave to File a Second Am. Compl., ECF No. 16 [hereinafter Pls.' Mot. to Am.].

Save an argument buried in a footnote, Plaintiffs do not argue that WFMI's subsidiaries' contacts with the District of Columbia should be imputed to WFMI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, Plaintiffs contend that WFMI\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   \"transacts business\" in the District of Columbia through its operation\n   of stores and its setting of policies for stores. Pls.' Opp'n at 8-10. Plaintiffs' evidence and fact allegations do not support that proposition, let alone overcome Defendants' contrary evidence. WFMI's Form 10-K, on which Plaintiffs so heavily rely, does not establish WFMI's direct control of stores in the District. \"[I]t is widely acknowledged that 'consolidating the activities of a subsidiary into the parent's reports is a common business practice.' \"\n   <em>\n    Khatib v.

Likewise, WFMI's admission in its Answer in\n   <em>\n    FTC v. Whole Foods Market\n   </em>\n   that it \"transacts business within the District of Columbia\" does not advance Plaintiffs' cause. The court views that admission much like the Form 10-K-an acknowledgment that the corporate entity as a whole operates stores in the District of Columbia, and no more. After all,\n   <em>\n    FTC v.

Whole Foods Market, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573992,3953017\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/548/1028/\">\n    548 F.3d 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1032 (D.C. Cir. 2008). In such circumstances, the court finds it highly improbable that, by admitting to conducting business in the District of Columbia, WMFI intended to disavow its corporate structure and convey that it, in fact, transacts such business directly, instead of through a subsidiary. Finally, Plaintiffs' allegations that the cost-shifting practice was \"nation-wide\" and that \"corporate leadership\" instructed Plaintiffs to take such action,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31, is simply too vague to ascribe jurisdictional contacts to WFMI in the District. Plaintiffs do not allege specific facts supporting their assertion that labor cost-shifting occurred at stores outside the Mid-Atlantic region; nor do they identify the \"corporate leadership\" that directed Plaintiffs' conduct. Absent such allegations, Plaintiffs cannot overcome Yost's sworn declaration that WFMI does not \"set policies for any Whole Foods Market store, nor does WFMI regulate or assure the uniformity of policies in\n   <em>\n    Whole Foods Market\n   </em>\n   stores .... [, which] is set and regulated by other Whole Foods entities, not WFMI.\" Yost Decl. \u00b6 10. Thus, having failed to provide specific facts to contradict Yost's testimony, Plaintiffs have not satisfied their burden of establishing specific jurisdiction as to WFMI under subsection (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Next, subsection (a)(3) provides no refuge. The only alleged tortious conduct occurring in the District of Columbia, as required under subsection (a)(3), is Vasquez's firing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs aver that \"regional president Scott Allshouse, vice-president Nicole Newscoe, and executive coordinator of HR David Gearhart\" terminated Plaintiffs \"at the regional office on December 1, 2016.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 16. That allegation, however, is insufficient to attribute Vasquez's firing (or any other Plaintiff's firing for that matter) to WFMI because nowhere\n   do Plaintiffs allege that Allshouse, Wescoe, or Gearhart are officers, employees, or agents of WFMI.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Livnat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277107\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/45/#p56\">\n    851 F.3d at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that \"bare allegations\" of agency are insufficient to make out a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction). In fact, the only record evidence suggests that they are not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Yost Decl. \u00b6 7. Nothing alleged in the Amended Complaint, therefore, establishes jurisdiction over WFMI under subsection (a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, subsection (a)(4) does not, as Plaintiffs maintain, confer jurisdiction over WFMI through Plaintiffs' defamation claim. That contention suffers from two defects. First, Buchanan, who uttered the alleged defamatory statement, is not alleged to be an officer, employee, or agent of WFMI.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Livnat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277107\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/45/#p56\">\n    851 F.3d at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the only evidence about her employment comes from Buchanan herself, who attests that she is the \"Global Vice President of Communications\" for\n   <em>\n    WF Services\n   </em>\n   . Buchanan Decl. \u00b6 1. Second, Plaintiffs' argument that WFMI \"derives substantial revenue\" from the operation of Whole Foods stores in the District of Columbia is unpersuasive. As a holding company, to the extent WFMI earns any revenue from the District, it does so only indirectly through the shares it holds in the subsidiary that owns and operates the District's Whole Foods stores. To attribute such District-generated earnings to WFMI would run afoul of the rule that \"it is generally improper to impute the contacts of a subsidiary to a corporate parent that is a holding company because the subsidiary is not performing a function that the parent would otherwise have to perform itself (the holding company could simply hold another type of subsidiary).\"\n   <em>\n    Khatib\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784656\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/846/18/#p33\">\n    846 F.Supp.2d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Plaintiffs offer no reason for the court to deviate from that general rule in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In the end, Plaintiffs have not offered a sufficient factual basis upon which this court can exercise personal jurisdiction over WFMI. Accordingly, all claims against WFMI are dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    WF Services\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The final jurisdictional inquiry concerns WF Services. WF Services is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Texas. Yost Decl. \u00b6 3. Yost describes WF Services \"as the administrative arm of the Whole Foods Market family of companies, providing accounting, legal, and other administrative services to the Whole Foods Market [regional] operating entities,\" such as WFM Group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. WF Services charges WFM Group and other operating companies the cost of the services provided, \"plus a nominal upcharge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. The amounts charged by WF Services for its services \"are not connected to any goods or services sold by WFM Group, including goods or services sold in the District of Columbia.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, WF Services has no permanent presence in the District of Columbia. It has no employees, office space, or telephones in the District; nor does it have any bank accounts or other tangible or real property in the District.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. It also does not render services directly to persons or entities operating within the District.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   With regard to the events at issue in this case, according to Yost, WF Services provided \"legal services related to the investigation and preparation for this and related pending legal matters.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Additionally, it provided \"non-legal services ... in relation to the Gainsharing issues generally ... at WFM Group's office in Rockville, Maryland.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Yost attests that WF Services does not derive revenue from any goods sold or services rendered in the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs offer no facts of their own in opposition to Yost's affidavit. Instead, they assert that Yost makes their case for them. They contend that WF Services does not provide its services \"in a vacuum,\" but instead provides administrative services \"directly\" to the four stores located in the District of Columbia. Pls.' Opp'n at 12. They also point to Yost's admission that WF Services provided legal services in connection with the investigation of Plaintiffs and other related pending matters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. And, finally, they rely on Buchanan's defamatory utterances, attributing those to her employer, WF Services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on these specific facts, Plaintiffs assert that long-arm jurisdiction over WF Services is warranted under subsections (a)(1), (2), and (4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The court views it as a close call, but ultimately concludes that Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of making a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction under subsection (a)(4). As previously discussed in connection with Buchanan, Plaintiffs have alleged tortious conduct outside the District of Columbia-Buchanan's alleged defamatory statements-as well as injury in the District of Columbia, because Buchanan's statements were received in the District. But, unlike with Buchanan, Plaintiffs have satisfied one of the \"plus\" factors required by subsection (a)(4) with regard to WF Services. Plaintiffs have pointed to facts connecting WF Services to the District of Columbia that render it plausible that WF Services either \"regularly does ... business\" or \"engages in any other persistent course of conduct\" in the District. Yost's concession that WF Services provided legal services in connection with the investigation of Plaintiffs in the District of Columbia makes it \"plausible\" that WF Services has provided similar services in the past in this forum.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Forras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310081,4085399\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1102/\">\n    812 F.3d at 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It may be that WF Services' legal and investigative contacts in this case are an isolated instance of contacts with the District of Columbia, in which case they would not qualify as either \"regular\" or \"persistent\" conduct sufficient to satisfy subsection (a)(4). But the ultimate determination of whether the court can exercise personal jurisdiction over WF Services will have to wait until after the conclusion of discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Before moving on, the court recaps the results of the personal jurisdiction inquiry. Plaintiffs did not meet their burden of showing pertinent facts to make out a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction against WFMI and Buchanan; thus, the claims against them are dismissed without prejudice. Plaintiffs did meet their burden as to WF Services, and WFM Group did not contest jurisdiction. The court now turns to address the merits of Defendants' 12(b)(6) motion as to WF Services and WFM Group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    1. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy (Count I)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   All Plaintiffs concede that they were at-will employees. Nevertheless, in Count I of the Amended Complaint, they bring a claim for wrongful termination, asserting that the public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine applies. Plaintiffs assert that, because Whole Foods terminated them for blowing the whistle on the nationwide practice of shifting labor costs to undermine the Gainsharing program and steal bonuses from employees, they can maintain a claim for wrongful termination as a matter of public policy. As Plaintiffs were terminated from employment in different jurisdictions, the law applicable to Count I varies. District of Columbia law applies to Vasquez; Maryland law applies to Bautista and Njie; and Virginia law applies to Sheikh, Sadoudi, Ba,\n   Miano, and Amegnaglo. Regardless of the differences in law, none of Plaintiffs' wrongful termination claims survive, albeit for different reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Public-Policy Exception in District of Columbia\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The District of Columbia recognizes a common law tort of wrongful discharge \"as an exception to the traditional at-will doctrine governing termination of employment, where the discharge violates 'a clear mandate of public policy.' \"\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v.

As to the first inquiry, the Virginia Wage Payment Act does not itself confer a right on employees to receive pay. Rather, the sole state appellate court in Virginia to have interpreted the Wage Payment Act describes its purpose as \"establish[ing] the public policy of the Commonwealth as\n   <em>\n    to the manner\n   </em>\n   in which employers pay wages to employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Mar v.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Mar\n   </em>\n   emphasized that the Act is a \"regulatory not a remedial statute\" and, as a result, \"we are not required to liberally construe this statute as a remedy for the benefit of employees.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4135500\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/60/759/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court further noted that the Act does not provide a private right of action, only an administrative one, and to the extent it creates an \"underlying right to receive pay or wages,\" that right \"derives\n   <em>\n    not from the Act\n   </em>\n   , but from the contract of employment, express or implied.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 739 (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pallone v.

Thus, the court observed, \"a[n] aggrieved employee can pursue his private civil action based on claims of breach of contract or\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11509599\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/97/742/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mar\n   </em>\n   , therefore, stands for the proposition that the Act itself confers no right on employees to receive wages; that right instead is rooted in contract law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   From that conclusion it naturally follows that each Plaintiff's termination\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   did not violate public policy. At most, the Wage Payment Act establishes an employee's\n   right regarding when and how to get paid. There is no correlative public policy in the Act that protects an employee's \"exercise\" of her right to receive wages. Indeed, if the statutory right to seek a protective order to safeguard one's health and safety does not reflect a public policy to protect the exercise of such a right, then surely the more passive right of receiving earned wage payments on a regular basis, to the extent it exists statutorily, cannot as a matter of public policy receive greater protection. The court therefore finds that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim of wrongful discharge under Virginia law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In so ruling, the court recognizes that numerous state and federal courts in Virginia have gone the other way. Those courts have concluded that the Wage Payment Act confers \"an individual's right to compensation\" and, as such, \"implicates a property right that falls within the\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   exception.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

Second, the GIG expressly disclaims that it is a contract and affirms\n   the at-will nature of the employment relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   With respect to the first reason, Plaintiffs maintain that Whole Foods limited its ability to terminate employees at-will by committing to a \"corrective action process,\" as set forth in the GIG. Plaintiffs characterize that process as a promise by Whole Foods to its employees that it would terminate an employee for misconduct only after subjecting her to a series of incremental disciplinary actions over a 12-month period, except in the case of a severe offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 33-35. By agreeing to adhere to such a process, Plaintiffs assert, Whole Foods \"voluntarily and explicitly mandated dismissal only for cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35. Plaintiffs' argument is unpersuasive, however, because it relies on a selective reading of the GIG. It is true that the GIG generally prescribes a corrective action process for behavioral or performance deficiencies that moves from counseling statements to written warnings to a final written warning, instituted over a \"rolling 12-month period,\" before Whole Foods discharges an employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 GIG at 46-49. It also, however, vests substantial discretion in Whole Foods to carry out that process. For instance, when describing the policy, the GIG states at the outset that, \"[\n   <em>\n    w\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    hen practical\n   </em>\n   , Team Members will be warned and counseled for unsatisfactory performance prior to discharge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46 (emphasis added). The very next sentence states that, \"[d]epending on the nature and severity of the offense ..., the company reserves the right to discharge any Team Member without warning.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   (\"The process may vary based on the severity of the situation.\"). The GIG also contrasts \"[e]xamples of conduct that may lead to corrective action\" and \"major infractions,\" suggesting that the latter category of offenses is more likely to lead to immediate discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 47-48. The GIG's use of permissive language makes clear that Whole Foods did not intend to precondition termination of its employees on participation in the corrective action process, or to create a \"just cause\" requirement for termination.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strass v.

The court does not quibble with that principle; it just does not help Plaintiffs. The manual in\n   <em>\n    Strass\n   </em>\n   contained only a single disclaimer stating that it was not a contract. The court contrasted that language with other aspects of the manual that contained language of a mandatory nature.

In this case, by sharp contrast, the GIG disclaims that it is a contract\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   affirmatively asserts that employment at Whole Foods remains at-will.

The court observed that, under New York law, \"where a statement defames all members of a small group, the reference to the individual plaintiff reasonably follows from the statement....

First, the court in\n   <em>\n    Lines\n   </em>\n   surely would have reached a different conclusion with the benefit of\n   <em>\n    Elias\n   </em>\n   . After all, if three plaintiffs of a 53-member fraternity could advance a small-group theory of defamation, then surely one plaintiff of a 14-person group of terminated employees could do so, too; a workplace is at least as intimate as a university community, if not more so, and there can be little doubt that the plaintiff's co-workers in\n   <em>\n    Lines\n   </em>\n   would have recognized the plaintiff as among the 14 employees referenced in the company's press release announcing their firings. Second,\n   <em>\n    Elias\n   </em>\n   supports the court's conclusion here. Like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Elias\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs here have plausibly alleged that those acquainted with them and the circumstances would have recognized them as the subjects of Buchanan's statements accusing them of wrongdoing. Indeed, like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Elias\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs here have pleaded that, in fact, prospective employers and their former Whole Foods colleagues were able to make out that Buchanan was referring\n   to them in her statements. Thus, consistent with\n   <em>\n    Elias\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs in this case have pleaded sufficient facts to support a small-group theory of defamation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Finally, Defendants reliance on a line of cases that \"refus[e], as a matter of law, to find defamatory meaning where the claim of defamation is based on the interpretation third parties place upon termination of an at-will employee\" is misplaced.

Unlike those cases, Plaintiffs' defamation claim does not rest on the interpretation of a third party as to why they were fired. Rather, Buchanan's alleged defamatory statements expressly state why Plaintiffs were terminated: because they manipulated the Gainsharing program for their own benefit. No third-party interpretation is needed to make such statements have a defamatory meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In sum, the court concludes that Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient factual matter to make it plausible that persons acquainted with them would recognize Buchanan's alleged defamatory statements as \"of and concerning\" them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    \"Capable of Bearing a Defamatory Meaning\" and \"Highly Offensive to a Reasonable Person\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The court next addresses Defendants' contention that the alleged defamatory statements are not capable of bearing a defamatory meaning nor would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. Defs.' Mot. at 40. Under District of Columbia law, \"a statement is 'defamatory' if it tends to injure the plaintiff in his trade, profession or community standing, or lower him in the estimation of the community.\"\n   <em>\n    Jankovic v.

Cir. 2007). Similarly, to sustain a false light claim under District of Columbia law, Plaintiffs must show that the statements \"would be offensive to a reasonable person\" or that they were \"given unreasonable and highly objectionable publicity that attributes to [them] characteristics, conduct or beliefs that are false, and so [are] placed before the public in a false position.\"\n   <em>\n    Zimmerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274603\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/257/#p273\">\n    246 F.Supp.3d at 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652E cmt. b (2016) ). \"[C]ontext is key to determining whether, as a matter of law, a statement is capable of bearing a defamatory meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Marsh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9154107\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/339/1/#p5\">\n    339 F.Supp.2d at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Plaintiffs' allegations easily satisfy these standards. In context, Buchanan's statements to the Associated Press and The Washington Post paint Plaintiffs as cheats and thieves. True, one of the statements communicates that Whole Foods fired Plaintiffs for merely committing a \"policy infraction,\" but other statements are more specific, asserting that Plaintiffs \"manipulated a bonus program to their benefit\" and that their misconduct \"allowed [them] to benefit from a profit-sharing program at the expense of store employees.\" It is hardly a stretch to say that such statements, if false, would injure Plaintiffs in their profession and community and \"would be offensive to a reasonable person.\"\n   <em>\n    Zimmerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274603\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/257/#p273\">\n    246 F.Supp.3d at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
