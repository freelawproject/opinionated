In support of these arguments, Plaintiffs cite to sentences throughout the Court's Order in\n       <em>\n        Trump\n       </em>\n       that discuss entry into the United States, rather than the issuance of visas.

The two individual plaintiffs found to be entitled to injunctive relief-Doe # 1 and Dr. Elshikh-are individuals whose injuries and standing arose solely from the Executive Order's likely effect on their family members' abilities to obtain visas. John Doe # 1, one of the plaintiffs in\n       <em>\n        IRAP\n       </em>\n       , is \"a lawful permanent resident of the United States\" whose wife, at the time Doe # 1 sought an injunction, was \"currently awaiting her consular interview\" in\n      order to\n       <em>\n        obtain a visa\n       </em>\n       .\n       <footnotemark>\n        6\n       </footnotemark>\n       <em>\n        IRAP\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276595\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/554/\">\n        857 F.3d at 582\n       </extracted-citation>\n       . Similarly, Dr. Elshikh, one of the plaintiffs in\n       <em>\n        Hawaii\n       </em>\n       , is an American citizen who alleged that \"[the Executive Order] will prevent his mother-in-law from\n       <em>\n        obtaining a visa\n       </em>\n       to reunite with her family\" in the United States.\n       <em>\n        Hawaii\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276521\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/741/\">\n        859 F.3d at 762\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (emphasis added). In light of the fact that the Supreme Court ordered that individuals \"similarly situated\" to Doe # 1 and Dr. Elshikh, with a bona fide relationship to the United States, were exempt from the Executive Order, it necessarily follows that an individual without a bona fide relationship is not exempt from the Executive Order, even with respect to visa issuance.\n       <footnotemark>\n        7\n       </footnotemark>\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-39\">\n       Moreover, the Ninth and Fourth Circuits, in upholding the lower courts' injunctions, specifically mentioned the issuance of visas. In\n       <em>\n        Hawaii\n       </em>\n       , the Ninth Circuit found that \"Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that Section 2(c) of the Order, in\n       <em>\n        suspending the issuance of immigrant visas\n       </em>\n       and denying entry based on nationality, exceeds the restriction of \u00a7 1152(a)(1)(A) [of the INA].\"\n       <em>\n        Hawaii\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276521\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/741/\">\n        859 F.3d at 779\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (emphasis added). The Fourth Circuit, although ultimately declining to decide whether the Executive Order violates the INA, noted that \"[s]ection 2(c)'s 'short pause' on entry effectively halts\n       <em>\n        the issuance of visas\n       </em>\n       for ninety days.\"\n       <em>\n        IRAP\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276595\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/554/\">\n        857 F.3d at 583\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (emphasis added). Similarly, the lower courts drew no distinction between entry and visa issuance when they enjoined enforcement of the Executive Order, finding that the Executive Order impermissibly delayed both issuance of visas and entry into the United States for individuals from the affected countries. The Supreme Court thus considered these findings when it granted the government's applications for stays of the injunctions, and the Court's order precludes this court from determining the legality of the State Department's implementation of the Executive Order.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-40\">\n       The court is unconvinced by Plaintiffs' argument that \"no future development in the Supreme Court litigation will have an impact on this case.\" (Pls.

Moreover, there is no adequate alternative remedy available to Plaintiffs. Absent relief from this court, Plaintiffs are foreclosed from receiving visas in FY 2017 due to the impending statutory deadline. Defendants have made clear they will not issue visas past the end of the fiscal year or in excess of the statutory cap. (\n       <em>\n        See generally\n       </em>\n       ECF No. 47 (\"Defs. Resp. Status Rep.\")). Plaintiffs' only recourse would be to reenter the diversity visa lottery in future years, and it is statistically unlikely that Plaintiffs will win the lottery a second\n      time, since millions enter the diversity lottery every year; Defendants concede that the \"demand for [diversity] visas is high.\" (Defs. Opp. at 3).\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-46\">\n       Accordingly, Defendants are ordered to (1) reserve any unused visa numbers for FY 2017 for processing following the Supreme Court's decision (should the Court rule in Plaintiffs' favor); and (2) report any unused visa numbers to the court by October 15. In granting such relief, the court avoids both depriving other applicants of the chance to obtain a visa-in the case of FY 2017 lottery winners-and lessening other applicants' chances of obtaining a visa-in the case of FY 2018 lottery winners-while still addressing the potential irreparable harm that Plaintiffs face.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-47\">\n       Defendants' latest filing does not convince this court to find otherwise. (\n       <em>\n        See generally\n       </em>\n       Defs. Resp. Status Rep.). In their response to Plaintiffs' September 22, 2017 status report, Defendants argue that this case is moot because the State Department has reached the statutory cap. (\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        id.\n       </em>\n       at 2-6). In two of the cases Defendants cite for this proposition, the courts did not reach the merits of the government's mootness argument.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        Agahi v.

In the other two cases upon which Defendants rely, the defendants provided data that persuasively demonstrated that all visas were indeed used in a given fiscal year.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        Basova v.

Mar. 26, 2006) (finding that \"the USCIS reached (and in fact exceeded) its statutory cap on H-1B visas\"). In this case however, the State Department only claims to not have \"any available visa\n       <em>\n        numbers\n       </em>\n       ,\" (Defs. Resp. Status Rep. at 6), and therefore has not definitively shown that all\n       <em>\n        visas\n       </em>\n       have been issued for FY 2017. It is possible that not every applicant who currently has a visa number will receive a visa. (\n       <em>\n        See generally\n       </em>\n       Defs. Status Report). The\n       <em>\n        possibility\n       </em>\n       that the State Department has reached the statutory visa cap because it has already allotted all of the visa numbers does not necessarily render Plaintiffs' case moot.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-48\">\n       Defendants also argue that the court is precluded from ordering the processing of visas after the statutory deadline.

Golsefid received an email on August 24 encouraging him to \"send [documents to show that he has a bona fide relationship with the United States] as soon as possible before September 13, 2017.\" (ECF No. 45-1 at 17).

(ECF No. 45-2 at 7-8). Alsakkaf received a form from the State Department indicating that he had been determined ineligible for a visa due to the Executive Order, and instructing him to send information demonstrating \"a relationship that would qualify [him] for a visa issuance.\" (ECF No. 45-3 at 6-7). On September 15, Almaqrami did receive a letter indicating that the State Department would \"not be able to issue [him] a visa.\" (ECF No. 45-4 at 2-4). However, at the emergency status conference on September 19, Defendants' counsel maintained that Almaqrami\n       <em>\n        may\n       </em>\n       not receive a visa because of the 50,000 visa-statutory cap. Counsel did not indicate that he would definitely not receive a visa (although it admittedly appears unlikely), therefore it appears that Almaqrami's visa application is pending as well. Moreover, the September 22, 2017 Declaration of Chloe Dybdahl, an attorney adviser in the Legal Affairs, Advisory Opinions Division of the Visa Office, Bureau of Consular Affairs, does not definitively indicate that Plaintiffs' applications have been finally refused. (\n       <em>\n        See generally\n       </em>\n       ECF No. 47-1). The State Department's most recent communications with Plaintiffs, coupled with its representations to the court, strongly suggest that Plaintiffs' visa applications have not been finally refused.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-55\">\n       Even if Plaintiffs' applications have been finally refused, the doctrine of consular non-reviewability does not apply because Plaintiffs challenge the State Department's policy, not the discretion of a specific consular officer in applying the policy.\n       <em>\n        See e.g.\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <em>\n        Patel\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11588425\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/134/929/#p932\">\n        134 F.3d at 931-32\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (\"However, when the suit challenges the authority of the consul to take or fail to take an action as opposed to a decision taken within the consul's discretion, jurisdiction exists.\");\n       <em>\n        Int'lUnion of Bricklayers &amp; Allied Craftsmen v.
