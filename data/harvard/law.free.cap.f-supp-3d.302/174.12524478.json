The plaintiff requested records regarding himself and records relating to two criminal cases prosecuted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 23, 2016, Mr. Reep brought suit against the defendant agencies under FOIA, the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The gravamen of plaintiff's complaint is that the agencies failed to uphold their obligations under FOIA. The government moved to dismiss the suit as against defendants EOUSA, FBI, and DEA, arguing that the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over claims barred by the statute of limitations. In the same filing, defendant ATF moved for summary judgment in its favor, arguing that it fulfilled all of its obligations under FOIA as it relates to Mr. Reep's requests. Mr. Reep filed an opposition brief and the defendants chose not to reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Upon consideration of the defendants motion, the plaintiff's opposition, the entire record, and the applicable law, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   dismissal of the suit as to defendants EOUSA, FBI, and DEA, and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   defendant ATF's motion for summary judgement.

Despite filing a second appeal, the plaintiff constructively exhausted his administrative remedies twenty days after his first appeal because at that point he could have brought suit in this Court. Therefore, his right of action accrued on June 8, 2009, and his window to bring suit against the FBI closed on June 8, 2015, more than one year before he actually filed this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, the Office of Information Policy (\"OIP\") acknowledged receiving the plaintiff's appeal from the EOUSA decision on January 8, 2010. OIP subsequently informed the plaintiff on April 9, 2010, that it agreed with the EOUSA's decision to withhold records in response to his FOIA request. ECF No. 12-8, Francis Decl. \u00b6 13. The plaintiff's right of action against the EOUSA accrued on around February 11, 2010. Therefore, the statute of limitations precluded plaintiff from filing suit after February 11, 2016, a few months before he actually filed this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff does not dispute the specific dates proffered by the government in a way that would materially alter the outcome of this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the plaintiff points to his last correspondences with each agency to demonstrate that his lawsuit was in fact filed within the six-year statute of limitations window. Plaintiff's argument fails because the relevant factor is when the plaintiff has constructively exhausted his remedies, not when the administrative appeal has been adjudicated or when the agency last corresponds with the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spannus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4330755,1730430\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/824/52/\">\n    824 F.2d at 57-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Motion for Summary Judgement as to Claims against ATF\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The government argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's remaining claims because ATF \"fully discharged\n   its obligations under FOIA,\" ECF No. 12 at 5, by conducting a reasonable search and properly withholding documents under the applicable exemptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    1. Reasonableness of the Search\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The government puts forth a declaration by Stephanie M. Boucher, Chief of the Disclosure Division at ATF, outlining ATF's handling of the FOIA request, including how the search was conducted. According to Ms. Boucher, in response to the plaintiff's initial FOIA request in March 2009-requesting all records pertaining to himself-the Disclosure Division of ATF searched though \"N-Force\" and the Treasury Enforcement Communications System (\"TECS\")-the two systems of records which would most likely contain the documents pertaining to the plaintiff's request. ECF No. 12-2, Boucher Decl. \u00b6 28. TECS is a database-maintained by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Department of Homeland Security-which functions as a \"comprehensive ATF law enforcement database that contains ATF investigative records.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. N-Fore is a case-management system and is \"ATF's official case file of record for documenting investigative activity and information, creating reports, tracking investigative leads and linking data.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. The Disclosure Division searched those two systems by inputting the plaintiff's first and last name, date of birth, and Social Security Number.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. The search uncovered a single investigative case file numbered 768025-02-0042 involving the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In June 2010 in response to plaintiff's second FOIA request for all records related to case files 768025-02-0042 and 768025-03-0042, TECS and N-Force databases were again searched for responsive documents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. Again, case file numbered 768025-02-0042 was identified.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ATF determined case filed numbered 768025-03-0042 to be unrelated to the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In July 2016, a Specialist in ATF's Disclosure Division searched TECS and N-Force for a third time for any documents pertaining to the plaintiff by inputting his first and last name, date of birth, and Social Security Number.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. No additional documents were identified beyond what had already been identified and released to the plaintiff in 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. Moreover, \"ATF's Washington Field Division and the Norfolk Field Office (within the Washington Field Division) performed a search of each respective office and confirmed that no additional documents had been placed in Plaintiff's case file since the original search for records was conducted in March 2009.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court finds that ATF met its burden to demonstrate that it conducted a reasonable search. In 2009, 2010, and 2016, ATF searched the systems that would contain the information sought by the plaintiff and came up with the same case file each time. As such, in order to avoid summary judgment on this issue, the plaintiff must \"provide countervailing evidence as to the adequacy of the agency's search.\"\n   <em>\n    Iturralde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701462,9374831\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/311/\">\n    315 F.3d at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff seems to allege that the search was not adequate because he \"did not receive the requested date in which the Grand Jury convene (sic) for original indictment and date the Grand Jury issued that superceded (sic) the indictment.\" ECF No. 15-1 at 4. \"But it is long settled that the failure of an agency to turn up one specific document in its search does not alone render a search inadequate.\"\n   <em>\n    Iturralde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701462,9374831\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/311/\">\n    315 F.3d at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).

But rather he appears to be arguing that ATF also improperly redacted the meeting date of the grand jury-information that should not be exempted because it does not reveal the inner workings of the grand jury investigation. ECF No. 15-1 at 5. The Court finds no evidence in the ATF declaration, the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index, or anywhere else in the record that the date was redacted. But even if it had been, the Court finds the redaction proper. The touchstone of the inquiry is whether disclosure of the date would \"reveal some secret aspect of the grand jury's investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.

ECF No. 12-2, Boucher Decl. \u00b6 53. ATF also withheld two draft documents prepared by the Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) in response to the plaintiff's motions in his underlying criminal case (they were forwarded to ATF for review and comment) because they \"contain the thoughts and initial legal strategy and arguments employed in preparation of filing a response to Plaintiff's motions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   FOIA exemption 5 exempts from disclosure \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5).

Even so, the Court finds that the two draft documents prepared by the AUSA and shared with ATF for review were properly withheld under the deliberative process privilege. The documents were \"predecisional\" in that no final agency action had been taken and were deliberative in that they were shared as part of a consultative\n   process.\n   <em>\n    Mapother v.

The documents contained legal analysis by the AUSA, in this case counsel for ATF, and were prepared in anticipation of litigation. The Court also finds that the 28 pages of draft legal filings were properly withheld under the attorney-client privilege. Ms. Boucher's declaration notes that the documents contained the legal advice of the AUSA handling the underlying criminal prosecution of the plaintiff and contained analysis of facts and law.

Additionally, the plaintiff appears to be justifying disclosure based on a private, not a public, interest.

Ms. Boucher further declares that \"[a]ll releasable information has been provided to Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669544,727181\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/177/1022/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The agency is entitled to a presumption that it properly segregated the information.\n   <em>\n    Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Service\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565051,6047422\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1106/\">\n    494 F.3d 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1117 (D.C. Cir. 2007). The plaintiff has not provided any evidence to rebut that presumption in this case. The Court finds that ATF properly released any \"reasonably segregable portion of the record.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    4. Document Referrals\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The plaintiff also appears to call into question the referral of documents between the defendant agencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, ECF No. 1 at 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 15-1 at 6. It is unclear if the plaintiff alleges that ATF improperly withheld documents by referring to other agencies, as his claim appears to center on EOUSA's alleged improper referral of documents. However, even if he did intend to allege improper conduct by ATF, he has not provided evidence, nor has the Court found evidence, indicating that the referral led to improper withholding of records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sussman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565051,6047422\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1106/\">\n    494 F.3d at 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   dismissal of the suit as to defendants EOUSA, FBI, and DEA, and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   defendant ATF's motion for summary judgement. ECF No. 12. The case is hereby dismissed. A separate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Plaintiff represents that the FBI informed him in a letter that his appeal was received on June 16, 2009 and not on May 11, 2009 as proffered by the FBI.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 15 at 18. However, even if the Court accepts that date as correct, the plaintiff's suit against the FBI would still be barred by the statute of limitations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
