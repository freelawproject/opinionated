ECF No. 103. Carlin filed an opposition (ECF No. 112) to which defendants replied (ECF No. 120).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This action has an extensive factual and procedural history,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   but in brief, this action involves the various agency decisions and federal permits issued by the BLM authorizing a mining project on land known as the Tosawihi Quarries located in Elko County, Nevada.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specific portions of the quarries have been identified by plaintiff the Battle Mountain Band of the Te-Moak Tribe of Western Shoshone Indians (\"Battle Mountain Band\" or \"the Band\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as its traditional cultural property (\"TCP\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant BLM is the federal agency responsible for overseeing and administering\n   public lands, including the public lands on which the Tosawihi Quarries and the Battle Mountain Band's identified TCPs exist. As part of its administration of these lands, the BLM is authorized to issue permits and leases for use of the land, including the mining of natural resources. The BLM is also authorized to make eligibility determinations for the inclusion of land, including TCPs, on the National Register of Historic Places (\"National Register\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At all relevant times, defendant Silvey was the Elko District Manager of the BLM and was the person in charge of the Tosawihi Quarries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Intervenor Carlin is the owner of certain mining rights within the Tosawihi Quarries. In 2008, Carlin applied for a permit from the BLM to convert certain land within the quarries from an exploratory mining area into a functional mining operation known as the Hollister Mine Project (\"the project\"). The project was ultimately approved by the BLM on March 31, 2014, after six-years of agency and public review including: the issuance of environmental impact statements as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"); the completion of Class III historical surveys and inventories\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (\"NHPA\"); several BLM decisions concerning the eligibility of the Battle Mountain Band's identified TCPs for inclusion on the National Register;\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the negotiation of an ongoing agreement for the preservation of historic lands during the project between the BLM, Carlin, and non-parties the Nevada State Historic Preservation Office (\"NSHPO\") and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (\"ACHP\"), known as the Programmatic Agreement (\"project PA\");\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the issuance\n   of a final Record of Decision (\"ROD\") approving the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In late 2015, after the project ROD had been issued, the Battle Mountain Band invoked the dispute resolution provisions of the project PA in an effort to have the BLM determine the eligibility of new TCPs, not previously identified during the six-year NHPA and NEPA review process, for inclusion on the National Register. On April 19, 2016, after completion of the dispute resolution process, the BLM, without consultation with Carlin, determined that the newly identified TCPs were eligible for inclusion on the National Register. Thereafter, on May 19, 2016, the Battle Mountain Band filed the underlying complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief alleging that defendants violated NHPA by failing to reconsider their decision to allow Carlin to proceed with the project on land which the BLM now considers eligible for the National Register.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response to the Band's complaint, Carlin filed a motion to intervene under Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (ECF No. 20) which was granted by the court (ECF No. 55). After being granted the right to intervene in this action, Carlin filed cross-claims against defendants alleging three causes of action: (1) violation of NHPA; (2) violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%203809\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 3809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (3) violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"). ECF No. 98. In its cross-claims, Carlin alleges that defendants' failure to consult with Carlin on the BLM's April 2016 decision that certain land within the Tosawihi Quarries was eligible for inclusion on the National Register was procedurally improper and contrary to Carlin's rights under the project PA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%203809\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thereafter, defendants filed the present motion to dismiss Carlin's cross-claims on the basis of Article III and prudential standing.

As such, defendants argue that Carlin has no ongoing consultation rights on eligibility determination that arises later in the project. The court disagrees. Specifically, the court has reviewed the documents and pleadings on file in this matter and finds that under the project PA Carlin is entitled to ongoing consultation on National Register eligibility determinations on land within the project area for the duration of the mining project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In support of their position, defendants identify three provisions of the project PA they contend establish that Carlin does not have any ongoing consultation rights on eligibility determinations: Section D(12)(c);\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section D(2)(f);\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Section\n   D(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argue that both Sections D(2)(f) and D(12)(c) govern ongoing consultation of certain decisions for the duration of the project and specifically identify and limit that ongoing consultation to Tribal governments and tribal groups like the Battle Mountain Band.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 106, Ex. 1, Section D(2)(f) (stating that the BLM shall consult with \"Tribal Governments, tribal groups, and interested persons within the tribal communities\"); Section D(12)(c) (stating that the BLM shall consult with \"Tribal Governments\"). In contrast, defendants argue that Section D(3), which they admit includes Carlin as a \"Consulting Party,\" specifically limits Carlin's consultation rights to the time immediately following Carlin's completion of Class III inventories in 2013 and terminated shortly after.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 106, Ex. 1, Section D(3) (stating that \"[t]he BLM, in consultation with the SHPO, Tribal Governments, and other Consulting Parties shall evaluate all Cultural Resources (including TCPs) identified within the applicable APEs for Eligibility to the [National Register] (utilizing criteria found in 36 CFR 60.4 ) as inventories and revisits are completed.\"). Thus, defendants contend that because the ongoing consultation provisions of the project PA (which defendants narrowly limit to Sections D(2)(f) and D(12)(c)) only mention Tribal parties of which Carlin is not a member, Carlin has no right under the project PA to challenge the BLM's April 2016 decision or to complain that it was not consulted during the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   However, defendants' argument is not supported by any reasonable reading of the project PA. First, the court notes that the term \"Consulting Party\" is specifically defined in the project PA as \"[o]rganizations or individuals likely to be interested in the Project and who have requested that they be consulted about Cultural Resources that would be affected by the Project.\" ECF No. 106, Ex. 1, Appendix A: Definitions. It is undisputed that Carlin is an organization likely to be interested in the mining project, given that they are the Operator of the project as that term is defined in the PA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, it is undisputed that Carlin, as a signatory to the PA, requested to be consulted about decisions, including those related to \"Cultural Resources\" that could affect the project. Moreover, defendants recognize that Carlin is a \"Consulting Party\" for Section D(3) of the project PA which specifically uses\n   that term.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11478731\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1206/#p1210\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Section D(3) (utilizing the \"Consulting Party\" language to identify parties with consultation rights). Therefore, the court finds that Carlin is a \"Consulting Party\" as defined in the project PA and is appropriately considered a \"Consulting Party\" when that term is used in the project PA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Accepting that Carlin is a \"Consulting Party\" on the PA, defendants' argument that Carlin is not entitled to ongoing consultation rights is nonsensical. Defendants do not explain, and the court cannot reconcile, why Carlin can be a \"Consulting Party\" under Section D(3), but not a \"Consulting Party\" under Section D(12)(c), when both sections use the same language. Compare\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11478731\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1206/#p1210\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Section D(3) (\"The BLM, in consultation with ... other Consulting Parties) with Section D(12)(f) (\"Consultation with Consulting Parties\"). Such a narrow interpretation of the project PA, which excludes Carlin from Section D(12)(c), is contrary to accepted principles concerning the interpretation of contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flores v. Am. Seafoods Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1533878\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/335/904/#p910\">\n    335 F.3d 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 910 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that a written contract must be read as a whole and every part interpreted with reference to the whole, with preference given to reasonable interpretations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, neither Section D(2)(f) nor Section D(12)(c) expressly governs consultation on National Register eligibility determinations and thus, do not support defendants' argument. Section D(12)(c), which is in the section of the project PA entitled Time Frames, governs ongoing consultation for the \"determination and implementation of treatment plans\" to protect cultural resources discovered during the project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 106, Ex. 1, Section D(12)(c). There is no mention of consultation on eligibility determinations anywhere in this section. Similarly, Section D(2)(f) involves ongoing consultation with tribes on the identification of TCPs. Identification of TCPs is a legally distinct process from eligibility determinations and only an Indian Tribe has the authority to identify its own TCPs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation\n   </em>\n   , 479 F.3d at 1029. However, the mere identification of a TCP by a tribe does not automatically make it eligible for inclusion on the National Register. Instead, eligibility determinations are made by a special process conducted by the relevant agency, in this case the BLM, pursuant to statutory guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2060.4\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, it makes sense that Carlin is not a consulting party to the Band's TCP designations as it has no authority to either identify the Band's traditional cultural property or challenge the Band's identification of its own TCPs. And, in contrast to Sections D(3) and D(12)(c), the term \"Consulting Party\" is not found in Section D(2)(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The only contract provision identified by the BLM that mentions eligibility determinations is Section D(3) which defendants concede includes Carlin as a consulting party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 106, Ex. 1, Section D(3) (\"The BLM, in consultation with ... other Consulting Parties shall evaluate all Cultural Properties (including TCPs) ... for eligibility to the [National Register] ... as inventories and revisits are completed.\"). Defendants argue that Carlin's consultation rights under Section D(3) were limited to immediately after Carlin completed the cultural inventories during project approval and did not continue past project approval. However, the plain language of Section D(3) is not so limited. Rather, the plain language provides that \"Consulting Parties\" shall be consulted on eligibility determinations \"as inventories and revisits are completed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2060.4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The PA does not define what constitutes a \"revisit\" to the project area and the term is not mentioned elsewhere in the PA. The word \"revisit\" can be either a verb, meaning \"to consider or discuss again,\" or it can be\n   used as a noun, meaning \"a second or repeated consideration or discussion of a subject.\" American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (Fifth Ed. 2016). As used in Section D(3), the word revisit can reasonably be interpreted to be a noun and the court finds that, based on its use and the purpose of Section D(3), the term revisit should be understood to mean \"second or repeated consideration or discussion of a subject.\" As this case concerns the subsequent designation of TCPs in and around the project area after Carlin's inventory, a reasonable reading of the revisit language would include consideration of eligibility determinations on TCPs\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the completion of Class III inventories because such determinations are repeated considerations or discussions of the same underlying issue: whether TCPs identified by the Battle Mountain Band are eligible for inclusion on the National Register. It would be incongruous to allow the Band to continue to identify TCPs on project land after the BLM issues its ROD and seek to have those TCPs included on the National Register but preclude Carlin from having any consultation rights on eligibility determinations on those TCPs simply because a ROD had already been issued, especially when such an eligibility determination can have a significant impact on Carlin's ability to conduct mining operations under the project. The court shall not so narrowly construe the project PA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Additionally, several other provisions of the project PA, which were not identified or relied upon by defendants in their briefing, support the court's interpretation that Carlin is entitled to ongoing consultation rights on subsequent eligibility determinations for the duration of the project. For example, both Sections D(3)(a) and (b) specifically require the BLM to consult with \"Consulting Parties\" on all determinations of whether certain TCPs may be eligible for inclusion on the National Register.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 106, Ex. 1, Section D(3)(a) (\"The BLM shall require the Contractor conducting the Class III inventory to make initial recommendations regarding Eligibility, but determinations of Eligibility will be made by the BLM in consultation with the SHPO, taking into consideration the views of the Consulting Parties.\"); Section D(3)(b) (\"The BLM shall apply the NRHP criteria to properties proposed as TCPs in consultation with Tribal Governments and other Consulting Parties, and with the SHPO's concurrence determine whether such properties are eligible.\"). Further, several provisions in Section D(4), which governs the procedures the BLM must follow when historic or cultural properties (including TCPs) are identified on project land, require consultation with Carlin. In particular, Sections D(4)(a)(3), D(4)(a)(4), D(4)(b), and D(4)(c) all use the \"Consulting Party\" language when discussing the BLM's consultation duties.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 106, Ex. 1, Section D(4)(b) (\"Avoidance. The BLM, in consultation with ... Consulting Parties ... shall ensure that Operator avoids Adverse Effects to Historic Properties through project design or redesigning[.]\"). And, nowhere in these provisions is consultation limited or restricted to the time period immediately following the completion of Class III inventories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, the court's interpretation of the PA is supported by defendant Silvey's own written interpretation of the BLM's ongoing consultation duties under the project PA. On November 20, 2015, after the Battle Mountain Band had initiated the dispute resolution process against the BLM, defendant Silvey authored a letter to Director Nelson, the director of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, in response to the Band's initial identification of new TCPs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 112, Ex. 1. In that letter, Silvey stated that the BLM \"will consult with the Band, as well as the operator, Carlin Resources, on the eligibility\n   of the new TCP values prior to making determinations of eligibility\" as to whether the Battle Mountain Band's newly identified TCPs could be included on the National Register.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2060.4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, Silvey stated that the BLM \"will consult with Carlin Resources because BLM's determinations may affect their interest in the area, as well as the fact that Carlin signed the PA as an invited signatory.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2060.4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Although the court recognizes that Silvey does not identify any specific provision of the project PA in her letter, she does provide her official opinion about the BLM's consultation duties for ongoing eligibility determinations and specifically notes Carlin's interest in new eligibility determinations. Further, the letter reflects Silvey's official understanding of how the BLM should proceed under the project PA when new eligibility determinations need to be made. A reasonable person could interpret Silvey's statements as promising that Carlin would be part of the consultation process. Therefore, based on the above, the court finds that defendants' alleged failure to consult with Carlin prior to the BLM's April 2016 decision is sufficient to allege an \"injury in fact\" for purposes of constitutional standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants make an additional argument that even if Carlin had a right to consultation under the project PA, Carlin has not suffered any concrete harm. In particular, defendants argue that because the BLM's April 2016 decision has not had any effect on Carlin's ability to proceed on the project as Carlin was able to construct the power line which was the focus of the Battle Mountain Band's motion for a preliminary injunction (ECF No. 27) and thus, Carlin has not been affected by the BLM's decision. The court finds this argument disingenuous. Carlin had to intervene in this action and spend significant resources to litigate the Band's motion and protect its rights in the mining project against both defendants and the Band. Thus, the BLM's decision had a direct impact on Carlin. Further, it is a foundational principle of contract law that when a binding agreement is breached, the non-breaching party has suffered an injury and may seek judicial remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Moreover, it is not necessary that Carlin show that the alleged procedural injury caused it economic harm. It is sufficient for a plaintiff alleging a procedural injury to show that they have a procedural right that may potentially protect their interests.\n   <em>\n    Salmon Spawning &amp; Recovery All. v.

Nor is it necessary for Carlin to show that participation and consultation in the eligibility determination would have actually changed the outcome of the BLM's April 2016 decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p559\">\n    504 U.S. at 572-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p559\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that it is not necessary for a plaintiff to prove that the actual outcome of an agency decision would have changed if the agency had followed the alleged proper procedures).

Carlin's mining project, approved under the requirements of the NHPA, is part of that purpose. Further, it is undisputed that Carlin and the BLM entered into the project PA in order to comply with their various obligations under Section 106 of the NHPA. Where an agency or a party violates a provision of an agreement substituting for Section 106, like the project PA in this case, the violation of the agreement can constitute a violation of the NHPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muckleshoot Indian Tribe v.
