Second Amended Complaint (\"Compl.\") at 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Currently before the Court is the Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (\"Defs.' Mot.\"), which seeks summary judgment on the CIA's, the Executive Office's, and the Director's responses to the plaintiffs' FOIA requests. <em>See</em> Defs.' Mot. at 1. Upon consideration of the parties' submissions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Court concludes that it must grant in part and deny in part the defendants' motion.</p><p id=\"p-9\"><strong>I. BACKGROUND</strong></p><p id=\"p-10\">The undisputed facts relevant to the defendants' motion are the following. <em>See generally</em> Pls.' Facts (not disputing any the defendants' facts). On December 10, 2015, the plaintiffs submitted a FOIA request to the Director, <em>see</em> Defs.' Facts \u00b6 27, seeking \"copies of all [of the Director's] records pertaining to [Thomas Andrews] Drake from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2011,\" <em>id.</em> \u00b6 28. Specifically, the plaintiffs sought all records concerning \"the criminal/intelligence investigation into [the] activities\" of Drake, who was a \"former NSA employee.\" Compl. \u00b6 9.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Director \"reasonably determined\" that its \"Office of General Counsel, [ ] Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General, and [ ] National Counterintelligence and Security Center\" would \"potentially have documents responsive to [the p]laintiffs' FOIA request[ ].\" Defs.' Facts \u00b6 29. The Director therefore instructed those offices to \"conduct[ ] systematic searches of both their <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"294\" href=\"#p294\" id=\"p294\">*294</a>physical and electronic records\" for potentially responsive documents. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 30. \"Only the Office of the General Counsel identified any potentially responsive records, which were then reviewed by the [Director's] Information Management Division [ ] to determine whether these documents were actually responsive to [the p]laintiffs' FOIA request.\" <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 32.</p><p id=\"p-11\">Based on its review of the potentially responsive documents that were located, the Director \"identified four documents, which it ha[d] designated [as] Documents A, B, C, and D, as responsive to [the p]laintiffs' FOIA request.\" <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 33. On July 28, 2016, the Director \"released a redacted version of Document A, an e-mail thread,\" <em>id.</em> \u00b6 35, and on October 3, 2016, the Director \"released redacted versions of Documents B and C, both also e-mail threads,\" <em>id.</em> \u00b6 36. The Director redacted information from Documents A, B, and C pursuant to several FOIA exemptions. <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 38-39. The Director \"referred Document D to the NSA for review and direct release to [the p]laintiffs,\" <em>id.</em> \u00b6 34, and this document is not a subject of this memorandum opinion.</p><p id=\"p-12\">The plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint asserts eleven separate causes of actions. <em>See generally</em> Compl. Through their motion, the defendants seek summary judgment only as to counts three, ten, and eleven. <em>See</em> Defs.' Mot. at 1; <em>see also</em> Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-29, 63-72. The plaintiffs now challenge only the Director's redactions of Documents A and B pursuant to the deliberative process privilege of FOIA Exemption 5, <em>see</em> Pls.' Opp'n at 1, 5, which relates to count eleven of the plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint, <em>see</em> Compl. \u00b6 68-72.</p><p id=\"p-13\"><strong>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</strong></p><p id=\"p-14\">The Court must grant a motion for summary judgment \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Holcomb v.

The Court must therefore draw \"all justifiable inferences\" in the non-moving party's favor and accept the non-moving party's evidence as true. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p255\">477 U.S. 242</extracted-citation>, 255, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p255\">106 S.Ct. 2505</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p255\">91 L.Ed.2d 202</extracted-citation> (1986).

If the Court concludes that \"the nonmoving party has failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of [its] case with respect to which [it] has the burden of proof,\" then the moving party is entitled to summary judgment. <em>Celotex Corp. v.

Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). The Court will grant summary judgment to the government in a FOIA case only if the agency can prove \"that it has fully discharged its obligations under the FOIA, after the underlying facts and the inferences to be drawn from them are construed in the light most favorable to the FOIA requester.\" <em>Friends of Blackwater v.
