Rather, the language in the e-mail responding to the e-mail containing the redacted language raises an inference that the withheld information was merely an update on the status of the Drake prosecution, and the Director's involvement in that matter is not clear from what has been submitted to the Court.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Ewing Decl., Ex.

Similar to his explanation of the redactions in Document A, Ewing explains that the language redacted in Document B \"relates to [ ] employees' assessments and frank comments related to the investigation and prosecution\" of Drake and \"includes ... discussions and assessments regarding what next steps [the Director] should take.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 37. While this description provides more context on the withheld information in Document B than Ewing's description of Document A (i.e., Ewing's inclusion of the phrase \"next steps\"), it, however, also fails to provide the Court \" 'the minimal information necessary to make a determination' concerning [the] applicability of the deliberative process privilege.\"\n      <em>\n       Elec.
