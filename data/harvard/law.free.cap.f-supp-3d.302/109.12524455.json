First Hardy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-35. The FBI searched the Central Records System (\"CRS\"), which consists of records of \"applicant, investigative, intelligence, personnel, administrative, and general files\" that spans the entire FBI including its headquarters, field offices, and legal offices worldwide.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.

First Hardy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-27. These case management systems enable those searching to gain access to multiple indices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 27.

And then a district court must always determine for itself whether the record and any undisputed material facts justify granting summary judgment. These standards cannot be satisfied if, as allowed by Local Rule 7(b), the District Court simply grants judgment \"as conceded\" when the nonmoving party fails to meet a deadline.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 507 (internal citations, quotation marks, and edits omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    But that is not what happened in this case.

And here, unlike in\n    <em>\n     Winston &amp; Strawn\n    </em>\n    , plaintiffs filed a timely opposition to the motion for summary judgment. Thus, plaintiffs have availed themselves of the opportunity provided in Rule 56(c) to address all of defendant's assertions of fact, and, pursuant to Rule 56(e), the Court may consider facts \"undisputed for purposes of the motion\" when \"a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact ....\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. Since plaintiffs have not presented facts that would give rise to a genuine dispute of material fact concerning the invocation of Exemptions 1, 3, 5, 7(A), and 7(D), there is no dispute for the Court to adjudicate, and the requirements of Rule 56 have been satisfied.\n    <em>\n     See e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Shapiro v.
