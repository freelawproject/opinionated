(Doc. 58 at \u00b6 1). It contends that defendants-Forrester Wehrle Homes, Inc.; Wehrle Development, Ltd.; and their principals Jeffrey, Richard, and Joseph Wehrle (collectively, FWH)-infringed DB's copyrights in twenty-three architectural plans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 35-36). The defendants allegedly did so by copying DB's plans, marketing the copied plans, creating unauthorized derivative works, and using DB's plans to build homes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 44-59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending are,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the defendants' motions for summary judgment on the issue of substantial similarity (Doc. 82) and to exclude the declaration of Carl Cuozzo. (Doc. 97). Because FWH has not shown that no reasonable jury could find that its designs are substantially similar to DB's works at the protected level of expression, I deny the motion for summary judgment. I also deny the motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   DB is an architectural-design firm based in Omaha, Nebraska. (Doc. 58 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 10). Since the 1980s, DB has \"marketed its original custom and ready-made home plans for single and multi-family homes through plan catalogs, home building industry publications ... client-specific publications, and the internet.\" (Doc. 83-1 at 2). DB holds copyrights in roughly 2,000 home designs. (Doc. 82-1 at 8);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Design Basics, LLC v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20). After the housing-market collapse of 2008, however, DB's licensing revenues shrank by seventy-five percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20). DB's owners started looking for someone to take over the business, and, in 2009, Myles Sherman and Patrick Carmichael purchased DB. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Since the change in ownership, DB has \"authored approximately 350 new original architectural works[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The company also began undertaking copyright litigation in federal courts across the country.\n   <em>\n    Lexington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276651\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1093/#p1096\">\n    858 F.3d at 1096-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting Carmichael's testimony that \"proceeds from litigation have become a principal revenue stream for [DB]\"). Based on a search of the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) database, it appears that DB has filed at least 103 copyright infringement lawsuits since June, 2009, with the vast majority of the filings coming in or after 2013. As the Seventh Circuit recognized, the flood of litigation is a product of the company's internal and acknowledged \"bounty program.\" According to Sherman, \"[t]heft of DB's readily available copyrighted works is rampant and has been for nearly two decades-since the rise of the internet and the ready availability of its plans.\" (Doc. 83-2 at \u00b6 10). Accordingly, DB \"offers its employees incentives to scout out potential copyright infringement cases, paying its employees a finder's fee in the form of a percentage of the net recovery relating to any home plans that they located\" on the Internet.\n   <em>\n    Lexington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276651\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1093/#p1096\">\n    858 F.3d at 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. DB's Relationship with FWH\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   FWH is a family-run business located in Maumee, Ohio, that builds homes in Northwest Ohio and Southeastern Michigan. (Doc. 81-1 at 4-10; Doc. 87-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The relationship between DB and FWH dates back to 1993, when DB licensed two of its architectural plans-the Ashton and the Albany-to FWH. (Doc. 58 at \u00b6 37). Since then, DB, whether on its own initiative or at the request of FWH, mailed at least fifteen of its catalogs containing additional architectural designs to FWH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 83-3 at \u00b6 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In March, 2013, while DB was preparing \"marketing efforts\" in Ohio, the company \"became aware that [FWH] had violated its copyrights in one or more distinct ways.\" (Doc. 58 at \u00b6 35). DB acquired this information when its \"senior designer,\" Carl Cuozzo, visited FWH's website and concluded that FWH's designs infringed DB's copyrighted plans. (Doc. 83-3 at \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   DB filed this suit in April, 2015, alleging that FWH's designs infringed DB's copyright in fifteen copyright works. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Infringement Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In November, 2016, DB filed its second amended complaint. This complaint alleged that twenty-nine of FWH's plans infringed DB's copyright in twenty-three of its own designs. (Doc. 58 at \u00b6\u00b6 35-36). It also alleged that FWH used either DB's plans, or plans FWH made by copying DB's plans, to build more than three hundred homes in Northwest Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   There are nine counts in the second amended complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Count One: Infringement of DB's copyrighted works by \"scanning, copying, and/or reproducing unauthorized copies thereof,\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Count Two: Infringement of DB's copyrighted works by \"publicly displaying on [FWH's] website(s) and elsewhere, for purposes of advertising and marketing, unauthorized copies or derivatives thereof,\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Count Three: Infringement of DB's copyrighted works by \"creating derivatives therefrom in the form of two dimensional plans and fully constructed residences,\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Count Four: Infringement of DB's copyrighted works by \"advertising, marketing, and/or selling one or more houses based upon copies or derivatives of said works,\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Counts Five through Eight: Infringement as described in Counts One through Four committed \"willfully.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Count Nine: Violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , by \"remov[ing] and omitt[ing] DB's copyright management information from copies of DB's works,\" and distributing copies or derivatives of such works with the knowledge that distributing them without DB's copyright management information would induce and facilitate further infringement of DB's copyrights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Doc. 58 at \u00b6\u00b6 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61-64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   FWH originally asserted an \"independent creation\" defense to DB's claims, but it later withdrew the defense \"with prejudice\" as to all of the allegedly infringing works except FWH's Franklin design.

The defendants filed: 1) a motion for partial summary judgment on statute-of-limitations grounds (Doc. 81); 2) a motion for summary judgment on the issue of the substantial similarity of the parties' works (Doc. 82); and 3) the motion to strike Cuozzo's declaration (Doc. 97).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   DB filed its own motion for partial summary on the issues of FWH's access to its designs and the validity of DB's copyrights.

(Docs. 84, 89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   By order entered November 14, 2017, I granted in part and denied in part FWH's motion to exclude Kraly's original report and granted in full the motion to exclude Kraly's supplemental report.\n   <em>\n    Design Basics, LLC v.

It also argues that \"external considerations eliminate any protected expression within the designs at issue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants further maintain that \"there is no protected expression in the overall look and feel of the designs at issue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, FWH argues that, even if \"any of the designs at issue had any protected expression,\" the differences between FWH's works and the protected expression in DB's works would preclude a finding that the works are substantially similar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Kraly's Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   To support these claims, FWH relies on the report of its expert, Ohio architect Richard Kraly. (Doc. 115 at 33, 34, 35, 37, 46).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The crux of Kraly's opinion is that \"the total composition of each [of DB's architectural works] is the direct result of standard pieces / parts and relationships which include industry-accepted and client-expectations for room sizes, industry and client-desired relationships of the interior rooms and specific functions of the individual rooms that determine their placement in the overall scheme.\" (Doc. 82-7 at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   According to Kraly, no arrangement of expression of exterior or interior elements-roof planes, doors, windows, ceilings, or \"walk-and-pass through openings\"-is protected, because all such \"expression\" is \"standard to the industry, details within the public domain and are functional elements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). In making this claim, however, Kraly did not attempt to demonstrate how functionalism, industry standards, or details within the public domain required DB to\n   make any of the countless design choices the company made in composing the plans at issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6, 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Kraly also opined that \"[t]he arrangement of individual living spaces\" is unprotected because all such arrangements \"are usual and customary to the design and construction of residences.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). Once again, Kraly did not explain how \"usual and customary\" space arrangements dictated that DB make any particular design decisions in any of the plans at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Next, Kraly opined that all \"[r]oom sizes are usual and customary to accommodate furniture and passage through areas based upon the intended use of the space.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). He observed that: 1) room heights vary between eight and ten feet; 2) \"[t]he top / head levels of window[s] usually align with the top edges of doors;]\" and 3) kitchen and bathroom countertops are usually thirty to thirty-six inches above the floor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In the next paragraph of his report, Kraly declared that \"[f]eatures within rooms are standard / functional with details specific to the intended use\" of the room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). To illustrate the point, Kraly noted that kitchens and bathrooms regularly include \"cabinets / countertops and plumbing fixtures.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Kraly then opined that, in the home-construction field, builders and contractors rely on \"standard materials\" like \"2x4 / 2s6 wall studs, floor joists of 2x_ joists and / or truss joists.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It is also common, Kraly continues, to use \"fiberglass shingles, clay tile, slate, wood shakes or metal panels\" to build a roof. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Kraly also observed that \"[t]he planning, design and on-site construction of residences are required to comply with specific residential building codes\" that may, consequently, dictate the appearance, size, or arrangement of a given house or its interior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Kraly did not, however, cite to any particular building code that might have affected how DB designed its plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Finally, Kraly opined that builder and consumer preferences affect \"design and construction practices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to Kraly, builders generally prefer that \"rooms with plumbing fixtures ...be clustered for efficiency of water supply and drain lines to that area of the house.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Likewise, customers prefer: 1) to \"separat[e] master bedroom suites from children [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] bedrooms\"; 2) \"inclusion of in-kitchen countertop for casual dining plus adjacent breakfast area\"; and 3) attached garages to avoid exposure to weather. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Again, however, Kraly did not elaborate on how such preferences might have caused DB to make certain design choices that would deprive DB's works of copyright protection.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tiseo Architects, supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3563810\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/344/#p345\">\n    495 F.3d at 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (no protected expression where plaintiff based many elements of its architectural sketches on the client's original sketches).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    2. DB's Supplemental Brief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In its opposition brief, DB argues that, under Kraly's opinion, \"every element and arrangement in a residential design would not be protected expression because they are all 'standard' or 'functionally-required.' \" (Doc. 118 at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   DB contends that adopting this mode of analysis would \"eviscerate\" the Architectural Works Copyright Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Stat.%205089\">\n    104 Stat. 5089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -the federal law that extended copyright protection to architectural works,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Chirco v.

Mich.) -and \"ignore[ ] the creativity of a professional architect[.]\" (Doc. 118 at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   By way of a hyperbolic example, DB argues that not even Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater would contain protected expression under Kraly's mode of analysis. This is so, DB contends, because at the most granular level even Fallingwater comprises \"functionally required and standard elements such as roof planes,\n   windows, doors, walls, ceilings, [and] floors,\" and contains \"standard arrangements of rooms, such as a dining room adjacent to a kitchen, a great room...displacing formal living rooms, [and a] clustering of bedrooms and bathrooms[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Homing in on the particulars of Kraly's opinions, DB contends that \"[i]ndustry standards dictate only how a building is put together[,] not how it is actually designed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). While standards may exist for tasks like hanging drywall, pouring concrete, and \"toenailing wood structures,\" DB contends that \"[n]one of these standards affects the design of the house.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). To the contrary, DB asserts-without citation to any evidence-\"the design of the work dictates the required industry standards.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Regarding the role of consumer expectations and zoning requirements, DB argues that they are \"not universal, but instead vary from state to state.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Finally, DB disputes FWH's attempt to pigeonhole its architectural works as belonging to a recognized architectural style: the \"conventional, modestly priced\" home.

Impermissible Legal Conclusions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   First, Kraly's opinion is in significant-and perhaps irreconcilable-tension with the persuasive case law finding that copyright protection in architectural works extends to an author's arrangement of standard, unprotected design elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   According to Kraly, any such arrangement in the design for a single-family home-be it a window placement, room placement within the floor plan, or fixture placements within a given room-is unprotected expression. (Doc. 82-7 at 5-7). This is so, Kraly maintains, because such arrangements are \"usual and customary to the design and construction of residences.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   But as district courts nationwide have concluded, copyright protection in plans for residential homes extends to precisely those kinds of design choices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Architects Collective\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274627\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/247/1322/#p1342\">\n    247 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1342 ;\n   <em>\n    J &amp; V Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5763552\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/130/1266/#p1278\">\n    130 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1278-81 ;\n   <em>\n    Lennar Homes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357988\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/117/913/#p933\">\n    117 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   934 ;\n   <em>\n    Frank Betz Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%204628203\">\n    2010 WL 4628203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Much of Kraly's report on this score therefore reads like an expert giving an impermissible-and, in this case, an incorrect-legal conclusion. As I explained in\n   <em>\n    Design Basics I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205467152\">\n    2017 WL 5467152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4, when I granted the motion to exclude Kraly's report in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   [Kraly] examine[d] DB's design plans and conclude[d] that they lack 'original expression' necessary to meet the restrictions of a copyright designation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Kraly's belief that DB's designs do not merit copyright protection is a legal conclusion-and a subject on which I do not need the judgment of witnesses. Thus, insofar as the original report offers opinions that plaintiff's copyrights are meaningless and of no value ... these opinions must be excluded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Thus, to the extent Kraly opines that basic design choices are not entitled to copyright protection, I reject his opinion as an impermissible, and incorrect, legal conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Unsupported Opinions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Second, two critical parts of Kraly's opinion are: 1) his conclusion that external considerations dictated all of DB's design choices, such that the ensuing designs are not original to DB (Doc. 82-7 at 5-6); and 2) his assertion that all of DB's design choices are unprotected because those choices are usual and customary for the style of architecture at issue (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   To the extent Kraly opines that external factors and genre conventions can dictate design choices, his opinion is unproblematic. The Sixth Circuit recognized as much in\n   <em>\n    Tiseo Architects\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3563810\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/344/#p345\">\n    495 F.3d at 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (client's wishes, as expressed in prior sketches, limited the amount of protected expression in plaintiff's work), and I accepted as much in\n   <em>\n    Design Basics II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205444569\">\n    2017 WL 5444569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3-4 (merger and\n   <em>\n    scenes a faire\n   </em>\n   doctrines can limit protected expression).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   But Kraly's opinion that DB's designs contain no protected expression whatsoever proves too much and too little.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Taken at face value, his blanket assertion that \"the total composition of each [DB design] is the direct result of standard pieces / parts and relationships\" (Doc. 118 at 11) means that no architectural design for a home can contain protected expression. As DB correctly observes, every home, at the root level, exists as a composition of \"standard pieces / parts and relationships,\" the structure and appearance of which flows, in some measure, from \"industry-accepted and client expectations\" for room sizes and arrangements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Courts have held, however, that architects are entitled to copyright protection when they arrange these features in original ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   More importantly, Kraly failed to demonstrate-failed even to opine with the faintest degree of specificity-how the external considerations he identified in his report controlled, dictated, or affected the specific design choices DB made when composing the plans at issue. Without such evidence, a reasonable jury would have no basis-other than pure speculation-to conclude that DB's design choices are unprotected.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arendale v. City of Memphis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552853\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/587/#p605\">\n    519 F.3d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 605 (6th Cir. 2008) (\"conjecture or conclusory accusations\" cannot support a grant of summary judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    a. External Considerations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   As noted above, Kraly opined that industry standards, customary practices, and functional considerations influence \"the design and construction of residences.\" (Doc. 82-7 at 5-6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10). But Kraly never explains how any particular industry standard or functional concern-or any external consideration at all-dictated the scores of design choices that DB made in composing its architectural works.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   This omission in Kraly's report comes into focus when one examines his opinion alongside the specific design choices that DB contends represent protected expression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   To take but one example, DB alleges that FWH's Alexander plan infringes its Kaiser plan. Both are designs for a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom home. According to DB, the Kaiser includes several original design elements (all of which FWH allegedly copied when composing the Alexander):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   \u2022 Placing the half-bath on the first floor adjacent to the master bedroom, even though the \"Powder Room, provided for guests' convenience, is [ordinarily] located away from private areas of the plan.\" (Doc. 118 at 23).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   \u2022 Use of a \"bay bump-out\" window on the first floor. This was \"a purely aesthetic decision by DB that is not required for the functionality or performance of the room.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   \u2022 Arranging a unique hallway shape on the second floor that \"mirror[s] angled doors across from one another\" and \"plac[es] the Bathroom and linen closet on the opposite side of the long end of the hallway, split by the stair.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Nevertheless, Kraly's report does not explain how an external factor-be it customer or builder preferences, a zoning code, functionalism, or a combination thereof-dictated that DB incorporate these features into the Kaiser. And though DB has alleged that each of its other plans incorporate similarly protected design choices (Doc. 118-1 at 2-19), Kraly's report similarly fails to address how external considerations dictated those choices, so as to strip those designs, in whole or in part, of protected expression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   For these reasons, Kraly's opinion does not permit a reasonable jury to conclude that DB's plans contain no protected expression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Stylistic Conventions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Likewise, Kraly failed to substantiate his opinion that all of DB's design choices are unprotected because those choices are \"standard and customary\" to the design of single-family homes. (Doc. 82-7 at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   To begin, Kraly does not say what he means by a \"standard and customary\" style of residential homes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-10). Nor does he identify the design features or characteristics that define this style of architecture. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, Kraly does not explain how the conventions of this style dictated that DB design its plans in precisely the way it did. For example, Kraly does not discuss why stylistic conventions required DB to incorporate a bump-out bay window on the first floor of the Kaiser or why DB had to incorporate mirrored doorways in the second-floor hallway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Given the absence of evidence establishing that stylistic conventions in fact controlled DB's design choices, this case is distinguishable from the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Zalewski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , on which FWH heavily relies. (Doc. 115 at 23-27, 30-32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The plaintiff in that case granted the defendants licenses \"to use several colonial home designs he had created.\"\n   <em>\n    Zalewski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 754 F.3d at 98. He alleged that defendants infringed his copyrights by \"customizing his designs for their customers\" and marketing the customized designs without his consent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99. According to plaintiff, the defendants \"copied the overall size, shape, and silhouette of his designs, as well as the placement of rooms, windows, doors, closets, stairs, and other architectural features.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   On appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed a judgment in favor of the defendants. The court recognized that defendants had copied the plaintiff's work, but it held that what the defendants had copied was unprotected expression:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   \"[M]ost of the similarities between Plaintiff's and Defendants' designs are\n   features of all colonial homes, or homes generally. So long as Plaintiff was seeking to design a colonial house, he was bound to certain conventions...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   Plaintiff makes no attempt to distinguish those aspects of his designs that were original to him from those dictated by the form in which he worked. For example, Zalewski claims that the front porches are the same design, size, and in the same location. But a door centered on the front of the house is typical of many homes, and colonials in particular.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 107.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The Second Circuit pointed to \"several treatises\" in the record that \"describe the basics of colonial architecture,\" and the court relied on that evidence to support its judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 106 n.20. Kraly's report, in contrast, is bereft of any citation to treatises or other learned sources that would permit a jury to find that stylistic conventions bound DB to design its homes in a particular way.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J &amp; V Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5763552\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/130/1266/#p1278\">\n    130 F.Supp.3d at 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding, in a case featuring DB as the plaintiff, that \"this case is distinguishable because the designs in question are not of a particular style, such as the colonial style discussed in\n   <em>\n    Zalewski\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Perhaps it is the case, as the court in\n   <em>\n    J &amp; V Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5763552\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/130/1266/#p1278\">\n    130 F.Supp.3d at 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , suggested, that \"the style of 'conventional, modestly priced housing,' which the defendants allege [is] present in this case, may require certain specific features.\" But as that court likewise concluded, and as I conclude here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   at this juncture in the case, it is not entirely clear what those features are. For example, the court in\n   <em>\n    Zalewski\n   </em>\n   found that the identical placement of the doors in the plaintiff's and defendant's designs did not show substantial similarity because a colonial style specifically required a door centered at the front of the house. In contrast,\n   <em>\n    the defendants have provided no evidence of this type to support an argument that the 'conventional, modestly priced' style of house requires the placement or the arrangement of features in any specific way\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5763552\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/130/1266/#p1278\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In sum, DB has identified elements of its architectural works that qualify for copyright protection.

According to Kraly,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   [t]he many differences between the residential designs prepared by [DB] and [FWH] provide evidence [FWH] did not copy [DB] designs but rather, both products contain similar (likeness and / or resemblance of) concepts, configurations, dimensions, materials, products, features, finishes and fixtures. [FWH's] designs at issue are the result of assembling the resources (systems and materials) available to local designers and builders within Ohio in response to client expectations in the local housing market as reflected by prevailing community standards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   (Doc. 82-7 at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Kraly also produced a series of comparisons between each FWH design and the DB plan that it allegedly infringes. (Doc. 82-8 through Doc. 82-32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Kraly concluded, for example, that FWH's Alexander design is not similar to DB's Kaiser because: 1) there is only one gable on the Alexander's roof, whereas there are two on the Kaiser; 2) the Alexander features wide rectangular windows, whereas the Kaiser uses narrower windows that extend further to the ground; 3) the Alexander's kitchen includes a U-shaped countertop, while the Kaiser features an L-shaped countertop; and 4) the entry from the Alexander's garage into the house runs through a separate hallway, whereas the entry from the Kaiser's garage is through the laundry room. (Doc. 82-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   DB responds that a reasonable juror viewing its and FWH's plans side-by-side could find that the works are substantially similar. (Doc. 118 at 22-49). Regarding the Kaiser and the Alexander, for example, DB contends that \"[t]here are multiple substantial similarities of protected expression\" in the two plans. (Doc. 118 at 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   DB observes that \"all spaces are located precisely in the same arrangement and composition with respect to adjacencies and position in the overall organization of the plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). More specifically, this means that both designs: 1) include a \"comma-shaped\" master bedroom in the left rear corner of the plan; and 2) place the second-floor bedrooms over the garage and dining room. For another, DB contends that \"the designs align exactly in three-dimension.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This means that, when one design is placed on top of the other, the dimensions, room placements, and spatial configurations match almost perfectly. (Doc. 89-5 at 2) (overlay of Kaiser and Alexander plans).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Having reviewed the Kaiser and the Alexander side-by-side, and having conducted a similar review of the other infringed and infringing works at issue, I conclude that a jury must decide whether the designs are substantially similar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   First, FWH failed to establish that no reasonable juror could find that DB's works contain protected expression. For that reason, I must accept DB's contention that the all of the design choices and features at issue amount to protected expression. Accordingly, the ground on which a jury could base a substantial-similarity finding is far broader than it would be if Kraly had demonstrated that DB's designs, in whole or in part, lacked protected expression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Second, a reasonable jury viewing this ground in the light most favorable to DB could easily conclude that the firms' designs are substantially similar. Indeed, to take only one example, the evidence practically compels such a finding with regard to the Kaiser and Alexander plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   To be sure, there are some minor differences in the shapes of the windows and kitchen countertops, as well as in the number of gables on the roof. But glaring similarities abound across the plans. Both include: 1) a \"comma shaped\" master bedroom in the left rear corner of the first floor; 2) a half-bath on the first floor next to the master bedroom, despite a general preference to keep such a bathroom at a distance from the master bedroom; 3) identical bump-out bay windows in the same location on the first floor; and 4) identical hallways and mirrored doors on the second floor. (Doc. 118 at 23). These similarities are only magnified when one examines an overlay of the two plans, which tends to show that the Alexander is nearly an exact duplicate of the Kaiser. (Doc. 89-5 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   For these reasons, a reasonable juror might \"be disposed to overlook [the few differences], and regard [the designs'] aesthetic appeal as the same.\"\n   <em>\n    Peter Pan Fabrics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1956784\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/274/487/#p489\">\n    274 F.2d at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, I cannot say that, as a matter of law, the designs are so dissimilar that no reasonable jury could find for DB.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J &amp; V Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5763552\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/130/1266/#p1278\">\n    130 F.Supp.3d at 1281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Although the defendants have pointed to numerous and identifiable differences, the Court nonetheless finds that the similarities weigh in favor of denying summary judgment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

The attachments to Cuozzo's declaration facilitate that process, allowing the fact-finder to identify both similarities and differences in the various plans.
