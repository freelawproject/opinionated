Third, Ghana maintains that neither Petitioner has standing to bring the Petition because the assignment of the Award from Balkan Ghana to Balkan UK was invalid.

The court thus finds that the FSIA's arbitration exception applies in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Each of Ghana's arguments against exercising subject-matter jurisdiction under Section 1605(a)(6) is unavailing. Ghana asserts that the FSIA's arbitration exception cannot apply for two primary reasons: (1) the arbitration agreement is itself invalid under Ghanaian law, and (2) a threshold question to award confirmation is determining the validity of the assignment of the Award to Balkan UK, but the arbitration exception does not confer subject-matter jurisdiction to make that predicate assessment. The court addresses those assertions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    1. Validity of the Arbitration Clause\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Relying on Ghanaian law, Ghana argues that Section 1605(a)(6) does not apply here because the arbitration agreement is itself invalid. In Ghana's view, the arbitration clause is not severable from the PPA, and because the PPA was never approved by the Ghanaian Parliament, the government official who entered into the PPA-and the arbitration agreement contained therein-lacked the authority to do so. According to Ghana, the arbitration clause therefore was not \"made by the foreign state\" for purposes of the arbitration exception. Resp't's Reply at 4; Ampaw Decl. \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ghana's position, however, is squarely foreclosed by authority from this Circuit. In\n   <em>\n    Belize Social Development II\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit faced a similar argument concerning\n   the purported invalidity of an arbitration clause as a threshold subject-matter jurisdiction issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4287464,6786095\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/99/\">\n    794 F.3d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102 (D.C. Cir. 2015). There, the Government of Belize argued that its former Prime Minister lacked actual authority to enter into the agreement that contained the arbitration clause and, as a result, \"the agreement, including the arbitration provision, [wa]s void.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4287464,6786095\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/99/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The D.C.

Thus, to avoid jurisdiction under the arbitration exception, the court observed, Belize could not prevail by showing that the\n   <em>\n    underlying agreement\n   </em>\n   was invalid. Rather, it would have to establish that the Prime Minister lacked the authority to enter into the\n   <em>\n    arbitration agreement\n   </em>\n   itself.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4287464,6786095\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/99/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4287464,6786095\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/99/\">\n    at 102-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As did the Government of Belize, Ghana seeks to avoid subject-matter jurisdiction under the arbitration exception solely by attacking the validity of the PPA. This it cannot do. Under\n   <em>\n    Belize Social Development II\n   </em>\n   , the critical question is not whether the underlying agreement is valid, but whether the arbitration agreement\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   is invalid. Thus, Ghana's contention that the government official who signed the PPA lacked contracting authority because he did not first secure parliamentary authorization does not allow it to evade jurisdiction under the arbitration exception of the FSIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Ghana asserts that\n   <em>\n    Belize Social Development II\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because, unlike the Government of Belize, Ghana has provided an expert opinion establishing that the arbitration clause\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   is invalid under Ghanaian law. But, upon closer inspection, the expert opinion-which relies chiefly on the Ghana Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    The Attorney General v. Balkan Energy Ghana Ltd.\n   </em>\n   -solely challenges the validity of the PPA, and not the agreement to arbitrate. According to Ghana's expert, \"an arbitration clause found in an international agreement governed by Article 181 is not severable from the international agreement and is invalid if the international agreement was not approved by Parliament.\" Ampaw Decl. \u00b6 8. In his view, because the Ghana Supreme Court held that the PPA was an \"international business or economic transaction\" that required parliamentary approval, and because the arbitration clause is not severable from the PPA, the clause is therefore invalid. Stated differently, Ghana's expert challenges the validity of the arbitration clause solely by reference to the invalidity of the PPA.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Ampaw Decl. Such \"invalid agreement\n   <em>\n    ergo\n   </em>\n   invalid arbitration clause\" logic has already been rejected by the D.C. Circuit.\n   <em>\n    Belize Soc. Dev.

The court cannot depart from that precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The court could stop its analysis here, but in the interest of completeness addresses the argument that Ghana does not expressly make-that the agreement to arbitrate is itself invalid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[I]f a contract contains a general choice of law clause and provides in the arbitral clause that arbitration is to be held in a country with a different law, the latter indication must be deemed to prevail over the former.\" Albert\n   Jan van den Berg,\n   <em>\n    The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958: Towards a Uniform Judicial Interpretation\n   </em>\n   293 (1981). In this case, because the parties designated in the arbitral clause that The Hague, Netherlands was to serve as the seat of arbitration, Dutch law supplied the law applicable to the arbitration agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jay E. Genig,\n   <em>\n    International Commercial Arbitration\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7.2 (January 2018 update) (\"In the absence of any express choice [regarding the law applicable to the arbitration agreement], the applicable law is generally the law of the seat of arbitration.\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Karaha Bodas Co., LLC v.

That is precisely what the arbitral tribunal held.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Interim Award \u00b6\u00b6 152, 154. Ghana offers no argument as to why the arbitration agreement is invalid under Dutch law. Its failure to address the law that governs the arbitration agreement therefore defeats any assertion that the agreement is invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Belize Soc. Dev.

As already discussed, that view of the law is wrong. But even if the court were to consider Ghanaian law in assessing the validity of the arbitration clause, Respondent's arguments would still fail because they are based on a misreading of the Supreme Court of Ghana's decision in\n   <em>\n    The Attorney General v. Balkan Energy Ghana Ltd.\n   </em>\n   Contrary to Respondent's reading, the Supreme Court of Ghana held that the arbitration provision was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an \"international business or economic transaction\" that required Parliament's approval under Article 181(5) of the Constitution. Ghana Sup. Ct. Decision at 40-41. Notwithstanding the significance of this legal holding, Ghana's expert makes much of the language following it-wherein the court noted its \"difficulty in conceiving of [the arbitration clause] as a transaction separate and independent from the transaction that has generated the dispute it is required to resolve.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41. Based on that passage, Ghana's expert concludes that the arbitration clause is not severable from the PPA, and therefore, invalid because the PPA was not approved by the Parliament.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This court is unpersuaded by Ampaw's skewed reading of the Ghanaian Supreme Court's decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In interpreting the decision, Ampaw conveniently excludes from his block quotation of the Supreme Court's opinion the very first line of the paragraph announcing the pertinent holding: \"On the other hand, the answer to the second issue referred is that the arbitration provisions contained in clause 22.2 of the [PPA] ... [do] not constitute an international business transaction within the meaning of Article 181(5) of the Constitution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Ampaw Decl. \u00b6 4,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Ghana Sup. Ct. Decision at 41. The Supreme Court's reference to the \"second issue referred\" is to the question: \"Whether or not the arbitration provisions contained in clause 22.2 of the [PPA] ... constitutes an international business transaction within the meaning of Article 181(5) of the Constitution.\" Ghana Sup. Ct. Decision at 2-3. And, the court's use of the phrase \"on the other hand\" signals a clear pivot from its earlier holding that the PPA itself was subject to Article 181(5) approval. Thus, read in context, the Supreme Court of Ghana reached the unmistakable conclusion that, under Ghanaian law, the arbitration agreement did not require parliamentary approval and thus was valid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In sum, Ghana has not offered any evidence that the arbitration agreement itself is invalid under the law of the Netherlands, or even under the law of Ghana. Its effort to avoid subject-matter jurisdiction based on the invalidity of the arbitration agreement therefore fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    2. Effect of the Assignment on Subject-Matter Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Ghana's next argument hinges on the assignment of the Award by Balkan Ghana to Balkan UK. Ghana's argument is specific as to each Petitioner. As to Balkan Ghana, Respondent insists that the Ghanaian company cannot invoke the FSIA's arbitration exception because, by virtue of the assignment and its filings in this court, it has \"judicially admitted\" that it has no rights in the Award. As to Balkan UK, Respondent asserts that its capacity to enforce the Award is dependent on the predicate question of the assignment's validity and, as to that threshold question, the FSIA's arbitration exception does not confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Resp't's Mem. at 4-7, 8-10. The court does not address Respondent's argument as to Balkan Ghana, because it concludes that Balkan UK's claim to enforce the Award is sufficient to secure jurisdiction under the arbitration exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Nothing in Section 1605(a)(6) requires a court to resolve whether an arbitration award was validly assigned as a necessary precondition to recognizing subject-matter jurisdiction under the arbitration exception.

Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Ghana takes the puzzling position that neither Petitioner has standing to enforce the Award. According to Ghana, Balkan UK lacks standing to enforce the Award because the assignment agreement is invalid. Ghana challenges the assignment both under Ghanaian law and under the terms of the PPA. Moreover, Ghana maintains that Balkan Ghana also lacks standing because, by assigning its rights to Balkan\n   UK, Balkan Ghana \"relinquished any rights to confirm the award.\" Resp't's Mem. at 10. The court is unpersuaded by these arguments and concludes that Balkan UK has standing to seek confirmation and enforcement of the Award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To begin with, the assignment agreement between Balkan UK and Balkan Ghana contains a clear choice-of-law clause, providing that \"[t]his Deed [of Assignment] and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales.\" Deed of Assignment \u00b6 6. Ghana offers little to sway the court from honoring the parties' choice of law, beyond assertions of its Ghanaian legal expert that because the PPA is governed by Ghanaian law and because the Award \"affects the contractual obligations of the Republic of Ghana under the PPA, any assignment would be governed by Ghanaian law.\" Ampaw Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. Ghana's expert, however, offers no explanation for how Ghanaian law could possibly operate to overcome the chosen law of the parties to a separate assignment agreement. The expert's conclusory assertion does not warrant deviation from the general principle that courts \"favor[ ] application of the law that the parties to a contract agreed would apply.\"\n   <em>\n    Belize Soc.

I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4142926\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/5/25/\">\n    5 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   36 n.4 (reviewing cases and applying English law to determine the validity of an assignment that \"[b]y its own terms\" was to be governed by English law). The court therefore applies English law to assess the validity of the assignment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To that end, Petitioners provide the expert legal opinion of an English solicitor, James Samuel George Hargrove.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'rs' Opp'n, Decl. of James Samuel George Hargrove, ECF No. 19-1 [hereinafter Hargrove Decl.]. Hargrove explains that, under English law, \"[t]he Deed of Assignment satisfies the requirements for a legal/statutory assignment\" and that, accordingly, \"Balkan [Energy] acquired the legal right to [the Award] with a legal remedy for its recovery and the power to give a good discharge,\" meaning that \"Balkan [Energy] is entitled to bring proceedings in its own name.\" Hargrove Decl., Legal Op., ECF No. 19-2 [hereinafter Hargrove Legal Op.], at 3-4. Petitioners' expert legal opinion is effectively uncontested by Ghana, as Ghana has not provided an expert opinion assessing the assignment under English law. The court therefore finds that the assignment is valid under English law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Ghana's argument that the terms of the PPA bars the assignment is equally unconvincing. The PPA provides that \"[n]either Party may assign nor transfer all or any part of its rights, benefits, or obligations hereunder without the written consent of the other Party.\" PPA art. 19. Based on that provision, Ghana maintains that the assignment was invalid because Ghana did not consent to it. That contention fails for two reasons. First, the arbitral tribunal terminated the PPA when it rendered its Award on the Merits in April 2014,\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Balkan Ghana assigned its rights in the Award to Balkan UK in August 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Award on the Merits \u00b6 642; Deed of Assignment. Thus, because the PPA was void on the date of the assignment, there was no right of refusal for Ghana to exercise under the PPA. Second, the court accepts the uncontested legal opinion of Hargrove, who concludes that, under English law, \"the Award[ ] created new rights, superseding the causes of action arising out [of] the breach of the PPA.\" Hargrove Legal Op. at 4-5. Thus, under the law applicable to the assignment, Balkan Ghana need not have obtained Ghana's written consent before assigning its rights to the Award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, in its Preliminary Response to the Petition, Ghana requests \"leave to conduct limited discovery to obtain documents from and take depositions of both Petitioners on the issue of the validity and effect of the assignment.\" Resp't's Prelim.

None of these arguments supplies a defense to confirmation of the Award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    1. Article V(1)(a): Invalidity of Arbitration Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Article V(1)(a) of the Convention allows a court to refuse recognition and enforcement if the arbitration \"agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made.\" New York Convention, art. V(1)(a). Ghana's primary objection to confirmation of the Award under Article V(1)(a) is that, under the laws of Ghana, the arbitration agreement is invalid because it is not severable from the PPA and therefore must have been approved by the Ghanaian Parliament in accordance with the 1992 Ghana Constitution to be effective. That is the same argument Ghana advanced, and the court rejected, when arguing that the FSIA's arbitration exception does not apply in this case. Therefore, for the reasons discussed in Part IV(A), Article V(1)(a) does not provide a ground to deny the Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    2. Article V(1)(c): Arbitrability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Ghana next asserts that confirmation may be denied under Article V(1)(c) of the New York Convention because \"[t]here is no evidence that the parties 'clearly and unmistakably' agreed to submit the question of the validity of the arbitration clause to the arbitral tribunal.\" Resp't's Prelim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Resp. at 7 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Crystallex Int'l Corp. v.

According to Ghana, determining the validity of the arbitration clause lies within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Ghana, not the arbitral tribunal. Ghana therefore asserts that confirmation of the Award should be denied because \"[t]he award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration.\" New York Convention, art. V(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   But Ghana's reliance on Article V(1)(c) fails because Ghana overlooks the express terms of its agreement to arbitrate in the PPA.

According to Ghana, the garnishment order compels Ghana to pay any amounts owing under the arbitration award to Balkan Ghana's creditor, Zenith Bank Ghana.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Ghana asserts that when the garnishment order issued, Balkan Ghana \"ceased to have title or right to payment pursuant to the arbitration award at issue in this litigation\" because its creditor was awarded, through garnishment, the funds Balkan Ghana is entitled receive to under the Award.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ghana also asserts that the \u20ac 75 million judgment against Balkan Ghana \"for the recovery of damages caused to a barge by Balkan [Ghana]\" \"more than offsets the arbitration award at issue in this litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Respondent offers the declaration of a Principal State Attorney of Ghana, authenticating the garnishment order and judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Grace Mbrokoh-Ewoal, ECF No. 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The court has considered Ghana's request and declines to take notice of the order and judgment because doing so will have no effect on the court's confirmation of the Award.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court grants the Petition to Confirm Arbitral Award against Respondent Republic of Ghana in favor of Balkan UK and denies the Republic of Ghana's Motion to Dismiss Petition.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Prior to this assignment, on January 1, 2010, Balkan Ghana and Balkan UK agreed to an interest in claim assignment by which Balkan UK acquired the right to 95% of any recovery from the arbitration in return for an agreement to pay the costs and expenses of arbitration.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pet., Ex. H, ECF No. 1-9.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    \"[M]otions to enforce arbitral awards should proceed under motions practice.\"\n    <em>\n     TermoRio S.A.

Accordingly, in this court's view, Ghana should have included all arguments and supporting affidavits for denial of the Petition in its response to the Petition, rather than submitting them in piecemeal fashion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Petitioners also assert that the FSIA's waiver exception,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1), confers subject-matter jurisdiction over this matter, but the court need not reach that question in light of its decision that the arbitration exception applies.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The court addresses this issue because portions of Ghana's pleadings, liberally construed, could be understood to make the argument that the arbitration agreement is invalid, irrespective of the validity of the PPA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1, when determining the law of a foreign jurisdiction, this court may \"consider any relevant material or source.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1. \"Most often, foreign law is established through written or oral expert testimony accompanied by extracts from foreign legal material.\"\n    <em>\n     Estate of Botvin ex rel. Ellis v. Islamic Republic of Iran\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823481\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/772/218/#p228\">\n     772 F.Supp.2d 218\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 228 (D.D.C. 2011). Though such expert testimony aids the court in determining the content of the law, the court \"need not uncritically accept such expert testimony and may 'engage in its own research or reexamine and amplify material that has been presented by counsel in partisan fashion.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823481\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/772/218/#p228\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1 advisory committee's note). Consistent with this authority, the court conducts its own review of the Ghanaian Supreme Court decision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The court also rejects Ampaw's reading for other reasons. For one, the Supreme Court of Ghana was not engaging in a contractual legal analysis of the severability of the arbitration clause from the PPA that contained it. Rather, the court was elaborating on the legal conclusion it did reach-that the arbitration clause did not need parliamentary approval-by explaining that such a clause cannot be \"by itself an autonomous transaction commercial in nature which pertains to or impacts on the wealth and resources of the country.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 41. The court's reading of the decision is further bolstered by the fact that the 2010 Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of Ghana considers arbitration agreements to be severable from the agreements that contain them.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pet'rs' Notice of Foreign Law Auth., ECF No. 29, Ex. B, \u00a7 3(1). It is doubtful that the Supreme Court of Ghana purported to reach the conclusion advanced by Respondent without addressing this statutory authority or even mentioning it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The court is likewise unpersuaded by Ghana's suggestion that \"English law is irrelevant, because there was no legal nexus between English law and the arbitration.\" Resp't's Resp. at 13. Contrary to Respondent's reading of\n    <em>\n     Belize Social Development I\n    </em>\n    , the district court did not apply English law to determine the validity of the assignment \"because the arbitral seat was ... in London.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Instead, as the court clearly explained, it honored the parties' choice-of-law clause contained\n    <em>\n     in the assignment agreement.\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4142926\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/5/25/\">\n     5 F.Supp.3d at 36\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court therefore rejects Respondent's unsupported contention that such a \"nexus\" is required before applying the law chosen by the parties to govern an assignment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
