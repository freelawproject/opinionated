(\"RH\"), and two individual defendants, namely Gary Friedman (CEO) and Karen Boone (CFO). Specifically, plaintiffs raise the following causes of action: (i) violation of section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 against all defendants; and (ii) control person liability under section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against Friedman and Boone.\n </docketnumber>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  Defendants challenge plaintiffs' section 10(b) claim on three grounds. First, plaintiffs fail to identify any statements which were false or misleading when made. Second, plaintiffs cannot establish a strong inference of scienter. Third, the complaint does not allege loss causation. With regard to plaintiffs' 20(b) claim against Friedman and Boone defendants argue that plaintiffs cannot show an underlying predicate violation under section 10(b).\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  Having carefully considered the papers submitted and the pleadings in this action, the hearing held on October 31, 2017, and for the reasons set forth below, the Court hereby\n  <strong>\n   DENIES\n  </strong>\n  the motion to dismiss and finds that plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts of material falsity, scienter, and loss causation.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts at issue in this case, as pleaded in plaintiffs' 100-page Consolidated Class Action Complaint (\"CCAC\"), (Dkt. No. 45), are well-known to the parties. Relevant allegations from the CCAC are set forth below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. RH's Business and Procurement Structure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   RH is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Corte Madera, California, with approximately 41 million outstanding shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.) Its fiscal year (\"FY\") concludes on January 31 of each year. RH is a retailer of luxury home furnishings such as couches, chairs, tables, lamps, and rugs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) It sells products through its website; retail and outlet stores; and \"Source Books\" which are voluminous, glossy product catalogs distributed to potential customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As of April 29, 2017, the RH operated 85 retail stores and 28 outlets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the Class Period, RH did not manufacture any of the products it sold. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Instead, RH contracted with third-party manufacturers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Most of RH's manufacturers (frequently referred to as \"vendors\") were located overseas: RH sourced approximately 69% of its inventory from vendors in Asia in FY2013 and 82% in FY2015. Plaintiffs aver that sourcing inventory from foreign manufacturers involves \"significant lead times,\" typically upwards of six and as many as nine months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Alleged Facts Relevant to this Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to plaintiffs, RH experienced significant revenue growth in the years leading up to the Class Period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) \"By the start of the Class Period, however, revenue growth...from RH's existing product lines had slowed substantially.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) RH sought to restore its sales growth by expanding its product offerings through the introduction of new brands, notably \"RH Modern.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2 and 30.) Defendants promoted the launch of RH Modern to investors, describing the product line as \"the most important and significant new home furnishings business to be launched in the last 15 or 20 years.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Plaintiffs further allege that a successful launch required adequate in-stock merchandise of RH Modern. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) \"Without adequate\n   inventory, customers who placed orders for RH Modern products would face long delays to receive their products, leading to cancelled orders and costly accommodations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 103, and 173.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the first day of the Class Period, March 26, 2015, Friedman announced the launch of RH Modern and reported that RH was \"systematically placing orders now,\" which \"should help us with lead times [and] help us with inventory flow.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5 and 117; Dkt. No. 52, Declaration of Erik J. Olson in Support of Motion to Dismiss (\"Olson Decl.\"), Ex. 1 at 14.) Plaintiffs aver that during the Class Period defendants \"repeatedly assured investors\" that RH was \"prepared for the launch.\" (CCAC \u00b6 3.) Specifically, during an investor call on June 6, 2015, Friedman stated that RH was growing its inventory levels, making the \"necessary\" inventory investments, and would \"compete on speed\" of delivery for RH Modern. (Olson Decl., Ex. 7 at 19.) Boone also reassured investors that RH was making inventory investments to prevent \"high back orders\" and claimed that RH would \"grow inventory ahead of sales at the end of Q4.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Plaintiffs contend that defendants \"emphasized RH's preparedness for the launch throughout 2015\" by indicating that RH Modern was \"going to compete on speed.\" (CCAC at \u00b6 5.) According to plaintiffs, however, the \"preparation and launch of RH Modern were debacles from the outset due to a near-complete lack of inventory.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) \"RH needed to order RH Modern products far in advance of the launch date in order to have RH Modern inventory available to fulfill customer orders at the time of the RH Modern launch\" but failed to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 11, 2015, defendants allegedly marketed RH Modern \"before designs were finalized and without placing orders with manufacturers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) On that date, defendants published a \"video presentation\" for investors which appeared to display a range of RH Modern items. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124.) Plaintiffs allege that \"certain of these were not actual products from the line but unfinished 'one-offs' that had been hastily constructed by hand shortly before the investor video.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During the video presentation, Boone stated that 1Q15 inventory \"was up 24%\" and that \"we expect to end the year with inventory growth that is higher than our sales growth,\n   <em>\n    given the inventory investments in RH Modern\n   </em>\n   and other newness that we will introduce this fall.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Olson Decl., Ex. 6 at 5 (emphasis supplied).) Plaintiffs allege that Boone's statement referencing RH Modern \"inventory investments\" was (i) false because RH had not actually made such inventory investments when the statement was made, and (ii) misleading because it concealed the fact that 1Q inventory growth was due to \"surplus inventory of existing product\" and \"60-80% of RH's inventory\" was \"product that had been returned to RH from customers and/or was damaged.\" (CCAC at \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that when defendants launched the RH Modern website and published the 540-page RH Modern Source Book in September 2015, \"there was essentially no RH Modern furniture in stock.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 40.) Plaintiffs claim that Friedman knew that the Source Book \"featured Photoshopped images of products that did not exist, and the videos through which he promoted RH Modern also showcased unavailable, unfinished products.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Customers therefore faced lengthy delays and many became upset and cancelled their orders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 51-55, 106.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 10, 2015, RH issued a press release which indicated that \"the launch of RH Modern and RH Teen late in the third quarter,\" among other factors, \"puts us on a clear path to accelerate our growth in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2016.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Olson Decl., Ex. 11 at 2.) On December 10, 2015, Friedman expressed a similar sentiment during an investor call when he touted as a \"headline\" that RH Modern was \"performing ahead of our expectations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 13 at 14.) That same day, RH issued a press release which indicated that defendants were \"extremely encouraged by the early results we are seeing out of...RH Modern\" and that \"RH Modern is trending to add significant incremental revenues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 15 at 2.) Plaintiffs allege that these representations were false and misleading because they concealed (i) pervasive RH Modern inventory shortages as well as (ii) customer complaints and (iii) canceled orders arising from such inventory shortages dating back to 1Q15. (CCAC at \u00b6 193.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In a statement issued by RH on December 10, 2015, RH disclosed that RH Modern was suffering from an \"in-stock position [which is] not great today.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10 and 144.) The following day RH shares declined by more than 10%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Nonetheless, Boone continued to reassure investors that \"we continue to expect to end the year with inventory growth higher than our sales growth given the inventory investments in RH Modern and RH Teen.\" (Olson Decl., Ex. 14 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The extent of RH Modern's inventory shortage was reflected in an internal memo sent by Friedman to all RH employees on January 30, 2016, which stated that RH's customers were \"on fire\" and that RH had \"let customers die.\" (CCAC \u00b6 106.) Friedman's email initiated a \"delight the customer initiative\" wherein RH issued millions of dollars in \"customer accommodations\" including $10,000 gift cards, free orders, and complimentary expedited air shipping to pacify customers upset by the inventory shortage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8 and 108.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 24, 2016, defendants disclosed RH's poor financial performance as well as \"shipping delays,\" \"poor in-stocks...[and] suppressed orders\" for RH Modern. (Olson Decl., Ex. 17 at 2.) This disclosure also attributed the poor financial performance to \"macro economic challenges\" including \"energy, oil, or currency fluctuations\" in certain markets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156.) The following day RH shares fell by more than 25%. (CCAC at \u00b6 163.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, on June 8, 2016, defendants disclosed \"RH Modern production delays\" and revealed that RH had issued $18 million in customer accommodations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 173;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Olson Decl., Ex. 22 at 5.) RH also stated that other product lines were suffering from \"extra inventory\" which was \"bloating [the] balance sheet\" and leading to \"clearance events.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11 and 156.) The next day, RH's \"share price plunged over 21% on the highest trading volume in history since its IPO.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Material Misrepresentations or Omissions Requirement Met\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs' securities fraud claim centers on three categories of statements. First, plaintiffs allege that statements regarding RH Modern inventory were false and misleading. Second, plaintiffs challenge statements which allegedly misrepresented RH Modern's market performance. Finally, plaintiffs aver that RH's partial disclosures were themselves misleading because such disclosures attributed poor financial performance in part to macroeconomic conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Inventory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   With respect to statements concerning RH inventory, the Court finds the relevant allegations to be as follows. During a 2Q15 video presentation for investors held on June 11, 2015, Boone indicated that RH inventory \"at the end of the first quarter was up 24%.\" (Olson Decl., Ex. 6 at 5.) Boone explained that RH expected \"to end the year with inventory growth that is higher than our sales growth,\n   <em>\n    given the inventory investments in RH Modern.\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Emphasis supplied).) Plaintiffs allege that this statement was misleading for two reasons: First, it led the market to believe that RH's inventory growth was driven by the launch of RH Modern and inventory investments regarding the same. As noted above, plaintiffs proffer evidence that RH's inventory growth was actually the result of non-Modern product returns stemming from persistent quality issues. (CCAC \u00b6\u00b6 58 and 59.) Second, plaintiffs assert that this statement led the market\n   to believe that RH had made meaningful \"inventory investments in RH Modern\" despite the fact that RH had failed to order necessary inventory for the RH Modern launch in a timely manner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 181.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Next, on December 10, 2015, RH touted \"increases in inventory of $201.7 million related to the increase in 2015 Spring, RH Teen and RH Modern collections\" in its SEC filing for the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2015 (\"3Q15\"). (Olson Decl., Ex. 16 at 28.) According to plaintiffs, it was misleading for RH to connect the $201.7 million inventory increase to RH Modern when RH Modern inventories were negligible and the company did not order or receive significant RH Modern inventory in 3Q15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In support of plaintiffs' allegations regarding material falsity, plaintiffs rely on several confidential witnesses (\"CWs\") as attesting that (i) defendants had not made inventory investments in RH Modern prior to the launch in 2Q15, and (ii) RH inventory growth in 3Q15 reflected an accumulation of excess non-Modern inventory rather than RH Modern inventory growth leading up to and immediately following the launch. With regard to RH Modern inventory investments in 2Q15, CW2, a Buyer employed at RH who worked at corporate headquarters from 2014 through 2016 and is knowledgeable about product selection, inventory levels, and purchasing of hard goods and furniture for RH Modern, stated that when RH Modern was launched in September 2015 no inventory existed because RH Modern product designs had not even been finalized. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.) CW 19, a former Vice President of Merchandising for Upholstered Furniture, stated that the Modern Source Book depicted samples that RH had not yet attempted to manufacture. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) RH's Customer Service Lead Assist until April 2016 (CW4) explained that when RH issued its Modern Source Book in September 2015 not a single piece of RH Modern furniture was in stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) CW4 further explained that prior to the Modern launch employees were informed that RH Modern inventory was not in stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) CW8, a Manager of Financial Planning and Analysis throughout the Class Period, corroborates the testimony of the other CWs in indicating that when the RH Modern Source Book was issued RH Modern product was not available for purchase. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41 n.8.) RH's Product Development Leader for Dining Furniture from 2014 through September 2016 (CW9) similarly stated that no RH Modern product was in stock on the launch date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42 (Associate Store Leader from May 2013 through April 2016 (CW10) (same) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Concerning the inventory of non-Modern products in 2Q15 and 3Q15, RH's Store Operations and Communications Analyst through June 2016 (CW18) noted that surplus inventory for non-Modern product lines increased significantly year-over-year from 2014 to 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) CW11, a Manager in Operations throughout the Class Period, similarly indicated that RH was experiencing problems regarding\n   \"tons of excess inventory\" totaling over $200 million in 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) CW11 further noted that Friedman \"would get involved\" in conversations about excess inventory and \"yell.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Based on the foregoing outline of the allegations, the Court finds that plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged falsity, particularly with respect to present-tense statements of fact\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   regarding (i) the inventory investments RH had made in RH Modern inventory as of 2Q15, and (ii) specific attribution of 3Q15 inventory growth to RH Modern on December 10, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Market Performance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court further highlights three statements made by Friedman with regard to RH Modern's performance in the market. First, on September 10, 2015, Friedman stated in a press release that the launch of RH Modern in 3Q15 \"puts us on a clear path to accelerate our growth in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2016.\" (Olson Decl., Ex. 11 at 2.) Second, in a December 10, 2015, press release, Friedman wrote that RH was \"extremely encouraged by the early results we are seeing out of...RH Modern\" and that \"RH Modern is trending to add significant incremental revenues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., Ex. 15 at 2) Third, during an investor call held that same day, Friedman stated that a \"headline\" was that RH Modern was \"performing ahead of our expectations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 13 at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court finds that plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged material falsity with regard to the challenged market performance statements because Friedman's rosy representations concealed that RH Modern was suffering from a severe lack inventory and defendants were receiving customer complaints and canceled orders regarding the same. As noted, less than eight weeks after Friedman stated that defendants were \"extremely encouraged\" by the RH Modern results and represented that RH Modern was \"performing ahead of [ ] expectations[,]\" Friedman wrote a memo to all RH employees which specifically referenced RH Modern and stated that RH's customers were \"on fire\" and that RH had \"let customers die.\" (CCAC \u00b6 106.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Three categories of allegations support this conclusion: first, allegations regarding RH Modern inventories as of September 10, 2015; second, allegations concerning\n   the home furnishings industry production cycle and lead times; and third, the content of Friedman's internal memo sent to all RH employees eight weeks after he made the December 10, 2015, statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As to the first category, plaintiffs reference several CWs as attesting to the fact that by September 10, 2017, defendants' \"total absence of [RH Modern] inventory\" was well known internally and openly \"communicated at staff meetings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49 (CW4).) As discussed above, plaintiffs proffer CWs who indicate that RH Modern product had not been ordered by the time defendants launched the RH Modern product line and issued the Source Book in September 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41, 161 (CW8);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33, 37 (CW1); \u00b6 40 (CW4); \u00b6 41 (CW9 and CW10); and \u00b6 73 (CW19).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   With regard to the second category, multiple CWs state that product lead times in the home furnishings industry are at least six months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33 (CQ1); 34 (CW2 and CW2); 35 (CW4); and \u00b6 38 (CW6).) Pursuant to this timeline, Friedman's September 10, 2015, representation that the launch of RH Modern put RH \"on a clear path to accelerate our growth in the fourth quarter [of fiscal 2015] and into fiscal 2016\" was misleading because RH would not even have received RH Modern inventory until several months\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the close of FY2015, much less converted that inventory into incremental revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Third, the Court finds significant the temporal proximity between Friedman's December 10, 2015, statements that RH Modern was experiencing \"encouraging\" results and \"performing ahead of [ ] expectations,\" and his January 30, 2016, memo alerting employees to customer complaints stemming from orders \"not being in stock, and having orders pushed out multiple times\" which specifically referenced RH Modern. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 112.) The Court does not find plausible the possibly that such pervasive customer complaints arose only after December 10, 2015, and subsequently escalated with such intensity over the next eight weeks so as to drive Friedman to decry that RH had let its customers \"die.\" Thus, it was misleading for Friedman to represent to that market that RH Modern was experiencing \"encouraging\" market performance when RH Modern was suffering from inventory shortages and customer dissatisfaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to support their contention that at the time Friedman's statements were made the statements conveyed to investors that RH Modern was performing well in the market despite inventory shortages, customer complaints, and canceled orders which were well documented internally. Such statements therefore created an \"impression of a state of affairs that differ[ed] in a material way from the one that actually exist[ed].\"\n   <em>\n    Berson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566629\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/982/#p985\">\n    527 F.3d at 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brody v.

Scienter Requirement Met\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court finds that plaintiffs have adequately alleged scienter for three reasons: First, Friedman was highly involved in the RH Modern launch. Second, plaintiffs proffer testimony of CWs who indicate that Friedman and Boone had access to and reviewed reports which described the RH Modern inventory shortage and customer complaints. Third, the\n   record reflects CW testimony alleging that RH was struggling with an accumulation of non-Modern \"excess inventory\" totaling over $200 million and that Friedman took an active role in conversations regarding this issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61 and 63.) Finally, the Court highlights the importance of the RH Modern launch to defendants' business and growth strategy. In so finding, the Court views the CCAC as a whole and takes note of the context in which the statements above were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In support of their contention that defendants possessed scienter when the above-referenced statements were made, plaintiffs refer to multiple CWs. Plaintiffs' reliance on the CW statements must pass two hurdles. First, a CW must be described with sufficient particularity to establish his or her reliability and personal knowledge.\n   <em>\n    Zucco Partners LLC v. Digimarc Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4013317\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/981/#p995\">\n    552 F.3d 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 995 (9th Cir. 2009)\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Second, the statements supplied by CWs \"with sufficient reliability and personal knowledge must themselves be indicative of scienter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4013317\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/981/#p995\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the Court finds the standard met. The CWs are described with sufficient specificity to establish reliability-their dates of employment and professional roles are provided, and that information provides a sufficiently reliable basis for the Court to determine that statements attributed to them are indicative of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   First, Friedman was highly involved in the Modern launch, and made last-minute changes to RH Modern designs which caused delays. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) According to CW2, these changes slowed down production and caused inventory shortages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68 and 69.) Further, CW2 indicated that both Boone and Friedman received \"weekly inventory reports\" which showed that RH Modern inventory was out of stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.) Similarly, CW1, RH's Director of Product development employed from April 2009 through May 2015, explained that Friedman \"had the final word on how much of the RH Modern would be ordered.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49 (Customer Service Lead Assist (CW4) statement that Friedman's management style was \"hands on everything\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, CW11, RH's Manager in Operations throughout the class period who worked with vendors to source RH inventory, indicated that she observed Friedman \"regularly\" inspect RH's Merchandise Drill Down (\"MDD\") system which pulled information on inventory levels for all products including for RH Modern. CW11 further stated that \"in mid to late 2015, there were meetings where Friedman checked MDD...asking questions about inventory.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.) According to CW11, Friedman and Boone received weekly inventory reports which showed that RH Modern was out of stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.) CW8, a Manager of Financial Planning and Analysis throughout the class period, worked closely with Boone and provided Boone with a weekly \"CFO Package\" which contained information on sales, demand, and how the RH was converting demand to net sales for products including RH Modern. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41 n.8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Third, CW20, a studio manager in charge of catalogue photo operations from 2012 to 2016, stated that Friedman staged RH Modern video and photoshoots for investors by using samples and prototypes instead of actual product because RH had not \"decided what it was going to make.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.) Employees would \"have to rig the products to make them work, and [ ] this process was happening the night before the video was released\" to investors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) CW2 similarly stated that \"items were photographed and digitally manipulated, and catalogs launched long before finishes were approved on the product.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.) Further, \"some products shown\n   in the RH Modern Source Book were Photoshopped and did not actually exist.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Fourth, CW11 stated that RH was struggling with an accumulation of non-Modern \"excess inventory\" totaling over $200 million in 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) Accordingly to CW11, Friedman \"would get involved\" in conversations about excess inventory and \"yell.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, in addition to these CW statements, the CCAC notes that Friedman touted RH Modern as \"the most innovative and new concept in the world of home design\" that \"represented our finest work to date.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) He also described RH Modern as \"the most important and significant new home furnishings business to be launched in the last 15 or 20 years.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Although circumstantial and certainly not dispositive, such statements, paired with the CW statements regarding Friedman's \"hands on\" management style, support a compelling inference that Friedman knew about the inventory shortages and customer complaints which followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The confluence of these specific allegations supports this Court's finding that the PSLRA's high standard for alleging scienter has been met here. That RH Modern was allegedly such a critical product for RH's financial success, that defendants had been highly involved when the RH Modern launch was delayed, that they had received or reviewed the substance of MDD, CFO, and weekly sales reports wherein the inventory shortage continued to be quantified and analyzed, and the production timeline for the Modern furniture, together support a strong inference that they knew of the (i) shortage in RH Modern inventory, (ii) effects of this shortage on RH Modern's market performance and customer satisfaction, and (iii) fact that inventory growth in 3Q2015 was attributable to excess non-Modern inventory and not the RH Modern launch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court does not reach this conclusion lightly. In so holding, the Court has considered possible non-culpable explanations for why defendants might have stated that they had sufficient RH Modern inventory to support the launch and that Modern was exceeding market expectations when it was later exposed as not having been. For example, perhaps Friedman and Boone simply assumed that customers would not mind waiting several months for their RH Modern orders to arrive, or maybe the delays were not foreseeable to defendants when the challenge statements were made. However, allegations in the CCAC render such possibilities relatively less persuasive than the inference that defendants met the scienter requirement of the PSLRA. The CCAC, read as a whole, and in particular those allegations concerning Friedman's and Boone's own roles in monitoring inventory and the confidential witnesses' statements,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   undermines the notion that defendants were not privy to the sort of information that would have informed them about the problems surrounding RH Modern inventory and customer dissatisfaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Plaintiffs do not persuade in light of the fact that the Court may take judicial notice of both presentations for investors and investor conference calls.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Metzler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235959\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/540/1049/#p1061\">\n     540 F.3d 1049\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at 1064 n.7 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Primo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223577\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/940/1105/\">\n     940 F.Supp.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1115 n.1. The fact that transcripts from these two related events were combined in a single exhibit does not render judicial notice inappropriate.
