INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this patent case involving Plaintiff Sprint Communications Company, L.P. (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Sprint\") against Defendant\n   Cox Communications, Inc. (\"Defendant\" or \"Cox\"), Sprint alleges that Cox infringes certain of Sprint's telecommunications and data networking patents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among these patents are U.S. Patent Nos. 7,286,561 (\"the '6,561 patent\"), 6,633,561 (\"the '3,561 patent\"), 6,463,052 (\"the '052 patent\"), and 6,452,932 (\"the '932 patent\") (collectively the \"Call Control Patents\") and U.S. Patent Nos. 6,473,429 (\"the '429 patent\"), 6,343,084 (\"the '084 patent\"), and 6,298,064 (\"the '064 patent\") (collectively the \"Broadband Patents\"). Sprint asserts approximately 15 claims from the Call Control Patents and the Broadband Patents (the \"patents-in-suit\") against Cox. (D.I. 650 at 2) District Judge Sue L. Robinson construed various claim terms of the patents-in-suit in March 2016 and May 2017. (D.I. 399; D.I. 400, D.I. 541) Upon Judge Robinson's retirement from the bench, the case was reassigned to the undersigned on June 16, 2017. (D.I. 557) A pre-trial conference is scheduled for November 17, 2017, with a jury trial set to begin on December 7, 2017. (D.I. 603; D.I. 654) The court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1338(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As part of its defenses to the allegation of patent infringement by Sprint, Cox contends that the patents-in-suit are invalid for lack of written description under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20112\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 608 at 1) In support, Cox presents the testimony of its expert witnesses Paul S. Min, PhD (\"Dr. Min\") and Kevin Almeroth, PhD (\"Dr. Almeroth\"). (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 587, ex. 1 at \u00b6 105) Based upon this testimony, and Cox's admissions, Sprint argues that \"the claims as construed are supported by the specification[,]\" (D.I. 587 at 15), and has moved for partial summary judgment of no invalidity of the patents-in-suit, (D.I. 586). Sprint has also moved to exclude the testimony of Drs. Min and Almeroth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Meanwhile, Sprint has presented the validity opinions of its expert, Dr. Stephen Wicker (\"Dr. Wicker\"). (D.I. 620, exs. 2, 3, 4) Based upon Dr. Wicker's reports, Cox contends that \"there are no genuine factual disputes\" as to its central theory that all of \"Sprint's patents\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   disclose only\n   <em>\n    connection-oriented\n   </em>\n   technology, namely [Asynchronous Transfer Mode] ATM, for packet-voice transmissions[ ]\" and cannot, therefore, read on products and services that employ Internet Protocol (IP) technologies. (D.I. 608 at 1 (emphasis in original)) As a result, Cox has moved for partial summary judgment of invalidity of the patents-in-suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During briefing on the instant motion, in its reply brief, Sprint included an Appendix A, entitled \"Sprint's Response to Cox's Statement of Facts (CSUF)[,]\" which is a nine-page response to the statement of facts that Cox presented in its answering\n   brief. (D.I. 620, appx. A; D.I. 608 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-7) Cox moved to strike this material, arguing that it \"contain[s] additional pages of substantive arguments.\" (D.I. 634 at 1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The patents-in-suit relate to transmission of telephone calls between traditional telephone networks and packet data networks. All of the patents-in-suit originate from U.S. Patent Application No. 08/238,605 (\"the '605 application\"), which was filed on May 5, 1994 and was abandoned by applicant. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '052 patent, 1:5-10) The '605 application is incorporated by reference into all of the patents-in-suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Call Control Patents are continuations of the '605 application and share a common specification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; '932 patent, 1:5-12; '3,561 patent, 1:5-12; '6,561 patent, 1:6-12) The Broadband Patents share a common specification and are continuations of U.S. Patent Application No. 08/525,897 (\"the '897 application\"), filed on September 8, 1995, which is now\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C991%2C301\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 5,991,301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

( '301 patent, front page, item [63]; 1:6-10) By definition, a continuation-in-part application is \"filed during the lifetime of an earlier [ ] application, [and] repeat[s] some substantial portion or all of the earlier [ ] application and add[s] matter not disclosed in the [ ] earlier [ ] application.\" \u00a7 201.08 MPEP (9th ed., Rev. 07.2015, Nov. 2015).

The USPTO has identified \"[t]wo separate statutory requirements [that] must be met before a certificate of correction for an applicant's mistake may issue.\"\n   <em>\n    In Re Arnott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.P.Q.%202d%20%28BNA%29%201049\">\n    19 U.S.P.Q.2d 1049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5 (Com'r Pat. &amp; Trademarks May 22, 1991) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1481 MPEP (9th ed., Rev. 07.2015, Nov. 2015). \"The first statutory requirement concerns the nature, i.e., type, of the mistake for which a correction is sought...

No. 08/238,605, entitled 'Method, System, and Apparatus for Telecommunications Control', filed May 5, 1994, currently pending, and incorporated by reference into this application.\" ( '301 patent, 1:6-10) In other words, while the status of the '897 application as a continuation-in-part of the '605 application may be in doubt, at a minimum, the '897 application (which forms the basis for the Broadband Patents) incorporates by reference the '605 application (which forms the basis for the Call Control Patents). Therefore, aspects of the Broadband Patents may find support in the common specification for the Call Control Patents,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   but limitations to the Broadband Patents do not necessarily result in limitations to the Call Control Patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Broadband Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2016, Cox moved for summary judgment of no literal infringement of the '084 patent (which is one of the Broadband Patents) as well as several other patents no longer in suit\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the premise that the patents are limited to ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) technologies and that Cox's accused products and services are used in IP (Internet protocol) networks. (D.I. 357 at 25). At the time, Cox explained in its reply brief that \"[t]o be clear, we agree that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the claims are read as limited to ATM networks, they will not run afoul of the written description requirement.\" (D.I. 353 at 11 (emphasis in original)) Sprint did\n   not argue to the contrary and suggested that, under a construction limited to ATM, it would assert infringement under the Doctrine of Equivalents. (D.I. 329 at 22) Judge Robinson construed, inter alia, the \"interworking unit\" limitation of independent claim 1 of the '084 patent to be an \"ATM interworking multiplexer[,]\" (D.I. 400 at \u00b6 9), and granted summary judgment of no literal infringement, (D.I. 399 at \u00b6\u00b6 6-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As discussed above, the other two Broadband Patents (the '429 and '064 patents ) share a common specification with the '084 patent, and the parties have agreed to apply the ATM technology limitation to the '429 and '064 patents. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 490 at 2, applying definitions of \"interworking unit\" as \"ATM interworking multiplexer\" and \"asynchronous communication\" as \"ATM communication\" to limitations in the '429 and '064 patents ) As a result, Sprint does not assert that Cox literally infringes any of the Broadband Patents. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 593, ex. 22 at 10:8-13, 11:15-23 (deposition of Sprint's expert witness on infringement))\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Call Control Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When the court granted summary judgment of no literal infringement of the '084 patent, the Call Control Patents had been ruled invalid as indefinite by Judge Robinson and were on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. (D.I. 399 at 1 n.2) As a result, in 2016, Cox did not argue that the Call Control Patents were invalid for lack of written description. (D.I. 357 at 19-24) Cox's Drs. Min and Almeroth expressed opinions on the written description requirement as to the Call Control Patents in June 2017. (D.I. 587, exs. 1, 5) Sprint's Dr. Wicker presented rebuttal arguments, (D.I. 630, ex. 3), and all three experts were deposed about their opinions, (D.I. 587, exs. 4, 6; D.I. 608, ex. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

(D.I. 587 at 12) Moreover, Sprint avers that Cox's arguments are contrary to the court's claim construction, and the written description defense is foreclosed as a matter of law by the doctrine of equivalents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-15)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Cox responds that, after \"applying the [c]ourt's construction to the claims, Cox's experts have opined that a person of ordinary skill would not have understood the Sprint inventor to have possessed an 'IP' invention, because 'ATM' and 'IP' were separated by a technical chasm.\" (D.I. 608 at 1) Cox ignores Sprint's equivalents assertions and adheres to its written description argument, because \"by accusing IP systems, Sprint insists that the claims are broader in scope than the ATM-limited disclosure.... [, which] bring[s] the issues of written description front and center.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8) Based upon Cox's briefs, the court identifies three major areas of Cox's argument: (1) extrinsic evidence, (2) claim construction, and (3) legal principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Min and Almeroth do not .... address the doctrine of equivalents at all.\" (D.I. 608 at 10) Without an opinion on the doctrine of equivalents, Cox has no evidence to present to a jury. Moreover, the opinions are based entirely on equivalence between the claimed subject matter (ATM-limited claim limitations) and accused products and services (that rely on IP) at the time of invention. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 587, ex. 1 at \u00b6 144 (\"a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of filing of the Asserted Patents (or underlying applications), would see the claimed system as using ATM.\")) \"[T]he proper time for evaluating equivalency-and thus knowledge of interchangeability between elements-is at the time of infringement, not at the time the patent was issued.\"\n   <em>\n    Warner-Jenkinson Co. v.

Therefore, Cox does not offer any evidence upon which a reasonable jury could invalidate the Broadband Patents for lack of written description. Moreover, to the extent that Cox's arguments relate to the Call Control Patents as asserted under the doctrine of equivalents,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   no reasonable jury could invalidate these patents for lack of written description.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

At the same time, Cox addresses\n   <em>\n    Wright Medical\n   </em>\n   and explains that the ensnarement analysis from\n   <em>\n    Wilson Sporting Goods\n   </em>\n   (the seminal\n   case on the subject) is not at issue in the case at bar:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Sprint's other case,\n   <em>\n    Wright Medical\n   </em>\n   , also fails to address the correct question....

No such hypothetical claim is suggested here[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4 (footnote omitted)) While Cox is correct that neither of the parties have suggested a \"hypothetical claim\" here, that failure is (in part) Cox's doing. First, Cox argued that\n   <em>\n    Warner-Jenkinson\n   </em>\n   is inapposite, because it does not relate to ensnarement. Second, Cox cited ensnarement cases and argued facts aligned with ensnarement principles. Finally, Cox argued that ensnarement should lead to invalidity for lack of written description. (D.I. 608 at 10, 12 n.4; D.I. 633 at 4, 6, 10) However, Cox did not, as is its burden in an ensnarement defense,\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   produce evidence of prior art that would challenge a hypothetical claim asserted under the doctrine of equivalents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Sprint argues that Cox did not cite to \"a single case extending the ensnarement doctrine to the written description requirement.\" (D.I. 620 at 3) The court agrees. Absent such case law, even if Cox were to present sufficient evidence (which it has not) upon which a reasonable jury could find that Sprint's patent claims \"ensnare[ ] behavior that, as a matter of law, the literal claims could not,\" (D.I. 633 at 6), the remedy would be noninfringement, not invalidity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Conclusion: Broadband Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Despite Cox's repeated attempts to broaden the court's claim construction, the court declines to re-cast its earlier constructions to encompass broad limitations to ATM technology to \"the invention\" or \"the patents\" or to add additional limitations, such as \"connection-oriented,\" (D.I. 608 at 1), to the claims. Moreover, as discussed above, the court declines to re-construe the claims to factor in Sprint's theories of infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Based upon the briefing, Cox has not identified any case law that supports its contention that, after the written description requirement has been incorporated into the court's claim construction to narrow limitations of asserted claims, those same arguments and the written description requirement extend further to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents. (D.I. 608 at 1) \"This proposition not only has no authoritative support, but also runs counter to what the Supreme Court has said about the doctrine of equivalents.\"\n   <em>\n    Wright Medical\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20130578\">\n    1999 WL 130578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (citing\n   <em>\n    Warner-Jenkinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11650956\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/17/#p37\">\n    520 U.S. at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11650956\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/17/#p37\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In addition to the lack of citation to case law supporting its position, Cox's experts did not provide opinions as to the doctrine of equivalents, and their written description analysis explaining that ATM and IP are antithetical technologies is predicated on the time of invention and not (as required by the doctrine of equivalents) the time of infringement. The facts as alleged by Cox (even though Cox does not necessarily name its claims accordingly) appear to reference known patent law principles\n   of vitiation and ensnarement, though these principles lead to noninfringement of the asserted patents, (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 592 at 10), and not the requested remedy of \"summary judgment of invalidity[,]\" (D.I. 608 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For these reasons, as it relates to claims asserted under the doctrine of equivalents (and specifically the asserted claims of the Broadband Patents), the court concludes that Cox has not produced any evidence upon which a reasonable jury could invalidate these claims for lack of written description. Therefore, summary judgment of no invalidity as to written description is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Call Control Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Neither party has stated affirmatively whether or not Sprint avers that Cox literally infringes the Call Control Patents. However, based upon the arguments, Sprint appears to assert literal infringement of at least some of the claims of the Call Control Patents. (D.I. 587 at 13-14; D.I 608) With respect to these patents, Sprint contends that \"the [c]ourt expressly rejected Cox's attempt to inject requirements into the claims, holding that the specification discloses a broader invention. Yet, Cox (through Dr. Min and Dr. Almeroth) continues to advance opinions that the [c]ourt considered and expressly rejected as unsupported by the specification.\" (D.I. 587 at 13) In its brief, Sprint chronicles the ways in which, it asserts, Drs. Min and Almeroth contradict the court's claim construction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Cox agrees with Sprint that, in regard to the Call Control Patents, claim construction issues are central to the written description dispute. (D.I. 608 at 11) Cox argues that after the court's May 2017 Memorandum Order on claim construction, (D.I. 541), \"the Court's constructions [do not] reach [the question of] whether the packet network must be connection-oriented or connectionless. That distinction, which fully accounts for the Court's constructions, is the basis for the \u00a7 112 opinions expressed by Cox's experts on the Call Control patents.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 608 at 11 (citations omitted)) Cox references its statement of facts, paragraphs 2 and 4 (as well as paragraphs 1 and 3), as explaining its experts' opinions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Claim construction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, the court declines to perform additional, supplemental construction. Cox acknowledges that its experts performed additional claim construction, and argues that this is necessary, because \"the [c]ourt's constructions never reach [the question of] whether the packet network must be connection-oriented or connectionless.\" (D.I. 608 at 11) Sprint does not propose an alternative construction, and instead, Sprint avers that \"the [c]ourt soundly rejected each of Cox's arguments during claim construction[.]\" (D.I. 620 at 2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Meanwhile, Cox's experts were not consistent in their proposed limitations to the claim construction. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   D.I. 587, ex. 2 at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9 (relying on a \"connection-oriented\" limitation)\n   <em>\n    with\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11650956\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/17/#p37\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , ex, 5 at \u00b6\u00b6 509-15 (relying on a limitation to ATM technology))\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Nor were Cox's experts specific about which claim limitations should be construed or why-Dr. Min explained his reasoning based upon some of the patents as a group, (D.I. 587; ex. 2 at 8-9 (referring to the \"Call Control Patents\")), and Dr. Almeroth combined the Broadband and Call Control Patents in single argument, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , ex. 5 at 509-15 (citing the '932 (Call Control) and '429 (Broadband) patent specifications)).\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   This lack of specificity is sufficient to terminate the question of claim construction, which Cox argues, (D.I. 608 at 11), is dispositive of its arguments on written description.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Additionally, for the reasons discussed below, even if Cox's experts were to identify with specificity the claim limitations in need of construction, as is discussed below, the evidence presented is insufficient to lead the court, as a matter of law, to agree that either of the \"ATM\" or \"connection-oriented\" restrictions (to unknown claim terms and limitations) are either necessary or appropriate.

(D.I. 587, ex. 2 at \u00b6 7) Paragraph 9 relates to the Call Control patents, and Cox notes that in it, \"Dr. Min opined that a person of ordinary skill in the art would similarly not [have] understood the inventors of the Call Control Patents to be in possession of a connectionless invention based on 'disclosure regarding only connection[-]oriented ATM.' \" (D.I. 608 at \u00b6 2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In paragraph 4 of its statement of facts, Cox identifies paragraphs 490-515 of Dr. Almeroth's expert report on invalidity as supporting three arguments-of these, only one relates to Dr. Min's ATM-versus-IP argument as to written description.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 608 at \u00b6 4) According to Cox, \"Dr. Almeroth opined that a person of ordinary skill would not understand the inventors of the Call Control Patents ... to be in possession\n   <strong>\n    of an ATM invention\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   because\n   a person of ordinary skill would have understood that ATM and IP 'are inherently different protocols,' where 'ATM is connection oriented,' and 'IP on the other hand, is a connectionless protocol.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) (citing D.I. 587, ex. 5 at \u00b6 511))\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    (i) Dr. Min\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Dr. Min stated that he based his opinion on the court's claim construction, \"[a]s construed, the Call Control Patents are not limited to ATM systems or for that matter, connection-oriented systems.\" (D.I. 587, ex. 2 at \u00b6 9) Dr. Min even acknowledged that \"the full scope of [the] claimed invention\" in the Call Control Patents is broad enough to encompass both ATM and IP as well as connection-oriented and connectionless protocols. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) None of these facts are in dispute. And yet, Dr. Min added limitations to the claims as a whole by reading in limitations from the specification, which he referred to as a \"disclosure regarding only connection[-]oriented ATM[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Effectively, Dr. Min opined that (unlike the Broadband Patents in which specific claim limitations were restricted to ATM technology) all claims of the Call Control Patents should be confined to \"connection[-]oriented ATM\" technologies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of his opinion Dr. Min identified extrinsic and intrinsic evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The extrinsic evidence from Dr. Min is primarily his opinions from paragraphs 40-123 of his 2016 report and his explanation that \"the invention\" disclosed in the shared specification of the Call Control Patents \"is directed to the solution of problems that only arise in connection[-]oriented networks (namely, the fact that the switches that handle bearer traffic also handle the selection of a communications path)[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 587, ex. 2 at \u00b6 8) He filled in the details with (ostensibly) the knowledge of a person of ordinary skill in the art and observed that \"[t]hese problems do not arise in, and these benefits are not achieved in 'connectionless' networks where no path for a call is ever selected, but rather the path for each packet comprising the call is separately selected.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As for intrinsic evidence, Dr. Min opined that the disclosure of \"the transmission of bearer traffic in one non-TDM [ (time division multiplexed) ] format: ATM\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   ... [and the] fact [that] the term 'IP' or 'internet protocol' does not appear anywhere in the specification[ ]\" supports his conclusion that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not \"consider disclosure of ATM for carrying bearer traffic to teach or express possession of an invention that uses connectionless protocols, such as IP, to transmit bearer traffic (i.e., voice).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (footnotes omitted)) The first cited portion of the specification employs open-ended language and refers to \"[b]roadband systems,\n   <strong>\n    such as\n   </strong>\n   Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)[.]\" ( '932 patent, 2:28-29 (emphasis added)) The phrase \"such as\" is commonly used in patents to identify non-limiting examples. Additionally, the specification discusses the concept of \"a connection\" using similarly exemplary language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   A connection is the media between two network elements that allows the transfer of information. A few\n   <strong>\n    examples\n   </strong>\n   of connections are: digital T1 lines, OC-3 optical fibers, packet connections, dedicated access lines, microwave transmission, and cellular radio. As those skilled in the art are aware, connections can be described in a range from general to specific. All of the media between two switches is a general description and\n   <strong>\n    might\n   </strong>\n   correspond to a virtual path in an ATM system or a trunk groups in a T1 system. An individual circuit between two elements is more specific and\n   <strong>\n    might\n   </strong>\n   correspond to a virtual channel in an ATM system or a DS0 circuit in a T1 system. Connections can also be described as being logical or physical. Physical connections are electrical-mechanical media. Logical connections are paths which follow physical connections, but are differentiated from one another based on format and protocol. The term \"connection\" includes this entire range and the meaning varies according to the context in which the term is used. The present invention could make selections encompassing the entire range of connections.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   ( '932 patent, 4:64-5:15 (exemplary language emphasized)) The cited portions of the specification are not limiting and do not, on their own, lead to the conclusion that the applicant intended to disavow all technologies other than ATM. Moreover, the specification does not employ the terms used by Dr. Min (e.g. \"TDM,\" \"connectionless,\" or \"connection-oriented\") and the cited passages directly contradict Dr. Min's statement about the disclosure of ATM as the sole \"non-TDM\" technology, because \"packet radio,\" \"cellular radio,\" and \"microwave transmission\" could be interpreted to be, inter alia, \"non-TDM.\" Neither Dr. Min nor Cox provides any explanation as to why these examples should be limiting. \"Where a specification does not require a limitation, that limitation should not be read from the specification into the claims.\"\n   <em>\n    E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v.

For example, Dr. Wicker presented unrebutted evidence that TCP (a connection-oriented protocol) is used extensively with IP in what is commonly known as \"TCP/IP.\" (D.I. 620, ex. 2 at \u00b6\u00b6 154-55) Dr. Wicker acknowledged that UDP is a connectionless alternative to TCP that is also used at Layer 4 in conjunction with IP in what is known as \"UDP/IP.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Dr. Wicker explained that voice communications were often transported over the connectionless UDP/IP protocol using a higher-level protocol, named \"RTP,\" which provided \"end-to-end delivery services[,]\" and which Dr. Wicker opined is \"akin to the virtual circuit and virtual path identifiers included within an ATM cell.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 160-64) Dr. Wicker also identified other technologies within IP to manage phone calls, including RSVP and DiffServ, for setting up \"connection oriented path[s] within an IP network.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 165-78) Additionally, Dr. Wicker produced evidence, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 193-205), to support his opinion that \"at the\n   time of [the] invention[of the patents-in-suit], those skilled in the art would have known that IP networks were interoperable with ATM networks and either or both could be used[,]\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 192). Were the court inclined to engage in claim construction (which it is not), this unrebutted testimony would most likely be persuasive extrinsic evidence that would be useful in discounting Dr. Min's assertions of the all-out war between ATM and IP at the time of invention. Also, as it relates to summary judgment, Dr. Wicker's testimony in the record would most likely demonstrate that Dr. Min's testimony would not amount to the clear and convincing evidence that a reasonable jury would need to invalidate the Call Control Patents for lack of written description.\n   <em>\n    Eli Lilly &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11099194\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/251/955/#p962\">\n    251 F.3d at 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    (iii) Dr. Almeroth\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In paragraph 4 of its statement of facts, Cox identifies several arguments presented by Dr. Almeroth. (D.I. 608 at 6-7 at \u00b6 4) One of these relates to written description. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing D.I. 587, ex. 5 at \u00b6 511)) Like Dr. Min, Dr. Almeroth relied on the same exemplary language from the \"Background of the Invention\" section of the Call Control Patents that identifies \"[b]roadband systems\n   <strong>\n    such as\n   </strong>\n   Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 509 (citing '932 patent 2:27-36)) He juxtaposed this (not limiting) language from the '932 patent with limiting language from the '429 patent (one of the Broadband Patents) and effectively suggested a \"limitation-by-association.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Almeroth repeated this juxtaposition a second time with similarly exemplary language (this time using the word \"might\") from the '932 patent accompanied by a quotation from the '429 specification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 510) As with Dr. Min's testimony, Dr. Almeroth's expert report provides no specific basis for a claim construction, and the identified intrinsic evidence of exemplary, non-limiting statements is similarly unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Conclusion: Call Control Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As it relates to the Call Control Patents, Cox has based its argument on a claim construction restricting unknown limitations from unknown claims of the Call Control Patents to either \"connection-oriented networks\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   or to \"ATM technology.\" This argument lacks specificity, and the court declines to construe these unidentified terms. For the reasons discussed above, summary judgment of no invalidity is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Both parties have moved for summary judgment as to written description. With respect to the Broadband Patents, the court heard argument on the issue of written description and adopted Cox's claim construction limiting specific claim limitations to ATM networks. As a result, the court granted summary judgment of no literal infringement. Sprint now asserts claims of the Broadband Patents under the doctrine of equivalents. Cox now attempts to re-argue invalidity for lack of written description, citing facts and case law that stand for various principles related to the doctrine of equivalents (ensnarement, prosecution history estoppel, and vitiation) for which the remedy is noninfringment and not invalidity. With regards to the Call Control Patents, Cox bases its written description argument on a baseless claim construction that lacks specificity as to\n   which terms and claim limitations are involved. Additionally, the evidence presented is insufficient to support the claim construction Cox proposes. Taken together, Cox has presented no evidence of lack of written description as to either the Call Control Patents or the Broadband Patents.\n   <em>\n    Eli Lilly &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11099194\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/251/955/#p962\">\n    251 F.3d at 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the court grants Sprint's motion and denies Cox's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Exclude\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Sprint argues in the alternative that \"[e]ven if Cox put forth a viable written description defense ( [which] it has not), the expert opinions provided by Dr. Min and Dr. Almeroth should be excluded because the testimony is inconsistent with the Court's claim construction[,] is unreliable and unhelpful to the finder of fact.\" (D.I. 587 at 15-16 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). Cox responds that \"both Dr. Min and Dr. Almeroth testified, they applied the Court's construction to understand the scope of the claim, and then examined the disclosure to determine whether that claim scope was supported.\" (D.I. 608 at 11-12) Having reviewed the record, the court agrees with Sprint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Broadband Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Dr. Min's testimony as to the Broadband Patents identified the court's claim construction and the various ATM-related constructions for the \"interworking multiplexer\" and \"asynchronous communication\" terms. (D.I. 587, ex. 2 at \u00b6 6) However, Dr. Min then opined that \"to the extent the claims of the '064 patent and '429 patent are found to encompass systems that use IP or connectionless protocols to transmit bearer traffic\n   <strong>\n    through the doctrine of equivalents,\n   </strong>\n   this exceeds the written description of the [Broadband] Patents as would be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted)) As discussed extensively above in Section IV.A.1, this statement is contrary to the law and is, therefore, unhelpful and likely to confuse a jury.\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p597\">\n    509 U.S. at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p597\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

First, Dr. Min explained that \"[t]he specification of the Call Control Patents states that the invention they disclose is directed to the solution of problems that only arise in connection oriented networks[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8) Second, he read in limitations from his prior reports and characterized the specification as a \"disclosure of ATM for carrying bearer traffic to teach or express possession of an invention that uses connectionless protocols, such as IP to transmit bearer traffic (i.e., voice).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Third, he concluded that \"a person of ordinary skill in the art would not understand the inventor of a patent directed to the solution of problems related to connection-oriented networks and whose benefits all stemmed from the invention's ability to solve those problems to be in possession of an invention that was applicable to connectionless networks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Then, after reciting the court's construction, he concluded that the written description requirement was not met, because the claims were limited\n   to \"connection[-]oriented protocols such as ATM.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9) Elsewhere, he drew other conclusions based upon reading in this \"connection-oriented\" limitation.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 12, 13). Dr. Min expressed opinions on written description\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   that are contrary to the court's claim construction.

As discussed earlier, the juxtaposition of the '932 patent (which is not limited to ATM technologies) with text from the '429 patent (which is ostensibly limited to ATM technologies and which incorporates by reference the specification common to the Call Control Patents) is misleading and will most likely confuse a jury.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 500-08) Instead, in this section, Dr. Almeroth opined that, in \"the Call Control and [Broadband] patents[,] ... the CCP ... establish[es] a communication path through the network.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 501) After citing various embodiments from the '932 patent (a Call Control Patent), Dr. Almeroth summarized these embodiments as saying \"[n]o matter how the call path is established, it results from the decision made by the 'processing system' (the CCP).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 503) Elsewhere, Dr. Almeroth explained why \"the entire call path\" must be selected by the CCP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 504 (\"the Asserted Patents only provide the proposed solution, if the ultimate decision that determines the entire call path, is made by the CCP/CCM.\"); \u00b6 507 (\"the processing system of the [Broadband] Patents establishes a path through the network.\"); \u00b6 508 (\"Mr. Christie's [ ] conception documents ... showed a call control model at center that establishes the path from the originating point to the destination point.\"))\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Sprint argues that \"Dr. Almeroth contends that the specification for the Call Control Patents only discloses the processing system setting up an entire path for the communications... [, which is an interpretation of the specification that] this [c]ourt has twice rejected[.]\" (D.I. 587 at 19) Cox responds that \"[w]hat Dr. Almeroth's opinion explains, is that a person of skill would understand that the 'processing system' to be critical to that process, i.e., that makes at least one selection that will determine how the voice will flow[,]\" and that paragraph 503 of the report, which also quotes the specification, is an acknowledgement from Dr. Almeroth \"that components other than the processing system can be involved in the selecting the path the voice will take[.]\" (D.I. 608 at 14-15)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   During claim construction, Cox argued extensively that the \"processing system\" (e.g., the CCP) must select the entire call path.

(D.I. 608 at 14-15) Dr. Almeroth identified a number of reasons in his report. First, \"[t]he Call Control Patents teach away from signaling from the CCP to control the MUX.\" (D.I. 587, ex. 5 at \u00b6 492) This is based upon a narrow reading of the specification that dismisses a statement related to an alternative embodiment in which:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   As long as the connections correspond through the mux, the CCP can track the communication path properly. Alternatively, the connections may not correspond. In that case, signaling links between the muxes and the CCP would be required for the devices\n   <strong>\n    to communicate\n   </strong>\n   and allow the CCP\n   <strong>\n    to track\n   </strong>\n   the communication path.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   ('052 patent, 10:37-42 (emphasis added)) Dr. Almeroth interpreted this statement to mean that \"the only messaging that may be passed between the MUX and CCP are to track connections the MUX makes[,]\" (D.I. 587, ex. 5 at \u00b6 492). He did not explain what the \"to communicate\" language means within the context of the embodiment discussed in Figure 3 of the Call Control Patents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Sprint argues that the specification states that \"signaling links between the muxes and the CCP would be required for the devices to communicate,\" and that \"[c]onfronted with this disclosure, Dr. Almeroth admitted that the inventor did, in fact, literally disclose \"a signaling link\" between the MUX and CCP (even though a direct line was not included in the exemplary Figure 3).\" (D.I. 587 at 18-19 (citing\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36; '932 patent, 10:42-45)) Cox alleges that \"Sprint mischaracterizes Dr. Almeroth's opinion[.]\"(D.I. 608 at 14)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Dr. Almeroth's deposition exposed additional issues not raised in his expert report-for example, Dr. Almeroth qualified his opinion that Mr. Christie (the inventor) \"calls it a signaling link. But again, I think it's clear that what he's describing here is the functionality only of tracking the communication path.\" (D.I. 587, ex. 6 at 210:15-211:14) In his report, Dr. Almeroth did not explain why he relied on a definition of \"signaling link\" that is limited to \"tracking the communication path,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , ex. 5 at \u00b6\u00b6 490-92), to the exclusion of specific examples of \"signaling links\" in the specification, ( '932 patent, 10:50-57), as well as discussion in relation to Figure 5 about signal formats, signal links, and the types of information (i.e., messages) transmitted over the signals, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , 14:60-15:64).\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based upon Dr. Almeroth's explanation, it is far from clear that the Call Control Patents \"teach away\" from signaling the multiplexer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Second, Dr. Almeroth opined that further support for this alleged teaching away is claim differentiation and double patenting. (D.I. 587, ex. 5 at \u00b6 493) He explained that if the \"device\" in claim 1 of the '052 patent (one of the Call Control Patents) \"can be the interworking mux, there is no non-obvious difference in the claims,\n   <strong>\n    and Sprint has engaged in double patenting\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added)) Dr. Almeroth does not explain why \"engaging in double patenting\" would lead a court to read a specification as \"teaching away\" from an embodiment (i.e., the \"signaling links ... for the devices to communicate\" embodiment at column 10, lines 40-41 of the '052 patent ) disclosed in the specification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, Dr. Almeroth does not explain why the remedy would be narrowing the earlier-filed claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Third, Dr. Almeroth explained that the \"entire point of the [Broadband Patents] is the addition [of] communications control by 'providing virtual connections through the ATM interworking multiplexer.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 494) He identified link\n   <strong>\n    191\n   </strong>\n   in Figure 1 of the specification of the '429 patent (a Broadband Patent), which the text at column 4, lines 17-18 explains \"could be any links capable of transporting data messages[,]\" and opined that \"[s]uch signaling to the ATM Interworking Multiplexer was missing from the Call Control Patents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 495) Dr. Almeroth did not explain the basis for this opinion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Fourth, Dr. Almeroth explained that \"during prosecution of the '084 patent\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   [which is one of the Broadband Patents\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   ], the applicants distinguished the [Broadband Patents] on the basis that they did not teach signaling to a switch, but rather, to an interworking unit.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 496 (citing to footnote 270, which is blank in the report)) The file history of the '084 patent contains no record of any such statement. (D.I. 388-1, ex. 2) During prosecution of the '084 patent, the examiner twice rejected claims in view of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C483%2C527\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 5,483,527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to Doshi, but none of the office actions mention any of the patents-in-suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, the '084 patent is one of the Broadband Patents, so it makes no sense that applicant would seek to distinguish the patent from other patents that share the same specification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Fifth, Dr. Almeroth relied on a document created by Mr. Christie to conclude\n   that \"[i]t is clear ... that [ ] Mr. Christie had not conceived of an invention in which the processing system signaled the mux in October 1993[.]\" (D.I. 587, ex. 5 at \u00b6 497) Then, based upon a statement by Sprint that \"the inventions in the [Broadband Patents] were conceived by [Mr.] Christie no later than June 1994,\" Dr. Almeroth concluded that Mr. Christie did not arrive at \"the concept of signaling to the interworking unit to control call setup ... until June 1994-[which was]\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Call Control Patents were filed on May [5], 1994.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 498 (emphasis in original)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Dr. Almeroth did not explain why he interpreted \"no later than June 1994\" to mean a point in time in the seven week period immediately following May 5, 1994. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Presumably, this priority question would factor into an enablement or written description analysis under section 112, but that degree of detail is missing from the report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, in his report, Dr. Almeroth did not address the fact that the Broadband Patents incorporate by reference (and claim priority to) the Call Control Patents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Nor did Dr. Almeroth address whether the disclosure of the Call Control Patents could (or could not) enable claim 1 of the '429 patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, Dr. Almeroth returned to his double patenting argument and explained that \"[i]f the Call Control Patents could provide control through [the] interworking mux, ... this altogether eliminates the purpose of the supposed invention of the [Broadband] Patents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 499)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Taken together, Dr. Almeroth's opinion in Section XV.A of his 2017 report is not helpful, is contrary to the law, and is likely to confuse a jury. His report lacks the level of detail and research that usually accompany such reports. Specifically, Dr. Almeroth's testimony is not \"based upon sufficient facts[,]\" as is identified by his lack of investigation into the record, the patents, and their file histories (his statement about the '084 file history is untrue). Dr. Almeroth's testimony also makes assumptions about the dates of invention and does not present facts to support his conclusions. Dr. Almeroth's testimony is not \"the product of reliable principles and methods\" in that, without explanation, he construes claim terms. Additionally, his testimony improperly applies legal principles, such as those relating to claim construction, prosecution history estoppel, and double patenting. In all, the court has no confidence that Dr. Almeroth \"has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\" Fed. R. Evid. 702(d). Dr. Almeroth's testimony is likely to confuse a jury, and therefore, it must be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The testimony of Drs. Min and Almeroth is contrary to the court's claim constructions. The testimony of Dr. Almeroth is also likely to mislead and confuse a jury. For these reasons, their testimony as to written description should be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Sprint's reply brief included an Appendix A, entitled \"Sprint's Response to Cox's Statement of Facts (CSUF)[,]\" which is a nine-page response to the statement of facts that Cox presented in its answering brief. (D.I. 620, appx. A; D.I. 608 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-7) Also, in responding to Cox's separate motion for summary judgment of invalidity for lack of written description (a motion that Cox introduced in its answering brief, and for which Sprint had presented no facts), (D.I. 608 at 1), Sprint argued that Drs. Min and Almeroth \"have no idea whether Cox's implementation of a\n   VoIP network operates, on a limitation-by-limitation basis, substantially similar to each element of the asserted claims.\" (D.I. 620 at 9-10 (citing footnote 14)) In footnote 14, Sprint details that \"[a]s explained in Sprint's opposition to Cox's motion for summary judgment of non-infringement (D.I. 611 at 11-22), which is incorporated herein by reference, Dr. Wicker has done this analysis[.]\" (D.I. 620 at 10 n.14)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Cox moved to strike this material, arguing that it \"contain[s] additional pages of substantive arguments in response to Cox's statements of fact, as well as supplemental, affirmative statements of fact, to circumvent the 10-page-limit on reply briefs imposed by Local Rule 7.1.3(a)(4).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 634 at 1) \"In addition, Cox moves to strike as improper under Local Rule 7.1.3(a)(4) the arguments incorporated by reference into Sprint's Written Description Reply.

Cox identifies a number of cases that supposedly relate to the remedy it seeks. Of these,\n   <em>\n    TQ Delta, LLC v. 2Wire, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 13-1835-RGA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205402180\">\n    2016 WL 5402180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (D.

Cox does not explain how the facts in\n   <em>\n    TQ Delta\n   </em>\n   relate to those in the case at bar. (D.I. 649 at 4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Cox argues that it \"has been disadvantaged by Sprint's improper use of Appendices A to expound its legal arguments.\" (D.I. 634 at \u00b6 7) Cox cites to a case relating to page limits in an appellate briefing in which the D.C. Circuit explained that \"page limits are important to maintain judicial efficiency and ensure fairness to opposing parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Corson &amp; Gruman Co. v. N.L.R.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526217,3479631\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/899/47/\">\n    899 F.2d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 50 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Having reviewed the Appendix A in question, the court discerns no prejudice or disadvantage. Cox moved for summary judgment of invalidity for lack of written description in its answering brief. (D.I. 608 at 1) In so doing, Cox first responded to Sprint's statement of facts, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-5), and then presented its own statement of facts related to its cross-motion, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1-7). Sprint's materials in Appendix A further elucidate the dispute of the parties, (D.I. 620, appx. A at 13-18), and present additional statements of fact in response to Cox's cross-motion, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1-10). Notwithstanding the pages addressing the\n   contested issues, as per the court's Standing Order, the briefing pages have not exceeded the limit imposed by the Delaware Local Rules. Therefore, Cox's motion to strike is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   As to Sprint's incorporation by reference of materials in D.I. 611 at 11-22, although Cox has not explained why this is additional briefing, the brief (D.I. 611) is currently before the court on a separate summary judgment motion. Moreover, the arguments and expert opinions relevant to Cox's motion for noninfringement, (D.I. 590), are also relevant to the motions on written description, because Cox relies on many of the same factual assertions and legal theories (e.g., vitiation) in arguing a lack of written description. In light of the arguments presented in the case at bar, citation to D.I. 611 at 11-22 is relevant. Incorporating these materials by reference would technically increase the length of the brief beyond that allowed by the Delaware Local Rules. And Sprint has not explained why citation to those materials is insufficient, and the \"incorporate by reference\" language is necessary. Therefore, it is appropriate to strike the \"which is incorporated by reference\" language from footnote 14 on page 10 of D.I. 620.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

This allows the network to pull narrowband switches out of service without taking extreme measures.
