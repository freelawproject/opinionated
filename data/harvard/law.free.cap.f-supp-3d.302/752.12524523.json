Dove and Brown argue that the government has failed to establish venue in the Western District of Virginia on Counts Three through Eight, which violates their right to be tried where the crimes were committed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art.

As a result, Brown and Dove claim that the conduct giving rise to those charges occurred entirely in Norfolk, which is located in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20127\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The government argues that the issue of venue for Counts Three through Eight should be submitted to the jury because the government's evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that \"Brown and Dove committed the two violent crimes at issue with the purpose of maintaining or increasing their position in the gang, and the MSB leaders ... who had authority over Dove and Brown and resided and operated in the Western District of Virginia.\" United States' Resp. Proof Venue, ECF No. 850, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties' disagreement centers on the sufficiency of the government's evidence adduced in its case in chief.

Second, no evidence was presented that orders were given by gang leaders in the Western District of Virginia to Dove and Brown directing them to commit the violent crimes on the streets of Norfolk. Third, no evidence was presented that anyone, including Dove and Brown, communicated with gang leaders in the Western District of Virginia about the Norfolk street crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The government argues that a patchwork of circumstantial evidence adduced at trial would allow a rational trier of fact to find, by a preponderance of the evidence, an objective, physical act directed toward the Western District of Virginia \"for the purpose of gaining entrance to or maintaining or increasing position in\" MSB. The government's circumstantial evidence consists of the following facts: (1) MSB leaders were incarcerated in the Western District of Virginia and controlled its actions from there; (2) MSB members committed other crimes in the Western District of Virginia; (3) at the time of the alleged Ink Junkeez robbery and O.J. shooting, MSB leaders commanded Dove, Brown, and Adrienne Williams, a paid government informant and MSB member, to stay together; (4) Brown commented that he made Dove participate in the O.J. shooting; and (5) Brown received a call from Nicholas Johnson, an MSB member in the Western District of Virginia, shortly after the O.J. shooting. The court has considered the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and concludes that the evidence does not support a finding of an objective, physical act related to the charged violent crimes that either took place in the Western District of Virginia or the effects of which were felt in this district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   First, the government points to evidence that the two highest ranking members of MSB in Virginia, Hassan Hubbert and Larry Boone, were both incarcerated in state prisons in the Western District of Virginia at the time of the Ink Junkeez robbery and O.J. shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   While that is true, there was no evidence that Hubbert, Boone, or other gang leaders in the Western District of Virginia had any involvement in the robbery and shooting that occurred on the streets of Norfolk. No evidence was introduced to suggest that gang leaders in the Western District ordered these violent acts, approved of these violent acts, or were even informed of these violent acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Indeed, the government's principal witness, informant Adrienne Williams, testified that although she was the mouthpiece on the street of incarcerated MSB gang leader Larry Boone, she did not tell Boone or other gang members about the Ink Junkeez robbery or the O.J. shooting. In short, in the absence of any evidence tying the Norfolk street crimes to gang leaders incarcerated in state prisons in the Western District of Virginia, the mere fact of their incarceration here does not provide a rational trier of fact with any basis to link the Norfolk street crimes to this district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, while evidence was presented that other gang members, such as James Bumbry and Nicholas Johnson, engaged in other crimes in the Western District of Virginia, such as selling drugs in Roanoke or broadcasting a hit into a state prison in this district, evidence of these wholly separate crimes does not constitute an objective, physical act linking the Norfolk street crimes to this district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The government presented evidence that MSB leaders in New York commanded that Dove, Brown, and Williams stay together at all times. The government claims that \"[i]t was understood that if they were not together and they got caught by leadership, they would be violated.\" The government also claims that the jury could infer \"that they would be involved in criminal activity together during this period of time.\" The government explains that Shawn Smith, a high-ranking MSB member based in New York, learned about Brown from Willie Borroughs, another high-ranking MSB member based in New York. Smith testified that Brown was somebody new in control on the streets of Virginia and that he \"put work in,\" meaning that he committed acts of violence or got money for MSB. United States' Resp. Proof Venue, ECF No. 850, at 6 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Even in the light most favorable to the government, however, this evidence does not support venue for the Norfolk street crimes in this district. Throughout the government's argument on this point, one fact stands out: The command for Dove, Brown, and Williams to stay together and the information about Brown all came from New York, not the Western District of Virginia. Williams testified that the command to stay together originated with defendant Michael Jones, who was based in Brooklyn. The information Smith learned about Brown came from Borroughs, who was also located in New York. Even assuming that the command to stay together meant that Dove and Brown were to commit crimes, nothing about this command from New York implicates the Western District of Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The government points to a statement made by Brown that he \"probably made him [Dove]\" participate in the shooting of O.J.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. To support venue, the government suggests that since Brown outranked Dove at the time of the shooting, \"Dove would have been required to follow Brown's instructions\" or be subject to a violation for not following gang rules.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Again, the problem with this evidence is that it provides no nexus to the Western District of Virginia. To be sure, Brown's statement suggests that he coerced Dove into participating in the O.J. shooting, but there is no evidence that Brown's command originated from or was otherwise tied to the Western District of Virginia. As such, Brown's statement does not demonstrate that anyone in this district compelled Dove's participation in the O.J. shooting in Norfolk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, the government argues for venue here because Brown received a call from Nicholas Johnson, ostensibly located in the Western District, a short time after the O.J. shooting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Ex. 210. During the phone call, Brown and Johnson discuss some MSB affairs, including getting an MSB member out on bond. Brown also mentions that he spoke with Hubbert recently. Williams, who was present in the car with Brown when he received the call, also commented that she needed \"to speak with Boone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The call between Brown and Johnson is more notable for what it does not discuss than what it does discuss. Not once did Brown discuss the O.J. shooting with Johnson, even though it occurred mere\n   hours before the call. Not once did Brown discuss the Ink Junkeez robbery with Johnson, even thought it occurred six days before the call. Not once did Brown suggest to Johnson that Brown committed any acts of theft or violence to impress leaders of MSB incarcerated in the Western District of Virginia. Similarly, while Williams stated she needed to speak with Boone during the call, she testified that she never actually spoke with Boone about the Ink Junkeez robbery or the O.J. shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Again, what is lacking from this evidence is any link between the Norfolk street crimes and the Western District of Virginia. Brown and Johnson did not discuss the O.J. shooting shortly after it occurred, and there was no evidence presented that Brown, Williams, or anyone else told gang leaders in the Western District of the Norfolk street crimes to boost Dove and Brown's position in the gang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Even when considered together, the government's patchwork of circumstantial evidence does not support venue in this district for the VICAR counts. The evidence is simply insufficient to establish any link between the Norfolk street crimes constituting the VICAR counts and the Western District of Virginia. While there is evidence of other crimes committed by other gang members in the Western District of Virginia, nothing links those crimes to the Norfolk street crimes charged in the VICAR counts. There is evidence that Virginia MSB gang members were incarcerated in the Western District of Virginia, but there is no evidence that those leaders authorized, condoned, or even knew about the street crimes in Norfolk. Most importantly, even considering all of the evidence together, no evidence suggested that Dove and Brown committed the Norfolk street crimes to impress gang leaders incarcerated in this district.
