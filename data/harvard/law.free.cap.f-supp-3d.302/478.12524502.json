Gen. Laws ch. 229, \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , provides for a single action brought by a decedent's executor or administrator\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   encompassing loss\n   of consortium and punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cox v. Brand 44, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-cv-11903,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206182469\">\n    2015 WL 6182469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2 (D. Mass. Oct. 21, 2015), and cases cited. Although plaintiffs are free to seek such damages in connection with the wrongful death alleged in Count IV, neither can stand alone as a separate count. Accordingly, defendants' Motion to Dismiss Counts III and V (Docket # 93) is ALLOWED, and its previous Motion to Dismiss the same counts of plaintiff's earlier complaint (Docket # 78) and Motion for Leave to File a reply brief (Docket # 81) are DENIED AS MOOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants' Motion is DENIED as to the claim for punitive damages included in Count IV, which plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded and is entitled to develop in discovery.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-13\">\n    Two defendants have since moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction (Docket # 100). This order in no way resolves that motion, which is not yet ripe.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    The term \"personal representative\" \"includes executor, administrator, successor personal representative, special administrator, special personal representative and persons who perform substantially the same function under the law governing their status.\" Mass.
