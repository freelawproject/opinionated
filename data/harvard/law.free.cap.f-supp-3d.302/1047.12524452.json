Nos. 852, 863\n </docketnumber>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   William H. Orrick, United States District Judge\n   This motion presents a conundrum: our District has possession of an undeniably important historical record-video recordings of the high profile bench trial to determine the constitutionality of California's Proposition 8, colloquially known as the ban on same-sex marriage. But the recordings were explicitly made for personal use by the presiding judge at the trial, the Hon. Vaughn Walker, in preparing findings of fact. When he began using them in public appearances, the Ninth Circuit stopped him, citing the \"importance of preserving the integrity of the judicial system.\" It left open the question of whether they could be released in the future, or when.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Media intervenor KQED, Inc. now asks me to unseal those video recordings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   KQED's unsealing request is supported by the plaintiffs in the action\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the plaintiff-intervenor City and County of San Francisco (CCSF). Dkt. Nos. 866, 867.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant State of California does not oppose the motion to unseal. Dkt. No. 869.

As a result of the Supreme Court's stay, the applicable Civil Local Rule in effect at the time of trial, Civ. L.

The court initially assumed \"for purposes of this case only, that the common-law presumption of public access applies to the recording at issue here and that it is not abrogated by the local rule in question.\"\n    <em>\n     Perry v.

The court then concluded that there was \"a compelling reason in this case for overriding the common-law right\" of access, namely \"Proponents reasonably relied on Chief Judge Walker's specific assurances-compelled by the Supreme Court's just-issued opinion-that the recording would not be broadcast to the public, at least in the foreseeable future.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715864\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/1078/#p1081\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715864\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/1078/#p1081\">\n     667 F.3d at 1084-1085\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The Ninth Circuit determined that Judge Walker made \"at least two\" \"unequivocal assurances that the video recording at issue would not be accessible to the public.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715864\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/1078/#p1081\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715864\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/1078/#p1081\">\n     at 1085\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Those assurances were, in essence, a commitment by Judge Walker not to allow the public broadcasting of the videos. In the absence of those assurances, and given the indications provided in the Supreme Court orders, the Ninth Circuit concluded the \"Proponents again might well have taken action to ensure\n    that the recording would not be made available for public viewing.\"\n    <em>\n     Perry v.

In reaching its decision, however, the Ninth Circuit was careful to avoid concluding that the then-existing compelling reason and the Proponents' reasonable expectations regarding non-broadcast would permanently preclude disclosure. The court explained that proponents reasonably relied on assurances that the video recordings would not be broadcast in public \"at least in the foreseeable future.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715864\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/1078/#p1081\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715864\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/1078/#p1081\">\n     at 1084-85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The plaintiffs explain why they believe public release and review of the video recordings is important and why the currently-available transcripts are not an adequate substitute. The plaintiffs expect that the video recordings will carry significant and unique weight in showing what happened during the trial because they show the vulnerability of the plaintiffs as they testified and the level of emotion surrounding their testimony, \"uniquely show[ing] the real reasons that marriage is important to people like\" the plaintiffs.

They point out that Judge Walker's ruling is settled law following its affirmance by the Supreme Court. They note that in its 2012 decision on the appeal from the first motion to unseal, the Ninth Circuit relied in part on the fact that merits of the case had not yet been decided and the law on same-sex marriage remained unsettled, and held only that the video recordings had to remain under seal at that time and not in perpetuity. They also show that while there has been wider acceptance of same-sex marriage (certainly as a legal matter), there is continued, ongoing debate over the issue and a continued interest in the Proposition 8 trial itself.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Given the changed circumstances from the time when the Ninth Circuit ruled on sealing in 2012 and the significant continued public interest, movants argue that the compelling justifications found by the Ninth Circuit in 2012 no longer exist and the public's right of access-both under the common law and the First Amendment-requires the video recordings to be unsealed. Movants also argue that any interests the Proponents may have had regarding potential harassment due to their involvement in the trial that could have supported continued sealing in 2012 have been mitigated by the passage of time, the now-settled legality of same-sex marriage, and the extensive reporting that occurred during and following the trial (including re-enactments) that disclosed Proponents' actual arguments and testimony but which did not result in any actual harassment shown by evidence in the record.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    Finally,\n    movants contend that the Northern District's Local Rule presumptively sealing court records for ten years, Civ. L.R. 79-5(g), must give way to the public's right of access given the lack of existing compelling justifications and the arbitrary ten year outer boundary used in that Rule.\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Proponents make no effort to show, factually, how further disclosure of their trial testimony would adversely affect them. Indeed, the transcript of the trial has been widely disseminated and dramatized in plays and television shows. Instead, they raise a number of arguments that I am both barred from considering movants' request to unseal and, if I reach the merits, required to continue the seal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    As an initial matter, I reject the arguments that I cannot consider the motion to unseal on its merits because of the Ninth Circuit's mandate on the prior motion to unseal or because of the doctrines of issue preclusion, law-of-the-case, or stare decisis. The Ninth Circuit's mandate reversed Judge Ware's decision, concluding he had abused his discretion, and remanded \"with instructions to maintain the trial recording under seal.\"\n    <em>\n     Perry v.

That mandate did not include any language indicating that the materials should remain under seal in perpetuity or otherwise binding the district court from addressing a future motion to unseal based on changed circumstances. The language utilized by the Ninth Circuit was conditional as to time. The court expressly concluded that: \"Proponents reasonably relied on Chief Judge Walker's specific assurances-compelled by the Supreme Court's just-issued opinion-that the recording would not be broadcast to the public,\n    <em>\n     at least in the foreseeable future\n    </em>\n    \" and cited the District's civil local rule providing a ten year presumptive mark for unsealing court records.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715864\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/1078/#p1081\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715864\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/1078/#p1081\">\n     667 F.3d at 1084-85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    The court's recognition that continued sealing is conditional squares with Ninth Circuit authority requiring proponents of sealing to show that justifications supporting continued sealing continue to exist.\n    <em>\n     Kamakana v.

But I conclude that the compelling justification of judicial integrity identified in the Ninth Circuit's 2012 Order continues to apply and prevents disclosure of the video recordings through the presumptive unsealing ten year mark applicable under Civil Local Rule 79-5(g).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Proponents argue that former Local Rule 77-3, as well as long-standing judicial policies in place in 2010 preventing or tightly controlling the recording and broadcasting of court proceedings, defeat the public's right of access and preclude release of the video recordings for public dissemination. They rely on the Supreme Court's recognition that the Rule 77-3 had the \"force of law\"\n    <em>\n     Hollingsworth v.

However, a recording of the proceedings\n    <em>\n     was made\n    </em>\n    and was, without separate objection by Proponents, made part of the trial record. As circumstances and justifications change (for example, the current Northern District and Ninth Circuit rules and policies\n    <em>\n     allow\n    </em>\n    for public broadcast of proceedings), so does the calculus concerning how the public's right of access weighs against asserted compelling justifications for maintaining court records under seal. Neither former Rule 77-3 nor the Judicial Conference or Ninth Circuit Judicial Council policies in effect in 2010 preclude the public's right of access from attaching to the video recordings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Proponents also contend that the common-law right of access cannot apply to video recordings of witness testimony that are \"wholly derivative of evidence offered and the arguments made in open court\" relying on\n    <em>\n     United States v. McDougal\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1075\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/103/651/\">\n     103 F.3d 651\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (8th Cir. 1996). Oppo. at 18-19.\n    <em>\n     McDougal\n    </em>\n    , however, dealt with a markedly different situation and applied a different standard in assessing the public's right of access. There, the Eighth Circuit concluded that a videotaped deposition played in open court was not a \"judicial record\" to which the right of public access attaches and, in the alternative if considering the deposition tape to be a judicial record, declined to apply the accepted-in-other-circuits (including the Ninth) \"strong presumption\" of public access to judicial records. Here, unlike in\n    <em>\n     McDougal\n    </em>\n    , the video recordings at issue are recordings\n    <em>\n     of the court proceedings themselves\n    </em>\n    , not a prior recording of testimony simply played at trial. Those tapes were made with the express intent and actual purpose of assisting the trial judge in reaching his decision. Moreover, the analysis of\n    <em>\n     McDougal\n    </em>\n    is contrary to \"the strong presumption in favor of copying access\" applicable in the Ninth Circuit to \"audio and videotape exhibits as they are received in evidence during a criminal trial.\"\n    <em>\n     Valley Broadcasting Co. v.

The public's right of access applies to the video recordings at issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    However, the compelling justification identified by the Ninth Circuit in 2012-namely, judicial integrity-continues to exist and precludes release of the video recordings at this juncture. To be clear, I am not holding that the recordings must continue to be sealed simply because Judge Walker made a promise that movants argue was mistaken if not impermissible under the law. I agree that a record cannot continued to be sealed where a trial judge makes a mistake in characterizing the record at issue or the interests proffered to justify sealing.\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n    I also agree that just because a compelling justification existed at one point in time does not mean that a compelling justification exists in perpetuity. As the Ninth Circuit has noted, in order for documents to remain under seal, there must be compelling \"interests favoring\n    <em>\n     continued\n    </em>\n    secrecy.\"\n    <em>\n     Kamakana\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856737\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/447/1172/#p1178\">\n     447 F.3d at 1181\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Here the compelling justification identified by the Ninth Circuit in 2012 continues to exist. That justification, judicial integrity, was and continues to be inextricably couched in the unique procedural facts recognized by both the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit in the appeals related to recordings at issue including: (i) the adoption of a pilot project to allow recording and broadcast of court proceedings in the Ninth Circuit (without prior public notice and comment), (ii) the efforts to modify this District's civil local rules (without prior public notice and comment), (iii) then-existing Civil Local Rules in effect at the time of the trial (given the Supreme Court's stay) that did not allow for recording or broadcast, (iv) the assurances of internal-only use made by Judge Walker which (as the Ninth Circuit concluded) were relied upon by Proponents in not seeking a further stay of the recording, and (v) the Ninth Circuit's reliance on this District's ten year presumption of continued sealing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    While I do not find my consideration of this motion to unseal is precluded by the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n    <em>\n     Perry v.

However, Rule 79 applied generally to \"BOOKS AND RECORDS KEPT BY THE CLERK,\" Rule 79-5 applied to \"Filing Documents Under Seal,\" and then-Rule 79-5(f) provided in full:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    (f) Effect of Seal.

However, a party that submitted documents that the Court placed under seal in a case may, upon showing good cause at the conclusion of the case, seek an order that would continue the seal until a specific date beyond the 10 years provided by this rule. Nothing in this rule is intended to affect the normal records destruction policy of the United States Courts.

There was and is nothing in Rule 79-5 limiting the presumptive unsealing to materials filed by the parties as opposed to materials created and filed by the Court, like transcripts of judicial proceedings or the video recordings at issue. Judge Walker, as noted above, directed that the Clerk \"file the trial recording under seal as part of the record.\"\n    <em>\n     Perry v.

Rule 79-5 applies. Moreover, there is no inherent conflict between then-existing Rule 79-5(f) presumptive unsealing and then-existing Rule 77-3 prohibition on recording and broadcasting proceedings. Nothing in the Rules themselves creates an inherent conflict.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Movants' argument both relies on then-Rule 79-5(f) and then seeks to avoid it. Movants first argue that the ten year presumption of unsealing, as cited by the Ninth Circuit, would set the outside boundary of Proponents' reasonable expectation of sealing. Reply at 4. They also argue, however, that ten years is an arbitrary timeframe, adopted without apparent case law or other support, and that timeframe cannot be used to defeat the public right of access to the video recordings\n    <em>\n     now\n    </em>\n    on the facts currently presented.

However, as noted above, the existence of the ten year unsealing presumption was significant to the Ninth Circuit and remains significant to me.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Finally, my analysis would be no different if I applied a First Amendment right of access instead of the common-law right of access. As noted above, compelling justifications must exist to satisfy both standards.
