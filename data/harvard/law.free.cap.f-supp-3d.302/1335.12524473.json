For the most part, the Court disagrees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    1. Dr. Camarota\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   United challenges the testimony of Dr. Camarota under the first two elements of\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   -that is, qualifications and reliability. In United's view, because Dr. Camarota \"is not versed in voter registration policy and is not a statistician, he is [ ] wholly unqualified to offer an opinion-let alone an expert opinion-on the issues in dispute in this case.\" ECF No. [144] at 2. United's assessment, however, misconstrues the primary purpose for which ACRU seeks to introduce Dr. Camarota's testimony and, in turn, understates Dr. Camarota's credentials to that effect. As ACRU correctly points out, the essence of Dr. Camarota's expert opinion is an assessment, based in part on data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, of the ratio in Broward County of the total number of registered voters to the voting-eligible citizen population as a whole, compared to the same ratios elsewhere in Florida and throughout the country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34 (\"Taken at face value, these numbers indicate that nearly every eligible person in Broward County is registered to vote.... In sum, the registration rates for Broward County ... are much higher than the rates in Florida, the nation, and any other state.\"). It is with this specific purpose in mind that the Court will measure the qualifications of Dr. Camarota and the reliability of his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Regarding qualifications, Dr. Camarota received a master's degree in political science from the University of Pennsylvania and a doctorate in public policy analysis from the University of Virginia. While completing his doctorate, Dr. Camarota \"was focused on analysis of primarily Census Bureau data ... looking at ... issues associated with U.S. immigration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70. Dr. Camarota is currently the Director of Research for the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS)-a research institute that focuses on examining the consequences of immigration on the United States-where he has worked since completing his doctorate. Notably, Dr. Camarota has previously served as an expert witness in a number of lawsuits, at least one of which required him to analyze \"population estimates and Census Bureau data[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 80-81. Dr. Camarota has also \"served as the lead researcher on a contract with the Census Bureau examining the quality of immigration data in the [Census Bureau's] American Community Survey [ (\"ACS\") ].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. As is evident, Dr. Camarota has extensive experience and familiarity with analyzing data provided by the Census Bureau, including the Census Bureau's ACS. In light of that experience, the Court is satisfied that Dr. Camarota is at least minimally qualified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Furmanite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662505\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/506/1126/#p1129\">\n    506 F.Supp.2d at 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"An expert is not necessarily unqualified simply because [his] experience does not\n   precisely match the matter at hand.\"). Specifically, it is a Census Bureau ACS estimate-namely, the total number of voting-eligible citizens in Broward County-that serves as the denominator of the voter registration rates from which Dr. Camarota intends to testify. Although United is not wrong to point out that Dr. Camarota is not a statistician and \"has no formal statistical training outside of a three-month [course] he attended ... during graduate school[,]\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, the voter registration rates he seeks to offer constitute a straightforward division calculation. Above the denominator mentioned above, the numerator purports to be the total number of actual registered voters-an EAC Election Administration Voting Survey (\"EAVS\") estimate that is based on data compiled and submitted by state and local election officials themselves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [144] at 2-3. In this sense, the Court finds Dr. Camarota's statistical background, or lack thereof, to be largely irrelevant. Dr. Camarota is therefore qualified to offer testimony as to the purported voter registration rates he has compiled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   That said, Dr. Camarota's lack of statistical expertise is relevant insofar as Dr. Camarota intends to take his voter registration rates a step further by testifying as to their overall accuracy. In defending Dr. Camarota's qualifications, ACRU initially contends that his testimony \"is\n   <em>\n    simply\n   </em>\n   what the publically available data, including statements by the Defendant herself,\n   <em>\n    show the ratio of registrants over eligible voters to be.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (emphasis added). But even ACRU recognizes that Dr. Camarota intends to testify to more than that.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (characterizing the \"subject matter\" of Dr. Camarota's testimony as \"repeating publically available registration and demographic data\n   <em>\n    and why they are reliable\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added). This concern with the reliability of the voter registration rates speaks to opinions offered by United's expert, Dr. Daniel A. Smith (\"Dr. Smith\"). Dr. Smith asserts that population counts from the ACS should not be used to calculate registration rates because the ACS, being a survey, contains sampling error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [150] at 9-10. In an effort to rebut that position, Dr. Camarota opines that the margins of error for the ACS estimates are easily quantifiable and small, thereby rendering the ACS estimates accurate overall.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [144] at 34-35. Dr. Camarota may be right about this, but the statistical nature of this opinion, which is obvious, renders it beyond the scope of his expertise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (\"[A] survey's natural imprecision can be quantified using\n   <em>\n    basic statistics\n   </em>\n   to produce a\n   <em>\n    confidence interval\n   </em>\n   around any particular estimate.... Table 2 and Table 3 report confidence intervals using\n   <em>\n    margins of error\n   </em>\n   at different\n   <em>\n    significance levels.\n   </em>\n   The margins of error are small, and subsequently the variation in likely registrations rates in the county is also small.\") (emphasis added). Thus, although Dr. Camarota is qualified to offer testimony as to the purported voter registration rates he has compiled (e.g., presenting the figures themselves and comparing them to similar figures related to other localities), he is not qualified to offer testimony as to the degree of accuracy of those rates-a statistical inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    IMPACT v.

What Dr. Camarota has essentially done is take publically available data that was compiled by governmental agencies and perform straightforward division calculations with that data.

United argues that Dr. Camarota's comparison of the EAVS registration number to the ACS population estimate is flawed because it compares \"an\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   registration number to an\n   <em>\n    estimated\n   </em>\n   population number[.]\" ECF No. [144] at 18 (emphasis in original). As such, United appears to take issue with the use of\n   <em>\n    estimates\n   </em>\n   in Dr. Camarota's figures. Contrary to what United suggests, however, there is\n   nothing inherently problematic with the use of a population estimate in measuring data, especially where, as here, there is no indication that the estimate was tainted in any way. The Eleventh Circuit has explained in another voting rights case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [W]e would [ ] uphold the district court's consideration of the citizenship statistics, even though those statistics are based on sample data.

Thus, to the extent that the ACS population estimates used by Dr. Camarota do not lend to the kind of precision an exact value might, such a concern speaks to the weight of Dr. Camarota's figures, not their admissibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11481099\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1335/#p1341\">\n    204 F.3d at 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If the evidence is admissible, that voter registration data might not be as reliable as some other measures of population goes to the weight of the evidence, but does not preclude use of the figures by the district court.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Second, United argues that Dr. Camarota's comparison of the EAVS registration number to the ACS population estimate is flawed because it compares \"a registration number at\n   <em>\n    a single point in time\n   </em>\n   when registration rates are highest to an average population number over a five-year period.\" ECF No. [144] at 18 (emphasis in original). Regarding that five-year period, Dr. Camarota's \"five-year\" ACS data-which include five-year estimates reported in 2010, 2012, and 2014-reflects information collected during the five-year period of time that ends in the respective reporting year that is then \"totaled back and weighted to a midyear control point.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11481099\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1335/#p1341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 29 n.8;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 48;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 49-50 (\"[T]hink of it this way: [the five-year ACS data] has basically the same effect as if you were to take all the years and average them together....

United contends that it is problematic that Dr. Camarota, in calculating the voter registration rates, \"divide[d] the EAVS registered voter figure by ACS eligible population estimates\n   <em>\n    for the same year.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (emphasis in original). \"In other words, the 2006-2010 5-year ACS estimate, the median year of which is 2008, should not be used as a denominator for a 2010 EAVS numerator.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to United, \"the 2010 EAVS numerator should be compared against a denominator that more closely estimates the 2010 population, which would come from the 2008-2012 5-year ACS data.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Importantly, however, Dr. Camarota used \"single-year ACS data\" as well, which appears to do just that-that is, offer a denominator that more closely estimates the EAVS numerator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33 (calculating voter registration rates based on both one-year and five-year ACS eligible population estimates for the years 2010, 2012, and 2014). The Court notes that United makes no mention of Dr. Camarota's use of single-year ACS data. To the extent that Dr. Camarota will testify as to voter registration rates he calculated using both single-year ACS data and five-year ACS data, the Court believes that \"vigorous[ ] cross-examin[ation]\" and the testimony of United's own witnesses,\n   such as that of Dr. Smith, are the proper vehicles to address United's concerns.\n   <em>\n    Quiet Tech.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9321196\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/1333/#p1341\">\n    326 F.3d at 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that the testimony Dr. Camarota seeks to offer is admissible, but with one qualification.

Most notably, Gessler's knowledge and expertise in the field of voter roll list maintenance are tied directly to the same federal standard under the NVRA with which Snipes is required to comply. In the Court's view, the particular concerns\n   raised by United speak to the level of Gessler's expertise, and therefore the weight to be afforded his opinions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Broward County is a classic example of a jurisdiction that has alarmingly high voter registration rates....\" ECF No. [144] at 49, \u00b6 43. The Court is not convinced that Gessler has the requisite expertise in analyzing this kind of data to offer opinions that make assessments as to Broward County's voter registration rates. By comparison, ACRU has shown that Dr. Camarota has extensive experience in analyzing Census Bureau data, like the ACS, and other population related data. No comparable showing has been made with respect to Gessler, a lawyer by trade. Thus, although Gessler is certainly qualified to offer opinions concerning the specific list maintenance policies and procedures utilized (and not utilized) by Snipes, the Court does not find that he is qualified to offer data-driven opinions relating to Broward County's voter registration rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   With respect to reliability, United contends: \"No clear methodology is discernible from Mr. Gessler's opinion. He appears to have arrived at his conclusions by simply applying his personal knowledge of Colorado's voter registration system at the state level and his review of Florida law to the information about Broward County found in documents produced and the data sources generated for this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Importantly, United's reliability attacks focus almost entirely on Gessler's opinions concerning Broward County's voter registration rates-a subject that in any event Gessler is unqualified to testify about.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (describing Gessler's methodology as \"rel[ying] on two data sets drawn from calculations and analysis of population statistics\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (emphasizing that \"Mr. Gessler is not a statistician[,]\" \"has little familiarity with EAVS data[,]\" and \"has no basis for determining at what level a registration rate becomes potentially problematic\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (collectively addressing \"Dr. Camarota's and Mr. Gessler's methodology\" by noting, among other things, that \"the methodology used in both reports\" lacks evidence of an \"error rate\" and \"reliable, recognized statistical techniques\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17 (stating that \"Dr. Camarota's and Mr. Gessler's methodology consists of a flawed comparison between dissimilar data points\"). The only discernible challenge by United as to the reliability of Gessler's opinions concerning the list maintenance policies and procedures employed by Snipes-a subject that Gessler is qualified to testify about-is that Gessler \"[cites] no comparative studies of state voter registration systems, no national guidelines, and no widely accepted best practices ... [and offers] no explanation of how his limited Colorado experience suffices as support for his opinions on Broward\n   County's practices.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.

Even in addressing Snipes and United's reliance on the safe-harbor provision at this stage of the proceedings, however, the Court does not take the view that, as a matter of law, full compliance with the safe-harbor provision necessarily absolves an election official of any liability under subsection (a)(4) of Section 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As the Sixth Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Husted\n   </em>\n   , \"Section 8's language pairs the mandate that states maintain accurate voter rolls with multiple\n   <em>\n    constraints\n   </em>\n   on how the states may go about doing so.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173569\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/699/#p705\">\n    838 F.3d at 705-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In this Court's view, the Sixth Circuit's attentiveness to the constraints imposed upon election officials in their efforts to maintain accurate voter rolls directly informed its treatment of the safe-harbor provision. More specifically, the Sixth Circuit viewed the safe-harbor provision as Congress having provided states with \"an example\" of a residence-change procedure \"that would\n   <em>\n    comply\n   </em>\n   with the NVRA's mandates and accompanying\n   <em>\n    constraints.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173569\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/699/#p705\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173569\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/699/#p705\">\n    at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). But the Sixth Circuit did not appear to view the safe-harbor provision-though an example of a procedure that\n   <em>\n    complies\n   </em>\n   with the NVRA (including its constraints on election officials)-as an example of a procedure that\n   <em>\n    satisfies\n   </em>\n   all of an election official's duties under subsection (a)(4). Indeed, quite the contrary, the Sixth Circuit appeared to take a much more limited view, merely recognizing that the defendant's NCOA process, in mirroring the safe-harbor procedure, \"is thus\n   <em>\n    permissible\n   </em>\n   under the NVRA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173569\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/699/#p705\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

Down to its simplest form, the parties dispute whether in fact Snipes has provided all of the records requested by ACRU-a dispute that goes to the heart of\n   the relief ACRU seeks in under its Section 8(i)(1) claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020507\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(1) (requiring that each State \"make available for public inspection ... all records\" concerning programs and activities related to voter registration and list maintenance). As alluded to earlier, Snipes claims that she has fully complied with ACRU's records requests, having handed over to ACRU thousands of BCSEO documents. To the extent that there are requests by ACRU that have gone unfulfilled, Snipes contends that some of the requests in ACRU's January 26, 2016 letter required \"the creation of new records ... or required the reviewer to guess the nature of the [request].\" ECF No. [129] at 5. ACRU contends, on the other hand, that the January 26, 2016 letter \"did not call for the creation of new records or require any guessing as to what was requested.... [and] outlined specific categories of list maintenance records.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. [130] at 3. However, it is not for the Court to weigh at the summary judgment stage the competing interpretations as to the achievability or clarity of ACRU's requests. Rather, in this context, the Court must draw all reasonable inferences against ACRU, whose motion for summary judgment is under consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Group\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8962019\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/408/1328/#p1331\">\n    408 F.3d at 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Other than its own conclusory assertions, ACRU has made no meaningful attempt to explain why Snipes' contention that some of ACRU's requests call for records that are not in existence or are otherwise unclear is an unreasonable one. And the Court does not consider such an inference unreasonable given the circumstances, especially in light of the fact that ACRU has received from Snipes-through substantial discovery-documents numbering in the thousands. For example, ACRU offers no explanation as to why or how the thousands of documents that Snipes has provided are not responsive to any of the categories of documents that ACRU maintains that Snipes has continued to withhold. Nor has ACRU specified whether any of those categories of documents are indeed both in existence and in the possession of Snipes.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Snipes' Motion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Court begins with another obvious observation. Inexplicably, despite aptly describing the material issue of fact outlined above as a \"tremendous factual dispute\" in arguing against ACRU's Motion, ECF No. [129] at 6, Snipes makes an about-face in her own motion for summary judgment, asserting that \"there are no genuine issues of material fact related to Count II[,]\" ECF No. [145] at 1-2. As mentioned, Snipes claims that she has provided\n   all of the records requested by ACRU. According to Snipes, ACRU has \"attempt[ed] to 'game' the NVRA law by seeking and pursuing less [sic] information than is actually available and then claiming that Snipes is somehow negligent in her duty to produce documents.\" ECF No. [145] at 3. Overall, Snipes' Motion does not alter the Court's view that Count II is not without at least one genuine issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   First, with respect to the interactions that occurred prior to the commencement of this suit, Snipes asserts that following ACRU's January 26, 2016 letter, \"[a]t no time did [she] refuse to provide documents or allow for an inspection of documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. This assertion speaks to the phone call that took place between Snipes and ACRU's legal representative on April 5, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [12] at \u00b6 24 (alleging that on the April 5, 2016 phone call Snipes \"declined to set up [ ] a meeting\" to discuss remedial steps and the current status of the voter rolls). According to Snipes, during that phone call she \"provided the contact information for [her] General Counsel in order to coordinate inspection and follow-up.\" ECF No. [145] at 6 (citing ECF No. [129-2] at 2-3). According to ACRU's counsel, however, the phone call went as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   I just got off the phone with Brenda Snipes. The general theme of the call was \"why are you singling out Broward when you sent letters to 6 other counties.\" She even said that Miami-Dade has more people. That aside,\n   <em>\n    she declined to meet with us to discuss only Broward.\n   </em>\n   She said she would meet only if representatives from the other 6 counties were included.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   ECF No. [131-1] at 3 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [118-1] at 3, \u00b6 12 (\"\n   <em>\n    Defendant refused to meet to discuss remedies and permit inspection of records.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Snipes suggested that ACRU should focus on Miami-Dade County instead....\") (emphasis added). But Snipes denies that she ever refused to provide documents or allow for an inspection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [129-2] at 3, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. As ACRU correctly points out, then, \"[t]he characterization of that phone call differs profoundly between the parties....\" ECF No. [157] at 10. Importantly, the nature of that phone call is germane to ACRU's claim under Count II, as the Amended Complaint specifically alleges under Count II that Snipes \"failed to produce or otherwise failed to make records available.... [and] rebuffed efforts to meet to discuss and implement remedial plans to cure this violation.\" ECF No. [12] at \u00b6 33. Relatedly, ACRU argues that Snipes' February 8, 2016 letter in response to ACRU's January 26, 2016 letter, which only provided to ACRU certain certifications, constituted a \"less-than-complete response to ACRU's record request.\" ECF No. [157] at 11. Given that Snipes has since produced thousands of more records throughout discovery in response to ACRU's initial requests in the January 26, 2016 letter, such an inference is far from unreasonable. In any event, whether Snipes' initial response in her February 8, 2016 letter and her alleged refusal to arrange a meeting with ACRU during the April 5, 2016 phone call-both occurring before this suit was ever filed-would constitute an insufficient response for purposes of Section 8's public disclosure requirement remains a material issue of fact to be determined at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Second, with respect to the discovery conducted as part of this litigation, Snipes asserts that \"[a]ny documents that Plaintiff believes it does not have are a part of the VR System for which Plaintiff has not performed any due diligence to understand.\" ECF No. [145] at 3. Snipes then elaborates on how ACRU, in making \"little effort to determine how the VR System stores computer documents relating to NVRA[,]\" has elected not to \"take depositions of anybody associated with the computer system operations\" (such as Nunez) and declined to \"conduct a computer inspection of the VR System containing a great majority of the records related to NVRA disclosure requirements\" at the January 13, 2017 inspection, despite having the opportunity to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Implicit in Snipes' focus on records stored electronically in the VR System is the notion that Snipes is not required to (perhaps because she is unable to) produce such records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (citing ECF No. [111-2] at 8);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [111-2] at 8 (Snipes' objection to ACRU's request for production relating to written policies and manuals: \"[U]ser guides are contained within the VR System for which\n   <em>\n    the VR System third party contracted vendor considers confidential and proprietary information requiring court intervention for a final determination.\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis in original). However, Snipes does not cite to any supporting case law, nor has the Court found any, to indicate that records stored within the database of a third party whom a NVRA records holder contracts with necessarily fall outside the scope of Section 8's public disclosure requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Finally, Snipes asserts that ACRU abandoned the requests it made in its January 26, 2016 letter when it filed suit, apparently because ACRU has since \"[taken] no effort to request or clarify documents that were referenced and a part of [the letter].\" ECF No. 145 at 8. Snipes once again argues that \"the letter was deficient in its request for documents that would require creation (not in existence)\" and further argues, without supporting authority, that \"NVRA's 'public disclosure' of voter registration activities requirement relates to records that are actually in existence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, as already discussed, for purposes of the injunction sought by ACRU under Count II, the Court will not weigh at the summary judgment stage the competing interpretations as to whether ACRU's requests sought documents not in existence or were otherwise unclear in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that neither ACRU nor Snipes has demonstrated through their respective motions that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to Count II. To sum up, and for the sake of clarity moving forward, there exists a genuine factual issue as to whether Snipes indeed refused during the April 5, 2016 phone call to arrange a meeting with ACRU for an inspection of BCSEO's office and records, as ACRU alleges. If true, Snipes' pre-suit refusal along with her initial production of BCSEO certifications in her February 8, 2016 response letter-only to be followed by her production of thousands of admittedly responsive documents\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   this suit was filed-could support a finding that\n   Snipes did violate the NVRA's public disclosure requirement under subsection 8(i)(1) before this suit was filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020507\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(1). Conversely, Snipes may have never refused to arrange an inspection meeting with ACRU, but instead may have advised ACRU that such a meeting would need to be arranged through her General Counsel, as Snipes alleges. If true, and if ACRU declined to follow up on that invitation for the nearly three months that passed before ACRU filed suit in June 2016, ACRU's inspection of BCSEO's office and records and Snipes' production of thousands of responsive documents following the commencement of this suit could support a finding that Snipes did not violate the NVRA's public disclosure requirement under subsection 8(i)(1) before this suit was filed. It is the time period between ACRU's January 26, 2016 letter and the filing of this suit-which includes the 90 day curative period contemplated by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020510\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), the lapse of which gives rise to the private cause of action-that the Court deems operative in determining whether Snipes violated subsection 8(i)(1)'s public disclosure requirement. With respect to the specific injunction ACRU seeks under Count II, to the extent that ACRU claims that Snipes continues to withhold records in her possession that are responsive to its January 26, 2016 letter, ACRU will have to at a minimum (1) itemize with particularity those records and (2) explain how and why the thousands of records that have been produced do not satisfy its purportedly outstanding requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Nonetheless, and despite the issue having not been raised on summary judgment or at any other time during these proceedings, the Court questions whether the letter can constitute sufficient notice for purposes of ACRU's claim for failure to make reasonable efforts to conduct voter list maintenance programs under Count I\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    ACRU's failure to disclose claim under Count II. Specifically, the letter contemplated one potential NVRA violation, the violation claimed under Count I.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. [12-1] at 2 (\"[T]he list maintenance requirements of Section 8 of the NVRA [ ] ensure that ineligible voters are not participating in the political process.... The American Civil Rights Union has [ ] taken on the task of notifying you of your county's violation.\"). The letter did not contemplate the NVRA violation claimed under Count II, nor could it have; being the first correspondence between ACRU and Snipes, the letter represents the first time ACRU requested list maintenance records from Snipes. In other words, although the letter notified Snipes of a potential NVRA violation for her alleged failure to make reasonable efforts to conduct voter list maintenance programs, as far as public disclosure is concerned, the letter merely requested for the first time Snipes' list maintenance records.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020507\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020507\">\n     at 4\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"We would like to discuss with your office how to implement a remedial plan which could cure what appears to be a violation of Section 8 of the NVRA.
