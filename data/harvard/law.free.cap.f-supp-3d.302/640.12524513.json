BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   KPN asserts the '662 patent in a total of eleven cases against Defendants; in seven of those cases it is the only asserted patent, while in the remaining cases it is one of five patents-in-suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 29 at 1) The '662 patent is entitled \"Method and Devices for the Transmission of Data with Transmission Error Checking.\" (D.I. 29-1 Ex. A) As the title suggests, the '662 patent is related to the \"detection of errors, in particular transmission errors, in data streams and/or data packets.\" '662 patent at Abstract;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1: 10-11 (\"The invention relates to a method for the transmission of data with transmission error checking.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The patent explains that errors may occur when data is transmitted, for example, \"through electromagnetic radiation, inadequacies in a storage medium (transmission in time), and errors in switching and transmission equipment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 1:31-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The claimed invention allows for checking such errors by first generating supplementary data at the transmitting and receiving end of a transmission channel using a first and a second function, respectively.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1: 10-20. The supplementary data that is generated at each end is then compared to see if they correspond with each other.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If they do not, then a transmission error may have occurred and the relevant data can be re-transmitted, if necessary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 1:43-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The '662 patent also generally describes the principles of data transmission and error correction in the prior art.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Fig. 1;3:32-56. According to the patent, the concept of generating supplementary data to check for errors in data during transmission was already known.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1 :21-22, 34-3 7. The patent provides examples of prior art methods for generating supplementary data like using parity bits and a cyclic redundancy code (CRC) generator.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 1:37-46, 60-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   However, as the patent explains, these prior art systems and methods were not completely effective because transmission errors were sometimes not detected. The patent provides two specific instances when this occurred. One, referred to as \"systematic errors,\" is when the errors repeat themselves, and the other is when the data is altered, for example, compressed or encoded, during transmission.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 1:47-2:15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the \"object of the invention,\" the claimed method \"allows data to be checked for errors in a better way, and thus considerably increases the probability of transmission errors being detected,\" is well-suited \"for application to compressed data,\" and can be \"applied in a simple manner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 2: 18-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To achieve this objective, the '662 patent, unlike the prior art methods,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     varies\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the original data to create supplementary data.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 2:30-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By varying the original data, the patent explains, the probability of detecting \"systematic errors in particular increases considerably.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 2:42-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The four claims of the '662 patent are reproduced below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   1. A device for producing error checking based on original data provided in blocks with each block having plural bits in a particular ordered sequence, comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   a generating device configured to generate check data; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   a varying device configured to vary original data prior to supplying said original data to the generating device as varied data;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   wherein said varying device includes a permutating device configured to perform a permutation of bit position relative to said particular ordered sequence for at least some of the bits in each of said blocks making up said original data without reordering any blocks of original data.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   2. The device according to claim 1, wherein the varying device is further configured to modify the permutation in time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   3. The device according to claim 2, wherein the varying is further configured to modify the permutation based on the original data.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   4. The device according to claim 3, wherein the permutating device includes a table in which subsequent permutations are stored.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As can be seen, claim 1 claims a device having three components: a generating device, a varying device, and a permutating device. The generating device generates \"check data,\" which the specification also refers to as supplementary data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '662 patent at 3:32-34, 37-39. The varying device varies the original data to create \"varied data\" and then sends the varied data to the generating device. To vary the data, the varying device uses a permutating device, which permutates the data by changing one or more bit positions in each data block without reordering the blocks. All three dependent claims recite devices that claim additional features of either the varying device or the permutating device. The devices in the dependent claims are designed to modify the permutation based on time (claim 2) and the original data (claim 3) and also include a table in which later permutations can be stored (claim 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

While the claim recites various device limitations to generate, vary, and permutate data, there is no reference in the claim to a transmission channel, a transmitting end, a receiving end, or even to data transmission. Without such limitations, the other aspects of the purported inventive concept are also absent from the claim: the process of generating supplementary data at the transmitting end of a transmission channel and regenerating the supplementary data at receiving end of the channel,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:30-38; the requirement for \"a form of synchronization\" to exist between the user data and the supplementary data,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:59-62; and the process of \"comparing the regenerated supplementary data with the transmitted supplementary data,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:39-41, which is how error checking is accomplished, according to the patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Additionally, none of the capabilities or functions disclosed in the specification are described as anything other than conventional.

Therefore, the Court will grant Defendants' motion.

No. 17-88), Sierra (C.A. No. 17-90), TCL (C.A. No. 17-91), Telit (C.A. No. 17-92), and OnePlus (C.A. No. 17-89). It is one of five patents asserted against Blackberry (C.A. No. 17-82), HTC (C.A. No. 17-83), Lenovo (C.A. No. 17-84), and LG (C.A. No. 17-85).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    KPN does not contend that the Court must conduct claim construction before making a decision on the \u00a7 101 issues. (Tr. at 66) KPN previously asserted the '662 patent against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. in a case filed December 30, 2014 in the Eastern District of Texas (C.A. No. 2-14-cv-01165-JRG). That court issued a claim construction opinion. (D.I. 29-1 Ex. D) KPN disputes that the previous court's constructions are the most favorable constructions available to it and reserves the right to propose different constructions as this case proceeds. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.I. 37 at 6) The Court finds that in the instant case claim construction is not a prerequisite for determining the patent's subject matter eligibility.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bancorp Servs., L.L.C. v. Sun Life Assur.

Cir. 2012).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The Court has considered the other issues raised by the parties-including (i) whether the '662 patent claims survive the machine or transformation test (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    D.I. 37 at 10); (ii) whether the claims can be performed in the human mind (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    D.I. 29 at 12-13; D.I. 37 at 12-13); (iii) preemption concerns (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    D.I. 29 at 16-17; D.I. 37 at 16; D.I. 45 at 8); and (iv) the relevancy of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board's decision not to institute\n    <em>\n     inter partes\n    </em>\n    review on some claims of the '662 patent (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    D.I. 37 at 19; D.I. 45 at 10)-and has found none of them alters the outcome here.
