CHUTKAN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff, appearing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , challenges the Federal Bureau of Investigation's refusal to confirm or deny records responsive to his request under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"). The FBI has moved for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 (ECF No. 23). For the reasons explained below, the motion will be GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 29, 2016, Plaintiff requested \"Form 302 of interviews\" of six named individuals \"concerning the investigation of the murder of Ryan Vanderson and Larrick Sikes,\" and an \"index of available documents.\" (Decl. of David M. Hardy, ECF No. 23-1, Ex. A). On July 15, 2016, Defendant informed Plaintiff that in order to process his request for third-party records, it would need \"an authorization and consent\" from each person, proof of the person's death, or \"a justification that the public interest in disclosure outweighs personal privacy[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B). Otherwise, Defendant informed, it could neither confirm nor deny the existence of the requested records, which is commonly referred to as a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant further\n   informed Plaintiff that if such records exist, they would be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemptions 6 and 7(C), codified in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In a letter dated July 25, 2016, Plaintiff replied that he was seeking disclosure in the public interest. He explained that he was convicted of a homicide in \"an unfair trial in which state actors representing my rights refused to seek dismissal of the case.\" (Hardy Decl., Ex. C). Plaintiff proceeded to explain \"the real facts,\" exonerating him of the murder. He concluded: \"Not only is it a public interest that criminals be apprehended in this case, the undersigned has a right to the information because his due process rights have been violated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). Plaintiff faulted the investigation of the Lee County and Collier County Sheriff's Offices, and wrote that the \"FBI's investigation ... has been thwarted by the false statements given to investigators by the names listed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant rejected Plaintiff's public interest assertion in a letter dated August 9, 2016, explaining that he had not provided \"sufficient documentation demonstrating [that] the public interest in the operations and activities of the government outweighs the substantial privacy interest of the subject.\" (Hardy Decl., Ex. D). Defendant repeated its\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response and invocation of exemptions 6 and 7(C), closed the FOIA request, and informed Plaintiff that he could reopen the request only by providing a third-party privacy waiver or proof of the third-party's death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. D). Plaintiff appealed Defendant's decision to the Office of Information Policy, which affirmed the decision on October 16, 2016. (Hardy Decl., Exs. E, G). Plaintiff filed this action, construed as brought under the FOIA, in January 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 4, 2017 Order, ECF No. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
