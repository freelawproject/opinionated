MCFADDEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Plaintiff, Andrew Kowalevicz, alleges that he was arrested and charged for driving under the influence of alcohol with no legal justification. He asserts five tort claims against the United States, which employed the officer responsible for the arrest: negligence, false arrest, malicious prosecution, intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), and negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED). Compl. 5-11. The Government has moved for dismissal and for summary judgment, and both sides have provided affidavits with sharply differing accounts of what occurred. Even construing the facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, I conclude that only his negligence and false arrest claims survive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties agree that just before 11 p.m. on Wednesday, November 13, 2013, Andrew Kowalevicz was in the northwest quadrant of the District of Columbia, driving around Washington Circle. Officer Coleman of the U.S. Park Police began following him as he exited the circle onto New Hampshire Avenue, and initiated a traffic stop shortly thereafter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. 4. In response to Officer Coleman's questions, Dr. Kowalevicz said that he had consumed one drink.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Coleman then administered three field sobriety tests, and arrested Dr. Kowalevicz for\n   driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Compl. 4. But when a breathalyzer test was administered at the station about an hour after the arrest, Dr. Kowalevicz's breath alcohol content twice measured 0.000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After Officer Coleman submitted a report of the arrest, the District of Columbia Office of the Attorney General (OAG) brought charges against Dr. Kowalevicz for DUI and operating a vehicle while impaired-both criminal misdemeanors-although the charges were eventually dismissed before trial.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. These charges resulted in the revocation of Dr. Kowalevicz's security clearance (Dr. Kowalevicz has a Ph.D. in applied physics, and works for Raytheon Company).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5; Kowalevicz Decl. \u00b6 1. Dr. Kowalevicz sued the United States for negligence, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. 5-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties dispute almost all of the remaining details surrounding the night of the arrest. Supported by an affidavit from Officer Coleman, the Government has moved for summary judgment on the false arrest and malicious prosecution claims, contending that numerous factors provided probable cause for the arrest and subsequent prosecution, including Dr. Kowalevicz's erratic driving, the smell of alcohol on his person, bloodshot eyes, and poor performance on the sobriety tests.

The remaining claims, the Government argues, should be dismissed for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Mot. Dismiss 6-11. But Dr. Kowalevicz has provided an affidavit of his own, disputing many of Officer Coleman's factual claims with his own narrative of error-free driving, a single mixed drink two hours before the arrest, excellent performance on the sobriety tests, and zero visual or olfactory indicators of intoxication, as confirmed by the breathalyzer and the observations of a second officer at the station.

At trial, there would be a genuine, material dispute between the parties about whether Dr. Kowalevicz's driving, demeanor and appearance, and performance on the sobriety tests created probable cause for his arrest.

Even if I considered this unsworn and/or hearsay evidence regarding the actual reasons for the case's termination, it would not save the Plaintiff's malicious prosecution count. According to the affidavit of U.S. Park Police Sergeant Janice Bindeman, AAG Cargill told Sergeant Bindeman that \"there was enough evidence to prosecute,\" but \"OAG decided to dismiss Kowalevicz's case without prejudice because OAG lacked resources, not because of lack of evidence or lack of probable cause for the arrest.\" Bindeman Decl. \u00b6 6, Mot.
