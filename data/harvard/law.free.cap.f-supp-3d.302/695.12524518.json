Acting alone, Frederick Mutual removed the action to this Court. Target now moves to remand, arguing that removal was defective because: (1) Frederick Mutual failed to obtain consent of the other defendants prior to removal, and (2) the other defendants are citizens of Pennsylvania. For reasons set forth below, the Court will grant the motion to remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 21, 2017, Target sued, seeking to enforce its right to defense and indemnification for liability in an underlying action, filed by Ross Smith and his wife after he slipped and fell on ice in a Target parking lot in Bucks County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the time of the accident, Brickman Facility Solutions, LLC (\"BFS\") was under contract with Target to provide snow and ice management services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to the terms of their contract, BFS agreed to maintain liability insurance naming Target as an additional insured, and agreed to defend and indemnify Target against third-party claims for injury. BFS was insured by Ace American Insurance Company at the time of Mr. Smith's fall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BFS in turn subcontracted snow and ice removal to Groundtec, Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Target, in the subcontract, Groundtec agreed to name both BFS and Target as additional insureds in its liability insurance policy and agreed to defend and indemnify Target against third-party claims for injury. At the time of Mr. Smith's accident, Groundtec was insured under a general liability policy issued by Frederick Mutual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Target seeks a declaration under the Pennsylvania Declaratory Judgments Act of Frederick Mutual's duty to defend and indemnify Target as an additional insured under its liability policy. Target also seeks a declaration that Groundtec and BFS have a duty to defend and indemnify Target under indemnification provisions in the snow and ice removal contracts. In addition to seeking declaratory relief, Target alleges that Groundtec and BFS breached its contractual duties to defend and indemnify Target. Target also raises breach of contract and insurance bad faith claims against Frederick Mutual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Target alleges Frederick Mutual initially agreed to defend it in the Smiths' underlying action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, on September 22, 2017, Frederick Mutual disclaimed its defense of Target and initiated a declaratory\n   judgment action in the Court of Common Pleas for Philadelphia County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 31, 2017, Frederick Mutual filed a similar declaratory judgment action before this Court, and discontinued in state court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Target first moves to remand because Frederick Mutual failed to obtain consent of the other defendants prior to filing its notice of removal. As previously noted, \"[w]hen a civil action is removed solely under section 1441(a), all defendants who have been properly joined and served must join in or consent to the removal of the action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each defendant must sign the notice of removal, file its own, or file a written joinder in the original.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, Frederick Mutual acted alone in filing the notice of removal on December 11, 2017. However, by December 8, 2017, Target\n   had served all defendants with the complaint. Despite being served, none of the five other defendants signed the notice of removal, filed its own, or filed a written joinder to the notice of removal. Because Frederick Mutual failed to obtain the consent of the five other served defendants before filing its notice of removal, the Court will remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Target also argues that the action must be remanded because five defendants are citizens of Pennsylvania. As mentioned above, when removal is based solely upon diversity jurisdiction, the action \"may not be removed if any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Referred to as the forum defendant rule, this rule \"recognizes that the rationale for diversity jurisdiction no longer exists when one of the defendants is a citizen of the forum state since the likelihood of local bias is reduced, if not eliminated.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Groundtec, BFS, Ace, Mr. Smith, and Mrs. Smith are citizens of Pennsylvania.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the forum defendant rule prohibits removal, and provides a separate basis for remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Frederick Mutual contends that the other five defendants were fraudulently joined solely to defeat federal diversity jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, these defendants were joined because the claims raised against them are factually and legally related to the dispute between Target and Frederick Mutual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Target alleges that, like Frederick Mutual, Ace may also be held liable as an insurer for any liability resulting from the personal injury suit. Target also raises breach of contract claims against BFS and Groundtec for their purported failure to indemnify Target under the snow and ice removal contracts. Additionally, under Pennsylvania law, all parties whose interest will necessarily be affected in an action seeking declaratory relief under the Pennsylvania Declaratory Judgments Act must be joined.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Target properly joined Groundtec, BFS, Ace, and the Smiths as defendants, as their interests in recovery may be affected by the outcome of this action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since these five defendants\n   were properly joined and are forum defendants, the Court will remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Target's motion to remand will be granted.

Rule 13 provides that a counterclaim must be included as part of a defendant's pleading when certain criteria are met. Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a). In the related action, Target has filed a motion to dismiss Frederick Mutual's complaint under Rule 12. A motion filed pursuant to Rule 12 is not a pleading. No responsive pleading is due until the disposition of the Rule 12 motion. Since Target need not file compulsory counterclaims until the responsive pleading is due, Frederick Mutual's contentions regarding Rule 13 are premature. Moreover, this argument is not a basis for denying remand of an improperly removed action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
