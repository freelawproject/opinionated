BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs sue Defendant, American General Life Insurance Company (\"American General\"), for failing to disclose crucial information to Plaintiffs when they invested in Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (\"VEBA\") programs that included life insurance policies issued by American General. (Doc. 54, \u00b6 2). The particular VEBA programs that Plaintiffs invested in have been found to be tax avoidance schemes, and have thus subjected Plaintiffs to penalties issued by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"). Plaintiffs claim that American General knew that the VEBA programs at issue in this case did not comply with federal law, and yet failed to disclose that information to Plaintiffs. Moreover, Plaintiffs allege that American General promoted and marketed the Programs despite its knowledge of the Programs' noncompliance. Plaintiffs bring claims for (1) common law unfair competition (Count II); (2) misleading advertising under Florida Statute \u00a7 817.41 (Count III); (3) fraud by concealment (Count IV); (4) common law fraud (Count V); (5) violation of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"FDUTPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20501.201\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 501.201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -.23 (Count VII); (6) breach of fiduciary duty (Count VIII); (7) constructive fraud (Count IX); and (8) negligent misrepresentation (Count X).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Sea Nine VEBA Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A VEBA is a tax-exempt association providing for medical, disability, life, and other benefits to association members.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The VEBAs at issue in this case were administered by Sea Nine Associates, Inc. (\"Sea Nine\") and were offered to small, closely-held business owners as a way to provide for employee life insurance policies (the \"Sea Nine VEBA Program\"). (Doc. 54, \u00b6 4). Small business owners were advised to join the Sea Nine VEBA Programs and make supposedly tax-deductible contributions that the VEBA would then use to purchase life insurance policies. (Doc. 133, Pp. 1). Later, the business owners would take ownership of the policies and then either cash them out or borrow against them, again supposedly on a tax-free basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 1-2). Plaintiffs all consist of small business owners who participated in the Sea Nine VEBA Programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Unfortunately for Plaintiffs, the specific type of VEBA Programs administered in this case have been classified as \"listed transactions\" by IRS, meaning that they do not comply with federal law and are considered tax avoidance schemes. (Doc. 133, p. 2). In 2011, Plaintiffs began receiving letters from the IRS stating that the deductions that they claimed for contributions to the VEBAs had been made improperly and that Plaintiffs were required to pay back taxes and penalties for failing to notify the IRS that the VEBAs were listed transactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. American General's Involvement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that American General knew that the VEBAs were not tax compliant but still promoted the sale of insurance policies through the VEBAs. (Doc. 54, \u00b6 5). According to Plaintiffs, agents of American General\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   were involved with the Sea Nine\n   VEBA Programs during the 1990's and therefore knew that the Programs were illegal. (Doc. 133, p. 2). Despite this knowledge, they revived the Programs in 2002, at which time the VEBAs purchased life insurance policies from American General. (Doc. 133-30, 57:10-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, senior executives of American General worked closely with the administrators of the VEBAs and aided in the marketing and promotion of the Programs. For example, executives of American General attended marketing meetings with clients and their advisors. (Doc. 133, p. 3). The Sea Nine VEBA administrators would refer potential clients to American General's senior counsel and head of advance sales, David Robinson (\"Robinson\"), to answer questions about the insurance policies included in the VEBA. (Doc. 133-31, 74:9-16). One individual involved in the administration of the Sea Nine VEBAs-Lalat Pattanaik (\"Lalat\")-testified that he believed that the advice given by Robinson \"provided credibility\" to the Sea Nine VEBA Program due to Robinson's extensive qualifications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73:21-25, 74:1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   American General also provided marketing materials to the VEBA administrators, including software that the VEBA administrators used to illustrate the potential benefits of participating in the VEBA Programs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103:18-104:15). The marketing materials provided by American General included an \"advisor's guide,\" which is a technical informational document that provided information about the VEBA Program and the legal framework the programs are structured under. (Doc. 140-1). The American General advisor's guide was used frequently to educate financial advisors in hopes that those advisors \"would then convince their clients to-to join [the Sea Nine] VEBA program and buy American General product.\" (Doc. 133-31, 61:12-15). American General also provided a less technical informational document that was used to share information about the Sea Nine VEBA Program to other clients. (Doc. 133-35). This document was described by Sea Nine marketer Lalat as \"a great tool to engage other agents that had wealthy entrepreneurial clients.\" (Doc. 133-31, 62:25-63:2). Plaintiffs claim that the marketing materials provided by American General \"enhanced the credibility of the VEBA program by giving it the imprimatur of one of the county's most well established insurance firms.\" (Doc. 133, p. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs further contend that American General knew that the Sea Nine VEBA Programs were noncompliant with federal tax law, withheld that information from Plaintiffs and other potential clients, and continued to sell insurance policies to the VEBAs in spite of its noncompliance. In 2003, after the IRS tightened regulations governing VEBAs, Robinson asked Sea Nine employee Elliott to send documents showing that the Sea Nine VEBA Programs were compliant with the new regulations. (Doc. 133-40). Without ever receiving any confirming documentation, Robinson added the Sea Nine VEBA Programs to American General's list of regulatory compliant programs. (Doc. 133-43). Thereafter, Sea Nine submitted documents to American General, including a draft opinion letter from a tax attorney stating that the Sea Nine Programs did not comply with current regulations and that the plan documents would need to be amended. (Doc. 133-47). The plan documents were not immediately amended, (Doc. 133-30, 195:9-16); nevertheless,\n   American General continued to issue policies to the Sea Nine VEBAs until February 2008, (Doc. 133-31, 21:4-9). Based on these facts, Plaintiffs contend that American General was aware that the Sea Nine VEBA Programs failed to comply with current federal tax regulations, and yet continued to market, promote, and sell policies through the noncompliant Sea Nine VEBA Programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This case was initiated in state court on August 14, 2015. On December 4, 2015, American General removed the action to this Court based on the Court's diversity jurisdiction. (Doc. 1). On February 9, 2016, the Court entered a Case Management and Scheduling Order (\"CMSO\"), establishing that the deadline to amend pleadings was April 4, 2016. (Doc. 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 4, 2016, the deadline for amended pleadings, Plaintiffs filed the First Amended Complaint, adding their spouses and employers as parties, and dropping a claim for rescission of contracts. (Doc. 41). The First Amended Complaint alleged several causes of action: Count I alleged a claim under Florida's RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization) Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20895.01\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 895.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 895.06. Count II alleged a claim for common law unfair competition. Count III asserted a misleading advertising claim under Florida Statute \u00a7 817.41. Count IV alleged a claim of fraud by concealment. Count V asserted a common law fraud claim. Count VI asserted a claim of aiding and abetting against American General. Count VII asserted a claim under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"FDUTPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20501.201\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 501.201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -.23. Count VIII asserted a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. Count IX asserted a claim for constructive fraud. Finally, Count X asserted a claim for negligent misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On May 2, 2016, American General filed a Motion to Strike, or in the Alternative, Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint. (Doc. 44). On July 15, 2016, the Court granted American General's Motion to Dismiss for failing to plead with particularity. (Doc. 50). The Court granted leave to file a Second Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On July 29, 2016, Plaintiffs filed the Second Amended Complaint, specifying their allegations against American General. On August 12, 2016, American General filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' RICO claims, arguing that the alleged RICO enterprise is not distinct from American General. (Doc. 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On September 20, 2016, Plaintiffs moved for leave to amend in order to add federal RICO claims. On October 19, 2016, Magistrate Judge Spaulding denied Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend, finding that Plaintiffs failed to show good cause why the federal RICO claims could not have been added to their Complaint in one of the two previous amendments. (Doc. 76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On February 3, 2017, Magistrate Judge Spaulding submitted a Report and Recommendation (Doc. 80), recommending the Court grant American General's Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint, finding that Plaintiffs failed to allege an enterprise that is distinct from the entity alleged to have committed the violation. On March 30, 2017, the Court adopted Magistrate Judge Spaulding's Report and Recommendation and granted American General's Motion to Dismiss Counts I and VI of the Second Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs now move for reconsideration of the Court's Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss. (Doc. 110). Plaintiffs contend that the Second Amended Complaint contains sufficient allegations to state a claim for a RICO violation and that the aiding and abetting claim relates to\n   other counts in the Second Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Also before the Court at this time is American General's Motion for Summary Judgment as to all Counts. (Doc. 115). Plaintiffs have responded in opposition to that motion, (Doc. 133), and American General replied, (Doc. 137).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Count 1-RICO Violation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that dismissal of the RICO violation was improper because the Second Amended Complaint adequately alleges facts that establish that the members of the RICO enterprise were separate from American General and acted independently and pursued their own interests. (Doc. 110, p. 10). This argument, however, was already made in response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss and fails to satisfy any of the three factors for the Court to reconsider its prior Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Nonetheless, the Court has reviewed the case law provided by Plaintiffs in support of their motion for reconsideration, and again finds that Plaintiffs failed to allege facts that would support that the alleged RICO members in this case are distinct from American General. Plaintiffs took great pains in the Second Amended Complaint to allege that the RICO members were all agents of American General and acted on its behalf. Plaintiffs refer to the RICO members as \"agents\" throughout the Complaint, stating that each member \"acted as an agent, representative or employee of [American General].\" (Doc. 54, pp. 9-11). In further support of its agency allegations, Plaintiffs assert that alleged RICO members, Innovative, Laban, and Elliott, filed \"Notices of Agency Appointment\" with the California Department of Insurance, officially designating themselves as authorized agents of American General. (Doc. 54, p.12). RICO members Innovative and Laban were designated as \"Master General Agents\" of American General pursuant to a contract with American General dated February 7, 2004. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs also allege that \"[t]he [alleged RICO members] received commission payments from [American General]\" for policies sold through the Sea Nine VEBAs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). All of these facts alleged in the Second Amended Complaint contradict Plaintiffs' argument that these individuals were acting independently from American General with regards to their involvement with the Sea Nine VEBA plans. The case law on the distinctness requirement for a RICO violation is clear and well-settled: where a complaint fails to allege facts that establish that the alleged RICO members were acting independently from the RICO person, there is no RICO violation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ray v.

(Doc. 110, p. 17). Plaintiffs assert that the aiding and abetting claim also \"includes allegations that Defendant American General is liable for aiding and abetting fraud and other causes of action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In Florida, a cause of action for aiding and abetting requires \"(1) an underlying violation on the part of the primary wrongdoer; (2) knowledge of the underlying violation by the alleged aider and abett[o]r; and (3) the rendering of substantial assistance in committing the wrongdoing by the alleged aider and abettor.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v.

However, upon reexamination of Plaintiffs allegations set forth in the Second Amended Complaint, the Court finds that there are sufficient facts alleged to support a claim for aiding and abetting under Florida law.

The Court notes that the Case Management and Scheduling Order for this case was entered on February 9, 2016, setting the deadline for amended pleadings on April 4, 2016. (Doc. 35). The Pretrial Conference for this case is quickly approaching on August 22, 2017, with trial set for the trial term beginning on September 5, 2017.

Plaintiffs all consist of small business owners who participated in the Sea Nine VEBA Programs in an attempt to obtain insurance benefits with tax advantages. (Doc. 54, \u00b6\u00b6 16-33). Plaintiffs have not explained how any of their businesses compete with American General for a common pool of customers.

However, \u00a7 817.47 provides an exemption \"for advertising in connection with sales of insurance which are regulated under the insurance laws of the state.\" American General seeks summary judgment as to Count III, claiming that its actions are exempt pursuant to \u00a7 817.47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that insurance exemption should not apply in this case because the advertisements at issue concerned a \"welfare benefit trust\"-the Sea Nine VEBA Program-and had only a tangential connection to \"sales of insurance.\" (Doc. 133, p. 19). Such an argument, however, is contradicted by Plaintiffs' allegations in the Second Amended Complaint and other pleadings submitted by Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' summary of their claim against American General begins by stating that \"American General actively participated in a fraudulent scheme to sell highly profitable\n   <em>\n    life insurance\n   </em>\n   products\" (Doc. 133, p. 1) (emphasis added). Indeed, all of the facts presented by Plaintiffs indicate that American General's participation in the Sea Nine VEBA Program centers\n   around the sale of life insurance policies to the VEBAs. In its Complaint, Plaintiffs contend that American General participated in a \"unified marketing scheme that promoted both its [insurance] Policies and the Programs,\" (Doc. 54, \u00b6 50), and that it agreed with the Employees to sell \"[insurance] Policies through the [Sea Nine VEBA] Programs,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105). The crux of Plaintiffs entire suit against American General is that American General marketed, promoted, and sold insurance policies through the Sea Nine VEBA Programs after obtaining the knowledge that the Programs were noncompliant with federal law. Such claims contradict Plaintiffs assertion now that the advertisements at issue had only a tangential connection to \"sales of insurance.\" (Doc. 133, p. 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the advertisements at issue in this case were made \"in connection with the sales of insurance\" and are exempt from Florida's Misleading Advertising Law.

In Count V, Plaintiffs bring a claim for common law fraud, alleging that American General \"made various misrepresentations of material fact to Plaintiffs ..., and did so with the intent to induce Plaintiffs to join the VEBA Programs, purchase Policies, and make substantial payments to Defendants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Claims for fraud by concealment and common law fraud share a common element of detrimental reliance. Both require the plaintiff to have detrimentally relied upon either a false statement of material fact (fraud),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   or a concealed material\n   fact (fraud by concealment),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   made by the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   American General argues that Plaintiffs did not rely on the facts provided by American General regarding the tax compliance of the VEBA Programs. (Doc. 115, pp. 15-16). In support of this argument, American General submitted agreements signed by a few of the Plaintiffs containing reliance disclosures that provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \"The Policyowner acknowledges that he is not relying upon any representation, warranty or guarantee beyond those maintained within the insurance policy contract itself....

According to American General, these agreements demonstrate that Plaintiffs \"understood the two-level nature of the VEBA transactions and were not relying on American General ... for tax advice, that they would obtain their own tax advice, and that they understood the tax risks of VEBA participation.\" (Doc. 115, p. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   American General claims that Florida courts \"consistently enforce non-reliance language in executed documents in dismissing fraud-based claims.\" (Doc. 115, p. 16).

First, the non-reliance agreements provided by American General are not signed by all of the Plaintiffs. American General relies on language from the \"Disclosure and Acknowledgement\" clause from the VM5 VEBA Program-only one of the various Sea Nine VEBA Programs. Only five of the Plaintiffs participated in this particular program. Although American General contends that all of the Plaintiffs were \"presented with a\n   similar package of documents to review and sign,\" (Doc. 115, p. 4), the Court cannot determine based on the facts in the record that all Plaintiffs signed a non-reliance agreement. Moreover, the disclaimer language cited by American General indicates that it applies only to the \"Policyowner,\" (Doc. 115-14), which according to the structure of the Programs was the VEBA, not the individual Plaintiffs. There is nothing in the record that clearly establishes that each Plaintiff agreed not to rely on tax compliance information provided by American General. Lastly, there is an issue of fact regarding the contractual privity between the Plaintiffs and American General, as the agreements provided by American General in support of its non-reliance argument are between Plaintiffs and their agents-American General is not a party to the contracts. It is not sufficiently clear that these contractual agreements can be interpreted to negate a claim of fraud against American General as a non-signatory. In sum, American General has not met its burden of demonstrating that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact regarding the issue of fraud. Summary judgment as to Counts IV and V must, therefore, be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     5. Counts VIII and IX\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In Count VIII, Plaintiffs bring a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, claiming that American General \"held positions of confidentiality and mutual trust with Plaintiffs and voluntarily undertook and owed Plaintiffs a fiduciary duty to act in good faith for, or on behalf of, and, in the best interests of Plaintiffs individually.\" (Doc. 54, \u00b6 151). Plaintiffs allege that American General breached its fiduciary duty by personally inducing Plaintiffs to invest money in insurance policies while concealing the illegal tax status of the Sea Nine VEBAs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 153).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In Count IX, Plaintiffs bring a claim for constructive fraud, contending that American General owed a fiduciary duty and a duty of fair dealing to Plaintiffs related to the business affairs surrounding the Sea Nine VEBAs, and that Plaintiffs were denied the benefit of their investment in American General policies as a result of fraud, self-dealing and concealment of American General's conflicts of interests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 162-63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   American General moves for summary judgment on both Counts VIII and IX, arguing that there generally is no fiduciary relationship between an insured and an insurer. (Doc. 133, p. 17). According to American General, Florida courts only recognize a duty of good faith, or a fiduciary obligation, when handling third-party claims.

In Florida, the fiduciary relationship has been described as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   The relation and duties involved need not be legal; they may be moral, social, domestic or personal.

Relevant factors that aid in the determination of whether a \"special relationship\" exists include the extent of the insurance company's involvement in the client's decision to purchase insurance, and whether the insurance company held itself out as having expertise in the field and the insured relied upon that expertise.\n   <em>\n    Am.

Plaintiffs contend that American General created a \"special relationship\" that triggered a fiduciary duty through their superior knowledge and affirmative representations about the tax advantages of purchasing American General Policies through the Sea Nine VEBA program. (Doc. 133, p. 14). There is evidence in the record that American General provided marketing materials to Plaintiffs to promote the sale of its insurance policies through the Sea Nine VEBA programs. Of particular value was the \"Advisors Guide\" produced by American General which summarized the legal framework the Sea Nine VEBAs were allegedly structured under. These materials, which prominently featured American General's logo, worked to provide a level of credibility to the Sea Nine VEBA programs, and according to Plaintiffs, induced them into investing in the Sea Nine VEBAs. Despite American General's contention that there is no fiduciary relationship between an insurer and an insured during an arms-length sale of an insurance policy,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Drilling Consultants, Inc. v. First Montauk Sec.

Summary judgment on Counts VIII and IX will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     6. Count X\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In Count X, Plaintiffs bring a claim for negligent misrepresentation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging that\n   American General, acting through its agents and employees, made misrepresentations that it should have known were false; that it was American General's intention that Plaintiffs rely on those misrepresentations; and that the Plaintiffs did in fact rely on those misrepresentations and were injured. (Doc. 54, \u00b6\u00b6 167-71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that American General is vicariously liable for misrepresentations made through its agents and employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 168). American General moves for summary judgment on Count X, arguing that the evidence in the record does not support a finding that the agents or employees were acting with actual or apparent authority when making the alleged misrepresentations, and that the lack of authority negates Plaintiffs' claim for negligent misrepresentation. (Doc. 115, pp. 21-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Court notes that American General successfully argued to this Court that the agents in this case were acting on its behalf when seeking dismissal of Plaintiffs RICO claims. (Doc. 107). Now, on summary judgment, American General changes its position and claims that the agents were not acting within its authority in an attempt to dismiss Plaintiffs' misrepresentation claim. American General appears to claim an agency relationship when it suits them, and denies the existence of such a relationship when it does not. Based on American General's seemingly disingenuous change in positions, the Court is uninclined to find that the agents in this case were not acting with American General's authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire v.

Further, American General attended marketing meetings with potential VEBA clients and their advisors. (Doc. 133, p. 3). The agents would refer potential clients to American General's senior counsel and head of advance sales to answer questions about the insurance policies included in the VEBA. (Doc. 133-31, 74:9-16).Based on the case law in Florida, these facts could be sufficient for a fact finder to find that the agents in this case were acting with the authority of American General when selling Sea Nine VEBA programs.
