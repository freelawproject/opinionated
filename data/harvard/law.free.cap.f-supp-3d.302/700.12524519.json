R. Civ. P. 4(m).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In this case, the underlying events giving rise to Plaintiff's claims occurred on June 16, 2013. However, Plaintiff did not serve Walton with a copy of the Amended Complaint until May 2, 2017, almost four years after the incident, and nearly two years after the statute of limitations had run. Accordingly, the statute of limitations bars Plaintiff's claim against Walton unless the Amended Complaint \"relates back\" to the initial Complaint under Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Such an amended pleading relates back where, among other requirements, the party to be brought in by amendment knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against him or her, \"but for a mistake concerning the proper party's identity.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c). The core of the relation back inquiry is \"what the prospective\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   knew or should have known\" after the initial pleading was filed.\n   <em>\n    Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p.

Moreover, Plaintiff does not so contend.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Tr. of July 24, 2017 Hearing. Instead, Plaintiff's argument is that that the\n   <em>\n    PICC\n   </em>\n   , via Walton's supervisors, \"knew exactly who [Plaintiff] was referring to,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:1-2, and had ample time to provide Walton's \"true name.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:1-8. Yet, even assuming that PICC had adequate notice that Walton was the intended defendant, that does not establish that Walton herself had notice. Further, as explained below, any such notice that PICC had is not imputed to Walton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Third Circuit has recognized two methods of imputing notice to defendants under Rule 15(c) : (i) the existence of a shared attorney between the original and proposed new defendant; and (ii) an identity of interest between these two parties. Additionally, Rule 15(c)(3)(B) requires that the party sought to be added knew or should have known that, but for a mistake, the plaintiff would have named him or her in the original complaint.\n   <em>\n    Singletary v. Pennsylvania Dep't of Corr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498282\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/186/#p189\">\n    266 F.3d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 189 (3d Cir. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this case, neither method of imputing notice is applicable. First, Walton and the other defendants did not share an attorney prior to the running of the statute of limitations. Second, the Third Circuit has held that notice to an employer does not constitute notice to a non-managerial, staff-level employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498282\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/186/#p189\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 200 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9294507\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/354/215/#p220\">\n    354 F.3d at 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Additionally, equitable tolling does not apply in this case. For one, Plaintiff was aware that his initial attempts to serve Walton were returned unexecuted, and that PICC was at least claiming that it could not identify her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 6, 48, 52, 54, 56. Yet, Plaintiff did not request through discovery that PICC produce Walton's identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because Plaintiff has failed to show that Walton had either actual notice or constructive notice within the required 120 day period under Rule 15(c), Plaintiff's Amended Complaint does not relate back to the date of the initial Complaint. Therefore, Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claims against Walton are barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Motion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff, in his motion, basically summarizes the case and contends that there is no genuine dispute of material fact. Thus, in Plaintiff's view, he is entitled to summary judgment in his favor. Although Plaintiff is correct that Defendant has not disputed the basic facts of this case, as discussed above, the statute of limitations bars his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
