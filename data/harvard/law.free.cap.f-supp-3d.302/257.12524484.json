INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Stephanie A. Gilliard, who submitted her amended complaint\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   but\n   who is now represented by counsel, brings this action against the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") and other FDIC employees, alleging race discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Defendants moved for dismissal or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, and Ms. Gilliard subsequently moved for leave to amend her complaint for a second time. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants Ms. Gilliard's motion for leave to amend her complaint. Treating Ms. Gilliard's Second Amended Complaint as the operative complaint, the Court grants Defendants' motion to dismiss, except as to Counts One, Three, Four, and Eight. The Court also denies Defendants' alternative motion for summary judgment as premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Stephanie Gilliard, an African-American woman, is a Senior Administrative Specialist (\"SAS\") in the Administrative Management Section (\"AMS\"), Strategic Planning, Budget and Reporting Branch (\"SPBR\"), Division of Risk Management Supervision (\"RMS\") at the FDIC. Am. Compl. \u00b6 4, ECF No. 15. She has held that role-a grade level CG-13 position-since June 2011. Gilliard Aff. 14-050 at 1, ECF No. 18-1. During her tenure, she has filed at least four equal employment opportunity (\"EEO\") complaints, the first in or around October 2011. Gilliard Aff. 14-050 at 7. This action focuses on the period from about March 2013 through December 2014, when, according to Ms. Gilliard, she suffered a host of adverse employment actions-the purported denial of several promotions, the loss of employment responsibilities, unfavorable performance reviews, and exposure to a hostile work environment-because of racial discrimination and/or as retaliation for her protected EEO activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Acting AMS Chief Position\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March 2013, RMS Director Doreen Eberly issued an Expression of Interest (\"EOI\") seeking an FDIC employee to serve as Acting Chief of AMS for a 120-day assignment. Def.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8, ECF No. 18; EOI, Ex. C, ECF No. 18-3. The EOI was open to permanent FDIC employees nationwide at the CG-15 and CM-1 grade levels. Def.'s Facts \u00b6 7; EOI, Ex.

FDIC employee Janice Butler was selected and served as Acting Chief-and, consequently, as Ms. Gilliard's first-line supervisor-from early May 2013 through early September 2013. Def.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 2, 9; Am. Compl. \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Gilliard contends that, based on the position description, the Acting AMS Chief position could have been performed at the CG-13 grade level and she asserts that it should have been advertised as such. Am. Compl. \u00b6 11. Ms. Gilliard argues that Phillip Mento, the Associate Director of SPBR, RMS and her second-level supervisor, decided to list the position at the CG-15 grade level to intentionally exclude her from the role because of her race and to provide Ms. Butler-who is a white woman-an advantage in competing for the soon-to-be-posted permanent AMS Chief position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Am.

Permanent AMS Chief Position\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The permanent AMS Chief position was posted under Vacancy Announcement Number (\"VA\") 2013-HQ-0838, and was open from August 19 through September 3, 2013. Def.'s Facts \u00b6 11; Ex. F, ECF No. 18-6. Unlike its acting equivalent, the permanent AMS Chief position was listed at grade level CG-13.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Facts \u00b6 13; Ex. F. Ms. Gilliard applied for the position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 15.

Compl. \u00b6 15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. G, Rudolph Aff. 13-055 at 1-2, ECF No. 18-7. According to Defendants, the interview panel recommended the three top-ranked candidates-none of whom were Ms. Gilliard-to Mr. Mento. Def.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 17-18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. G, Rudolph Aff. 13-055 at 2. Of the recommended candidates, Mr. Mento selected Ms. Butler for the role.

Ms. Gilliard argues that she was more qualified for the position than Ms. Butler given her educational background and experience and claims that Ms. Butler was selected for the permanent Chief position because of her alleged personal relationship with Mr. Mento. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-17. Ms. Gilliard also notes that Mr. Mento issued her a Letter of Reprimand-based on an incident that occurred months earlier-on the day that she interviewed for the permanent AMS Chief position, contending that he did so to reflect badly on her during the AMS Chief application review process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 11; Pl.'s Facts in Dispute \u00b6 6, ECF No. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Senior Resource Management Specialist Position\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In or around May 2014, AMS Chief Butler hired Suzanne Jeansonne to be her assistant. Am. Compl. \u00b6 63. Thereafter, Ms. Butler created the position of Senior Resource Management Specialist (\"SRMS\"); the new position purportedly entailed performance of nearly the same duties as Plaintiff's position. Am. Compl. \u00b6 64. According to Ms. Gilliard, Ms. Butler permitted Ms. Jeansonne to assist in preparing the posting for the job, even though Ms. Butler was aware that Ms. Jeansonne planned to apply for it. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 65-66. Indeed, Ms. Gilliard asserts that Ms. Butler had trained Ms. Jeansonne in hopes of having her take on the SRMS position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 63-67. Ms. Gilliard claims that although a three-person selection panel interviewed candidates for the position, Ms. Butler manipulated the interview process to advantage Ms. Jeansonne and to disadvantage Ms. Gilliard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 68. For example, Ms. Gilliard contends that she was required to prepare a writing sample on the spot after the interview while under supervision while Ms. Jeansonne was purportedly permitted to prepare her writing sample after the interview and may have been provided early information about the writing prompt. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 66-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Ex. Y, ECF No. 18-25. According to the vacancy announcement, the position required at least one year of specialized human resources experience, including experience writing staffing\n   policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Gilliard applied for the job, but Human Resources Officer Monica Cain, who was charged with reviewing and evaluating applications, determined that Ms. Gilliard lacked experience writing staffing policies and therefore did not qualify for the position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 50-59; Ex. AA, ECF No. 18-27; Ex. GG, Cain Aff. 15-006R at 4-5, ECF No. 18-33. Like other applicants who were believed to lack required experience, Ms. Gilliard was afforded an opportunity to submit supplemental information to show that she qualified for the position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 54-57;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex.

Def.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 56-59; Ex. FF at 2-4, ECF No. 18-32. Ms. Gilliard contends that she would have qualified for the position, if her private sector experience had been properly considered. She asserts that Ms. Cain \"willfully obstructed\" her right to compete for the position by refusing to look to her private sector work experience to satisfy the requirements. Am. Compl. \u00b6 30. According to Ms. Gilliard, Ms. Cain did so as retaliation for Ms. Gilliard's past EEO activity. Am. Compl. \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Senior Human Resources Specialist (Performance Management) Position\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 11, 2014-just days after Ms. Gilliard had been notified that she did not qualify for the HR Specialist-CEP position-Ms. Cain reportedly notified FDIC's Dallas Regional Office Human Resources Officer Candy Capper that the electronic job posting for VA 2014-1103 had been breached by an individual from the Dallas Regional Office. Def.'s Facts \u00b6 60; Ex. HH, Capper Aff. at 2-3, ECF No. 18-34; Ex II, Cain Aff. at 2-3, ECF No. 18-35. Furthermore, the data system reflected that Ms. Gilliard's application materials may have been accessed. Def.'s Facts \u00b6 61; Ex. II, Cain Aff. at 2-3. Ms. Cain expressed concern that someone may have tampered with Ms. Gilliard's file and asked Ms. Capper to investigate the incident. Def.'s Facts \u00b6 62; Ex. II, Cain Aff. at 2. In particular, Ms. Cain explained to Ms. Capper that because Ms. Gilliard had filed EEO complaints, they needed to be \"especially careful with her job applications.\" Ex. II, Cain Aff. at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. HH, Capper Aff. at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Shortly after Ms. Capper's conversation with Ms. Cain, Ms. Capper reportedly mentioned the system breach-including that it involved a job applicant who had a pending EEO complaint-at a staff meeting in the Dallas Office as a \"teaching moment\" for her staff. Ex. H, Capper Aff. at 3. Ms. Gilliard alleges that she received a phone call in late June or early July 2014, from an employee from the Dallas Regional Office who told her that during the meeting Ms. Capper had called Ms. Gilliard \"a troublemaker who likes to file EEOC claims.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 32;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. GGG at 1, ECF No. 18-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   About a week after Ms. Gilliard was notified of Ms. Capper's alleged comments, Ms. Gilliard contends that she was scheduled to interview by phone for the Senior Human Resources Specialist (Performance Management) (\"HR Specialist-PM\") position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 33. On the day of her interview, Ms. Gilliard called into the interview conference line. After she introduced herself to the panel, Ms. Capper announced herself as one of the interview panelists. Ex. III, ECF. No 18-61; Am. Compl. \u00b6 34. Ms. Gilliard refused to go forward with the interview, inferring that the other panel members\n   had been \"put on notice\" about Ms. Capper's impression of Ms. Gilliard. Ms. Gilliard believed that she had been \"effectively eliminated for true consideration.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. Ms. Gilliard contends that Ms. Capper \"purposely positioned herself to sit on the panel ... to enable her to eliminate any possibility of the Plaintiff getting the said position.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 36. Ms. Capper did so, Ms. Gilliard claims, in retaliation because Ms. Gilliard had engaged in EEO activity. Am. Compl. \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Unfavorable Ratings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under the FDIC's \"Performance Management and Recognition\" (\"PMR\") system, employees are rated on two axes (1) Job Standards and (2) Behavioral Standards. Def.'s Facts \u00b6 23. On the Job Standards axis, employees are assigned a numerical rating from 1 (\"Unacceptable\") to 5 (\"Role Model\") in five different categories. Def.'s Facts \u00b6 26;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. JJ, ECF No. 18-36. The five scores are then averaged to arrive at the employee's \"Summary Job Standards Rating.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. JJ. On the Behavioral Standards metric, employees are rated either \"Below Target,\" \"At Target,\" or \"Above Target\" in each of four categories. Def.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 28-9; Ex. JJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ms. Gilliard contends that from December 2013 through December 2014, Mr. Mento and Chief Butler discriminated and/or retaliated against her when they gave her what she regards as unfairly negative evaluations. Ms. Gilliard first cites her December 2013 PMR on which Mr. Mento rated her 3 out of 5 (\"Accomplished Practitioner\") in all but one Job Standards category, resulting in an average rating of 3.2. Am. Compl. \u00b6 76; Def.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 34, 37;\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. L, ECF No. 18-12. Ms. Gilliard also complains about mid-year and year-end ratings that Ms. Butler assigned her in 2014. With regard to her 2014 mid-year review, Ms. Butler rated Ms. Gilliard a 3 in three different Job Standards categories-Demonstrates Technical Knowledge of Program Area, Applies Analytical Skills, and Provides Consultative Services. Ex. JJ at 7, ECF No. 18-36. In the remaining two Job Standards categories, Ms. Butler rated Ms. Gilliard a 2. Ex. JJ at 7. In that same evaluation, Ms. Butler rated Ms. Gilliard \"At Target\" for all four Behavioral Standards categories. Ex. JJ. Finally, Ms. Gilliard protests her 2014 year-end evaluation. On that PMR, Ms. Butler assigned Ms. Gilliard ratings of 3 in two Job Standards categories, and ratings of 2 in the other three categories, for a Summary Job Standards Rating of 2.4. Ex. JJ at 3. On the Behavioral Standards axes, Ms. Butler rated Ms. Gilliard \"At Target\" in three categories and \"Below Target\" in the remaining category. Ex. JJ at 3. Ms. Gilliard contends that Ms. Butler used pretextual reasons to justify the low ratings. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-23, 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Other Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Ms. Gilliard's Amended Complaint describes a multitude of other purportedly discriminatory and/or retaliatory actions. Among them, Ms. Gilliard asserts that during the relevant period, she had some employment responsibilities taken away from her. Most notably, Ms. Gilliard contends that from about May 2012 through June 26, 2013, she had been tasked with providing administrative management support for RMS's Large Bank Supervision section (\"Large Bank Branch\"). Am. Compl. \u00b6 73. She complains that Mr. Mento removed her from this assignment and transferred it to Angela Tarbet, a white woman.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Gilliard also claims that Ms. Butler subjected her work to \"excessive edits\" while not making similar edits on the work of white employees, and otherwise offered preferential treatment to white employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19,\n   25, 58, 79. Likewise, Ms. Gilliard contends that Ms. Butler worked to turn other managers at the FDIC against Ms. Gilliard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49-54. In addition, Ms. Gilliard complains that Ms. Butler sent her a Letter of Counseling based on an argument between Ms. Gilliard and a co-worker, who is a white woman. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. Ms. Gilliard claims that Ms. Butler insufficiently investigated the dispute, failing to seek information from an African-American female witness and relying on accounts from the other participant in the dispute. Am. Compl. \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Ms. Gilliard describes an incident that occurred on July 9, 2013.

The Court concludes that justice requires permitting Ms. Gilliard to amend her complaint. Accordingly, it deems Ms. Gilliard's Second Amended Complaint filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Ms. Gilliard offers several reasons why the Court should permit her to amend her complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Leave at 5-12. First, she explains that her prior complaints were filed without the aid of counsel and that her Proposed Second Amended Complaint primarily clarifies the facts and legal theories that she already asserted in her prior complaints.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Leave at 5-12. Ms. Gilliard also emphasizes the liberal standard for granting leave to amend and notes that this Court prefers deciding cases on the merits rather than on technicalities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Leave at 5-6, 9-12. In addition, Ms. Gilliard asserts that Defendants are not likely to suffer prejudice as a result of her amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Leave at 6-9. Defendants primarily oppose Ms. Gilliard's motion on the ground that most of the contemplated amendments would be futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Leave to File Second Am. Compl. (\"Opp'n to Mot. for Leave\") at 5-44, ECF No. 44. Defendants also assert that Ms. Gilliard has already amended her complaint once, that Ms. Gilliard was aware of the information underlying her proposed amendments when she filed her original complaint, that some of Ms. Gilliard's proposed amendments are purportedly brought in bad faith, that Ms. Gilliard engaged in undue delay in filing her Second Amended Complaint, and that Defendants will be prejudiced if Ms. Gilliard is permitted to amend her complaint. Opp'n to Mot. for Leave at 2-5, 8-10, 38-39, 41, 44-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   First, the Court determines, in its discretion, that it is appropriate to consider Defendants' futility arguments in the context of evaluating Defendants' motion to dismiss rather than in considering whether Ms. Gilliard should be permitted to amend her complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Driscoll v. George Washington Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343181\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/42/52/#p57\">\n    42 F.Supp.3d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57 (D.D.C. 2012) (\"Because review for futility 'is, for practical purposes, identical to review of a Rule 12(b)(6)' motion to dismiss, [defendant's] futility arguments are addressed below, as part of the Court's consideration of [defendant's] arguments for dismissal.\" (citation omitted) ). Second, the Court finds Defendants' other arguments in favor of denying Ms. Gilliard's motion unpersuasive. While it is true, for example,\n   that Ms. Gilliard previously amended her complaint, she did so because the Court ordered her to set out all of her claims in one complaint. Her previous amendments did not alter the substance of her claims let alone constitute the sort of \"repeated failure to cure deficiencies\" that might justify denying her leave to amend her complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stanard v.

Specifically, Defendants cite Ms. Gilliard's decision not to mention in her Second Amended Complaint allegations featured in her prior complaints that Mr. Mento hired Ms. Butler for the Acting Chief of AMS position due to a personal relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n to Mot. for Leave at 9-10, 38-39; Am.

Defendants have, however, fallen well short of establishing bad faith on Ms. Gilliard's part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First, it is hardly clear that Ms. Gilliard's Proposed Second Amended Complaint contradicts claims asserted in her Amended Complaint. Ms. Gilliard's Amended Complaint, which was filed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , must be construed liberally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Erickson v.

So construed, her Amended Complaint appears to assert both that Ms. Mento hired Ms. Butler due to a purported personal relationship and that Mr. Mento hired Ms. Butler and did not hire Ms. Gilliard for racially discriminatory reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

The fact that Ms. Gilliard's Proposed Second Amended Complaint asserts separate claims against Mr. Mento-one alleging \"prohibited personnel practices\" and another alleging race discrimination under Title VII-based on these same events lends support to the notion that Ms. Gilliard intended to state two different claims to this effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   Am.

Jan. 5, 2018) (collecting cases). Not one of those circumstances is present in this case. Ms. Gilliard filed her motion for leave to amend only about six months after this litigation began-and only about a month after Defendants filed their motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The parties have yet to conduct discovery. And, at the time that Ms. Gilliard filed her request, the Court had not yet passed on any dispositive motions. A delay of mere months, before the parties have conducted any discovery and before the Court has ruled on any dispositive motions, certainly does not constitute undue delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, Defendants assert that they will suffer prejudice if they are required to \"again pore over the over 4,000 page administrative record, concerning three administrative complaints, spanning a period of three years, to mount defenses each time Plaintiff creates a new iteration of, or attempts to expand upon previously raised claims.\" Opp'n to Mot. for Leave at 45.

Ms. Gilliard's allegations are precisely this type.

Furthermore, Defendants' contention that Ms. Butler was properly approved by Human Resources for the AMS Chief position identifies a factual dispute, but does not provide a basis for dismissing Ms. Gilliard's claim. Because Ms. Gilliard has alleged the basic elements of a race-based discrimination claim-that is, Ms. Gilliard contends that Defendants did not select her for the AMS Chief position because of her race and instead selected a different person who is of a different race-the Court concludes that Count Three survives Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

In addition, Ms. Gilliard complains that Mr. Mento called her a \"God Damn Liar\" after a dispute and that Mr. Mento issued Ms. Gilliard a Letter of Reprimand in September 2013, immediately after her interview for the Chief of AMS position, based on an incident that occurred in July 2013. 2nd Am.

Compl. \u00b6 76. Under Ms. Gilliard's theory, Ms. Capper learned of Ms. Gilliard's EEO activity and garnered the view that Ms. Gilliard was \"a troublemaker\" based on conversations with Ms. Butler. The Court expects that investigation of Ms. Gilliard's administrative complaint would have included inquiry into when and how Ms. Capper learned about Ms. Gilliard's EEO activity. Count Eight also alleges that Ms. Capper \"purposely placed herself on the interview panel for the accomplished purpose of essentially preventing the Plaintiff from having the opportunity to fairly compete\" for the HR Specialist-PM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   position. 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 76. This allegation likewise relates to Ms. Gilliard's administrative claim-the reason Ms. Gilliard worried about whether she would be afforded an opportunity to compete for the HR Specialist-PM position was because of Ms. Capper's alleged comments regarding Ms. Gilliard's EEO activity. The Court concludes that Count Eight is sufficiently \"like or reasonably related to\" the reprisal claim described in Plaintiff's administrative complaint to permit her to bring her claim in a lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Defendants also argue that, even if Ms. Gilliard exhausted her administrative remedies, for this claim, Count Eight should be dismissed because Ms. Gilliard cannot demonstrate that she suffered a materially adverse action.

The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   An action is materially adverse for purposes of Title VII's antiretaliation provision if it might \"dissuade[ ] a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Burlington v.

While Defendants construe Ms. Gilliard's claim as focusing on her nonselection for the HR Specialist-PM position, the Court perceives it as centering on the disclosure of her protected EEO activity to other FDIC employees in a manner that encouraged those employees to allegedly deny Ms. Gilliard the opportunity to compete for other positions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court cannot say as a matter of law that such claims are not materially adverse-a reasonable employee might be dissuaded from making or supporting a charge of discrimination if her colleagues shared information about her protected EEO activity and discouraged others from hiring her as a result.

The D.C. Circuit has stated that \"summary judgment ordinarily 'is proper only after the plaintiff has been given adequate time for discovery.' \"\n   <em>\n    Americable Int'l v. Dep't of Navy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11902329,3709594\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/129/1271/\">\n    129 F.3d 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1997). This practice recognizes that a nonmovant can hardly identify disputes of fact to stave off summary judgment if she has had only limited opportunity to develop and understand the facts. Indeed, in the context of discrimination cases, courts in this jurisdiction have acknowledged that \"summary judgment must be approached with special caution.\"\n   <em>\n    Gray v. Universal Serv.

In such cases, plaintiffs often face difficulty uncovering clear proof of discrimination or retaliatory intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nurriddin v.

Employers possess emails, hiring records, and other materials on which a plaintiff might rely to prove her claim. Given the information asymmetry, it is hardly fair to expect that a (purported) victim will arrive in Court with a smoking gun in her hand. Accordingly, the Court denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the remaining counts at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend is granted and her second Amended Complaint is deemed filed. Treating Ms. Gilliard's Second Amended Complaint as the operative complaint, the Court grants Defendants' motion to dismiss, except as to Counts One, Three, Four, and Eight.
