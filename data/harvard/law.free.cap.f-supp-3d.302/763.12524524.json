Larry alleges that, by selecting her for layoff, MCC denied her rights under the FMLA, and discriminated and retaliated against her on the basis of her sex and her pregnancy in violation of the West Virginia Human Rights Act and the Pregnancy Workers' Fairness Act. She further alleges that MAEI aided and abetted MCC in engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court are the defendants' motions for summary judgment.

Larry's Employment History with MCC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Beginning in September 2012, Larry was employed by the Consolidation Coal Company (\"CCC\") as a Mine Clerk at its Loveridge Mine located in Marion and Monongalia\n   Counties, West Virginia (Dkt. No. 75-1 at 4-5). Larry was then one of two Mine Clerks at the Loveridge Mine, where, along with Human Resource Supervisor Pamela Layton (\"Layton\") and Human Resource Coordinator Ilya Shlyahovsky (\"Shlyahovsky\"), she was one of the four employees who formed the entirety of the Human Resources Department at the mine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 15, 2013, following MAEI's purchase of the Loveridge Mine, MCC assumed operation of the mine and renamed it the Marion County Mine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. Larry, Layton, and the other Human Resources staff members were all hired by MCC and continued to work in their same positions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In February 2014, Shlyahovsky was promoted to the Human Resource Supervisor position at another MAEI mine, and left his Human Resource Coordinator position at the Marion County Mine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Layton encouraged Larry to apply for the position and supported her candidacy with Paul Piccolini (\"Piccolini\"), the Vice President of Human Resources and Employee Relations of Murray Energy Corporation, a related entity that provides certain human resource related services to MCC and other MAEI companies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13; Dkt. No. 75-5 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   With Piccolini's approval, Larry was formally promoted to Human Resource Coordinator at the Marion County Mine on March 31, 2014 (Dkt. No. 75-8 at 1). However, she continued to perform her prior Mine Clerk duties, together with her new responsibilities, until a new Mine Clerk was hired in July 2014 (Dkt. No. 75-2 at 36; Dkt. No. 75-9 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In October 2014, Piccolini authorized the creation of a second Human Resource Coordinator position at MCC, and also at each of four other mines owned by MAEI (Dkt. No. 75-1 at 16; Dkt. No. 76-6 at 11; Dkt. No. 75-10 at 1). On December 15, 2014, MCC selected Eric Zuchowski (\"Zuchowski\") for the second Human Resource Coordinator position at the Marion County Mine (Dkt. No. 75-1 at 17; Dkt. No. 75-9 at 1). Like Larry, Zuchowski was promoted from his prior position as a Mine Clerk, and continued to perform certain of his prior Mine Clerk duties, as well as his new responsibilities as Human Resource Coordinator, until a replacement Mine Clerk could be hired and trained. Zuchowski formally assumed the second Coordinator position on April 27, 2015 (Dkt. No. 75-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Larry's Pregnancy-Related FMLA Leave and Accommodation Following Leave\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 6, 2015, Larry gave birth to a son (Dkt. No. 75-1 at 20). She sought and received FMLA-covered leave from February 6 until her return to work on March 23, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Upon returning to work, Larry was required to express breast milk using a mechanical pump three to four times each day, and suggested to Layton that she be permitted to use a file closet attached to their shared office for that purpose.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23. Larry alleges that Layton responded \"that wouldn't be a good idea in case someone was in the office.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. It was Larry's sense that Layton believed that it would be inconvenient for Larry to use the office closet, where salaried employee files were kept.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, Larry began taking her lactation breaks in the women's restroom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    3. MCC's Reductions in Force and Larry's Layoff\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In May 2015, MCC decided to reduce production at the Marion County Mine from seven to five days per week due to poor coal market conditions (Dkt. No. 75-2 at 5). A corresponding reduction in force resulted in layoffs of approximately 180\n   hourly workers, as well as 34 salaried employees (Dkt. No. 75-9 at 2). Within the Human Resources Department, Layton was required to reduce her four-person staff by one member (Dkt. No. 75-2 at 6). Layton decided to eliminate one of the two Human Resource Coordinator positions, and ultimately selected Larry as the Coordinator to be laid off.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, 17. Larry was notified of her layoff on May 28, 2015 (Dkt. No. 75-1 at 33; Dkt. No. 75-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the time of Larry's layoff from MCC, Shlyahovsky, her predecessor, was employed as the Human Resource Supervisor at an MAEI sister mine, The Monongalia County Coal Company (Dkt. No. 75-2 at 27). In July 2015, approximately two months after Larry's layoff, Shlyahovsky was transferred back to the Marion County Mine and demoted to the position of Human Resource Coordinator there (Dkt. No. 75-2 at 26-27; Dkt. No. 76-5 at 9-10). Shlyahovsky remained in that position for approximately three months, when he then was reassigned elsewhere (Dkt. No. 75-18 at 2). Shlyahovsky ultimately was laid off in a December 2015 reduction in force (Dkt. No. 75-6 at 10; Dkt. No. 75-19 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On October 20, 2015, Larry sued MCC in the Circuit Court of Monongalia County, West Virginia (Dkt. No. 1-2), asserting claims of (1) sex discrimination in violation of the West Virginia Human Rights Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205-11-1\">\n    W.

On November 10, 2015, the defendants removed the case to this Court (Dkt. No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On January 9, 2017, the Court stayed the case pending receipt of answers to two questions certified to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, which bore directly on the potential damages available in Larry's case (Dkt. No. 94).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

After receiving the answers to the certified questions, the Court conducted a conference with the parties on July 26, 2017, to discuss the status of the case (Dkt. No. 97). After the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia entered the mandate in\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , Larry filed a motion to lift the stay in this case, which the Court granted on November 1, 2017.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Under the\n   <em>\n    Conaway\n   </em>\n   framework, the first step in the Court's analysis is to determine whether Larry has sufficient\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of sex and pregnancy discrimination to survive summary judgment. She has clearly established the first two elements of her claim: She is a female, and accordingly, a member of the protected class; further, MCC made an adverse employment decision when it terminated her as a Human Resource Coordinator at the Marion County Coal Mine in May 2015. At issue is the third prong of Larry's\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   case. MCC argues that Larry has failed to present any evidence of a nexus between her termination and her sex, pregnancy, or pregnancy-related accommodations (Dkt. No. 87 at 9). Larry contends, however, that MCC's decision to terminate her was \"contaminated\" by her recent pregnancy leave and ongoing lactation breaks (Dkt. No. 84 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   To establish the third prong of her\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   case, Larry is required only \"to show some evidence which would sufficiently link the employer's decision and the plaintiff's status as a member of a protected class so as to give rise to an inference that the employment decision was based on an illegal discriminatory criterion.\"\n   <em>\n    Barefoot v.

In other words, the third prong is \"merely a threshold inquiry,\" requiring only that Larry establish an inference of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8578706\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/178/164/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Here, sufficient facts exist to permit a rational finder of fact to infer a discriminatory motive. After being promoted to Human Resource Coordinator in March 2014, Larry had received back-to-back pay increases in October 2014 and January 2015 (Dkt. No. 84-1 at 92). A performance evaluation completed by Layton on January 23, 2015-just two weeks before Larry went on maternity leave-indicated Larry\n   was \"meeting expectations\" in all categories assessed (Dkt. No. 84-18). In the same evaluation, Layton reported that Larry was \"function[ing] very well in HR coordinator role.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8578706\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/178/164/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Approximately two months after her return from maternity leave, and during the time when she was taking lactation breaks at work, however, Larry was chosen for layoff while a newly promoted male Human Resource Coordinator, who had obviously neither taken maternity leave nor required lactation breaks, was retained in the position. Thus viewed, Larry has satisfied the \"threshold inquiry\" required under\n   <em>\n    Conaway\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Barefoot\n   </em>\n   , and established a\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   case of sex discrimination under the HRA and pregnancy discrimination under the PWFA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The burden then shifts to MCC to establish a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Larry. MCC asserts that it selected Larry for layoff because it no longer had confidence that she would \"carry out her duties professionally\" and \"maintain the requisite confidentiality of the sensitive information entrusted to her\" as a Human Resource Coordinator (Dkt. No. 75 at 8). Layton testified that she believed Larry was leaking confidential information to hourly employees and union officials (Dkt. No. 75-2 at 10-11). Although she denied divulging confidential information, Larry admitted that she made personal telephone calls to other employees from her office, during which she discussed both \"personal stuff\" and \"stuff going on in the mine\" (Dkt. No. 75-1 at 42-43). Layton testified that, during one such call, she overheard Larry denigrating Marion County Mine Superintendent Brian Frederickson (\"Frederickson\") and Assistant Superintendent Brandon Laxton (\"Laxton\"), behavior Layton viewed as potentially causing friction between hourly workers and management (Dkt. No. 75-2 at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Laxton himself testified that, on multiple occasions, hourly employees or union officials learned through leaked information that disciplinary action was to be taken by mine management before those decisions had been announced or could be implemented (Dkt. No. 75-15 at 3-9). He further testified that, in each instance of leaked human resource information, Larry was believed to be the source.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8578706\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/178/164/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Based on this, MCC has offered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Larry.\n   <em>\n    Conaway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8578706\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/178/164/\">\n    358 S.E.2d at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Given that, Larry bears the burden of establishing that MCC's reason for terminating her was pretextual.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8578706\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/178/164/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She argues that MCC's assertions that she was leaking confidential information are \"baseless\" and were manufactured to cover up its discriminatory motives for her layoff (Dkt. No. 84 at 2). For example, Laxton testified that he believed Larry advised a union representative of pending disciplinary measures against two hourly workers (Dkt. No. 75-15 at 3-4), but Larry cites evidence that the information conveyed to the union representative was known by people other than Larry, that the fax machines likely utilized in communicating the information were in public work areas, and that the events occurred after Larry had left work for the day (Dkt. No. 84-12 at 19-21; Dkt. No. 84-1 at 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Laxton also testified about a second incident in which Larry was the only person, other than Frederickson, whom he told about the hiring of 25 contract workers; nevertheless, the union representative found out about the plan (Dkt. No. 75-15 at 6-7). Larry pointed out in response that Laxton admitted that the need for contractors was first brought to his attention by mine employees, and that he did not tell Larry that the information was confidential.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Further, Layton testified that, other than counseling Larry after overhearing the telephone call about Superintendents Frederickson and Laxton, she had never discussed any confidentiality concerns with her (Dkt. No. 84-4 at 23-24). Tellingly, none of these concerns was mentioned in Larry's January 2015 performance evaluation (Dkt. No. 84-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Larry also relies on evidence that Zuchowski, the male employee retained as Human Resource Coordinator instead of Larry, was less experienced in the role and may not have even been considered for layoff in May 2015. Despite Layton's testimony that Zuchowski was among the candidates considered for layoff, the \"layoff list\" generated by MCC did not include his name (Dkt. No. 84-4 at 15; Dkt. No. 84-9 at 1). And, while Zuchowski was permitted to participate in meetings with Layton, Laxton, and other MCC managers to discuss who would be laid off, Larry was not involved in those meetings (Dkt. No. 84-4 at 6; Dkt. No. 84-1 at 38-39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, in an attempt to refute Larry's evidence of pretext, MCC argues that it is entitled to the \"same actor\" inference, that arises when an employee \"was hired and fired by the same person within a relatively short time span.\"\n   <em>\n    Proud v. Stone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524339\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/945/796/#p798\">\n    945 F.2d 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 798 (4th Cir. 1991). Where present, this fact \"creates a strong inference that the employer's stated reason for acting against the employee is not pretextual.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524339\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/945/796/#p798\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The record in this case, however, gives rise to no such inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   MCC contends that Layton was solely responsible for the decisions to hire, promote, and terminate Larry. Larry disputes that contention, however, asserting that the decision to terminate her was made jointly by Layton, Frederick, and Laxton. As previously noted, Layton consulted with Frederickson and Laxton to identify would be selected for layoff (Dkt. No. 84-4 at 6, 8). Layton herself acknowledged that the decision to terminate Larry was based on information provided by her \"bosses,\" Frederickson and Laxton.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On this record, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Layton can be wholly credited with the decision to terminate Larry, and thus whether the same actor inference should apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burgess v.

This does not amount to \"substantial encouragement or assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Failla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11826655\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/146/149/#p157\">\n    146 F.3d at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Employees are not liable as aider and abetter merely because they had some role, or knowledge or involvement. Rather the degree of involvement, knowledge and culpability required as a basis for liability is heightened by the standard that the Restatement sets forth and we adopt. Only those employees who meet this heightened standard will be aiders and abettors.\");\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8935452\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/118/1070/#p1077\">\n    118 P.3d at 1077-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We look to the Restatement (Second) of Torts for guidance, which other courts have adopted in interpreting state statutes on aiding and abetting discrimination ... Ellison has made no attempt to satisfy this standard. She points out that the stewards had knowledge of discriminatory actions and did not report them, but this does not amount to 'substantial encouragement or assistance.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The other evidence on which Larry relies in support of her aiding and abetting claim is MAEI's transfer of Shylahovsky to the Marion County Mine within two months of her layoff. While MAEI concedes that it made the decision to demote Shlyahovsky and transfer him back to the Marion County Mine as a Human Resource Coordinator, it contends that the decision to select Larry for layoff in May 2015 was made unilaterally by Layton, without any input or approval from MAEI.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8935452\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/118/1070/#p1077\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As discussed earlier, genuine issues of material fact exist as to who made the decision to select Larry for layoff. Those disputed issues of fact, however, relate to who among MCC personnel and management-namely, Layton, Frederickson, and Laxton-were the decision makers regarding Larry's layoff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Contrary to Larry's contention that MAEI was involved in MCC's decision, Piccolini testified that, while he ultimately receives and \"reviews\" layoff lists generated at MAEI mines, he does not \"evaluate\" the lists because, in his role as Vice President of Human Resources and Employee Relations of Murray Energy Corporation, he has \"no knowledge of\" various mine employees' work performance and therefore relies upon personnel at each mine to make those evaluations (Dkt. No. 77-3 at 13-14). He further testified that layoff lists are generally sent to him for the purpose of \"keep[ing] [him] apprised of what's happening at the mine level,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, and that in the case of the layoff list at issue here, he was not aware that Larry had been selected for layoff until he \"received the final listing of everybody who was involved\" in the reduction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Further, Piccolini's only prior involvement with Larry's employment at MCC was his 2014 approval of her promotion to Human Resource Coordinator and the accompanying increase in her salary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Even when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Larry, no genuine issues of material fact exist regarding MAEI's involvement in the decision to lay off Larry, and a reasonable jury could not find that MAEI was a decision maker regarding both Larry's layoff and Shylavoksky's transfer back to the Marion County Mine. For these reasons, the evidence is insufficient for Larry to establish a claim for aiding and abetting discrimination against MAEI. Furthermore, because the Court has granted MCC's motion for summary judgment on Larry's claim for retaliation under the HRA, Larry cannot maintain a claim against MAEI for aiding and abetting such retaliation. The Court therefore\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   MAEI's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
