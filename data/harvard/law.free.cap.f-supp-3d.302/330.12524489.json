BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's \"Civil &amp; Criminal Complaint\" is neither \"short\" nor \"plain.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). He describes the Defendants as an \"assorted conglomerate of landlords, property management companies, and /or credit reporting agencies,\" who \"by personal meetings and/or search of credit and legal actions ... committed alleged conspiracies/violations had actual and/or constructive knowledge of Plaintiff's national-origin, race, religion, age, to create terror-horror, intentionally and forcing people to resolve their grievances, not by laws/ judiciary/ courts, but by violence.\" (Compl.

On June 3, 2016, the D.C. Housing Authority issued him a Section 8 voucher, which would expire in six months, on December 3, 2016. (Compl. \u00b6 45). The \"payment standard [was] set at $1,823.00 for one-/1-Bedroom.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46). On June 4, 2016, Plaintiff responded to Defendant 4000 Massachusetts Apartments' (\"4000 Mass.\") advertisement of a one-bedroom apartment. A leasing agent showed Plaintiff Unit-901 and indicated that it was available for immediate occupancy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52). \"[U]pon promise of immediate move-in by the leasing-agent, Plaintiff chose\" that apartment on June 6, 2016, which, with a monthly rent of $1,775.00, including utilities, was \"within DCHA rental-standard payment for the area.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54). Plaintiff provided a copy of the Section 8 voucher \"but still was asked and forced to pay $70.00 (as non-refundable application fee), and $500.00 (as holding fee)[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55). Plaintiff paid both amounts by two separate checks after being \"assured by the agent that he would be approved and move in immediately[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The leasing agent, \"interested to have Plaintiff ... move in ASAP and to finalize renting process ... demanded that Plaintiff ... provide Originals of DCHA Package, (Request Tenancy Approval/RTA), to be filled, signed by both side, and immediately submitted to DCHA[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57). In light of the leasing agent's assurances, Plaintiff provided \"originals\" of the package \"and stopped looking for any other apartment unit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that at the time of his inquiry about the apartment at 4000 Mass., he \"was unaware that [defendant] Polinger [and supposedly other defendant landlords and property management companies] had created red-lining in D.C. NW areas not to rent to minorities, low income applicants with 'Governmental Source of Income'/HUD Section-8 rental subsidy, minorities and with plaintiff's national origin, race, religion, color[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53). Plaintiff learned from DCHA a \"few days\" after providing the requested package \"that the Polinger/property-management company, (after becoming knowledgeable of the Plaintiff's ethnicity, national-origin, race, religion, and legal actions to protect his rights), had ordered\" the leasing agent \"to contact and ask the DCHA officials to guarantee in writing that HUD Section-8 would pay 100% of the rent as rental subsidy; knowing that DCHA could not legally provide such guarantee, intended as an\n   excuse to deny Plaintiff the provisions of Fair Housing Act.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58). On June 16, 2016, \"Polinger leasing office ... mailed an 'adverse-action' letter\" to plaintiff at his former residence in Orange County, California, which \"denied renting the apartment[,] [and] \"in [a] few days/weeks\" the leasing agent was terminated. (Compl. \u00b6 59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Allegedly upon receiving \"verbal notice of intention of legal actions,\" Polinger's Senior Vice President, defendant Petrine Squires, contacted Plaintiff and on August 23, 2016, \"e-mailed the Adverse-Action letter,\" which was \"based on a credit report provided by [defendant] CoreLogic Safe-Rent agency.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60). The next day, on August 24, 2016, Plaintiff contacted CoreLogic, which allegedly refused to e-mail the credit report to Plaintiff\" and eventually \"forced plaintiff to send his picture ID\" and \"to provide [the] residence address of an acquaintance to be able to receive the Report[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61). \"Pages 4 &amp; 5 of the Credit Report, based on which the [rental] application was denied ... claimed: 'Insufficient Income and Tax Lien Information Found.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62). The latter stemmed from tax liens \"fraudulently filed by California Franchise Tax Board,\" which, despite Plaintiff's legal actions, have not been removed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65-66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Meanwhile, on July 16, 2016, Plaintiff contacted the leasing office of defendant Chesapeake &amp; Saratoga Apartments on Connecticut Avenue, N.W., which Plaintiff alleges is owned and managed by Horning Brothers. Plaintiff was shown a one-bedroom apartment, which rented for $1,725 per month. Allegedly, DCHA approved Plaintiff for the rental and he submitted the DCHA package to the leasing office. Plaintiff paid an application fee of $75.00 \"and another $550.00 ... Facilities Fee,\" both non-refundable. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 72-75). Nevertheless, Plaintiff \"mentioned\" that the application fee was \"unreasonable\" and the \"Facility/Amenity Fee\" lacked \"justification.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75). When the leasing agent \"stated that all apartment buildings in the areas are asking the same or more,\" Plaintiff contacted the nearby Park Van Ness Apartments, which provided him \"pamphlets indicating\" seemingly higher total amounts. Plaintiff concludes: \"the reason that the above amount of $211.25 per month is not deducted from rent, is conspiratorial 'Red-Lining' and to keep those with governmental source of income not to be qualified, preventing them to move to the DC-NW area.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76). Plaintiff's allegations continue in this largely incomprehensible manner against each group of defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 22-32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff attaches to the Complaint the rental application rejection notices of 4000 Massachusetts Apartments (Group I Defendant); Chesapeake Apartments (Group II Defendant); The Kenmore Apartments (Group III Defendant); 3003 Van Ness Apartments (Group IV Defendant); Mt. Vernon Plaza/W.H.H. Trice Company (Group V Defendant); and Berkshire Apartments (Group VI Defendant). (Compl. Ex. A). Each notice was based on Plaintiff's credit report obtained from either Corelogic Rental Property Solutions LLC; RentGrow, Inc. dba Yardi Resident Screening; Kroll Factual Data; or TransUnion Consumer Solutions (Group VIII Defendants).
