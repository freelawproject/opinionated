Inc., Resolute FP August, LLC, Fibrek General Partnership, Fibrek U.S., Inc., Fibrek International, Inc., and Resolute FP Canada, Inc. (\"Resolute\" or \"Plaintiffs\") filed this case alleging claims for violation of the federal RICO laws\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as state law claims including racketeering, defamation, conspiracy, and tortious interference with prospective and contractual business relations. ECF No. 1 (\"Complaint\"). Defendants are the environmental groups Greenpeace and Stand, as well as their employees and officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants now bring five separate motions to dismiss or strike, alleging that the conduct at the heart of Resolute's lawsuit consists of speech and other advocacy that is protected by the First Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In one motion before the Court, Defendants Stand, formerly known as ForestEthics, and Todd Paglia (\"Paglia\"), the organization's Executive Director, move to dismiss Resolute's complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. ECF No. 55. In a second motion, Defendants Stand and Paglia move to strike Resolute's complaint under Georgia's statute concerning Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (\"anti-SLAPP\"), O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-11.1, arguing that the complaint interferes with their speech and conduct protected under the First Amendment. ECF No. 56. In a third motion, Defendants Greenpeace International, Greenpeace, Inc., Greenpeace Fund, Inc., and Greenpeace employees Daniel Brindis, Amy Moas, Matthew Daggett, and Rolf Skar (\"All Greenpeace Defendants\" or \"Greenpeace\") also move to strike Resolute's complaint under Georgia's anti-SLAPP statute, or, in the alternative, under California's anti-SLAPP statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20425.16\">\n    Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 425.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . ECF No. 60. Greenpeace Fund moves to dismiss Resolute's complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim. ECF No. 61. Finally, Defendants Greenpeace International, Greenpeace, Inc., Daniel Brindis, Amy Moas, Matthew Daggett, and Rolf Skar\n   (the \"Other Greenpeace Defendants\") move to dismiss Resolute's complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim. ECF No. 62. The matters came for a hearing on October 10, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This court GRANTS Defendants' three motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to all claims. The Court also GRANTS both motions to strike as to all state claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff Resolute is a multi-entity company in the forest products industry, which harvests trees, and mills wood to create paper and generate products, among other activities. Complaint \u00b6 24. Resolute Forest Products, Inc. is the parent company of the remaining Resolute plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20425.16\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant Greenpeace includes related Dutch and American non-profit organizations, operating in many states including in California, where it is also organized, which advocate for environmental protections. Complaint \u00b6 31-33. Defendant Greenpeace Fund raises and donates money to the Other Greenpeace Defendants. Complaint \u00b6 33. Defendant Stand is a non-profit organized in California, which advocates for environmental protections. Complaint \u00b6 34. Defendant Paglia is the Executive Director of Stand. Complaint \u00b6 35. The remaining individual defendants are officers and employees of the Greenpeace Defendants. Complaint \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Resolute alleges that, beginning around 2012, and continuing through the present, Greenpeace targeted the company with a number of media campaigns designed to reduce the forestry company's profits through false or misleading statements about the company's impacts on the environment and on indigenous communities. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 5-19. According to Resolute, Greenpeace also spread false information in order to \"fraudulently induce donations\" to \"pay its leaders and continue raising more funds.\" Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 44, 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Specifically, Resolute claims that in 2012, Greenpeace published a false report accusing the company of logging in an area of Canada's Boreal forest protected by an environmental agreement, the Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement (\"CBFA\"). Complaint \u00b6 73. According to Resolute, Greenpeace later admitted that it had \"incorrectly stated that Resolute had breached the [CBFA].\" Complaint \u00b6 78. Greenpeace then began a campaign referring to Resolute Forest Products as \"Resolute Forest Destroyer,\" in which it fabricated \"phony photographic evidence\" and misrepresented the location of Resolute's logging. Complaint \u00b6 81. According to Resolute, the term \"forest destroyer\" is false because the company harvests only a small portion of the Boreal forest. Complaint \u00b6 89, 103. Resolute accuses Greenpeace of \"bad faith\" because the organization once reported that a logging moratorium to which Resolute was a party protected woodland caribou habitat, but then later described Resolute's logging activities within that area-which Resolute characterizes as \"miniscule\"-as \"endangering\" the caribou. Complaint \u00b6 109. Additionally, Resolute accuses Greenpeace of falsely criticizing the forestry company's relationship with indigenous communities, when in fact the company employs community members, notwithstanding lay-offs \"result[ing from] economic and market realities.\" Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 115-17, 122. Finally, Resolute claims that Greenpeace committed additional bad acts when volunteers placed banners on a Montreal landmark claiming injustice by Resolute, and when supporters presented Resolute with a \"guardian tree\" containing 61,000 signatures asking Resolute to protect the forest. Complaint \u00b6 194. In sum, Resolute alleges that Greenpeace\n   publishes \"whopping lie[s] ... misrepresenting Resolute's harvesting as a major climate change risk.\" Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 86, 100.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Much of the complaint is devoted to Resolute's criticism of Defendants' choice of tactics. For example, Resolute criticizes Greenpeace's strategy of using \"sensational headlines,\" as Greenpeace leaders have admitted to \"emotionalizing issues\" to increase pressure. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 51-53. Resolute also claims harm from Greenpeace's use of particular words, such as \"ancient,\" \"old,\" and \"endangered,\" to describe the forest it seeks to protect. Complaint \u00b6 89. Resolute claims that Greenpeace's tactics show that the organization does not \"actually care about ... real environmental protection,\" has no \"genuine interest\" in protecting the forest, and that \"science and truth are not important to Greenpeace.\" Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 56, 60, 63, 83. Relatedly, Resolute claims it was harmed by Greenpeace's omission of certain favorable facts about Resolute in its campaigns, such as the fact that Resolute impacts only a very small percentage of the caribou population in the forests in which it operates, and that Resolute follows some forestry management standards. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 11, 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Resolute claims that Greenpeace, Inc., Greenpeace International, Greenpeace Fund, Stand and Paglia closely coordinated the above described \"disinformation campaign and broader attacks.\" Complaint \u00b6 46. Resolute alleges that the Defendants agreed to coordinate this campaign, and carried it out as a racketeering scheme and a \"criminal enterprise.\" Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 42-44.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Beyond explaining that the Defendants operated together, Resolute does not identify specific acts of racketeering by specific defendants in its complaint and instead refers to the Defendants collectively as the \"Greenpeace Enterprise.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Complaint \u00b6 107.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Resolute claims that as a result of the Defendants' coordinated publications and associated activism, a number of the company's corporate customers in Europe and the United States, such as 3M and Best Buy, withdrew their business from Resolute, causing the company up to $100 million CND in economic harm. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 155, 166-67. Accordingly to Resolute, the Defendants also caused independent auditors such as Rainforest Alliance and Forest Stewardship Council to issue bad reviews of the company. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 86-88. Resolute accordingly claims damages to its reputation and goodwill. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 213-16. Finally, Resolute seeks an injunction against \"wrongful activity and disgorgement.\" Complaint \u00b6 319.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Resolute filed the complaint in this action on May 31, 2016 in the Southern District of Georgia. ECF No. 1. The complaint includes eleven causes of action:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) Racketeering in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), on the basis of predicate acts including mail fraud, wire fraud, extortion, illegal interference with commerce, and illegal monetary transactions, in the form of transmitting false reports by email\n   and twitter from 2007-2016, and processing donations;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) Racketeering in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) by investing income from racketeering;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (3) Conspiracy in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) by conspiring to spread false reports;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (4) Racketeering in violation of state law on the basis of the same acts alleged under federal racketeering;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (5) Conspiracy in violation of state law on the basis of the same acts alleged under federal conspiracy;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (6) Defamation on the basis of \"knowingly and intentionally publish[ing] false and injurious statements\" that Resolute's logging is destructive, with actual malice because they knew or had reckless disregard with respect to the truth;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (7) Tortious interference with prospective business relations on the basis of unspecified acts;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (8) Tortious interference with contractual relations on the basis of unspecified acts;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (9) Conspiracy in violation of state common law on the basis of unspecified acts;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (10) Trademark dilution in violation of state law on the basis of the \"Resolute Forest Destroyer\" campaign; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (11) Attorney's fees under state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Complaint \u00b6 218-318. Plaintiffs also seek treble damages under their federal and state RICO causes of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Complaint \u00b6 253. All claims are alleged against all defendants. ECF No. 1 at 92-122.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Defendants moved to stay discovery, arguing that they intended to move for dismissal and to strike. ECF No. 35. The Defendants then moved to dismiss and strike the complaint in five separate motions, which are the subject of this order. ECF No. 55, 56, 60, 61, 62. The district court in Georgia granted the defendants' motion to stay discovery, reasoning that \"[b]ased on a preliminary peek at the defense motions, [there was] an immediate and clear possibility of rulings that would dismiss some or all of the claims and/or Defendants,\" especially \"in light of the complaint's grand scope of factual allegations, claims, and defendants.\" ECF No. 66;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 91 (denying motion to lift stay of discovery).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Concurrently with their motions to dismiss and strike, the Defendants also filed motions to transfer venue under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201406\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) for improper venue, or in the alternative to the Northern District of California for convenience under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). ECF No. 57, ECF No. 62. The district court for the Southern District of Georgia granted Defendants' motions to transfer venue and transferred the case to this court, finding venue improper because Resolute failed to establish that a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims occurred in the Southern District of Georgia. ECF No. 104, at 5-6. Moreover, the district court for the Southern District of Georgia held that venue was proper in the Northern District of California under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201406\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) because several defendants reside in that district and a substantial part of the events giving rise to the Plaintiffs' claims occurred in that district.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201406\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201406\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although the motions to dismiss and strike were fully briefed in the district court in the Southern District of Georgia, briefing on the motions continued in this Court after transfer. The Other Greenpeace Defendants filed a Supplemental Brief in Support of their Motions to Dismiss and Strike arguing that California choice of law analysis applies to both motions, and that under such analysis, California substantive law applies. ECF No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   127 at 5-10. Defendant Greenpeace Fund also filed a Supplemental Brief in Support of their Motions to Dismiss and Strike, arguing that Resolute failed to state a claim that overcame First Amendment defenses. ECF No. 144. Plaintiffs' Supplemental Memorandum opposing the Greenpeace Defendant's Rule 12(b)(6) Motions to Dismiss and Strike argued that anti-SLAPP did not apply to federal claims and that Plaintiffs met their burden as to anti-SLAPP and state claims. ECF No. 148. Defendants Stand and Paglia provided a Supplemental Brief with citations to Ninth Circuit, Northern District of California, and California state law regarding the claims and defenses. ECF No. 161. Plaintiffs filed a Supplemental Memorandum opposing Defendants' Supplemental briefs arguing that its complaint adequately pleaded RICO violations by Greenpeace Fund and Stand, and actual malice as to all Defendants. ECF 165. Finally Greenpeace Fund filed a Supplemental Reply arguing that Plaintiffs failed to state a claim. ECF No. 168.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Choice of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Because the case was brought under Georgia law and transferred, this Court must first determine what law governs. The first choice of law question is which state's choice of law analysis applies. In federal question cases, where, as here, a case is transferred for improper venue, the choice of law of the transferee state applies.\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

All of Resolute's discussions of photograph faking and map redrawing fail to specify what individual did the faking, and Resolute does not allege that the speaker of the alleged false statements regarding the CFBA knew that the photos were faked or maps redrawn. While Resolute does specifically allege some statements by specific individuals, for example that Rolf Skar emailed Hearst fake evidence showing a violation of the CFBA, it does not allege that Skar knew this evidence was fake nor that any specific Greenpeace individual made a false claim relying on information, including photos or maps, that individual knew to be false at the time they made the claim.

Accordingly, Resolute fails to state a claim for actual malice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Additionally, while the facts pleaded in Resolute's complaint could, if true, show ill will or bad faith, such a showing cannot support actual malice. For example, Resolute claims Greenpeace operated in bad faith because it earlier stated that the caribou population was protected, and then later stated that it was endangered by Resolute's activities. Complaint \u00b6 108.

For instance, Resolute refers to a Greenpeace campaign that describes Resolute as a Canadian Boreal \"Forest Destroyer.\" ECF No. 1 \u00b6 5. Resolute's claim depends on construing the word \"destroy\" to mean \"annihilate\" or \"eliminate completely.\" In this vein, Resolute's expert witness Peter Reich states, \"Resolute has not destroyed, and is not destroying, the boreal forest. Because almost all harvested stands grow back to boreal forest, Defendants' claims about Resolute's forest 'destruction' cannot be true.\" ECF No. 77 (Reich Decl.) \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As any reader of Greenpeace's statements will know, these are not the only permissible constructions. The word \"destroy\" is a perennial instrument of hyperbole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Edward Barsamian, \"Gigi Hadid Takes on the New Look of Destroyed Denim,\" Vogue (Feb. 3, 2015) (online ed.) (https://www.vogue.com/article/gigi-hadid-style-destroyed-denim). The Vogue writer here does not intend to convey that Ms. Barsamian's jeans have been completely annihilated, but merely that they are \"worn with deliberate tears at the knee\" or \"riddled with curious new holes.\" Similarly, when the entertainment writer Shaunee Flowers states that \"Kanye West destroys Wiz Khalifa on Twitter and it's epic,\" she is not suggesting that Mr. West has actually eliminated Mr. Khalifa, but only that he has made disparaging comments about him on social media. Shaunee Flowers, \"Kanye West Destroys Wiz Khalifa On Twitter And It's Epic-Even Amber\n   Rose Gets Involved,\" Inquisitr.com (Jan. 27, 2016) (https://www.inquisitr.com/2744304/kanye-west-destroys-wiz-khalifa-on-twitter-and-its-epic-even-amber-rose-gets-involved/). And even cabining the use of the word \"destroy\" as Resolute does, Greenpeace's expert makes plain that \"destruction\" can mean many things. \"If the fundamental nature of the forest is degraded during the course of management-for example by the loss of wildlife species or ecological processes-then we can also reasonably say that it has been destroyed. After all, a forest consists of more than its trees.\" ECF No. 98-3 (Malcolm Decl.) \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Moreover, many of Greenpeace's publications at issue rely on scientific research or fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 62 at 23. \"A statement of opinion based on fully disclosed facts can be punished only if the ... facts are themselves false and demeaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Standing Comm. on Discipline v.

The submission by Resolute of two expert declarations makes more manifest, not less, the degree to which the challenged statements are protected by the First Amendment. These declarations illustrate the extent to which the challenged statements (a) concern matters of public importance and (b) are subject to professional debate. For example, declarant Frederick Cubbage undertakes a review of the FSC's suspensions of RFP's certifications and concludes: \"Resolute's 2013 FSC audits indicate possible bias. Audits of similar forests in similar situations should have similar outcomes. That did not appear to be the case for Resolute. An applicant in full compliance with relevant laws should be certified under any standard.\" ECF No. 76 (Cubbage Decl.) \u00b6 49. Greenpeace's expert, Keith Moore, disagrees with this analysis, noting that because \"[t]he FSC certification system establishes a higher standard and a broader suite of requirements,\" it is possible to comply with the relevant law and still be denied FSC certification. ECF No. 98-2 \u00b6 43. Accordingly, he concludes, \"[i]t is also incorrect to state that a company that meets regulatory requirements is equivalent to a company meeting all FSC certification requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416031\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/55/1430/#p1439\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After all, as Dr. Cubbage notes, \"forest certification, generally, refers to a\n   <em>\n    non-state\n   </em>\n   market-based policy approach to achieving sustainable forest practices and development,\" ECF No. 49 at \u00b6 3, so by definition it will encompass more than \"relevant laws.\" The academy, and not the courthouse, is the appropriate place to resolve scientific disagreements of this kind.

Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading requirements apply even where fraud \"is not a necessary element of a claim,\" but the plaintiff chooses \"nonetheless to allege in the complaint that the defendant has engaged in fraudulent conduct,\" including \"a unified course of fraudulent conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Vess v.

Resolute fails to meet these heightened pleading requirements.
