The substantive question is whether the agreement can be enforced against the Delaware Department of Education, as the responsible State Education Agency, where the charter school has ceased to exist, leaving the child with nowhere else to turn to vindicate his right to a free and appropriate education. The threshold procedural question is whether Plaintiff has waived federal jurisdiction because the settlement was finalized outside the statute's resolution process, or whether jurisdiction nonetheless exists because the case necessarily presents a substantial issue of federal law. Because I am persuaded that the agreement is enforceable against the State, and because I further conclude that resolution of that question necessarily creates a substantial federal question, Delaware's pending Motion to Dismiss will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The IDEA Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires states to \"make available a free and appropriate public education [\"FAPE\"] to all children with disabilities residing within their borders.\"\n   <em>\n    D.S. v. Bayonne Bd. of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3921948\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/553/#p556\">\n    602 F.3d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 556 (3d Cir. 2010). The Act seeks to ensure that every child with a disability has access to a FAPE that is tailored to meet his or her unique educational needs.\n   <em>\n    Charlene R. v. Solomon Charter Sch.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4171258\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/63/510/#p512\">\n    63 F.Supp.3d 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 512 (E.D. Pa. 2014). The central mechanism for securing this right is the Individualized Education Program (IEP), which is a package of special educational and related services designed to meet the unique needs of a disabled child.\n   <em>\n    H.E. v. Palmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271171\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/220/574/#p577\">\n    220 F.Supp.3d 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 577 (E.D. Pa. 2016). To administer those services, the IDEA relies on states' education apparatuses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The IDEA requires states to submit a plan of compliance to the Secretary of Education in exchange for federal money. \u00a7 1401(9). The Secretary then distributes federal funding to State Education Agencies (SEAs), which are responsible for apportioning those funds to schools and other Local Education Agencies (LEAs). \u00a7 1413(a). That process requires LEAs to apply to their SEA for funding. \u00a7 1412(a)(11)(A). With this funding, the LEA provides services to children with disabilities through,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , developing an IEP after evaluating the child and continually making revisions as appropriate. \u00a7\u00a7 1414(d)(1)(A)(i), (d)(4). The Fourth Circuit has aptly summarized the framework as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The IDEA delegates supervisory authority to the SEA, which is responsible for administering funds, setting up policies and procedures to ensure local compliance with IDEA, and filling in for the LEA by providing services directly to students in need where the LEA is either unable or unwilling to establish and maintain programs in compliance with IDEA. The LEA, on the other hand, is responsible for the direct provision of services under IDEA, including the development of an ... [IEP] for each disabled student, the expenditure of IDEA funds to establish programs in compliance with IDEA, and the maintenance of records and the supply of information to the SEA as needed to enable the SEA to function effectively in its supervisory role under [the] IDEA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Gadsby v. Grasmick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834039\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/940/#p943\">\n    109 F.3d 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 943 (4th Cir. 1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Act enforces a child's right to a FAPE by providing procedural safeguards that allow parents to contest LEA decisions regarding their children. Specifically, it requires states to adopt procedures affording an opportunity for any party to present a due process complaint regarding the \"identification, evaluation, or educational\n   placement of the child, or the provision of a [FAPE].\" \u00a7\u00a7 1415(a), (b)(6). Upon the LEA or SEA receiving that complaint, parents are entitled to an impartial due process hearing. \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(A). The findings and decisions that result are appealable in both state and federal district court. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In addition, out of concern that such adversarial proceedings alone could breed distrust and discourage cooperation between the parents and school personnel, Congress amended the IDEA in 1997 and 2004 to facilitate the amicable resolution of disputes prior to the formal due process hearing.\n   <em>\n    T.L. ex rel.

Pennsylvania Leadership Charter Sch.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270653\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/224/421/#p425\">\n    224 F.Supp.3d 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 425 (E.D.

Two additional processes were added: the resolution meeting and period [hereinafter \"resolution process\"], and the mediation process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The resolution process begins when the LEA receives a proper due process complaint and requires that a due process hearing not be held until at least 30 days after the filing of that complaint.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20500.510\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 500.510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (2007). In the interim, the LEA must hold a resolution meeting-akin to a pretrial settlement conference-within 15 days of the filing of a due process complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20500.510\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 300.510(a). The meeting allows parents to \"discuss their complaint, and the facts that form the basis of the complaint,\" and gives the LEA \"the opportunity to resolve the complaint.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1)(B). To ensure productive resolution meetings, the IDEA requires the attendance of \"a representative of the [LEA] who has decision-making authority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.510\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5) (allowing parents to seek the intervention of a hearing officer if the LEA fails to produce the required decision-maker). The parties may also agree to expand or contract the initial 30-day time frame between the filing of the complaint and the initiation of a due process hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1415(e)(2)(B), (f)(1)(B)(i). And if a settlement agreement is reached \"at a [resolution meeting]\" or during the resolution period, the parties can execute an agreement, which is then enforceable in state or federal court. \u00a7\u00a7 1415(e)(2)(B), (f)(1)(B)(i), 1415(f)(1)(B)(iii). Although it is less relevant here, a resolution reached in the mediation process under 1415(e)(2)(F) is likewise enforceable in federal or state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ordinarily, disputes regarding a FAPE denial are between parents and LEAs. Here, as discussed more fully below, M.K.'s school, Prestige, was a charter entity that Plaintiff contends will soon be defunct. Accordingly, Plaintiff has sued the State of Delaware as the responsible SEA, and Prestige has not defended the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   M.K., now 16 years old, attended Prestige Academy Charter in Wilmington, Delaware from August 2011 to the end of the 2013-14 school year. His mother, Barlowe K., filed a due process complaint on his behalf against the Charter School in November 2015. The complaint alleged that Prestige failed to appropriately evaluate M.K. and provide an appropriate educational program to meet his needs, despite his being eligible as a student with disabilities under the IDEA. Barlowe K. eventually executed a settlement agreement with Prestige on May 9, 2016 [hereinafter \"Settlement Agreement\"].\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. A. 7, ECF No. 1-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Settlement Agreement itself required Prestige to \"provide payment or reimbursement for up to $30,000 worth of legitimate educational expenses for [M.K.] to be utilized between [then] and M.K.'s 21st birthday,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.510\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.510\">\n    \u00b6 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in addition to attorney's fees in the amount of $15,000,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.510\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.510\">\n    \u00b6 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Requests for reimbursement that qualified as legitimate educational expenses, as defined by the Agreement, were to be paid within 30 days of receipt.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.510\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.510\">\n    \u00b6 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These included expenses for tutoring, related services (as defined under the IDEA), vocational training, educational evaluations, behavioral and social skills training, and assistive technology. The State of Delaware is not a party to the agreement and did not participate in the negotiations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In reaching the Agreement, the Hearing Panel Order dated January 4, 2016 states that, on December 30, 2015, the parties orally agreed to waive the 30-day waiting period in light of \"settlement negotiations [that] were taking place.\" Def.'s Ex. A-1 p. 1, ECF No. 4-1. That same order states that the resolution period ended on the day of the verbal waiver. The parties memorialized that waiver in a written agreement dated January 22, 2016, and ended the due process hearing by stipulation on January 25, 2016. Def.'s Ex. A-2, A-3, ECF No 4-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In exchange, Plaintiff relinquished her and her son's statutory rights under the IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the No Child Left Behind Act, and the Delaware state special education statutes. They also relinquished their rights arising from Prestige's noncompliance with any IDEA provisions concerning identification, evaluation, and development of an IEP for M.K., such as claims for compensatory education, tuition reimbursement, and reimbursement for attorney's fees. Plaintiff did, however, reserve the right to litigate issues of non-compliance, and claims arising from physical injuries that may have occurred while M.K. was at Prestige.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Prestige has since failed to make any payments under the Agreement, according to allegations in the Complaint. It has also not renewed its charter, and according to Plaintiff, will soon cease to be a viable entity. That means it will not be able to satisfy its obligations under the Agreement. As a result, Plaintiff contacted the Delaware Department of Education [hereinafter \"Delaware\"], as the governing SEA, but Delaware has denied responsibility for the relief negotiated in the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff has sued Prestige and Delaware alleging two counts: (i) violation of the IDEA, and (ii) breach of contract regarding M.K.'s \"ongoing federal right.\" Delaware premises its denial of responsibility on the fact that the Agreement was not made through the resolution process, and on that same basis has moved to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In the alternative, Delaware moves to dismiss for failure to state a claim, contending it has no legal responsibility, and supporting its position with eight different arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant Delaware's motion is two-fold, first challenging the existence of jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) and second, contending that Plaintiff has not made out a legally cognizable claim under Rule 12(b)(6). The standard of review for the latter is well-settled. I accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint, and assess whether they make out a plausible legal claim.\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

Depending on the nature of the challenge, that same standard may apply to the former. That is the case if the jurisdictional challenge is facial-that is, Plaintiff's allegations have not been contradicted.\n   <em>\n    Mortensen v. First Fed.

The court there held that \"\n   <em>\n    Grable\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction\" did not exist for reimbursement claims against a local school district brought under the IDEA by a Pennsylvania nonprofit corporation that had provided services to children with disabilities. Judge Caputo found that there was no substantial federal issue, but the linchpin for his decision was the Third Circuit's earlier conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence Township\n   </em>\n   that Congress had provided no private right of action under the IDEA for suppliers of services. He further concluded that there was no dispute over the meaning of a particular provision of the IDEA, but merely factual questions concerning \"monies owed based on services provided.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7-8. In short,\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   involved a commercial dispute against the backdrop of the IDEA, and not the right of a child to a FAPE. The opposite is true here, as a child's right to a FAPE is at the heart of this case, and the obligation of an SEA to provide one under circumstances such as these presents a substantial question of federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    iii.

Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   , where the underlying action was one for legal malpractice, one of the factors weighing against federal jurisdiction was that states have \"special responsibility for maintaining standards among members of the licensed professions.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p259\">\n    568 U.S. at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p259\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court described the state's interest in regulating lawyers as \"especially great since lawyers are essential to the primary governmental function of administering justice, and have historically been officers of the courts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p259\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   But this is not a case of federalizing a claim brought under state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As set forth above, Plaintiff's claim here emanates exclusively from the IDEA, there is a private right of action, and federal courts are statutorily authorized to resolve such claims. State court jurisdiction exists as a subsidiary venue to enforce agreements reached under the Act. Principles of Delaware contract law are not the source of Plaintiff's claim, but in this context merely the means of enforcement of a federal right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Admittedly, Delaware seeks to invoke principles of state law as a substantive defense, and to that extent there is a conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   But that conflict but goes to the very heart of the IDEA. As was case in\n   <em>\n    Charlene R.\n   </em>\n   , this case directly involves Delaware's obligations under the IDEA. Congress has conferred specific authority on the states under the IDEA. As I held in\n   <em>\n    Charlene R.\n   </em>\n   , the responsibility of an SEA to ensure that every child receives a FAPE is a critical structural issue under the IDEA. Any conflict between federal and Delaware law in deciding that issue weighs in favor of federal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In that regard, it should be noted that this case involves not just federal law but federal funding, as Delaware, like other states, receives federal grants to assist in discharging its responsibilities. For example, for fiscal year 2016, $36,565,162 in federal grants was awarded to Delaware. Delaware Department of Education,\n   <em>\n    Special Education: Grants and Funding, Part B Interactive Spreadsheet\n   </em>\n   1, https://www.doe.k12.de.us/cms/lib/DE01922744/Centricity/Domain/78/Interactive 20pdf 20version.pdf (last visited 1/29/2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Consequently, ruling in this case will not disturb a congressionally approved balance between federal and state judicial responsibilities, but rather serve to delineate the responsibilities of a state under the terms of a federal statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   I therefore conclude that federal question jurisdiction exists here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Substantive arguments supporting the motion to dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Delaware advances eight different arguments to suggest that the complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim. Four of them are substantive in nature, and I address them first. Delaware contends that the Department of Education is not liable for the debts of the charter school as a matter of Delaware law; that it cannot be bound to the terms of the Settlement Agreement because it was not a party to the contract; that Plaintiff must proceed under Delaware corporate law in order to obtain recovery, including any remedies available under bankruptcy law; and that enforcement of the contract against the Department would violate public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   These defenses virtually mirror those raised by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in\n   <em>\n    Charlene R.\n   </em>\n   There is nothing in the applicable Delaware law cited by the defense that renders the analysis any different here. The essential and overriding point is the ultimate responsibility of an SEA to provide a FAPE.\n   <em>\n    Charlene R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4171258\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/63/510/#p512\">\n    63 F.Supp.3d at 520-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the absence of any new authority to the contrary, and with no new argument having been raised by Delaware that would cause me to reconsider the result I reached in\n   <em>\n    Charlene R.\n   </em>\n   , I reach the same result here and reject the substantive grounds advanced in support of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural arguments supporting the motion to dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Delaware advances four additional defenses that are procedural in nature. It contends that Plaintiff's complaint was not brought within the applicable statute of limitations; that it should be barred by\n   <em>\n    laches\n   </em>\n   ; that the claim is not ripe for adjudication; and that Plaintiff failed to make proper service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The arguments as to timeliness are closely related. The defense argues that because M.K. was denied a FAPE more than two years ago, the time with within which to bring a claim has expired. This ignores the fact that the present claims are\n   based on violations of the Settlement Agreement. It is not disputed that Plaintiff's due process complaint was timely filed on November 30, 2015, well before the deadline of October 2, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. 19, ECF No. 10. Delaware essentially suggests that I treat this present action, premised on violations of the Agreement, as accruing (and therefore time-barred) on the same date as that for filing a due process complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Such a ruling would contradict a basic principle underlying statutes of limitations: that a cause of action accrues at the time of the wrongful act-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , when it comes into existence as an enforceable claim or right.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Krahmer v. Christie's Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8402681\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/911/399/#p407\">\n    911 A.2d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 407 (Del. Ch. 2006) ;\n   <em>\n    Coleman v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9216727\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/854/838/#p842\">\n    854 A.2d 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 842 (Del. 2004) ;\n   <em>\n    Accrue\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). I therefore reject Defendant's suggestion. Until there was a breach of the underlying Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff could not sue to enforce. Even if one assumed that a breach took place on the very day the Agreement was executed, and further assumes a two-year statute of limitations for an action to enforce, the time within which to bring an action would not expire until April 29, 2018. Pl.'s Resp. 16, ECF No. 10. Moreover, because I conclude that the statute of limitations itself has not run, there is little merit to an argument based upon\n   <em>\n    laches.\n   </em>\n   In that regard, however, purported delay on the part of the Plaintiff is a particularly weak argument where Delaware itself argues that even now this matter is not yet ripe for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As to ripeness, reputable counsel of record has represented to the Court that Prestige has ceased operation and is not renewing its charter. On that score, Prestige was served in this action but has failed to respond, which certainly lends credence to the proposition that Plaintiff cannot realistically look to it for performance. To the extent that Delaware can show there is meaningful recourse against Prestige, that remains a substantive defense. But in a case where a child's education is at stake, Plaintiff's allegations here are sufficient to present an issue ripe for resolution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finally, Delaware argues insufficient service because Plaintiff's method did not comply with a Delaware statute. But federal procedural rules govern service of process here, and Plaintiff's methods comply with those rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(j)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, I will deny Defendant's Motion to Dismiss in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    I considered that interpretation most reasonable since any other would render the resolution process superfluous.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     T.L.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270653\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/224/421/#p425\">\n     224 F.Supp.3d at 430\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The only incentives for parties to reach a settlement during that period seems to be that the statute renders such settlements enforceable in federal court,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(iii), and that a party may void the agreement within three business days of its execution,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.510\">\n     30 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.510\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e).
