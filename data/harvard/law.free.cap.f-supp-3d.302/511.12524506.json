Plaintiffs allege that Defendants, the City of New York and the New York City Administration for Children's Services (\"ACS\"), failed to make approximately $15 million in contributions to the Fund between 2009 and 2012. They assert a claim under Section 515 of ERISA as well as various state law claims. Defendants, who now move for summary judgment, argue that they were not obligated to make the contributions at issue. Because the Court agrees with Defendants that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all claims, Defendants' motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Head Start is a federal program that makes grants to local governments and non-profit organizations for the purpose of providing child development services to economically disadvantaged children and families.

The City of New York has operated a Head Start program since the 1960s, Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 4; Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 4, and ACS has administered the program since 1997, Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 5; Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The program is funded at least in part by federal grants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 6; Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 6.

It made clear that \"the source of the funds for the payments ...

The draft contract also provided that the City would pay the lesser of 1.5% of the premiums paid or $8,045 to the Local 205 Fund each year as an administrative fee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The May 6, 1997 letter stated that the draft contract was \"the only one available.\" Kane Deck Ex. 16. Thus, the Local 95 Fund asked ACS for \"[a] copy of the latest hospitalization administration contract between the [Local 205 Fund] and ACS\" as well as \"[i]nformation regarding the process through which the contract is renewed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Despite this request, the parties agree that the Local 95 Fund never received \"a single, integrated and executed hospitalization administration contract between the City and the Local 205 Fund,\" Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 62, and that there is no evidence that the 1979 draft contract was ever signed, Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 59; Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 31, 1997, Local 95 and the Local 95 Fund sent a letter to ACS jointly requesting that administration of the hospitalization coverage be \"transferred\" to the Local 95 Fund. Kane Decl. Ex. 19. On August 12, 1997, the HSSBC informed ACS that the subject of the potential transfer had been raised during \"the most recent collective bargaining negotiations session\" and that the HSSBC had not agreed to the transfer at the time. Kane Decl. Ex. 20. The HSSBC asked ACS to \"hold the Union's request in abeyance\" until the matter could be resolved through collective bargaining.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On August 26, 1997, ACS sent a letter to the HSSBC regarding \"the recent request by the [Local 95 Fund] to transfer administration of the Head Start Blue Cross Hospitalization contract ... from Local 205 to Local 95.\" Kane Decl. Ex. 21. ACS stated that it did \"not have a problem with this request, and [was] prepared to approve it since payment for these benefits [was already going] to District Council 1707.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The letter made clear, however, that ACS would only instruct the City's Central Insurance Program to begin directing payments to the Local 95 Fund \"upon receipt of [the HSSBC's] agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In January 1998, Local 95 and the HSSBC entered into a Tentative Memorandum of Agreement that provided that \"the administration of the Blue Cross\\Blue Shield coverage\" would be transferred from the Local 205 Fund to the Local 95 Fund \"as soon as practicable following the ratification of the 1996-2000 Agreement.\" Kane Decl. Ex. 22 \u00b6 6. The transfer appears to have occurred sometime in the summer of 1998.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kane Decl. Ex. 23. The Local 95 Fund took over administration of the hospitalization policy and assumed $2,804,387.19 in liabilities to ACS for \"reserves attributable to favorable claims experience the [Local 205 Fund] ... accumulated during the length of the [Local 205 Fund's] administration of the Contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In or around 1998, the City began directing payments for hospitalization premiums and an administrative fee of approximately 1.5% of the premiums to the Local 95 Fund. Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 73; Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 73. The City prepared annual \"Contract Registrations\" in connection with the payments it made to the Fund.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Kane Decl. Ex. 25 (\"July 2007 Contract Registration\").

The letter noted the rising cost of these benefits and advised the HSSBC that \"it would be unwise to commit to expenditures beyond [January 2007] until we can be assured that we can meet the mandates established by the federal government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On July 13, 2006, the HSSBC responded that it had \"notified [Local 95] about the projected funding shortfall and its potential impact on money available to continue to fund health care benefits at its current level beyond [January 2007].\" Kane Decl.

The decisive question in this case is whether they were obligated to do so. Plaintiffs assert a claim under Section 515 of ERISA for delinquent contributions. They also assert state law claims for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment. For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that there is no genuine dispute of material fact with respect to any of these claims and that Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Plaintiffs' Section 515 claim is barred by Section 302(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act (the \"LMRA\"). Plaintiffs' state law claims are preempted by ERISA and the LMRA and foreclosed by the New York City Charter and the Rules of the City's Procurement Policy Board (\"PPB\") Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Section 515 of ERISA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs' first claim is brought under Section 515 of ERISA, which provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [e]very employer who is obligated to make contributions to a multiemployer plan under the terms of the plan or under the terms of a collectively bargained agreement shall, to the extent not inconsistent with law, make such contributions in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan or such agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201145\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, to be liable under Section 515, a defendant must (1) have contribution obligations that arise from either a \"plan\" or a \"collectively bargained agreement\" and (2) be an \"employer\" within the meaning of ERISA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201145\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Section 515 itself \"does not impose a duty to make ... contributions, even on one who qualifies as an 'employer' ... if the duty to contribute did not previously exist.\"\n   <em>\n    Cement &amp; Concrete Workers Dist.

Opp. at 22 (citing BC/BS Contract at FND-000505).

When the application is considered in the context of the contract as a whole, it cannot be reasonably read as requiring Defendants to make contributions to the Fund.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aramony,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11089002\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/403/#p411\">\n    254 F.3d at 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Language is ambiguous when it is capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement.\" (quotation marks omitted)). Plaintiffs have not identified any language elsewhere in the contract that purports to bind non-signatories or that suggests that the carrier was concerned with the manner in which contributions were made to the Fund. Defendants had no obligation to make premium payments to the carrier; both at the time of the application and during the relevant period, that was the plan's responsibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BC/BS Contract at FND-000432, 469.

However, to the extent Plaintiffs are suggesting that such an agreement can be implied from the \"annual premium notices provided to and paid by the City,\" Pls.'
