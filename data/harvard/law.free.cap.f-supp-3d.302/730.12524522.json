Cozart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882005\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/359/#p365\">\n    680 F.3d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 365 (4th Cir. 2012). Accordingly, the Court reviews the facts as alleged by Plaintiff Gavin Grimm (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Mr. Grimm\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., ECF No. 113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Grimm is an eighteen-year-old man who attended Gloucester High School, a public school in Gloucester County, Virginia,\n   from September 2013 through his graduation in June 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 79. When Mr. Grimm was born, hospital staff identified him as female.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. However, Mr. Grimm has known from a young age that he has a male gender identity-that is, he has a \"deeply felt, inherent sense of being a boy, a man, or male,\" rather than a sense of being \"a girl, a woman, or a female.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Because his gender identity differs from the sex assigned to him at birth, he is transgender.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   17-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Like many of his transgender peers, after the onset of puberty, Mr. Grimm began suffering from \"debilitating levels of distress\" as the result of gender dysphoria, \"a condition in which transgender individuals experience persistent and clinically significant distress caused by the incongruence between their gender identity and the sex assigned to them at birth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. There is a medical and scientific consensus that treatment for gender dysphoria includes allowing transgender individuals to live in accordance with their gender identity, including \"use of names and pronouns consistent with their identity, grooming and dressing in a manner typically associated with that gender, and using restrooms and other sex-separated facilities that match their gender identity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Furthermore, when medically appropriate, treatment also includes hormone therapy and surgery so that transgender individuals \"may develop physical sex characteristics typical of their gender identity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 25. In addition, under widely accepted standards of care, \"boys who are transgender may undergo medically necessary chest-reconstruction surgery after they turn [sixteen years old].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2014, by the end of his freshman year of high school, Mr. Grimm experienced such distress from his untreated gender dysphoria that he was unable to attend class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. At this time, he informed his parents of his male gender identity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He began treatment with a psychologist experienced in counseling transgender youth and, as part of the medically-necessary treatment for his gender dysphoria, commenced the process of transitioning to live in accordance with his male identity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 36-37. By the time he began his sophomore year, Mr. Grimm had legally changed his first name to Gavin and had begun using male pronouns. He wore clothing and a hairstyle in a manner consistent with other males, and used men's restrooms in public venues without incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 38. He also obtained a treatment documentation letter from his medical providers confirming that he was receiving treatment for gender dysphoria and was to be treated as a male in all respects-including restroom use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In August 2014, prior to the beginning of his sophomore year, Mr. Grimm and his\n   mother met with the Gloucester High School Principal and the Guidance Counselor, explaining that Mr. Grimm is a transgender boy and would be attending school as a boy. Mr. Grimm and his mother also provided the Principal and Counselor with the treatment documentation letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. At the time of the meeting, the Board lacked a policy addressing the restrooms that transgender students would use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Mr. Grimm initially requested the use of the restroom in the nurse's office. However, that restroom was located remotely, and using it left Mr. Grimm feeling stigmatized and isolated. That restroom was also far from many of his classrooms, causing Mr. Grimm to be late for class when he used it. After a few weeks, Mr. Grimm sought permission to use the boys' restrooms. With the Principal's support, he began using the boys' restrooms on October 20, 2014, and did so without incident for approximately seven weeks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Principal and Superintendent informed the Board that they had authorized Mr. Grimm to use the boys' restrooms, but otherwise kept the matter confidential.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. However, several adults in the community learned of a transgender student's use of the boys' restrooms. They contacted the Board, demanding that the transgender student be barred from the boys' restrooms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board considered the matter in a private meeting and took no action for several weeks. However, one Board member proposed a policy regarding the use of restrooms by transgender students and submitted the policy for public debate at a Board meeting scheduled for November 11, 2014. In pertinent part, the policy proposed that \"[i]t shall be the practice of the [Gloucester County Public Schools (\"GCPS\") ] to provide male and female restroom and locker room facilities in its schools, and the use of said facilities shall be limited to the corresponding biological genders, and students with gender identity issues shall be provided an alternative appropriate private facility.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the meeting, Mr. Grimm decided to address the issue publicly, describing how he sought to use the restrooms \"in peace\" and had experienced \"no problems from students\" when using the boys' restrooms, \"only from adults.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. The School Board deferred a vote on the proposed policy until its December 9, 2014 meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. Before the next meeting, the Board announced plans to add or expand partitions between urinals in the male restrooms, add privacy strips to the doors of stalls in all restrooms, and to designate single-stall, unisex restrooms \"to give all students the option for even greater privacy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Despite the announced plans, speakers at the December 9, 2014 meeting continued to demand that Mr. Grimm be excluded from using the boys' restrooms immediately.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. The Board then passed the\n   policy at the meeting by a six-to-one vote. The following day, Mr. Grimm was informed by the principal that he could no longer use the boys' restrooms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-62. The Board then installed three single-user restrooms, none of which was located near Mr. Grimm's classes. Although any student was allowed to use them, no student besides Mr. Grimm did.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Because using the single-user restrooms underscored his exclusion and left him physically isolated, Mr. Grimm refrained from using any restroom at school. He developed a painful urinary tract infection and had difficulty concentrating in class because of his physical discomfort.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-70. When he attended school football games, no restroom was available for Mr. Grimm's use. As a result, Mr. Grimm was forced to have his mother pick him up from games early.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Throughout his sophomore, junior, and senior years of high school, Mr. Grimm continued the process of transitioning to live in accordance with his male identity. In December 2014, the middle of his sophomore year, he had begun hormone therapy, which altered his bone and muscle structure, deepened his voice, and caused him to grow facial hair.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-73. In June 2015, prior to the beginning of his junior year, the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles issued Mr. Grimm a state identification card designating his gender as male.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74. A year later, prior to the beginning of his senior year, Mr. Grimm underwent chest-reconstruction surgery, in accordance with the medical standards of care for treating gender dysphoria.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. Later that year, in September 2016, the Gloucester County Circuit Court issued an order changing his sex under Virginia state law and directing the Virginia Department of Health to issue Mr. Grimm a birth certificate listing his sex as male; this certificate was issued in October 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76-77. Throughout the process of these changes-up through Mr. Grimm's graduation in June 2017-the School Board maintained that Mr. Grimm's \"biological gender\" was female and prohibited administrators from permitting Mr. Grimm to use the boys' restrooms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Grimm commenced this action against the Gloucester County School Board in July 2015, alleging that the Board's policy of assigning students to restrooms based on their biological sex violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In September 2015, another judge of this Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order (1) dismissing Mr. Grimm's claim under Title IX for failure to state a claim and (2) denying his Motion for a Preliminary Injunction based on the alleged Title IX and Equal Protection Clause violations.\n   <em>\n    G.G. ex rel. Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156280\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/132/736/#p753\">\n    132 F.Supp.3d 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 753 (E.D.

An interlocutory appeal of those decisions followed, leading to appellate review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and by the United States Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   III. A;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. at 132 at 1-2. During this time, the district court suit was re-assigned to the undersigned. The case was remanded to this Court for consideration of the Title IX claim. The Equal Protection Claim also remains pending before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following the filing of Mr. Grimm's Amended Complaint (ECF No. 113), the School Board filed the instant Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 135). With respect to the Title IX claim (Count II, ECF No. 113 \u00b6\u00b6 90-92), the School Board argues that its policy of separating restrooms by physiological\n   sex is valid under Title IX because (1) Title IX only allows for claims on the basis of sex, rather than gender identity, and (2) gender identity and sex, as addressed in Title IX, are not equivalent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 136 at 6, 12-26. With respect to the Equal Protection claim (Count I, ECF No. 113 \u00b6\u00b6 81-89), the School Board argues that its policy does not violate the Equal Protection Clause because transgender individuals are not members of a suspect class entitled to heightened scrutiny, and the Policy should be viewed as presumptively constitutional under both rational basis review and intermediate scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.

Md. 2018). Although these precedents are not binding upon this Court, the thorough analyses of analogous questions provided by the rulings proves persuasive. Moreover, to the extent that the Fourth Circuit's consideration of the Title IX claim provides meaningful guidance for this Court's analysis of the Title IX regulation, the earlier dismissal of the Title IX claim lacked such guidance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   p. 743 and note 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, a number of factual developments warrant reconsideration of the original decision to dismiss the Title IX claim. When Mr. Grimm filed his initial complaint in 2015, he alleged that the Board's policy violated his rights under Title IX on the day the policy was first issued, which occurred in the middle of his sophomore year. The Amended Complaint alleges that the Board violated his rights under Title IX when the policy was issued, and also throughout the remainder of his time as a student at Gloucester High School. Am. Compl., ECF No. 113 \u00b6 A. Since the previous dismissal of the Title IX claim, Mr. Grimm has received chest reconstruction surgery, obtained an order from Gloucester County Circuit Court legally changing his sex under Virginia law, and has received a new birth certificate from the Virginia Department of Health listing his sex as male.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-77. The previous decision was rendered without any opportunity\n   to consider whether the Board's policy violated Title IX throughout the remainder of Mr. Grimm's time at Gloucester High School, and in light of these factual developments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For these reasons, the Court concludes that revisiting the question of whether Mr. Grimm has stated a plausible Title IX claim is warranted. The Court now examines the claim's merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 113 \u00b6\u00b6 90-92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Title IX Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Title IX provides that no person \"shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20106.31\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 106.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Board also contends that the term \"sex\" \"at a minimum\n   <em>\n    includes\n   </em>\n   the physiological distinction between men and women.\" ECF No. 136 at 13. Therefore, the Board argues, this Court must interpret Title IX as applying only to discrimination on the basis of physiological sex, rather than gender identity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Before evaluating whether discrimination on the basis of a plaintiff's transgender status constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX, the Court must address the difficulties inherent in the Board's view of \"sex\" under Title IX. That construction may be an appealingly simple way of interpreting the term \"sex.\" However, the Board argues that the Policy \"distinguishes boys and girls based on physical sex characteristics alone,\" ECF No. 136 at 21, but fails to acknowledge that there are individuals who possess both male and female physical sex characteristics. As Mr. Grimm contends, attempting to draw lines based on physiological and anatomical characteristics proves unmanageable: how would the Board's policy apply to individuals who have had genital surgery, individuals whose genitals were injured in an accident, or those with intersex traits who have genital characteristics that are neither typically male nor female?\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grimm I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054700\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/709/\">\n    822 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   720-21 ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Evancho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268046\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/237/267/#p288\">\n    237 F.Supp.3d at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he Board has adopted a student bathroom policy that turns exclusively on the then-existing presence of a determinate external sex organ, no matter what other biological or gender markers may exist....\"). In Mr. Grimm's situation, how would the Board have continued to implement the Policy after Mr. Grimm's medical procedures? Mr. Grimm had attained some secondary male physical sex characteristics after hormone therapy and chest reconstruction surgery. Accordingly, acts of discrimination on the basis of physiological sex certainly could have occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Policy in question assigned restrooms based on \"biological gender,\" not physiological characteristics. This term has not been accepted by the medical community, because \"sex\"-the \"attributes that characterize biological maleness or femaleness\" (such as sex-determining genes, sex chromosomes, internal and external genitalia, and secondary sex characteristics)-is distinct from \"gender,\" or the \"internal, deeply held sense\" of being a man or a woman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wylie C.

Given the Policy's disregard for these distinctions, its use of the term \"biological gender\" functioned as a proxy for physiological characteristics that a student may or may not have had. The term allowed the Board to isolate, distinguish, and subject to differential treatment any student who deviated from what the Board viewed a male or female student\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   be, and from the physiological characteristics the Board believed that a male or female student\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court next turns to consideration of \u00a7 106.33.

The Board expands this argument by contending that concerns over student privacy extend to protecting students like Mr. Grimm who, for whatever reason, may be uncomfortable using a restroom corresponding with their physiological sex. The Board argues that by permitting such students to use a single-user restroom, the Board is also protecting the privacy of students like Mr. Grimm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Board's argument rings hollow.

Second, as the Seventh Circuit observed, a \"transgender student's presence in a restroom provides no more of a risk to other students' privacy rights than the presence of an overly curious student of the same biological sex who decides to sneak glances at his or her classmates performing their bodily functions.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1049\">\n    858 F.3d at 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, if school districts were genuinely concerned with protecting the privacy of students who have different-looking anatomies, \"then it would seem that separate bathrooms also would be appropriate for pre-pubescent and post-pubescent children who do not look alike anatomically,\" which the school district had not provided.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1049\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1049\">\n    at 1052-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For example, the\n   Board had taken steps \"to give all students the option for even greater privacy\" by installing partitions between urinals and privacy strips for stall doors. ECF No. 113 \u00b6 57. Additionally, students who wanted greater privacy for any reason could have used one of the new single-stall restrooms made available upon implementation of the policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grimm I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054700\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/709/\">\n    822 F.3d at 728-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Davis, J., concurring). Furthermore, as the\n   <em>\n    M.A.B.\n   </em>\n   court recognized, it is significant when a school board fails to provide \"any explanation for why completely barring [the transgender student] from the boys' [segregated facility] protects the privacy of other boys,\" \"while the availability of single-use restrooms or locker stalls does not.\"\n   <em>\n    M.A.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523053\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/286/704/#p711\">\n    286 F.Supp.3d at 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As in\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    M.A.B.\n   </em>\n   , preventing Mr. Grimm from using the boys' restrooms did nothing to protect the privacy rights of other students, but certainly singled out and stigmatized Mr. Grimm.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523053\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/286/704/#p711\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Similarly, the Board's argument that the policy should not be construed as violating the Equal Protection Clause because the policy treated all boys and girls the same is unavailing. ECF No. 136 at 26-37. The Policy singled out Mr. Grimm for differing treatment because it \"treat[ed] transgender students ... who fail to conform to the sex-based stereotypes associated with their assigned sex at birth[ ] differently,\" whereas a boy making the personal choice to change clothes in or use a single-stall restroom would not have been singled out by the school policy.\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276620\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1034/#p1049\">\n    858 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1051 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grimm I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054700\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/709/\">\n    822 F.3d at 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Davis, J., concurring) (\"For other students, using the single-stall restrooms carries no stigma whatsoever, whereas for G.G., using those same restrooms is tantamount to humiliation and a continuing mark of difference among his fellow students.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   For these reasons, the Court concludes that Mr. Grimm has sufficiently pled that the Policy was not substantially related to protecting other students' privacy rights, because there were many other ways to protect privacy interests in a non-discriminatory and more effective manner than barring Mr. Grimm from using the boys' restrooms.
