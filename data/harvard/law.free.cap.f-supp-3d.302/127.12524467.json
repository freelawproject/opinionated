COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case raises difficult questions concerning the ability of private citizens to sue the President for violations of his duty to preserve his official records for historical account. Citing media reports that appeared soon after President Trump took office, plaintiffs Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the National Security Archives allege that White House staffers have conducted official business using instant messaging applications that automatically delete messages after they are read. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the use of these apps violates the Presidential Records Act of 1978, which obligates the President to first classify and then take steps to maintain \"presidential records.\" They also request injunctive and mandamus relief requiring the President to comply with the Act. Finally, Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the White House has violated the Take Care Clause of the Constitution by making policy through executive order, rather than agency rulemaking, so as to avoid the public disclosure of records under other statutes like the Administrative Procedure Act and the Freedom of Information Act. The government has moved to dismiss the suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The use of automatically-disappearing text messages to conduct White House business would almost certainly run afoul of the Presidential Records Act. But that merits question is not before the Court. Rather, the threshold question presented by the government's motion to dismiss is whether Plaintiffs have identified a valid cause of action that would enable their case to proceed to the merits. The Court concludes that they have not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Presidential Records Act reflects a careful legislative balancing of two competing goals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v. Bush\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Armstrong I\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3488854,10542487\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/924/282/\">\n    924 F.2d 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 290 (D.C. Cir. 1991). On the one hand, Congress wanted to ensure that presidential records are preserved so that the public would have access to them after the President leaves office.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3488854,10542487\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/924/282/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On the other, Congress \"sought assiduously to minimize outside interference with the day-to-day operations\n   of the President and his closest advisors and to ensure executive branch control over presidential records during the President's term in office.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3488854,10542487\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/924/282/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In striking this balance, Congress chose not to create a private right of action to enforce the Act. And because the President is not an agency,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franklin v. Massachusetts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481206\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/788/#p801\">\n    505 U.S. 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 801,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481206\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/788/#p801\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481206\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/788/#p801\">\n    120 L.Ed.2d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), his compliance with the PRA cannot be challenged under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To the extent judicial review of the President's decisions under the Presidential Records Act is at all available, plaintiffs must root their claims elsewhere. Here Plaintiffs invoke the Court's mandamus jurisdiction. But they have failed to state a valid mandamus claim because the actions they seek to compel-like the issuance of guidelines prohibiting the use of the challenged messaging apps-are too discretionary in nature to satisfy the stringent requirements for mandamus relief. And because Plaintiffs have failed to state a valid mandamus claim, the counts of their complaint that are premised on violations of the Presidential Records Act must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs' contention that the President has violated the Constitution's Take Care Clause by making policy through executive order meets a similar fate. Whether claims brought directly under the Take Care Clause are even justiciable is open to debate. But regardless of whether some form of relief is available, Plaintiffs have not stated a claim to it here. They challenge no particular executive order; they concede that the President may issue executive orders generally; and they offer no authority preventing the President from choosing to address an issue through executive order rather than the administrative process, even if that choice limits the public's access to government records. As a result, the Court must dismiss the Plaintiffs' Take Care Clause claim as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Count IV, in contrast, is brought directly under the Take Care Clause of the Constitution: CREW seeks a declaratory judgment that the Trump Administration's use of executive orders violates the Clause's mandate to \"faithfully execute\" the laws.

It would be somewhat counterintuitive to conclude that a statute like the PRA (1) impliedly forecloses APA review, (2) thereby creating a need for mandamus review, and yet (3) impliedly forecloses\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   review as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Nor do the cases the government cites clearly indicate that\n   <em>\n    Armstrong I\n   </em>\n   forecloses mandamus review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Armstrong I\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit this time found that the plaintiffs' claims were reviewable. The court held that although \"the PRA impliedly precludes judicial review of the President's decisions concerning the creation, management, and disposal of presidential records during his term of office,\" courts \"may review guidelines outlining what is, and what is not, a 'presidential record' \" because to hold otherwise would \"be tantamount to allowing the PRA to functionally render the FOIA a nullity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724279,10517383\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/1274/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724279,10517383\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/1274/\">\n    at 1293-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The parties dispute the precise contours of the exception created by\n   <em>\n    Armstrong II\n   </em>\n   .

[presidential] records are preserved and maintained\" in accordance with the statute.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202203\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Second, the statute provides that \"[d]ocumentary materials produced or received by the President\" or his staff \"shall, to the extent practicable, be categorized as Presidential records or personal records upon their creation or receipt.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202203\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2203(b). CREW argues that these two provisions create a clear and compelling duty on the part of the President to issue effective classification guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Unfortunately for CREW, neither of these two provisions obligates the President to perform any duty with the requisite level of specificity that mandamus requires. For one, neither provision references classification guidelines in particular, let alone commands their creation. Subsection (a) refers to the \"implementation of records controls,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202203\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2203(a), but nothing in the statute says those \"controls\" must include classification guidelines. Similarly, while subsection (b) might direct that records\n   <em>\n    be\n   </em>\n   classified, it says nothing about\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   must classify these records or\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   she must go about doing so. In all, the statute does not require that any particular classification guidance be created, let alone that the President must create it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   By contrast, when courts have found that a statute creates a clear and compelling duty, the statute has ordinarily described the precise action the officer must undertake.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    N. States Power Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Energy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"978140,3709237\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/128/754/\">\n    128 F.3d 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 758 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (holding that statute providing that the Department \" 'shall begin' disposing' \" of nuclear waste by January 31, 1998 created a \"duty to act [that] could hardly be more clear\");\n   <em>\n    13th Reg'l Corp. v. U.S. Dep't of Interior\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1258044,3536189\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/654/758/\">\n    654 F.2d 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 760-61 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (holding that statute that \"directed\" the Secretary of Interior\n   \"to make a study of all Federal programs primarily designed to benefit Native people\" created a ministerial duty (citation omitted)). The PRA's silence as to any specific requirement is deafening for purposes of mandamus review: without a clear command to undertake any particular action, CREW has an uphill battle to show that a clear and compelling duty exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The battle is made all the more difficult by the discretion accorded the President in determining how to carry out his obligations under the Presidential Records Act. The statute simply directs the President to take such actions \"as may be necessary\" to preserve records, a phrase necessarily carrying a substantial degree of discretion to determine\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   steps are necessary. Indeed, even the President's duty to preserve records allows for some degree of discretion: The Act permits the President to destroy Presidential records \"that no longer have administrative, historical, informational, or evidentiary value\" but it defines none of these terms.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202203\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the President must determine what it means for a record to no longer have \"value\" and whether any particular, individual record has any remaining \"value.\" In light of the overall discretion accorded the President to manage presidential records-including which records to maintain or destroy-and the statute's silence as to any specific duty to create classification guidelines, CREW has failed to show the statute creates a ministerial duty to issue classification guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Judge Kollar-Kotelly's decision in\n   <em>\n    CREW v. Cheney\n   </em>\n   is not to the contrary. The court there held that the Vice President (and, consequently, the President) has no discretion \"to\n   <em>\n    change\n   </em>\n   the definition of Vice-Presidential [or Presidential] records provided by Congress.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701110\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/593/194/#p199\">\n    593 F.Supp.2d at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the court explained, \"[b]ecause the PRA provides a definition for Vice-Presidential records,\" the Vice President had no \"discretion to apply whatever definition of Vice-Presidential records he decided suited him when undertaking his preservation obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701110\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/593/194/#p199\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701110\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/593/194/#p199\">\n    at 220-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Put another way, the Vice President and President lack discretion to issue classification guidelines that conflict with the statute. But the mere fact that they cannot issue guidelines at odds with the statute does not mean they must issue those guidelines in the first instance. Limitations on an officer's discretion\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   undertaking a particular action do not automatically impose a limitation on the officer's discretion\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   undertake that action. And, again, the PRA creates no obligation to issue guidelines to begin with. That-along with the more expansive discretion generally accorded the President to make decisions regarding how to adequately preserve records-yields the conclusion that the statute does not clearly command the actions CREW seeks to compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   To sum up, CREW points to no duty that is sufficiently clear and compelling to meet the stringent requirements for mandamus relief. While the Presidential Records Act may obligate the President to take steps to preserve records, it nowhere dictates\n   <em>\n    which\n   </em>\n   steps to take. And while CREW may question the effectiveness of any guidance the President has issued regarding the preservation of his records, the Act nowhere clearly and definitively directs him to issue particular guidelines. Because CREW has not identified a ministerial duty, it has failed to state a valid mandamus claim. The Court must therefore\n   dismiss Counts I through III of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Count IV\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This leaves the fourth count of CREW's complaint. Unlike the preceding three counts, Count IV does not invoke the Presidential Records Act. Instead, CREW seeks a declaration that President Trump has violated his obligation under the Take Care Clause to ensure that \"the Laws be faithfully executed,\" U.S. CONST. art. II, \u00a7 3, cl. 5, by following a practice of making policy through executive order rather than administrative rulemaking (or adjudication). This is so, CREW says, because centralizing policymaking in the White House avoids the creation of agency records under the Federal Records Act and thereby shields records from disclosure under other statutes like the APA and FOIA. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 110-19. CREW does not root this count in any statutory cause of action; it proceeds directly under the Constitution's Take Care Clause itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CREW Opp'n at 41. Thus, CREW raises a difficult question: Can a plaintiff obtain declaratory relief against the President directly under the Take Care Clause?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The government offers what at first blush appears to be an easy answer: the Supreme Court made clear over 150 years ago in\n   <em>\n    Mississippi v.

The Supreme Court declined to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 499. It first distinguished two prior cases where it had granted writs of mandamus, explaining that these cases involved \"a mere ministerial duty\" where \"[t]here was no room for the exercise of judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court then explained that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [v]ery different is the duty of the President in the exercise of the power to see that the laws are faithfully executed, and among these laws the acts named in the bill. By the first of these acts he is required to assign generals to command in the several military districts, and to detail sufficient military forces to enable such officers to discharge their duties under the law. By the supplementary act, other duties are imposed on the several commanding generals, and these duties must necessarily be performed under the supervision of the President as commander-in-chief. The duty thus imposed on the President is in no just sense ministerial. It is purely executive and political.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In deference to the \"executive and political\" nature of the President's duty, the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   Court adhered to \"the general principles which forbid judicial interference with the exercise of Executive discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The government here seizes on\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's description of the President's duty under the Take Care Clause, interpreting it as holding the Clause to be entirely non-justiciable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.

It is not as clearly settled that a court cannot issue a declaratory judgment against the President. On the one hand, the D.C.

CREW does not challenge any of the President's executive orders themselves, nor does it argue that they exceed the President's authority to issue. CREW Opp'n at 18. Nor does CREW offer any reason why an administration could not, in good faith, elect to act through executive order rather than administrative action, even if that decision has incidental effects on the preservation of government records and the public's access to them. And the Court is aware of no authority preventing the President from electing to \"faithfully execute\" the laws by executive order rather than administrative process (assuming, of course, that the particular executive order at issue does not exceed the President's authority). Put another way, CREW does not dispute that the President has the discretion to make policy by executive order.
