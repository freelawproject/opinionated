INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Theresa James, acting on behalf of her minor granddaughter, V.J., seeks an award of attorneys' fees and costs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201400\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , for her counsel's successful representation of V.J. in the instant litigation and in administrative proceedings. Plaintiff contends that she is entitled to $93,676.78 in fees and costs. Defendant District of Columbia does not contest Plaintiff's status as a prevailing party under the IDEA or the number of hours spent by her counsel to represent V.J., but does assert that the proposed hourly rates for Plaintiff's counsel are not supported by adequate evidence and, therefore, are unreasonable. Defendant also challenges the reasonableness of the copying costs sought by Plaintiff\n   in her fees petition. Defendant asks the court to award Plaintiff no more than $62,821.63 in fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After considering the parties' submissions and the relevant law, the court grants in part and denies in part Plaintiff's Motion for Attorney Fees. The court awards attorneys' fees and costs to Plaintiff, calculated at an hourly rate of 75% of the United States Attorney's Office Matrix, in the amount of $75,286.78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court described the factual and procedural background of this case in its previous opinion, which resolved the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment and remanded for further administrative proceedings, and it need not repeat those details here.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff in this case seeks an award of fees for the services of two attorneys: Nicholas Ostrem and Douglas Tyrka.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot., Ex. 2, ECF No. 27-3 [hereinafter Billing Itemization]; Pl.'s Mot., Ex. 3, ECF No. 27-4 [hereinafter Ostrem Decl.]; Pl.'s Mot., Ex. 4, ECF No. 27-5 [hereinafter Tyrka Decl.]. Both Ostrem and Tyrka practice in Washington, D.C. Ostrem Decl. \u00b6 10; Tyrka Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Ostrem is a solo practitioner and represented Plaintiff in the administrative proceedings underlying this case. Ostrem Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 15. Tyrka is the sole owner of the law firm Tyrka &amp; Associates, LLC, and functions primarily as a solo practitioner. Tyrka Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 42. From his billing records, it appears that Tyrka represented Plaintiff only in the federal court litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Billing Itemization at 36-37. Plaintiff seeks an hourly rate of $395 for Ostrem and $516 for Tyrka.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Billing Itemization. These rates align with the rates for lawyers of comparable years of experience as reflected in the United States Attorney's Office (\"USAO\") Attorney's Fees Matrix [hereinafter \"the USAO Matrix\"]. Pl.'s Mot. at 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot., Ex. 11, ECF No. 27-12 [hereinafter USAO Matrix]. The USAO Matrix is a matrix of hourly billing rates for attorneys and paralegals/law clerks maintained by the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USAO Matrix at 1 n.1. The rates in the matrix \"were calculated from average hourly rates reported in 2011 survey data for the D.C. metropolitan area, which rates were adjusted for inflation with the Producer Price Index-Office of Lawyers (PPI-OL) index.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868028,7414415\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/57/1101/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant challenges only the reasonableness of the attorneys' fees and costs sought by Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 18-19. Starting with the attorneys' fees, Defendant makes two basic objections. First, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has provided \"insufficient evidence that the hourly rate in the USAO Matrix is the 'prevailing market rate' for attorneys practicing IDEA law in the District,\" and that Plaintiff's counsel's invoice inappropriately relies on current rather than historical market rates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 15-17. Defendant proposes that Plaintiff's attorneys' hourly rates should not exceed 75% of the USAO\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   or USAO Matrix rates, respectively, depending on the time period in which the services were performed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-22. Second, Defendant asserts that the attorneys' hours were not \"reasonably expended\" because Plaintiff's counsel's invoice bills at an inappropriate rate for travel and for the\n   preparation of her fees petition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. But that contention actually is no more than a plea that the court apply a reduced hourly rate to counsel's travel time and fees litigation work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, 20. Thus, Defendant's two objections largely merge into one challenge to the reasonableness of the hourly rate. So, the court considers the two objections in tandem. Finally, Defendant also asserts that Plaintiff \"cannot demonstrate the reasonableness of certain expenses.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. The only expense Defendant challenges, however, is Plaintiff's rate for copying costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19 (arguing that $0.25 is excessive and $0.15 is a more appropriate rate).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court addresses each of these issues below, starting with the reasonableness of the hourly rate (and thus the overall attorneys' fee award), and then turning to the reimbursement rate for Plaintiff's copying costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

This evidence, Plaintiff says, led the district court in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   to acknowledge the \"acute financial challenges currently faced by special education lawyers in the District\" due to the District's pattern of avoiding payment for attorney's fees \"to victorious counsel at all costs.\" Pl.'s Mot. at 12-13 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833431\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/908/233/\">\n    908 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   245-46 ).

Specifically, Defendant offers the declaration of Floyd Hayes, who serves as the Financial Program Analyst in the DCPS Office of General Counsel and processes attorneys' fees requests in IDEA cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 13-14; Def.'s Opp'n, Ex. 2, Decl. of Floyd Hayes, ECF No. 29-2 [hereinafter Hayes Decl.], \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. Hayes's declaration includes statistics regarding the number of invoices that were settled and the amount of attorneys' fees that were requested and ultimately paid, for fiscal years 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. Hayes Decl. \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5. Those statistics are as follows: DCPS settled 241 of the 303 attorneys' fees invoices it received in fiscal year 2014; 212 of the 310 invoices it received in fiscal year 2015; and 173 of the 234 invoices it received in fiscal year 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-7. In each case,\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the invoices that were settled were settled at 75% of the USAO\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix rate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendant argues that these statistics both demonstrate that the\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   prevailing market rate for attorneys practicing IDEA litigation in the District is 75% of the applicable\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   or USAO Matrix rate, and show that this rate is sufficient to attract competent counsel. Def.'s Opp'n at 14. As to the latter, the court agrees. Defendant's evidence shows that even though DCPS consistently has agreed only to pay 75% of the USAO\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix rates in each case where the parties have reached an agreement on attorneys' fees during the past few years, plaintiffs' counsel have continued to represent clients in IDEA cases in the District and to agree to such rates. Indeed, IDEA counsel have agreed to such rates in a clear majority of cases, at least where a settlement was reached.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hayes Decl. \u00b6 5 (approximately 80% of invoices resulting in settlement for 75% rate in FY 2014);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6 (approximately 68% in FY 2015);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7 (approximately 74% in FY 2016). Admittedly, the fact that Plaintiff is able to point to a handful of attorneys who have found these rates to be too low to allow them to maintain a full-time practice serving almost exclusively non-paying IDEA clients is not insignificant. It is also true, as Plaintiff\n   asserts, that settlements may be an inexact proxy for the prevailing rate for a variety a reasons, including that some lawyers \"may find it necessary to accept something in the short term, to keep the lights on,\" in lieu of protracted litigation. Pl.'s Reply at 10. But at the end of the day, Defendant's statistics undermine Plaintiff's largely anecdotal evidence that Defendant's rates \"have resulted in the broad evacuation of competent counsel from IDEA litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This conclusion is only reinforced by the relative subjectivity of Plaintiff's own proof. For example, some of Plaintiff's declarations show that counsel continues to pursue IDEA work and accept the 75% USAO Matrix rate, despite the financial difficulty it may impose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hill Decl. \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264854\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/264/131/#p145\">\n    264 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   141 n.3. In addition, the reasons stated for taking on less non-paying IDEA work in many of the declarations focus primarily on reasons\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   than the rate itself, such as the District's refusal to pay.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ostrem Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14-15; Tyrka Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-48; Savit Decl. \u00b6 6; Mendoza Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-12. And Plaintiff's evidence that directly discusses the rate does so in an entirely conclusory manner.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Moran Decl. \u00b6 12; Nabors Decl. \u00b6 10; Mendoza Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172499\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/517/#p520\">\n    843 F.3d at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding, at least with respect to a showing of complexity, that a fee applicant could not satisfy her burden by relying on \"[m]ere conclusory statements that IDEA litigation is 'as complex' as other types of cases\" without an explanation of \"\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   this is so\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The same is true of the complaints of the special education attorneys' roundtable discussed in the\n   <em>\n    Blackman\n   </em>\n   class-action monitor's report for the 2012-2013 school year.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Blackman\n   </em>\n   Report at 32 (noting that members of the roundtable \"believe that the decline in the number of due process complaints is the result of a concerted effort on the part of the District to limit their representation of parents by refusing to pay reasonable attorneys['] fees\n   <em>\n    in a timely manner\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) ). Moreover, the monitor's observations are based only on anecdotal evidence-rather weak proof when compared to the statistical analysis supplied by the District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   And finally, although Plaintiff's statistical evidence shows that markedly fewer administrative complaints have been filed by IDEA attorneys in recent years, the court cannot conclude that the decrease is the result of the availability of fewer lawyers to take on IDEA cases. Indeed, Plaintiff does not show that the reduction in administrative complaints is directly-let alone primarily-attributable to the hourly rate, as opposed to other factors. In other words, Plaintiff's evidence supports correlation, but not necessarily causation. While the D.C. Circuit has yet to define the precise contours of a fee applicant's evidentiary burden to demonstrate the prevailing market rate,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345995\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/197/#p203\">\n    172 F.Supp.3d at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court finds Plaintiff's evidence falls short of \"satisfactory evidence\" in this case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277058,6785367\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/97/\">\n    793 F.3d at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff has not shown that there is an unmet need for IDEA representation in the District of Columbia or, even if there is, that the reason for the unmet need is\n   that the 75% USAO Matrix rates are insufficient to attract competent IDEA counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In sum, Plaintiff has not shown that the USAO Matrix rates represent the prevailing market rates in the relevant community for IDEA attorneys with skill, experience, and reputation comparable to that of her counsel. Thus, the court finds the prevailing rates for IDEA litigation in the District of Columbia are equivalent to 75% of the applicable USAO matrix, as defined below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Plaintiff asks the court to apply the USAO Matrix for the year 2016-2017, i.e., the\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   market rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 14-15; USAO Matrix.
