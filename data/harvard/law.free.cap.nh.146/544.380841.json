She argues that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of an earlier fire that she had reported to the authorities and by failing to grant a mistrial after this evidence was presented to the jury. The defendant also argues that the two indictments are unsupported by the plain meaning of the arson statute. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The following facts are uncontested. The defendant concedes that in the early morning hours of January 7, 1999, she started a fire that caused significant damage to a single structure in downtown Berlin, wherein both an IGA Foodliner and a State of New Hampshire Liquor Store operated (IGA Foodliner building). The entire structure is owned by Theresa Rousseau and is leased to these businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Late on the previous evening, the defendant had reported another fire (prior fire) at a business near the IGA Foodliner building. Upon arrival at the scene, the authorities found the defendant, who directed them to a concealed area in the basement of the structure where the prior fire was burning. The defendant answered a few questions from the authorities. She indicated her dog had noticed the fire while they were walking together. The prior fire was extinguished without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Before trial, the defendant filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude testimony regarding the prior fire, arguing that New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 404(b) excludes \u201call evidence of uncharged misconduct or other crimes alleged to have been committed by a defendant if the purpose of the evidence is to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.\u201d At a hearing on the motion, the State argued that the prior fire was admissible because it related to the defendant\u2019s presence and opportunity. Responding, the defendant gave up her initial argument that the entire episode regarding the prior fire should be excluded, but continued to assert that reference to the fire itself would be prejudicial to her case. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">At trial, the prosecution\u2019s opening statement mentioned that the defendant called in the prior fire and that she \u201cshowed the firemen where the fire was, because initially they couldn\u2019t find it.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>prosecutor told the jury that \u201calmost an hour to the minute from the time that the first alarm was sounded, or she called the first time, there was a second fire called in.\u201d The State also called witnesses to testify regarding the prior fire. During her opening statement, the defendant conceded that she started the fire to stay warm and claimed it later went out of control by accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">During the State\u2019s case, the prosecutor asked Dana Hinkley, a captain with the Berlin Fire Department, if he had spoken to the defendant regarding the investigation of the prior fire. The captain began to explain how the prior fire started. At that point, the defendant objected, arguing that the prior fire was not relevant and that the captain\u2019s testimony intimated that the prior fire was started in a manner similar to the fire for which the defendant was being charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Apparently, the trial court agreed, and offered the following curative instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">Ladies and gentlemen, what this witness has been testifying about for the last five minutes or so is for informational purposes only. This defendant is not charged with any crime revolving around the fire that this witness is now describing. So, for the purposes of this trial, you are to ignore that as it relates to this defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Nevertheless, the prosecutor continued to inquire about the events surrounding the prior fire, and Hinkley later testified, \u201cBecause we knew we had a suspicious fire at this one, we wet that building down pretty heavy so the person who lit it couldn\u2019t come back and light it again.\u201d Again the defendant objected, this time asking for a declaration of mistrial. The trial court chastised the prosecutor, attributing the reason for the prejudicial answers to \u201cpoor preparation.\u201d Nevertheless, the court denied the motion for mistrial, but offered a curative instruction. Finally, during the charge, the trial court gave the following admonishment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcZ\">There has been testimony, ladies and gentlemen, about another fire earlier in the evening. You are instructed to ignore that testimony as it relates to this defendant. The fact that there was another fire should be given no weight at all in your deliberations to determine the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">The defendant was convicted, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">The defendant argues that she is entitled to a mistrial because admission of the evidence of the prior fire was irrelevant and unduly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>prejudicial in violation of New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 404(b). Rule 404(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">\u201c[E]vidence of other bad acts is inadmissible unless it is relevant for a purpose other than to prove the defendant\u2019s character or disposition, there is clear proof the defendant committed the other acts, and the prejudice to the defendant does not substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Dukette, </em>145 N.H. 226, 231 (2000) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">[T]he State, in offering evidence of other wrongs under Rule 404(b), must state the specific purpose for which the evidence is offered and must articulate the precise chain of reasoning by which the offered evidence will tend to prove or disprove an issue actually in dispute, without relying upon forbidden inferences of predisposition, character, or propensity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-8\"><em>State v. McGlew, </em>139 N.H. 505, 509-10 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The State contends that evidence of the prior fire was relevant to establish opportunity because the defendant reported the prior fire from a location and at a time proximate to the charged fire. Evidence is relevant when it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 401. At the motion hearing, before the defendant conceded she had started the charged fire, the defendant\u2019s opportunity to set the charged fire was relevant. Nevertheless, once the defendant conceded at trial that she started the fire, her presence at the prior fire scene was no longer relevant to establish opportunity. Thus, when the defendant objected during Captain Hinkley\u2019s testimony, arguing that the prior fire had no relation to the case, evidence of that fire was no longer relevant, and was prejudicial to the defendant\u2019s case. Despite the trial court\u2019s admonishments, the prosecutor continued to ask about the defendant\u2019s presence at the prior fire and, during the closing argument, the prosecutor highlighted the defendant\u2019s involvement with the prior fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>\u201cIntroduction of such evidence, however, does not automatically require a mistrial.\u201d <em>State v. Kerwin, </em>144 N.H. 357, 360 (1999) (quotation omitted). Rather, the prejudicial impact to the defendant must be so great \u201cthat it would be impossible for any curative instruction to be effective to cure the taint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The prejudicial effects of the inadmissible evidence must be such that \u201cthe trial court cannot unring a bell once it has been rung.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In <em>State v. Woodbury, </em>124 N.H. 218 (1983), we held that a mistrial was required in a robbery case after a police officer testified to the defendant\u2019s statement: \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re charging me with armed robbery. I\u2019ve been that route before. I\u2019ve been charged with armed robbery before.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220. We reasoned this statement raised the \u201cpotentiality for prejudice . . . [and] the fear that the generality of a jury\u2019s verdict might mask a finding of guilt based on an accused\u2019s past or alleged criminal acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and brackets omitted). Similarly, in <em>State v. LaBranche, </em>118 N.H. 176 (1978), a mistrial was required after several witnesses obliquely referenced a second but untried indictment for a similar offense. Even though the witnesses did not reveal the specifics of the untried indictment, a mistrial was required because the jury could have easily discerned that the defendant was \u201callegedly culpable for other instances of criminal conduct closely related to the charge before it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">We have noted \u201cthe degree of prejudice inherent in a reference to another charge may depend upon the similarity of the \u2018other incident\u2019 to that for which the defendant is currently on trial.\u201d <em>State v. Drew, </em>137 N.H. 644, 649 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The evidence of the prior fire in this case is both similar to the charged offense and extremely prejudicial. During the trial, the State offered extensive detail about the prior fire and insinuated during the opening statement and closing argument as well as throughout the testimony of Captain Hinkley that it believed the defendant started the prior fire. In fact, during the pre-trial hearing, the State indicated its suspicion that the defendant \u201cwould have had to have been inside [the] building to discover the [prior] fire\u201d and that no smoke was visible from the road. This belief was unambiguously conveyed to the jury during the opening statements, when the prosecutor said that the defendant \u201cshowed the firemen where the fire was, because initially they couldn\u2019t find it.\u201d Further, given Captain Hinkley\u2019s characterization of the prior fire as \u201csuspicious,\u201d and that the person who set it might come back again, the jury could have misused this information to find that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>was knowingly and purposely starting similar fires around Berlin that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Given the manner in which this evidence was presented to the jury, it is clear the incident of the prior fire was used only to establish propensity. Once the jury was exposed to knowledge of this fire, no curative instruction could remove the taint and, therefore, a mistrial was warranted in this case. <em>See LaBranche, </em>118 N.H. at 178-79. Accordingly, we reverse the convictions, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The defendant also argues that the arson statute does not permit her to be convicted on two counts when she caused damage to only one occupied structure. Because this issue is likely to arise on remand, we will address it. <em>See State v. Frost, </em>141 N.H. 493, 498 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">RSA 634:1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">I. A person is guilty of arson if he knowingly starts a fire or causes an explosion which unlawfully damages the property of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">II. Arson is a class A felony if the property damaged is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">(a) An occupied structure and the actor knew it was an occupied structure ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">\u201cOccupied structure\u201d means \u201cany structure, vehicle, boat or place adapted for overnight accommodation of persons, or for carrying on business therein, whether or not a person is actually present,\u201d RSA 635:1, III (1996), \u201cand includes structures appurtenant to occupied structures and seasonal dwellings whether vacant or occupied.\u201d RSA 634:1, V(a) (Supp. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">The defendant argues that charging her on two indictments, one based upon the damage to the IGA Foodliner and one based upon damage to the State Liquor Store, is a misapplication of the arson statute. The State argues that because the possessions of two property owners were damaged, the statutory scheme permits two indictments. In order to resolve this dispute, we must examine what the term \u201cproperty\u201d means in the context of the arson statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">For a conviction under RSA 634:1, 11(a), the term \u201cproperty\u201d means \u201can occupied structure.\u201d Thus, each occupied structure that is damaged is the \u201cproperty of another\u201d needed to sustain an indictment under this statute. While the State argues each \u201closs\u201d or each \u201cplace of business\u201d should be the unit of prosecution, the statute focuses, instead, upon each occupied structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>We agree with the State that the societal impact of arson is less when a person starts an isolated fire, damaging a single home, than when a person causes a high-powered explosion in the business district of a city. Accordingly, our reading of RSA 634:1, 11(a) permits the former arsonist to be prosecuted on one count for damage to one occupied structure, and the latter arsonist to be prosecuted for as many counts as there are occupied structures damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">In this case, the occupied structure is the building at 19 Pleasant Street, which was designed for carrying on business. That the structure contained the businesses of two separate leaseholders is irrelevant under the statute\u2019s definition of a single occupied structure. There was only one \u201coccupied structure\u201d damaged by the fire, and thus, only one conviction under RSA 634:1, 11(a) can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b594-7\">BROCK, C.J., and BRODERICK and DALIANIS, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
