We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-17\">The trial court found the following facts. The plaintiff and the defendant own adjacent residential properties in Bedford. The defendant acquired her interest in 1966 or 1967, and, with the exception of one year during which the defendant was renovating the residence, either the defendant or her mother lived on the parcel between 1966 and 1997. Although there is another access road to the property, the defendant and her mother have used the plaintiff\u2019s driveway as their primary access road from 1966 until 1997. The owners of two neighboring parcels also used the plaintiff\u2019s driveway during portions of the time in question, although only one of the neighboring parcels had a deeded easement for such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>The plaintiff purchased his parcel in 1989. Sometime thereafter, the plaintiff asked the defendant not to use the driveway and, eventually, brought this declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">On October 4, 1999, the trial court held a hearing at which the plaintiff, the defendant and the defendant\u2019s mother testified. The trial court concluded that the defendant\u2019s use of the driveway from 1966 to 1997 created a prescriptive easement. On the issue of adverse use, the trial court found that either the defendant or her mother had used the plaintiff\u2019s driveway as their \u201cmost frequent and common method\u201d of access from 1966 to 1997 and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">although [the defendant\u2019s mother] and [the defendant] may have subjectively believed that they had \u201cpermission\u201d from [the plaintiff] or his predecessors to use the driveway, they never actually sought or were given permission for such use, nor did they ever say or do anything which could be objectively viewed as an indication that they were using the driveway with the consent or permission of the owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s predecessors-in-title did not testify and there is no allegation that they gave the defendant or her mother permission to use the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">To establish a prescriptive easement, the defendant must prove by the balance of the probabilities that she used the plaintiff\u2019s driveway for twenty years and that her use was \u201cadverse, continuous, and uninterrupted ... in such a manner as to give notice to [the plaintiff] that an adverse claim was being made to it.\u201d <em>Sandford v. Town of Wolfeboro, </em>143 N.H. 481, 484 (1999) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">The plaintiff argues that the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s use was adverse was unsupported by the evidence, especially given that the plaintiff and the defendant testified that they believed that the defendant\u2019s use was permissive.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\"> We have held that to satisfy the adverse use requirement, \u201c[t]he nature of the use must have been such as to show that the owner knew or ought to have known that the right was being exercised, not in reliance upon the owner\u2019s toleration or permission, but without regard to the owner\u2019s consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets and quotation omitted). \u201c[A]dverse use does not require hostility between the two property owners,\u201d so long as the use is \u201ctrespassory.\u201d <em>Ellison v. Fellows, </em>121 N.H. 978, 981 (1981). Use is \u201ctrespassory\u201d if it consists of \u201ca wrong which the fee holder can prevent or for which he can obtain damages by means of legal action.\u201d <em>Zivic v. Place, </em>122 N.H. 808, 815 (1982) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of adverse use, the defendant must first produce evidence of acts of such a character that they create an inference of non-permissive use. <em>See Sandford, </em>143 N.H. at 485-86. Once the defendant satisfies this initial burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to produce evidence that the defendant\u2019s use of the driveway was permitted. <em>See id. </em>at 486. The burden of persuasion remains at all times on the defendant. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">\u201cWhether a use of property is adverse is an issue of fact. We will reverse the trial court\u2019s findings and rulings only if they are unsupported by the evidence or are erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Town of Warren v. Shortt, </em>139 N.H. 240, 242 (1994) (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant met her burden to prove that the use of the driveway was adverse. The evidence established that the defendant or her mother used the driveway as their primary access to the defendant\u2019s residence regularly for over twenty years with the knowledge of, but without the permission of, the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors-in-title. Such use was trespassory, and, therefore, adverse. <em>See, e.g., Sandford, </em>143 N.H. at 489; <em>Catalano v. Town of Windham, </em>133 N.H. 504, 510 (1990); <em>Zivic, </em>122 N.H. at 815; <em>Ellison, </em>121 N.H. at 981.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s assertion, he produced no relevant evidence that the defendant\u2019s use was permissive. As evidence of permissive use, the plaintiff first points to conversations between himself and the defendant\u2019s mother in 1993 or 1994. Even assuming that the plaintiff gave the defendant or her mother permission as early as 1993, such permission is irrelevant. The defendant had used the driveway since 1966 or 1967. Therefore, permission granted in 1993 would have been rendered <em>after </em>the maturation of the prescriptive easement in 1986 or 1987. <em>See Nelson v. Johnson, </em>679 P.2d 662, 665 (Idaho 1984) (permission granted after the limitations period had elapsed did not defeat the claimant\u2019s subsequent prescriptive easement claim); <em>see also </em>25 AM. JUR. 2D EASEMENTS AND LICENSES IN REAL PROPERTY \u00a7 50, at 620 (1996) (\u201cPrescriptive title ... is not divested by . . . subsequently given permission.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Next, as evidence that the defendant\u2019s use was permissive, the plaintiff points to testimony suggesting that the defendant and her mother <em>believed </em>that they had the permission of the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors-in-title. Again, even assuming that the defendant and her mother believed they had permission, such evidence is irrele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>vant. When determining whether a claimant\u2019s use is adverse, the claimant\u2019s \u201c[s]ubjective intent is immaterial; it is the nature of the use that is controlling.\u201d 25 AM. JUR. 2D <em>supra </em>\u00a7 62, at 631; <em>see also Hewes v. Bruno, </em>121 N.H. 32, 34 (1981); <em>Kellison v. McIsaac, </em>131 N.H. 675, 680 (1989). That the defendant may not have intended to trespass on the plaintiff\u2019s property does not render the nature of her use any less trespassory. Apart from the defendant\u2019s or her mother\u2019s alleged subjective belief, there was no testimony that the defendant or her mother actually sought or were given permission by the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors-in-title.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant adversely used the plaintiff\u2019s driveway after 1966 and, thus, created a prescriptive easement was supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b688-7\">DUGGAN, J., concurred; GRAY and MANIAS, JJ., retired superior court justices, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred; BARRY, j., superior court justice, sat for oral argument by special assignment under RSA 490:3 but did not take part in the final vote.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
