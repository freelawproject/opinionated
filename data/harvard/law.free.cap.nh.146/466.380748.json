Kalil, Jr., be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct (the Rules). On March 10, 2000, we appointed a Judicial Referee <em>(Bean, </em>J.) to conduct a hearing on the committee\u2019s petition. After a hearing, the judicial referee filed a report upholding the findings of the committee, but recommending that the committee impose a \u201cpreferably private\u201d censure of the respondent instead of suspension. We order the respondent suspended from the practice of law for three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">This dispute arises out of events that occurred immediately after a contempt hearing in Superior Court <em>(Fauver, </em>J.) on December 3, 1997. The respondent appeared as counsel for a creditor seeking satisfaction of a judgment against a <em>pro se </em>individual. After the hearing, the respondent and the debtor had a conversation in the courthouse lobby during which the debtor stated that he intended to violate the court\u2019s order. The respondent replied that if the debtor did so, the respondent would \u201crip his face off.\u201d After the conversation, the parties sought an immediate hearing before the court during which the debtor relayed the conversation including the respondent\u2019s threat. The respondent twice denied that the conversation occurred or that he had threatened the debtor. After the court heard from a member of the bar who corroborated the debtor\u2019s version of the conversation, the respondent admitted that the conversation had taken place and that he had made the threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">The respondent does not contest the committee\u2019s finding that he violated Rules 4.4, 3.3(a)(1), 8.4(c) and 8.4(a) by threatening an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>unrepresented opposing party, by knowingly making a false statement of material fact to the court, and by engaging in conduct involving dishonesty and misrepresentation. Instead, he contends that a suspension from the practice of law is inappropriately harsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We have long recognized that a license to practice law imposes upon a practitioner certain moral obligations. In 1890, Chief Justice Charles Doe observed that attorneys are a class of individuals \u201cto whose diligence, integrity, ability, and honor much is necessarily confided\u201d and, therefore, whose \u201chonesty, probity, and good demean- or\u201d is ensured by oath. <em>Ricker\u2019s Petition, </em>66 N.H. 207, 237, 240 (1890). He further commented that it is, therefore, an attorney\u2019s duty to avoid \u201cany ill practice attended with fraud or corruption, and committed against the obvious rules of justice and honesty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">These words are as relevant today as they were one hundred years ago. As officers of the court, attorneys \u201cshall not knowingly . . . make a false statement of material fact ... to a tribunal.\u201d N.H.R. PROF. CONDUCT 3.3(a)(1). The confidence of judges to rely with certainty upon the word of attorneys forms \u201cthe very bedrock\u201d of our judicial system. <em>Bruzga\u2019s Case, </em>145 N.H. 62, 71 (2000). Because \u201cno single transgression reflects more negatively on the legal profession than a lie,\u201d it is the responsibility of every attorney at all times to be truthful. <em>Nardi\u2019s Case, </em>142 N.H. 602, 606 (1998) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Every attorney admitted to practice law in this State takes an oath required under RSA 311:6 (Supp. 2000) in a public proceeding at the New Hampshire Supreme Court. This oath has been required of attorneys for over one hundred and fifty years. <em>See, e.g., </em>RS 177:5 (1842). The oath begins: \u201cYou solemnly swear or affirm that you will do no falsehood, nor consent that any be done in the court <em>. ... \u201d </em>RSA 311:6.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The respondent failed to honor this obligation. Not only did he act unprofessionally by attempting to intimidate a <em>pro se </em>litigant outside the courtroom, he abandoned his oath by lying about his conduct when questioned by the judge. He later admitted both his misconduct and his lie, but only after being confronted with evidence of his misconduct from another attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Although the respondent urges us to impose the less severe sanction of censure, which the judicial referee also recommends, the respondent\u2019s conduct in this case merits and requires a period of suspension from practice. In light of the respondent\u2019s twenty-five years of practice without discipline and his admission of and remorse for his conduct, we believe a three-month suspension will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>adequately satisfy the several purposes of the Rules of Professional Conduct while recognizing the mitigating circumstances of this case. Accordingly, the respondent is suspended from the practice of law for three months and ordered to reimburse the committee for its expenses in investigating and prosecuting this case. <em>See </em>SUP. CT. R. 37(16). The suspension shall take effect on July 1, 2001. Nothwithstanding anything in Supreme Court Rule 37(12) to the contrary, the respondent shall be reinstated on October 1, 2001, without further order of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b512-6\">BROCK, C.J., and BRODERICK, DALIANIS and DUGGAN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
