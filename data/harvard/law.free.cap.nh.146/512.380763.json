The defendant argues the court erred in: (1) awarding custody of the parties\u2019 minor child to the plaintiff; (2) finding that the plaintiff was abused within the meaning of RSA chapter 173-B (Supp. 2000); and (8) admitting into evidence a copy of an e-mail message purportedly sent by the parties\u2019 minor child to the plaintiff. We affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Following an uncontested hearing in superior court, the parties were divorced in June 1999. The permanent stipulation, approved by the court, included awarding the defendant physical custody of the parties\u2019 minor child. The plaintiff was granted visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">On June 23, 2000, the plaintiff filed an <em>ex parte </em>domestic violence petition asserting that she was \u201cin immediate danger of abuse by the Defendant\u201d and alleging:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">[The defendant] has been very abusive in the past. He has threatened me over the phone \u2014 through my daughter. And my father. I received an e-mail from my daughter on 5/30/00 saying he was going to slice my throat. On 6-22-00 he phoned my father \u2014 and told him[] that he\u2019s not going to reco[g]nize me the next [time] he saw me. On 5-26-99 \u2014 He beat me to the point of hospitalization. Police were at my home this morn[ing] (6-23-00).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The plaintiff requested, among other things, that the district court issue a protective order and award her temporary custody of their minor child. Based on the facts alleged on the face of the petition, the district court granted the relief sought and scheduled a hearing for a final order. <em>See </em>RSA 173-B:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">That same day the police removed the child from the defendant\u2019s home and placed her with the plaintiff. On June 26, 2000, the defendant filed a motion requesting that: (1) the court vacate its temporary order awarding custody to the plaintiff; (2) any remaining issues regarding custody be referred to superior court; and (3) the remaining allegations in the domestic violence petition be heard by the district court as scheduled or sooner. The district court scheduled all matters for a hearing the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">At the hearing, the plaintiff and her father testified about specific allegations of abuse. The defendant and his fianc\u00e9e also testified. The court found that the plaintiff had \u201cbeen abused as defined in RSA [chapter] 173-B\u201d and issued a protective order that included awarding the plaintiff custody of the parties\u2019 minor child while permitting the defendant unsupervised visitation with the child. The court then transferred the matter to superior court for a review of the custody issue. The record, however, does not show that there were any subsequent proceedings in superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Instead, the defendant moved in district court for reconsideration requesting the court vacate both the finding of abuse and the custody award. In awarding the plaintiff custody, the defendant argued that the district court exceeded its power to grant relief under the statute. <em>See </em>RSA 173-B:5, IY He asserted that because an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>order regarding custody had already been issued by the superior court pursuant to RSA chapter 458 (Supp. 2000), the district court lacked the authority to issue any order regarding custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The court denied each of the defendant\u2019s requests. In reaffirming its prior temporary custody order, the court \u201crecognize[d] the limitations imposed by []RSA 173-B:5, IV\u201d but determined that the legislature intended the court to liberally construe the statute to fulfill its purpose \u201cto preserve and protect the safety of the family unit for all family or household members.\u201d Laws 1979, 377:1. In addressing its concern for the child\u2019s emotional welfare, the court expressed its belief that the immediate and long-term welfare of the child warranted awarding the plaintiff custody while allowing the defendant unsupervised visitation rights. \u201cAlthough [the court found] the child was not in danger of immediate physical abuse [by the defendant], the Court was particularly concerned about the potential for emotional disorientation, . . . [especially in light of the fact] that the minor child had already been removed from the defendant pursuant to [the] Court\u2019s temporary orders . . . [and the] likelihood [remained] that the Superior Court. . . may well modify its orders with respect to the child\u2019s custodial status.\u201d The defendant subsequently filed this appeal. Immediately following oral argument, we issued an order vacating \u201c[t]hat portion of the district court\u2019s domestic violence final order that award[ed] custody of the parties\u2019 minor child to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">We will first explain the reasoning behind our decision to vacate the custody order. Whether the district court exceeded its authority to grant relief under RSA 173-B:5 when it awarded the plaintiff custody is a question of law which we review <em>de novo. See </em>RSA 173-B:3, VI; <em>Byblos Corp. v. Salem Farm Realty Trust, </em>141 N.H. 726, 729 (1997). When we interpret statutes, we first look to the plain meaning of the words used. <em>Appeal of Astro Spectacular, </em>138 N.H. 298, 300 (1994). \u201cOur goal is to apply statutes in light of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them and in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Appeal of Mascoma Valley Reg. School Dist., </em>141 N.H. 98, 100 (1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">RSA 173-B:5, I, provides that \u201c[u]pon a showing of abuse of the plaintiff by a preponderance of the evidence, the court shall grant such relief as is necessary to bring about a cessation of abuse.\u201d This section specifically states that such relief may include \u201c[a]warding temporary custody of the parties\u2019 minor children to either party or where appropriate, to the department [of health and human services.]\u201d RSA 173-B:5, I, (b)(5). Thus, in appropriate situations, the district court may award temporary custody. This grant of authority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>however, is limited. RSA 173-B:5, IV clearly states: \u201cNo order made under this section shall supersede or affect any court order pertaining to . . . custody of children pursuant to RSA [chapters] 169-B, 169-C, or 169-D; support or custody made under RSA [chapter] 458; or custody of children of unwed parents as determined by a superior court, probate court, or family division court</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"> Under this section, the district court is prohibited from modifying custody orders that have previously been judicially determined in any of the enumerated proceedings. In this case, the superior court had issued an order pertaining to custody under RSA 458:17. The plain language of RSA 173-B:5, IV prohibits the district court from issuing an order that would affect the custody award made under RSA chapter 458. Since the district court had no authority under RSA 173-B:5, IV to issue an order that affected the custody award made in June 1999 in the superior court, we vacated that part of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">This is not to say that courts are unable to act expeditiously to provide for a child\u2019s general welfare. For example, in a situation such as this, where the district court was concerned about the emotional welfare of the child under an existing superior court order, the statute provides procedures for resolving issues raised in a petition brought under RSA chapter 173. RSA 173-B:2 provides district courts and superior courts with concurrent jurisdiction and further provides that one court may transfer the proceeding to another court \u201cas the interests of justice or the convenience of the parties may require.\u201d RSA 173-B:2, III. In this case, where the district court was concerned with the child\u2019s general welfare under the existing custodial order, the court could have immediately transferred the proceedings to the superior court to be heard as if originally entered in the superior court. <em>See </em>RSA 173-B:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">We next address whether the district court erred in finding that the plaintiff was abused within the meaning of RSA 173-B:1, I. On appeal, \u201c[w]e review sufficiency of the evidence claims as a matter of law,\u201d <em>In re Estate of Cass, </em>143 N.H. 57, 60 (1998) (quotation omitted), and uphold \u201cthe findings and rulings of the trial court unless they are lacking in evidential support or tainted by error of law,\u201d <em>Phillips v. City of Concord, </em>145 N.H. 522, 524 (2000) (quotation omitted). <em>See also </em>RSA 173-B:3, VI. \u201cWe accord considerable weight to the trial court\u2019s judgments on the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given testimony.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Cass, </em>143 N.H. at 60 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>After hearing the testimony of the plaintiff, her father, the defendant and his fianc\u00e9e the trial court found that \u201c[the plaintiff\u2019s] and her father\u2019s testimony was clear and unequivocal, and [the defendant] was at best, evasive.\u201d The trial court specifically found the plaintiff\u2019s father\u2019s testimony recounting the defendant stating \u201cthat if [he] found [the plaintiff] after dark, [her father] would not recognize his daughter was very persuasive . . . [and the defendant\u2019s] explanation as to that testimony . . . not as persuasive.\u201d The record supports these findings by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">We next consider the trial court\u2019s application of law to the facts. \u201cAbuse\u201d is defined as \u201cthe commission or attempted commission of one or more of the following [criminal] acts by a family or household member or current or former sexual or intimate partner and where such conduct constitutes a credible threat to the plaintiff\u2019s safety.\u201d RSA 173-B:1, I. Among the acts included in the list is criminal threatening as defined in RSA 631:4 (Supp. 2000). <em>See </em>RSA 173-B:1, I (b). A person has committed \u201ccriminal threatening\u201d when he \u201cthreatens to commit any crime against the person of another with a purpose to terrorize any person.\u201d RSA 631:4, I (d). The plaintiff\u2019s father testified that during the course of a phone conversation, the defendant instructed him to relay several messages to his daughter and ended the conversation by stating \u201cif I catch [your daughter] after dark, you won\u2019t recognize her the next time you see her.\u201d When asked whether he made such a threat, the defendant testified, \u201cI don\u2019t recall. It was a very upsetting phone call.\u201d The trial court also heard testimony from the plaintiff, her father and the defendant of prior incidents of physical altercations between the defendant and the plaintiff. Based on this testimony, the trial court could reasonably conclude that the defendant\u2019s statement constituted criminal threatening and that the threat constituted a credible threat to the plaintiff\u2019s safety. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">In reaching its decision, the district court did not rely on the e-mail message allegedly sent by the parties\u2019 child to the plaintiff; therefore, we decline to address whether it was properly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; vacated in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AIy\">Brock, C.J., and Broderick and Nadeau, jj., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
