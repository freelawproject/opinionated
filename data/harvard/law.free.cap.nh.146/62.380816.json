We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">In November 1995, the petitioner injured her elbow while working at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. AIG Claim Services, Inc. (AIG), Wal-Mart\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier, denied her request for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. While represented by Attorney Andrew Richelson, she petitioned the New Hampshire Department of Labor for a hearing. Finding that the petitioner failed to demonstrate that her injuries were causally related to her employment, the department of labor denied benefits. The petitioner, acting <em>pro se, </em>appealed this decision to the board. Approximately four months prior to the board hearing, the petitioner hired Attorney James Townsend, an attorney with more than twenty-five years of experience. The board found in favor of the petitioner and ruled that she was entitled to payment of her medical bills and temporary total disability benefits for December 21, 1995, through February 21, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Attorney Townsend submitted a request for attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $3,670.90 to the board. Specifically, he requested approval for the payment of twenty and one-half hours at a rate of $175.00 per hour. AIG objected to Attorney Townsend\u2019s request, contending that it was not reasonable and suggesting that ten hours at $125.00 per hour would be a more appropriate award.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">Without a hearing, the board approved Attorney Townsend\u2019s request for payment of twenty and one-half hours of work; however, it reduced his hourly rate to $130.00. The board stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-12\">[t]he standard used by the panel for review is that an attorney shall be compensated by a reasonable fee in relation to the nature, length, and complexity of the case, as well as the usual and customary charge for work of the like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>kind and the benefit accruing to the claimant from the work performed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The board found that this case was \u201cwithin the normal average of cases that are presented to the board with respect to the nature of the dispute, length, and complexity,\u201d and that \u201c[i]n matters of this nature, the range of approved rates is from $120.00 to $150.00 per hour.\u201d The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, which the board denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">On appeal, the petitioner asserts that the board erred by: (1) failing to consider her attorney\u2019s standing and skill and the extent to which he prevailed; (2) relying upon an unpublished range of approved rates because it lacks the authority to set such a range; and (3) finding that an attorney with no experience is entitled to $120.00 per hour, while an attorney with twenty-five years of experience is entitled to only $130.00 per hour in \u201cthe normal average of cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">RSA 281-A:44, I (1999) provides that \u201c[i]n any dispute over the amount of the benefit payable under this chapter which is appealed to the board or supreme court or both, the employee, if such employee prevails, shall be entitled to reasonable counsel fees and costs as approved by the board or court.\u201d We will uphold the board\u2019s \u201cdetermination of a reasonable fee unless it is lacking in evidentiary support or is tainted by error of law.\u201d <em>City of Manchester v. Doucet, </em>133 N.H. 680, 682 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The \u201c[rjelevant factors in the determination of reasonable fees include the amount involved, the nature, novelty, and difficulty of the litigation, the attorney\u2019s standing and the skill employed, the time devoted, the customary fees in the area, the extent to which the attorney prevailed, and the benefit thereby bestowed on his clients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683 (quotation omitted). Here, the board\u2019s determination does not reflect a careful consideration of the relevant factors for determining reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Seppala &amp; Aho Constr. Co. v. Elton, </em>119 N.H. 634, 636 (1979). Specifically, the board\u2019s decision appears to ignore Attorney Townsend\u2019s more than twenty-five years of legal experience and relevant experience in workers\u2019 compensation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\"> AIG asserts that our enunciated factors for the determination of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees are not mandatory, but only guides, and thus, the board need not mention each factor in its decision. To the contrary, the board should consider the attorney\u2019s standing and the skill employed and should so indicate in its decision. <em>See Doucet, </em>133 N.H. at 683. If the board fails to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>an attorney\u2019s experience, experienced attorneys may be discouraged from representing claimants in the workers\u2019 compensation arena. This would undermine the compensatory purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. <em>See Appeal of Brown, </em>143 N.H. 112, 119 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\">The petitioner further argues that the board committed error by relying upon an unpublished range of approved rates because it lacks the authority to set a range of rates. The authority to adopt \u201c[a] scale of legal fees\u201d lies with the commissioner of the department of labor and not with the board. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:60, 1(f) (Supp. 2000). Based upon the record, it does not appear that the commissioner adopted such a scale of legal fees and our review of the applicable regulations did not reveal such a scale. Thus, it was error for the board to rely upon a \u201crange of approved rates\u201d when the commissioner has not adopted such a range.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Accordingly, we vacate the award of fees and remand for re-computation of the attorney\u2019s fees in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b109-6\">BRODERICK and NADEAU, JJ., concurred; HORTON, J., retired, and GROFF, J., superior court justice, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
