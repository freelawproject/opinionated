We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">We recite the facts as found by the superior court. The plaintiffs developed Westview Park Condominiums in Plaistow. At some point, the septic system failed because of faulty design and construction. As a result, in 1992, the Westview owners association sued the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs sought defense and indemnification under various insurance policies that the defendant had secured for them. In a series of letters dated from January 1993 through April 1993, all of the plaintiffs\u2019 insurers denied coverage. The plaintiffs began incurring legal fees on April 7, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">As a result of the insurers\u2019 denial of coverage, the plaintiffs brought a declaratory judgment action against them. This action was resolved in favor of the insurers on September 7, 1995. The plaintiffs filed their negligence action against the defendant on February 6, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">On appeal, the plaintiffs assert that their writ against the defendant was timely. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">To be timely, a negligence action must be brought within three years of when it arose. <em>See </em>RSA 508:4,1 (1997); <em>cf. Conrad v. Hazen, </em>140 N.H. 249, 251 (1995). \u201cA cause of action arises once all the necessary elements are present.\u201d <em>Shaheen, Cappiello, Stein &amp; Gordon v. Home Ins. Co., </em>143 N.H. 35, 40 (1998) (quotation and ellipsis omitted). A negligence action arises when \u201ccausal negligence is coupled with harm to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Conrad, </em>140 N.H. at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">In this case, the alleged negligence was the defendant\u2019s failure to procure insurance that would cover the plaintiffs in the underlying lawsuit. This alleged negligence first caused harm to the plaintiffs when they incurred legal fees in April 1993. The plaintiffs\u2019 writ, brought in February 1998, was thus untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">The plaintiffs assert that their writ is not time-barred because the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d applies. Under the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d if the harm and its causal relationship to the negligent act is not discovered or \u201ccould not reasonably have been discovered\u201d when the action arose, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the plaintiffs discover \u201cor in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered\u201d this causal relationship. RSA 508:4, I. The plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that the discovery rule applies. <em>See Glines v. Bruk, </em>140 N.H. 180, 181 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>The plaintiffs argue that they did not discover, nor could they have reasonably discovered, that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused them harm until the superior court ruled on their declaratory judgment action against the insurers. They assert that \u201c[ojnly [then] . . . could [they] know that all of the elements supporting a claim of negligence against the [defendant] were present, and that a cause of aetion against the [defendant] existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">To the contrary, the plaintiffs should have discovered that there was a causal connection between their harm (incurring legal fees) and the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence (the failure to procure appropriate insurance) when the harm occurred. <em>See Johnson &amp; Higgins of TX v. Kenneco Energy, </em>962 S.W.2d 507, 514-15 (Tex. 1998). Knowledge of this causal connection is all that was required. <em>See Draper v. Brennan, </em>142 N.H. 780, 786 (1998). The plaintiffs need not have been certain of it; the possibility that the causal connection existed sufficed. <em>See Glines, </em>140 N.H. at 182. The \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d therefore does not apply, and the plaintiffs\u2019 writ was properly dismissed as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments lack merit and warrant no further discussion. <em>See Vogel v. Vogel, </em>137 N.H. 321, 322 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In light of our opinion, the defendant\u2019s motion for late entry of transcript is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b212-8\">Broderick and Nadeau, jj., concurred; Horton, j., retired, and GROFF, J., superior court justice, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
