On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to an unlawful search of his motor vehicle. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>The following facts are not disputed. On March 27, 1998, in the early morning, an Enfield police officer stopped the defendant on Interstate 89 for having a broken taillight. A license status check revealed that the defendant\u2019s license had been suspended. The officer arrested the defendant and placed him in the back of the police cruiser. Upon learning that the defendant\u2019s only passenger also did not have a valid license, the officer placed her in protective custody and seated her in the cruiser as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The officer then called a wrecker to tow the defendant\u2019s vehicle and conducted an inventory search of the vehicle. During the search, the officer found a zipped grey vinyl bag on the back seat which he thought might contain a camera. The officer unzipped the bag and found inside it a closed blue bag. When he opened the blue bag he found six packets of heroin and four hypodermic needles, which form the basis of the charges against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The defendant filed a motion to suppress the contraband which the trial court denied, ruling that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">[t]he facts in this matter are not disputed and the sole issue is whether the inventory search conducted by the arresting officer exceeded the bonds [sic] permitted by the \u201cinventory\u201d search policy of the Enfield Police Department. The Court holds that it does not. To preclude an officer from inventorying the contents of an unsecured bag on the rear seat of a vehicle would strip the inventory search policy of all meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\u201cOur review of the superior court\u2019s order on [a] motion to suppress is <em>de novo, </em>except as to any controlling facts determined at the superior court level in the first instance.\u201d <em>State v. Daniel, </em>142 N.H. 54, 57 (1997) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">The defendant first argues that the inventory search violated his State and Federal Constitutional rights because the officer conducting the search opened closed containers without being specifically authorized to do so by the Enfield Police Department\u2019s inventory policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">The department\u2019s policy provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-11\">Each vehicle impounded by this Department will be inventoried.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">1. Two copies of the forms will be used. One for file, the other to be given to the tow operator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-13\">2. A complete check of the vehicle will be made to include the trunk and glove box. If the latter cannot be readily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>opened, force will not be employed unless there is a compelling reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">3. Evidence or expensive articles will be secured in the police evidence room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">4. If the vehicle is to be released, the tow operator will be so informed and provided a copy of the form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The State contends that although the policy does not explicitly authorize the opening of closed containers, it implicitly does so because for officers to perform a \u201ccomplete check\u201d of the vehicle and to remove any \u201cexpensive articles\u201d from the vehicle they would be required to open closed containers. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">We address the defendant\u2019s State constitutional claim first, <em>see State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231 (1983). We refer to decisions of the United States Supreme Court and other jurisdictions as aids in our analysis, <em>see Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1040-41 (1983). Because the State Constitution provides at least as much protection in this area as the Federal Constitution, we do not conduct a separate federal analysis. <em>See State v. Sterndale, </em>139 N.H. 445, 449 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Part I, Article 19 of our State Constitution provides that every citizen of the State has \u201ca right to be secure from all unreasonable searches and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions.\u201d We have held that \u201cwhere the search or seizure of a motor vehicle is involved, article 19 provides significantly greater protection than the fourth amendment against intrusion by the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">In <em>Florida v. Wells, </em>495 U.S. 1 (1990), the United States Supreme Court affirmed the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s suppression of evidence seized during an inventory search as violating the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. There, during an inventory search of an impounded automobile, the police seized evidence after opening a closed container. The police had no policy with respect to the opening of closed containers encountered during inventory searches. <em>See id. </em>at 3-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">Viewing favorably the reasoning of <em>Florida v. Wells, </em>we have said that \u201c[w]here the police have no policy with respect to the opening of closed containers during inventory searches, evidence found in such containers must be suppressed.\u201d <em>State v. Hale, </em>136 N.H. 42, 45 (1992) (quotation omitted). Our language in <em>Hale </em>supports our conclusion here that the opening of the closed container in the defendant\u2019s vehicle is unconstitutional because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>violated the defendant\u2019s rights under Part I, Article 19 of our State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\">We see no legal distinction between an inventory policy that does not include a procedure for searching a closed container, as exists here, and having no policy on the opening of containers as proscribed in <em>Hale.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The State argues that the law does not require that the inventory policies be in writing, but only that they constitute an \u201cestablished routine\u201d such that the officers understand them. <em>Florida v. Wells, </em>495 U.S. at 4. We need not address this issue because there is no evidence in the record that an \u201cestablished routine\u201d existed within the Enfield Police Department with respect to searching closed containers.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Because we reverse the trial court\u2019s order for the reasons set forth above, we need not address the defendant\u2019s remaining argument that the State Constitution\u2019s privacy protections prohibit any search of closed containers in an impounded automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b106-7\">BRODERICK and DALIANIS, JJ., concurred; HORTON, J., retired, and GROFF, J., superior court justice, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
