RSA 265:82, I (Supp. 2000). On appeal, he argues that the Hampton District Court <em>(Frasier, </em>J.) erred in admitting documents from a Massachusetts court regarding the defendant\u2019s prior DWI convictions because the documents were not properly authenticated. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The relevant facts follow. The defendant was charged with DWI, subsequent offense. At trial, the State offered into evidence court records regarding the defendant\u2019s prior DWI conviction in Massachusetts, including three forms: (1) Docket Face and Rear Sheet; (2) Notice of Trial Date; and (3) Appearance of Counsel. The documents are all stamped, \u201cA TRUE COPY ATTEST,\u201d signed by Kathleen M. McKeon, Assistant Clerk Magistrate, and contain a raised seal. Defense counsel objected to their admission, arguing that the documents were hearsay and not properly authenticated. The court admitted the evidence pursuant to New Hampshire Rules of Evidence 102 and 902(1). The court found the defendant guilty of DWI, subsequent offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the Massachusetts records were not properly authenticated. Specifically, the defendant contends that under <em>Folsom v. Blood, </em>53 N.H. 434 (1873), and the Reporter\u2019s Notes to New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 902, a certificate of attestation from a judge must accompany the out-of-state court documents. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">The trial court properly admitted the documents pursuant to Rule 902(1). Rule 902 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">Extrinsic evidence of authenticity as a condition precedent to admissibility is not required with respect to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-11\">(1) <em>Domestic public documents under seal. </em>A document bearing a seal purporting to be that of the United States, or of any State, district, Commonwealth, territory, or insular possession thereof . . . and a signature purporting to be an attestation or execution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Thus, the documents in the instant case, which contain both a raised seal and a signature of the clerk of the court attesting to their authenticity, required no further authentication.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\">The defendant correctly asserts that in <em>Folsom, </em>we held that a judge\u2019s signature of attestation is also necessary for proper authentication of out-of-state documents. <em>See Folsom, </em>53 N.H. at 435. <em>Folsom, </em>however, was decided in 1873, long before we adopted the Rules of Evidence. Rule 100 provides that the rules of evidence \u201cshall govern all cases the trial of which commences on or after July 1, 1985.\u201d N.H. R. EV. 100. Further, it provides that \u201c[t]o the extent these rules alter or conflict with the common law, the rules shall govern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rule 902(1) plainly states that only a seal and a signature of attestation are needed. An additional signature of attestation from a judge is not required. Accordingly, to the extent that <em>Folsom </em>holds otherwise, it conflicts with the rules of evidence and is no longer good law. N.H. R. EV. 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The defendant further relies upon the Reporter\u2019s Notes to Rule 902, which cite <em>Folsom, </em>to support his position that an attestation by a judge is required. This section of the Reporter\u2019s Notes conflicts with the rule. The Reporter\u2019s Notes do not have the force of law. Thus, when the Notes and rules conflict, the rules govern. Accordingly, we hold that pursuant to Rule 902(1), an attestation by a judge is not required to authenticate out-of-state documents when those documents contain a seal and an attestation from a clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b649-6\">BROCK, C.J., and BRODERICK, NADEAU and DUGGAN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
