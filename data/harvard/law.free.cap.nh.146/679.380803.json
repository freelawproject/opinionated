CT. R. 9. The petitioners, the trustees of a declaration of trust made by Frederic C. Dumaine and others, ask the court to determine whether the word \u201cchildren\u201d in the net income provision of the trust should be interpreted to include descendents of Dumaine who are neither his children nor grandchildren. The respondents, two of Dumaine\u2019s grandchildren, join in the petitioners\u2019 request. We hold that the settlor of the trust intended the word \u201cchildren\u201d to be interpreted literally.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">The following facts were presented by the trustees and found by the probate court. The trust was created in 1920. The trust income is distributed during the life of the trust according to the net income provision set forth in article II, paragraph 3 of the trust instrument. Pursuant to this provision, the trustees must determine the net income of the trust annually and distribute one-half of it to the principal. The provision permits the trustees to distribute the other half \u201cto the legitimate children of Frederic C. Dumaine or to their legitimate surviving children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">The trustees have sole discretion to determine who will receive income and in what amounts. The trustees are permitted to \u201comit all or anyfone]\u201d from the class of those to whom income is distributed. Despite this broad grant of authority, the trustees historically have distributed net income on a per stirpes basis, dividing it into equal shares with one share for each living child and one for each of the deceased children with living issue. They have paid one share to each of Dumaine\u2019s living children and one share on a representational basis to the legitimate living children of each deceased child. Since the death of the last survivor of Dumaine\u2019s seven children, the trustees have distributed one-half of the net income on a per stirpes basis to Dumaine\u2019s twelve grandchildren. The twelve grandchildren <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>now range in age from fifty-six to seventy-four, and thus it is likely that one or more of them will die before the trust terminates (at least twenty-one years from now).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">In June 1999, the trustees petitioned the probate court to interpret the word \u201cchildren\u201d in the net income provision to refer not only to Dumaine\u2019s children and grandchildren, but also to later generations, thus permitting the trustees to distribute income to the children of deceased grandchildren. This interlocutory transfer followed. The parties appearing before us all advocate the construction advocated by the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Whether the word \u201cchildren\u201d should be interpreted liberally or literally depends upon the intention of the settlor of the trust. <em>See Bartlett v. Dumaine, </em>128 N.H. 497, 505 (1986). When interpreting an <em>inter vivos </em>trust evidenced by a written instrument, \u201cthe terms of the trust are determined by the provisions of the instrument as interpreted in the light of all the circumstances and . . . other competent evidence of the intention of the settlor with respect to the trust.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). The \u201cdetermination of the ultimate fact of the intent of the [settlor] rests with [this] court.\u201d <em>Sylvester v. Newhall, </em>97 N.H. 267, 272 (1952); <em>see also In re Trust u/w/o Smith, </em>131 N.H. 396, 397 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\"> To determine the settlor\u2019s intent, we first look to the language of the trust. \u201cIn searching for the proper interpretation of words used in a written instrument, we require that the words and phrases be given their common meaning.\u201d <em>In re Dumaine, </em>135 N.H. 103, 107 (1991) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe nature and extent of the interest given to trust beneficiaries is to be determined from the whole instrument and not from an isolated phrase.\u201d <em>Indian Head Nat. Bank v. Rawls, </em>105 N.H. 142, 145 (1963). We examine extrinsic evidence of the settlor\u2019s intent only if the language used in the trust instrument is ambiguous. <em>See Bartlett, </em>128 N.H. at 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The relevant portions of the net income provision are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-9\">At the end of each calendar year the Trustees shall determine the net income of the trust; . . . [one-half] thereof the Trustees may in their sole discretion pay ... to the legitimate children of Frederic C. Dumaine or to their legitimate surviving children. The Trustees shall have full discretion to decide to which of said children of Frederic C. Dumaine, or their said surviving children, payments shall be made, and the amount thereof including the right to omit all or any ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>\u201cThe word \u2018child\u2019 ordinarily means a son or a daughter; a descendent in the first degree.\u201d <em>Sylvester, 97 </em>N.H. at 271; <em>see also In re Merrill Estate, </em>106 N.H. 99, 102 (1964) (the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cchildren\u201d does not include grandchildren). Relying principally upon <em>Edgerly v. Barker, </em>66 N.H. 434 (1891), the parties argue that the word \u201cchildren\u201d may include later generations. We hold that in the context of this trust, the word refers to first generation descendents only.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The eases cited by the parties are distinguishable. For instance, the provision in <em>Edgerly, </em>unlike the net income provision, referred to the testator\u2019s grandchildren <em>and </em>their heirs. <em>Id. </em>at 449. In that context, we held that it was permissible for the children of deceased grandchildren to take from the will. <em>See id. </em>at 447-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Similarly, the will provisions in the state supreme court decisions cited by the parties, unlike the net income provision, <em>required </em>a per stirpes distribution. <em>See, e.g., In re Clark\u2019s Estate, </em>59 A.2d 109, 113 (Pa. 1948) (where provision requires children to take per stirpes, the word includes grandchildren); <em>In re Estate of Englis, </em>255 A.2d 242, 246 (N.J. 1969) (where provision requires grandchildren to take per stirpes, \u201cthe terms \u2018children\u2019 and \u2018grandchildren\u2019 are to be read in their broader sense, including their lineal descendents\u201d). In <em>Estate of Englis, </em>the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the per stirpes distribution \u201cindicate[d] that the testator was thinking in terms of five blood lines rather than individual grandchildren.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the court explained, \u201c[t]he inheritance of those children, the testator\u2019s great-grandchildren, furthers the testator\u2019s intent to benefit equally the five blood lines which issued from his surviving children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By contrast, the net income provision expressly <em>permits </em>an unequal distribution in that it allows the trustees to omit beneficiaries from the distribution and does not require them to equalize payments out of future income.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Thus, we interpret the word \u201cchildren\u201d in the net income provision literally and construe it to permit the trustees to distribute one-half of the net income to Dumaine\u2019s children and, upon their demise, to Dumaine\u2019s grandchildren. <em>See Bartlett, </em>128 N.H. at 503. Additional support for this interpretation is found in article III of the trust, which provides that when the trust terminates, the principal must be distributed \u201cin equal shares to and among the legitimate issue or lineal descendents of the children of Frederic C. Dumaine living at that time, taking in each case by right of representation.\u201d Had Dumaine intended the trust income to be distributed to later generations, he would have used language similar to that in article III.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Although we believe the net income provision to be unambiguous, we note that the extrinsic evidence provided by the parties supports our construction. That evidence shows that Dumaine expressly declined to require either a per stirpes distribution of trust income or that the trustees hold amounts not distributed in reserve for the heirs of those to whom they elected not to make payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">We disagree that a literal interpretation of the net income provision is illogical given Dumaine\u2019s intent to distribute the trust principal to all of his descendents upon the termination of the trust. Dumaine may have limited the distribution of trust income to first and second generation descendents to increase the size of the trust principal and intended later generations to have an interest in the trust principal only. The trustees\u2019 argument that Dumaine could not have intended there to be twenty or thirty years during which no income is distributed is belied by the language of the net income provision itself, which does not require the income to be distributed at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">In sum, all of the circumstances and competent evidence of Dumaine\u2019s intent favor a literal interpretation of the word \u201cchildren\u201d in the net income provision. <em>See Bartlett, </em>128 N.H. at 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b727-7\">NADEAU and DUGGAN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
