The defendant, Michael Lieber, was convicted of criminal contempt by the Manchester District Court <em>(Lyons, </em>J.) after he refused to be transported for a probable cause hearing. The defendant appeals the court\u2019s use of its direct contempt power to sanction him for failing to appear. We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-16\">On March 30, 1998, the defendant, who was incarcerated at the New Hampshire State Prison, was scheduled to appear for a probable cause hearing before the district court. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>received actual notice of the order scheduling the hearing at the time of his arraignment. When the defendant failed to appear for the hearing, the court entered an order citing him with criminal contempt. In the order, the court stated that it had been \u201cinformed that defendant. . . refused to be transported for the hearing.\u201d The court ordered the defendant to appear at a hearing on April 13 \u201cto [s]how [clause why he [was] not in criminal contempt of this court\u2019s order directing him to appear on March 30, 1998,\u201d and appointed counsel to represent him at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">On April 13, the defendant appeared with his attorney before the district court and testified as to why he failed to appear on March 30. He explained that he had been transported back and forth between the district and superior courts on March 23 without attending any hearing and \u201csat around all day unfed.\u201d He stated that he thought \u201cmy lawyer can take care of this on his own,\u201d and that the transporting officer told him he did not \u201chave to go.\u201d On cross-examination, the defendant stated that he had been told by the transporting officer that he had the option to refuse transportation and that he did in fact refuse to be transported.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">During the hearing, the court made it clear that the defendant\u2019s testimony was \u201cin the nature of [an] allocution\u201d and that the burden was on the defendant to demonstrate that he was not in contempt. The court understood the defendant\u2019s testimony to constitute an excuse based on ignorance or mistake of the law, <em>see </em>RSA 626:3, II (1996), and found that the defendant failed to establish the necessary elements for such a defense. The court found that the \u201c[d]efendant\u2019s allocution does not constitute cause for non appearance,\u201d and that the defendant was guilty of criminal contempt. The court then sentenced the defendant to six months in the house of correction with five months and fifteen days suspended \u201con condition that he commits no crimes and does not refuse transport to any further hearings in relation to his present status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The defendant argues that his refusal to be transported could not have constituted direct contempt subject to summary proceedings because the elements of the offense did not occur in the presence of the court, and because his failure to appear \u201cdid not constitute a threat that immediately imperiled the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Town of Nottingham v. Cedar Waters, Inc., </em>118 N.H. 282, 285-86 (1978). Because \u201ccriminal contempt occurs as a result of the defendant\u2019s interference with the court\u2019s process or dignity,. . . the trial court\u2019s decision to utilize summary procedure should not be overturned unless an abuse of discretion is shown.\u201d <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>Martina, </em>135 N.H. 111, 118 (1991) (quotation, citation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The parties agree that this case involves a question of criminal contempt, the elements of which are the existence of a valid order, the defendant\u2019s knowledge thereof, and the defendant\u2019s intentional failure to comply with the order. <em>See State v. Wallace, </em>136 N.H. 267, 270-71 (1992). In general, a proceeding for criminal contempt must conform to \u201cthe formal requisites of ... a criminal proceeding,\u201d <em>Martina, </em>135 N.H. at 118, including \u201cthe issuance of process, service of complaint and answer, holding of hearings, taking of evidence, listening to arguments, filing of legal memoranda, [and] submission of findings,\u201d <em>Town of Nottingham, </em>118 N.H. at 285. Exception to this rule can be had when a contempt is \u201ccommitted in the presence of the court and in its immediate view, all elements of the contempt being clearly observable by the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In that case, the contempt is termed \u201cdirect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indirect contempt, in contrast, is \u201ccommitted outside the presence of the court and without the judge having full personal knowledge of every element of the contempt. Establishment of the contempt thus depends upon proof of facts of which the court could not take judicial notice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In light of the court\u2019s personal knowledge of a contemnor\u2019s conduct and \u201cbecause of the immediacy of the conduct and the need for prompt action,\u201d certain procedural formalities are bypassed in cases of direct contempt. <em>Id. </em>at 286. In such a case, the contemnor is entitled to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">oral notice of the conduct observed thought to constitute contempt . . . [and] an opportunity to speak in his defense. If the contemnor is found guilty the court may then pronounce sentence. The court must prepare, sign, and enter on the record an order of contempt, reciting the facts the court observed and which gave rise to the contempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">In this case, the court had personally ordered the defendant to appear on March 30, and the defendant had received, in hand on the same day, the notice of hearing. The court also had personal knowledge of the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the order to appear, having been on the bench at the time of the failure to appear. Proof of the defendant\u2019s intent, however, required the presentation of evidence. That the court \u201cwas told that [the defendant] refused transport,\u201d and later heard testimony from the defendant from which the court could conclude that the failure to appear was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>intentional, is insufficient to justify, in retrospect, the use of summary proceedings. <em>See State v. Costantino, </em>266 A.2d 38, 35 (R.I. 1970). Because not \u201call elements of the contempt [were] clearly observable by the court,\u201d <em>Town of Nottingham, </em>118 N.H. at 285, any contempt was necessarily indirect, and the defendant was entitled to the procedural requirements attendant thereto. The court\u2019s decision to utilize summary procedure was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the finding of contempt and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Given our disposition of this issue, we need not reach the defendant\u2019s remaining argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b152-7\">THAYER, J., sat for oral argument but resigned prior to the final vote; BROCK, C.J., and BRODERICK, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
