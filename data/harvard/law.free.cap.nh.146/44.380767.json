Geiger, </em>Esq.) and approved by the Superior Court <em>(McGuire, </em>J.). We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The parties married in 1974. Throughout the marriage, the defendant worked for Capitol Fire Protection Company, Inc. (the company), a business founded by his father in 1963. He is the company\u2019s president and owns 49.6% of its stock. His mother owns the controlling interest of 50.4%. The defendant has earned income ranging from a high of $577,800 in 1990 to a low of $255,636 in 1996. The plaintiff stayed at home during the marriage with the parties\u2019 three children, born in 1975, 1978, and 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The parties separated in October 1994, and the plaintiff filed a libel for divorce in May 1995. In July 1995, the parties entered into a temporary stipulation, pursuant to which the defendant agreed to pay child support of $1,531 per week for the two minor children. This amount was consistent with New Hampshire child support guidelines. <em>See </em>RSA ch. 458-C (1992 &amp; Supp. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The defendant later moved for a further temporary hearing on child support on the ground that the middle child was emancipated. In response, the plaintiff filed a motion for payment of alimony. In March 1997, the Superior Court <em>(Manias, </em>J.) approved the Master\u2019s <em>(Nancy J. Geiger, </em>Esq.) recommendation to reduce the defendant\u2019s child support obligation to $4,525 per month and awarded temporary alimony of $3,000 per month. It calculated these awards based on the defendant\u2019s average annual income from 1993 through 1996, which was $326,098. The court also stated that it would consider at the final hearing whether there should be an adjustment downward in child support due to the defendant\u2019s significantly high income.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">In its final decree dated December 3, 1997, the Superior Court <em>(McGuire, </em>J.) approved the Master\u2019s <em>(Nancy J. Geiger, </em>Esq.) recommendation to award $4,525 per month in child support. For purposes of determining child support, the trial court considered the defendant\u2019s income from 1990 to 1997, excluding the high and low years and averaging the remaining years. This resulted in an annual income of $369,000. The court also awarded alimony to the plaintiff. For purposes of determining alimony, the court considered the defendant\u2019s income to be $100,000 because his income over $100,000 had already been taken into account in valuing his interest in the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in: (1) averaging his income to determine his child support obligations; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>failing to depart from the child support guidelines on account of his significantly high income; and (3) \u201cdouble-counting\u201d a portion of his income by using the same income both to value the company and to calculate his child support payment obligations. The plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in reducing the value of the parties\u2019 interest in the company: (1) by 28.5% because the defendant was a minority shareholder in the company, a closely held corporation; and (2) by $79,144 to account for a debt owed by the defendant for which he provided no evidence or explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">We afford trial courts broad discretion in divorce matters. <em>Fabich v. Fabich, </em>144 N.H. 577, 579 (1999). We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s rulings regarding property settlement or child support absent an abuse of discretion or an error of law. <em>Hillebrand v. Hillebrand, </em>130 N.H. 520, 523 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\n<em>I. Child Support</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\n<em>A. Determination of Income for Purposes of Child Support Obligation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The defendant argues that the trial court improperly determined his income for purposes of his child support obligation by averaging his income over several years. The plaintiff contends that because the defendant\u2019s income fluctuates constantly, it is impossible to determine his income without averaging it.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Our case law is clear that trial courts should not employ income-averaging over a number of years to determine child support obligations. <em>See id. </em>at 526. Rather, child support should be determined on the basis of present income. <em>See id. </em>Thus, the trial court erred by averaging the defendant\u2019s income over several years to determine his child support obligation. On remand, the trial court should base the defendant\u2019s child support obligation on his present income. We note that this does not leave the plaintiff without recourse when the defendant\u2019s income changes. Either party may seek an adjustment in child support by petitioning \u201cfor a modification of support payments at any time a change of circumstances warrants it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526; <em>see </em>RSA 458:32 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">\n<em>B. Departure from Child Support Guidelines Due to Significantly High Income</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">The defendant also contends that the trial court erred by failing to depart from the child support guidelines due to his significantly high income. <em>See </em>RSA 458-C:5, 1(b) (1992). The purpose of the child support guidelines is \u201cto promote uniformity in child support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>awards. Accordingly, there is a rebuttable presumption that the amount of the award resulting from the application of the guidelines is the correct amount of child support.\u201d <em>Wheaton-Dunberger v. Dunberger, </em>137 N.H. 504, 508 (1993) (citation omitted). The court may make adjustments in the application of the guidelines, however, due to special circumstances. RSA 458-C:5 (1992). One such circumstance is the \u201c[significantly high or low income of the obligee or obligor.\u201d RSA 458-C:5, 1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Because we are remanding this case to the trial court for a recalculation of the income upon which the child support award was based, we need not address whether a deviation from the child support guidelines was warranted. If the defendant should raise this issue on remand, the trial court can consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\n<em>II. Property Division</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The parties requested that the trial court make an equal division of their property, but disagreed about the valuation of various assets. On appeal, both parties challenge certain aspects of the trial court\u2019s valuation of the parties\u2019 49.6% interest in the company. We affirm the trial court\u2019s valuation of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">\n<em>A. Use of Defendant\u2019s Income to Value the Company</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">When it valued the parties\u2019 interest in the company, the trial court attributed the defendant\u2019s salary in excess of $100,000 to the company, thereby increasing the company\u2019s value. The defendant asserts that because he was awarded the parties\u2019 interest in the company, the plaintiff was awarded the majority of the parties\u2019 real property. The defendant argues that the trial court erred by effectively assigning him a $100,000 salary when it valued the company, while assigning him a much higher salary when it calculated child support. According to the defendant, this resulted in impermissible \u201cdouble-counting.\u201d He does not contend that to remedy the \u201cdouble-counting\u201d the court should reduce his income for child support purposes. Rather, he argues that the court should remove the \u201cexcess income\u201d from the valuation of the company. The defendant cites no authority to support this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">The experts for both parties considered the salaries of the company\u2019s two officers, the defendant and his mother, when they valued the company. The experts explained that their respective valuation methods would require adjustments to the underlying calculations if the company\u2019s officer(s) had been granted inflated salaries. In fact, both experts adjusted their calculations for the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s salary. Only the plaintiff\u2019s expert, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>made an adjustment for the defendant\u2019s salary. The defendant\u2019s expert explained that he had decided against doing so to avoid any \u201cconfusion or double counting as to the amount by which [the defendant\u2019s] salary was reduced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In adopting the plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s approach and attributing the defendant\u2019s income in excess of $100,000 to the company, the trial court implicitly found that the defendant\u2019s income over $100,000 exceeded reasonable compensation for his services. Therefore, consistent with the principle that adjustments are necessary to account for inflated officer salaries when valuing a' closely held corporation, the court attributed the defendant\u2019s excess salary to the company\u2019s earnings. Apparently to avoid \u201cdouble-counting\u201d the same income, the court then assigned a $100,000 income to the defendant when it calculated alimony. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, this ruling does not compel the conclusion that the trial court \u201cdouble-counted\u201d the defendant\u2019s income when it used the defendant\u2019s income over $100,000 to calculate child support, but refused to exclude this \u201cexcess income\u201d from the valuation of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Alimony and property division are governed by separate statutory provisions. <em>See </em>RSA 458:16-a (1992 &amp; Supp. 2000); RSA 458:19 (1992 &amp; Supp. 2000). However, the two are closely related, and may be considered together. Indeed, one factor a court must consider in determining the amount of alimony is the property awarded. <em>See </em>RSA 458:19, IV(b) (1992 &amp; Supp. 2000). In contrast, the property division statute, pursuant to which the court valued the company, is unrelated to the child support guidelines. As the defendant concedes, the child support guidelines set out in RSA chapter 458-C mandate that an obligor\u2019s entire income be considered. In this case, the trial court\u2019s attribution of the defendant\u2019s \u201cexcess income\u201d for the purposes of valuing the company did not reduce the income actually paid to the defendant. Therefore, it should have no effect on the defendant\u2019s income for purposes of calculating his child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Furthermore, the defendant has not cited, nor have we found, any case from any jurisdiction which suggests that \u201cdouble-counting\u201d occurred in this case. The \u201cdouble-counting\u201d rule, adopted in some jurisdictions, has been applied to bar consideration of a divided asset for the purposes of calculating alimony. <em>See Cook v. Cook, </em>560 N.W.2d 246, 251 (Wis. 1997) (refusing to apply rule in child support context). It appears to be most often applied where an income-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>producing asset, such as a pension fund, is divided \u201cin-kind\u201d when the payments fall due. <em>See In re Marriage of White, </em>237 Cal. Rptr. 764, 767 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1987) (refusing to apply rule). We are unpersuaded that the rule should be adopted and applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">As one court has observed, it is not necessarily \u201cdouble-counting\u201d \u201cto treat a pension as marital property, award it entirely to the earner spouse (with an offsetting award of marital property to the nonearner spouse) and then to take the earner spouse\u2019s receipt of pension benefits into account in determining whether there should be any alimony award to either spouse.\u201d <em>White, </em>237 Cal. Rptr. at 767 (quotations omitted). Similarly, it is not necessarily \u201cdouble-counting\u201d to treat the parties\u2019 share of the company as marital property, award it to the defendant, offset the award to the plaintiff, and then use the income from the asset to determine the level of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Finally, we find persuasive the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Cook, </em>560 N.W.2d 246, where the court held that the rule against \u201cdouble-counting\u201d does not bar consideration of a pension both as property for purposes of property division and as income in calculating child support. <em>Id. </em>at 252. In so holding, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">The property division is an allocation of assets between the parents; each spouse receives something from the division. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">In contrast, the child of divorced parents receives nothing from the property division. A child support order gives the child fair support from the non-custodial parent\u2019s income including pension proceeds such as military retired pay. Thus, when a . . . court treats a pension which was subject to property division as income for child support purposes, the pension is counted for the first time between the parent and the child. As between the parent and the child, the pension is not being counted twice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-9\"><em>Id. </em>Similarly, as between the defendant and his child, the \u201cexcess\u201d income the defendant receives is not being counted twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion when it considered the defendant\u2019s entire income when calculating child support, but only $100,000 when calculating alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>\n<em>B. Reduction in Value of the Parties\u2019 Minority Interest in the Company</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">After determining the fair value of the defendant\u2019s interest in the company, the trial court found that because the company is a \u201cclosely held family company and [the defendant] does not have a controlling interest, ... it [is] appropriate to adjust the fair value into a fair market value figure by reducing [the defendant\u2019s] share by 28.5%.\u201d 28.5% is the net discount calculated by the plaintiff\u2019s expert. On appeal, the plaintiff does not contest the amount of the reduction. She argues that the trial court abused its discretion in making this reduction because the defendant \u201ccontrols\u201d the company and neither he nor his mother, the controlling shareholder, intends to sell the business. We disagree. Neither fact, even if true, supports a conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion when it applied the discounts the plaintiff\u2019s own expert used to calculate fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">To determine an appropriate division of marital property, including shares in a closely held corporation, courts generally look to the fair market value of the assets. <em>Cf. </em>SUPER. CT. R. 158 (model form Support Affidavit); <em>Shafmaster v. Shafmaster, </em>138 N.H. 460, 470 (1994) (Thayer, J., dissenting); 3 A. RUTKIN, FAMILY LAW AND PRACTICE \u00a7 36.10, at 36-44 (2000) (\u201cthe goal of valuation of the closely held corporation is to find a value that approximates market value\u201d). Fair market value is the price a willing buyer and a willing seller would probably arrive at through fair negotiations, \u201ctaking into account all considerations that fairly might be brought forward and reasonably be given substantial weight in such bargaining.\u201d <em>State v. 3M Nat\u2019l Advertising Co., </em>139 N.H. 360, 362 (1995) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Courts have recognized the need for reducing the value of stock both where there is no ready market for the stock and where a party owns only a minority interest in the corporation. <em>See, e.g., In re Marriage of Muelhaupt, </em>439 N.W.2d 656, 660 (Iowa 1989); <em>Hayes v. Hayes, </em>756 P.2d 298, 300 (Alaska 1988). The nonmarketability discount accounts for the fact that the lack of a ready market for closely held stock makes it a less attractive investment to a prospective purchaser. <em>See </em>Walzer <em>&amp; </em>Gabrielson, <em>Valuation of Stock in Closely Held Corporations at the Time of Marriage Dissolution, </em>1 J. AM. ACAD. MATRIM. Law 1, 10 (1985). The minority discount recognizes that a minority interest is more difficult to sell because a minority shareholder does not control the corporation. <em>See </em>RUTKIN, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 36.11[3][d]; Walzer &amp; Gabrielson, <em>supra </em>at 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The plaintiff argues that the minority interest and nonmarketability reductions were inappropriate because the defendant actively participates in the company\u2019s management. We disagree. The plaintiff\u2019s own expert accounted for the defendant\u2019s management role in the company when he calculated the discounts. He specifically noted that the defendant possesses certain elements of control over the company and is responsible for much of the company\u2019s management, but nevertheless arrived at a <em>28.5% </em>discount that takes into account both a minority interest discount and a lack of marketability discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">We also disagree that the discounts were inappropriate because there was no evidence that the defendant planned to sell his interest. The fact that an actual sale of the defendant\u2019s interest in the company was not contemplated at the time of the final hearing is irrelevant to the concept of fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it applied a <em>28.5% </em>discount to the \u201cfair value\u201d of the parties\u2019 shares in the company to arrive at their fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\n<em>C. Reduction in Value of the Parties\u2019 Interest in the Company to Account for a Debt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in reducing the value of the parties\u2019 interest in the company \u201cby $79,144 to account for a \u2018loan\u2019 which is on the books of [the company], but which the trial court admitted it could not explain.\u201d We disagree. In its final decree, the trial court stated that although it was uncertain what the $79,144 was used for, it would be added to the debt the defendant owed the company because it \u201cwas incurred well in advance of the parties\u2019 separation.\u201d We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in adding the $79,144 to the debt the defendant owed the company. <em>See Fabich, </em>144 N.H. at 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">We have reviewed the parties\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit and warranting no further discussion. <em>See Vogel v. Vogel, </em>137 N.H. 321, 322 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Any remaining issues raised in the notice of appeal but not briefed are waived. <em>See State v. Mountjoy, </em>142 N.H. 648, 652 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-12\">THAYER, J., sat for oral argument but resigned prior to the final vote; BRODERICK, J., concurred; HORTON, J., retired, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
