The plaintiff, Maria Emerson, appeals the Superior Court\u2019s <em>(.Fitzgerald, </em>J.) grant of the motion of the defendant, John Bentwood, M.D., for a directed verdict in her medical negligence case. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The plaintiff suffered from intermittent pelvic pain from approximately 1977 until March 2, 1994. The defendant is a surgeon who was brought in as a consultant by the plaintiff\u2019s physician, Dr. Stephen D. Elgert. The defendant reviewed reports of Dr. Elgert\u2019s examination of the plaintiff, laboratory data, a prior pelvic ultrasound, and hospital records including those of the plaintiff\u2019s previous hospitalizations at Speare Memorial.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The defendant\u2019s initial diagnosis after examining the plaintiff on February 28, 1994, was that the plaintiff had resolving pelvic inflammatory disease, a uterine polyp, and probable adhesions related to former surgery. The defendant testified that he recommended either a continuation of antibiotic therapy or an exploration and probable hysterectomy following a CT-scan. The plaintiff, however, testified that she was not given an option with respect to the hysterectomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Subsequently, a CT-scan was performed on March 1, 1994, which showed a uterine enlargement. On March 2, 1994, the defendant performed a total hysterectomy following exploratory surgery. He removed the plaintiff\u2019s uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">At trial, the plaintiff presented the videotaped deposition testimony of her expert witness, Dr. Henry Klapholz. Dr. Klapholz testified that the defendant deviated from the standard of care when he performed the hysterectomy He maintained that far less invasive and risky ways existed to make a diagnosis than the removal of the plaintiff\u2019s organs.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. The trial judge gave two reasons for granting the defendant\u2019s motion: (1) Dr. Klapholz\u2019s enunciation of the standard of care sprang from a flawed premise; and (2) even assuming there was a deviation from the standard of care, Dr. Klapholz\u2019s testimony failed to establish causation. The judge noted that he had found Dr. Klapholz\u2019s testimony so confusing and inconsistent in a prior case that the trier of fact could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>determine the applicable standard of care. He added that \u201c[w]hen the court hears such confused testimony, the obligation to act as gatekeeper to insure a minimum level of competence for the trier of fact is heightened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The plaintiff moved for reconsideration, urging that it was \u201cunfair to the plaintiff for the court to have based any part of its opinion on a previous ruling involving a completely different case with different facts and different injuries.\u201d In denying the motion, the court noted \u201cthat it did not \u2018rely\u2019 on prior experience with plaintiff\u2019s expert in reaching its conclusion, but only cited to that experience to buttress the compelling need to insure that expert testimony presented to the jury is competent and reliable in accordance with the rule of <em>State v. Cressey, </em>137 N.H. 402 (1993).\u201d We accept the trial court\u2019s explanation that it only referenced its prior experience with the same expert witness to emphasize its general concerns about the reliability of expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion because: (1) the plaintiff\u2019s expert testified that the defendant deviated from the applicable standard of care; (2) his testimony \u201cclearly established the causal link between the defendant\u2019s negligence and the plaintiff\u2019s wrongful hysterectomy\u201d; and (3) the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the expert\u2019s testimony was unreliable was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">A motion for directed verdict \u201cshould be granted only when the sole reasonable inference that may be drawn from the evidence, which must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, is so overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that no contrary verdict could stand.\u201d <em>Thompson v. The H.W.G. Group, </em>139 N.H. 698, 699 (1995) (quotation omitted). The trial court may not weigh the evidence or judge the credibility of witnesses. <em>Arthur v. Holy Rosary Credit Union, </em>139 N.H. 463, 465 (1995). The trial court should deny the motion for a directed verdict unless \u201cthe court can affirmatively determine that the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief on the evidence presented.\u201d 5 R. WIEBUSCH, NEW HAMPSHIRE PRACTICE, CIVIL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE \u00a7 48.15, at 333 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">RSA 507-E:2 defines the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof in an action for medical negligence. The statute requires the plaintiff to prove by competent expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">(a) The standard of reasonable professional practice in the medical care provider\u2019s profession or specialty thereof, if any, at the time the medical care in question was rendered; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>(b) That the medical care provider failed to act in accordance with such standard; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">(c) That as a proximate result thereof, the injured person suffered injuries which would not otherwise have occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">RSA 507-E:2,1 (1997). In addition, \u201can expert\u2019s testimony must rise to a threshold level of reliability to be admissible under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 702.\u201d <em>State v. Cressey, </em>137 N.H. at 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The trial court found that the plaintiff failed to produce \u201ccompetent expert evidence from which a rational trier of fact could conclude that the claimed deviation from the standard of care was, in fact, the legal cause of the claimed damages.\u201d Dr. Klapholz, however, offered the following testimony regarding the standard of care:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\">Q. Finally, Doctor, do you have an opinion based upon reasonable medical probability whether performing this total hysterectomy with her symptoms by Dr. Bentwood in 1994 was a deviation from the standard of medical care?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-11\">A. I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-12\">Q. And what is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-13\">A. I think under the circumstances that occurred here with the data that was available, I think this is a deviation from the standard of care in this time, 1996, at the time this was performed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-14\">Q. And the reason for that is what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-15\">A. Well, the reason is simple. There are other \u2014 there are other techniques which are available now, commonly available, that can make a diagnosis or can attempt to make a diagnosis that are far less invasive, far less risky and don\u2019t require the removal of organs. And it may turn out that you find something that requires further surgery. But the standard of care in 1996, and it\u2019s not that long ago, is to make a diagnosis first before you attempt to remove an organ.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-16\">Q. Is that the same standard of care that existed throughout the nineties, Doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-17\">A. Yes. That\u2019s the last ten years, I think it\u2019s safe to say.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>In the preceding dialogue, Dr. Klapholz rendered an opinion as to whether or not the defendant deviated from the standard of care. He further posited that \u201c[o]ffering [the plaintiff] a hysterectomy without any additional options ... in and of itself [was] a deviation from the standard [of care].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Dr. Klapholz explained that because far less invasive means existed to diagnose the plaintiff\u2019s condition, they should have been utilized first. He also emphasized the importance of a firm diagnosis before undertaking treatment. The defendant admitted at trial that \u201cpart of the reason for performing this hysterectomy was to arrive at a more definitive diagnosis.\u201d We therefore conclude that Dr. Klapholz provided an adequate foundation for his opinion that the defendant deviated from the standard of care by performing a hysterectomy, given the plaintiff\u2019s symptoms, when other less invasive means of diagnosis were available.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">We next turn to the question of causation. Dr. Klapholz testified that the defendant incorrectly diagnosed the plaintiff\u2019s condition as pelvic imflammatory disease. Further, Dr. Klapholz testified that had the defendant employed alternative diagnostic procedures, such procedures would have ruled out pelvic inflammatory disease. Moreover, he saw no evidence that a hysterectomy was required for the treatment of what was in the plaintiff\u2019s record at the time and that he considered a hysterectomy premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The trial judge, however, concluded his order for a directed verdict by stating that the fact that Dr. Klapholz was unable to identify the probable source of the plaintiff\u2019s pain, coupled with the fact that following the procedure the pain ceased, left the jury \u201cto speculate as to whether the hysterectomy was necessary for the treatment of the symptoms presented by plaintiff.\u201d In support of this conclusion, the trial court referenced the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">Q. So without knowing the cause of her pain, you can\u2019t say that the total hysterectomy was not necessary, can you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">A. I think it\u2019s \u2014 I think it\u2019s unlikely given all the possibilities that could cause pain that that would be a necessary procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Whether the hysterectomy was necessary was an issue for the jury to resolve. Dr. Klapholz\u2019s testimony goes to the weight of the evidence, a matter strictly within the province of the jury to determine. The jury was no longer free to make that determination after the judge rendered his directed verdict. As Dr. Klapholz postulated at the close of his deposition, the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>pain ceased after her hysterectomy does not mean that the plaintiff\u2019s uterus was the source of the pain. In fact, the final diagnosis in the plaintiff\u2019s discharge stated that the pelvic pain was of undetermined etiology.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that she \u201cmet her burden of proof under RSA 507-E:2 by presenting reliable expert testimony which clearly established the causal link between the defendant\u2019s negligence and the plaintiff\u2019s wrongful hysterectomy.\u201d The burden is on the plaintiff to prove that she \u201csuffered injuries which would not otherwise have occurred\u201d as a proximate result of the defendant\u2019s negligence. RSA 507-E:2, 1(c). The plaintiff must establish the proximate cause between the negligence and injury by expert testimony. <em>Martin v. Wentworth-Douglass Hosp., </em>130 N.H. 134, 136 (1987). The quantum of evidence required to survive a directed verdict is only \u201cenough to warrant the conclusion . . . that the causal link probably existed.\u201d <em>Bronson v. The Hitchcock Clinic, </em>140 N.H. 798, 802 (1996) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Dr. Klapholz repeatedly contended throughout his deposition that the defendant\u2019s conduct deviated from the standard of care when the defendant performed a hysterectomy given the plaintiff\u2019s symptoms. The plaintiff\u2019s alleged injury was the loss of her reproductive organs as a result of a wrongful hysterectomy. In other words, the expert testified that the plaintiff \u201csuffered injuries which would not otherwise have occurred.\u201d RSA 507-E:2, 1(c). No recitation of \u201cspecific words or phrases mirroring statutory language\u201d is necessary to establish causation. <em>Bronson, </em>140 N.H. at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u201c[I]f competent expert medical testimony is adduced from which the jury can fairly and reasonably conclude that but for a defendant\u2019s negligence an injury probably would not have occurred, the plaintiff has met [her] burden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff offered sufficient expert testimony to show a causal link between the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence and the plaintiff\u2019s alleged injury. <em>Cf. St. Pierre v. Elgert, </em>145 N.H. 620, 624-25 (2000). To conclude otherwise could conceivably render a plaintiff remediless whenever a physician acted prematurely and without a definitive diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Finally, the plaintiff contends that the trial court\u2019s finding that the testimony of Dr. Klapholz was unreliable constituted an abuse of discretion. Whether particular expert testimony is reliable rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See Chase v. Mary Hitchcock Mem. Hosp., </em>140 N.H. 509, 510 (1995). The trial court\u2019s discretion as to the admission or exclusion of such evidence is wide, and we will not reverse its ruling absent a clear abuse of discretion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>See Johnston v. Lynch, </em>133 N.H. 79, 88 (1990). \u201cWe will uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for directed verdict when the record supports the conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that no rational juror could find for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Goodwin v. James, </em>134 N.H. 579, 583 (1991) (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The trial court judge found the expert\u2019s testimony confusing and gave the following example in his order for a directed verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">[W]hen asked a rather straight forward question:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\u201cIs the use of a laparoscope in treatment hindered in your opinion by the presence of adhesions or prior surgeries?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">Dr. Klapholz answers: \u201cNo. It may be. It could . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">In his testimony, however, Dr. Klapholz clearly stated: (1) the standard of care \u201cis to make a diagnosis first before you attempt to remove an organ\u201d; (2) the defendant deviated from that standard of care performing the hysterectomy \u201cwith the data that was available\u201d by not using \u201cother techniques . . . commonly available, that can make a diagnosis that are far less invasive, far less risky and don\u2019t require the removal of organs\u201d; and (3) as a result the plaintiff underwent a total hysterectomy when it was \u201cunlikely given all the possibilities that could cause the pain that [a hysterectomy] would be a necessary procedure.\u201d Moreover, the beginning of the testimony the trial court cited took Dr.Klapholz\u2019s answer out of context. In fact, Dr. Klapholz clarified this answer by explaining that while the laparoscopic view might be obstructed by adhesions from prior surgeries, prior surgery was never a reason not to do a laparoscope first.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">We therefore hold that the trial judge abused his discretion by concluding that: (1) Dr. Klapholz\u2019s testimony was so confusing and inconsistent that the trier of fact could not determine the applicable standard of care; and (2) the plaintiff \u201cproduced no competent expert evidence from which a rational trier of fact could conclude that the claimed deviation from the standard of care was, in fact, the legal cause of the claimed damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">The expert\u2019s testimony was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to conclude that the defendant should have employed less invasive measures before resorting to a hysterectomy and that said deviation from the standard of care resulted in the plaintiff\u2019s injury. \u201cUnder our jury system, reasonably disputable issues of fact are to be resolved by the jury.\u201d <em>Faust v. General Motors Corp., </em>117 N.H. 679, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>684 (1977) (quotation omitted). We accordingly reverse the trial court\u2019s directed verdict and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b302-4\">DUGGAN, J., concurred; MOHL, O\u2019NEILL and HAMPSEY, JJ., superior court justices, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
