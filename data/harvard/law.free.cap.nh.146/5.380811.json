On appeal, he challenges the Trial Court\u2019s <em>(Coffey, </em>J.) order finding him competent to stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>trial, and the Trial Court\u2019s (Mokl, J.) order denying his request for a jury instruction on the use of force in defense of another. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\n<em>I. Competency</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">We first address the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in finding him competent to stand trial. At a pre-trial hearing on competency, the only witness to testify was the defendant\u2019s expert, Dr. Craig E. Stenslie. The defendant also introduced two psychological evaluations which Dr. Stenslie had completed in the six months prior to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">In his evaluations, Stenslie concluded that the defendant was incompetent to stand trial. He testified, consistent with his reports, that the defendant had a factual, but not a rational, understanding of the proceedings against him and that he did not have sufficient present ability to consult with his attorney. <em>See State v. Zorzy, </em>136 N.H. 710, 714 (1993). The State produced no evidence except testimony elicited from Dr. Stenslie during cross-examination and <em>voir dire. </em>The court found the defendant competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">On appeal, the defendant alleges violations of due process under both the State and Federal Constitutions. We analyze the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims under the New Hampshire Constitution, relying on cases interpreting the Federal Constitution only to aid in our analysis. <em>See State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 232-33 (1983). Because the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides no greater protection on this issue than Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution, we need not engage in a separate federal analysis. <em>See Zorzy, </em>136 N.H. at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The mental competence of a criminal defendant at the time of trial is \u201can absolute basic condition of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see State v. Champagne, </em>127 N.H. 266, 270 (1985). A defendant is competent if he has \u2018\u201csufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding,\u201d\u2019 and if he has \u201c\u2018a rational as well as [a] factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Champagne, </em>127 N.H. at 270 (quoting <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 402 (1960)). By rational understanding, we mean that the defendant must have \u201csufficient contact with reality.\u201d <em>Lafferty v. Cook, </em>949 F.2d 1546, 1551 (10th Cir. 1991). The State bears the burden of proving both of these elements by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Zorzy, </em>136 N.H. at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>In finding the defendant competent, the trial court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">[The defendant] \u201ctends to ramble\u201d and Dr. Stenslie testified that [his] thoughts are \u201ctangential\u201d and \u201cparanoid\u201d; while the Court notes that Dr. Stenslie uses these terms in the clinical, not colloquial, sense, certain other findings are more significant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">. . . [H]e is quite clear in his responses that he understands the factual nature of the charges against him, understands the allegation of assault, and has requested that his lawyer do all that he can to \u201cfight this case\u201d because he \u201cnever touched the man\u201d in question, indicating that he comprehends the elements of the crime of assault. Additionally, he understands the concepts of crime and punishment .... He also understands the roles of his attorney, the prosecutor, and the judge; despite his seemingly paranoid thoughts about the County Attorney\u2019s Office, he is clear as to their role. Dr. Stenslie himself concluded that the Defendant had a \u201cfactual understanding of the legal proceedings\u201d and this Court finds that [the defendant] has a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">We conclude that the trial court failed to apply properly the second prong of the <em>Champagne/Dusky </em>standard. The court concluded that the defendant had a rational understanding of the proceedings against him and, by doing so, rejected Dr. Stenslie\u2019s expert opinion without making any findings to support its conclusion. The court\u2019s order implicitly accepts Dr. Stenslie\u2019s conclusions that the defendant\u2019s thoughts were \u201cparanoid\u201d and \u201ctangential,\u201d but then states that \u201ccertain other findings\u201d were \u201cmore significant.\u201d Specifically, the court found that the defendant \u201cunderstands the factual nature of the charges against him, understands the allegation of assault, . . . has requested that his lawyer do all he can to \u2018fight this case\u2019 because he \u2018never touched the man,\u201d\u2019 and that he \u201cunderstands the concepts of crime and punishment.\u201d The court also found that \u201cdespite his seemingly paranoid thoughts about the County Attorney\u2019s Office,\u201d he \u201cunderstands the roles of his attorney, the prosecutor, and the judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">That the defendant can \u201crecite, civic-class style, the cast of characters, their roles and the object of the proceedings,\u201d <em>Champagne, </em>127 N.H. at 271, does no more than demonstrate the defendant\u2019s <em>factual </em>understanding of the proceedings against him, an issue which is not in dispute. Nowhere does the court make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>specific findings supporting its conclusion that the defendant has a rational understanding of the proceedings against him. <em>See State v. Bertrand, </em>123 N.H. 719, 728 (1983). Moreover, such a conclusion would be directly contrary to the only expert opinion offered at the hearing. As such, we conclude that the trial court erred by \u201cfocusing narrowly upon the defendant\u2019s factual understanding capabilities\u201d in finding the defendant competent to stand trial. <em>Champagne, </em>127 N.H. at 271 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The State argues that the trial court was within its discretion to reject Dr. Stenslie\u2019s testimony because competency to stand trial is a legal, not a medical concept. <em>See Bertrand, </em>123 N.H. at 726. The trial court should not \u201cabdicate to psychiatrists [its] judicial responsibility to determine whether a criminal defendant is competent to stand trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When, however, a defendant establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of incompetency through the introduction of uncontroverted expert testimony, the trial court should delineate its reasons for rejecting that testimony and those reasons must be supported by the record. <em>See Lagway v. Dallman, </em>806 F. Supp. 1322, 1338 (N.D. Ohio 1992). The trial court has not done so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The State further argues that, although it has the burden to prove that the defendant is competent, it need not produce its own evidence to meet its burden of proof. We agree that, generally, a party may satisfy its burden of proof if the necessary evidence is introduced by his adversary and is sufficiently convincing and uncontroverted. <em>See </em>29 AM. JUR. 2D <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 158, at 185 (1994). The trial court has not, however, made the necessary findings to support its conclusion that the State met its burden by relying solely on Dr. Stenslie\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Finally, the State argues that even if the court erred in finding the defendant competent after the pretrial competency hearing, the court independently found the defendant competent at trial three months later. During a bench conference in the middle of trial, defense counsel again raised the issue of the defendant\u2019s competency. The trial court summarily denied the defendant\u2019s request, stating that \u201ceverything this witness has shown suggests to me that Judge Coffey made the right determination with respect to this witness\u2019s competence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">While \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s competency is measured by his abilities at the time of the trial proceeding,\u201d <em>Zorzy, </em>136 N.H. at 715, we conclude that in this case, it is impossible to determine the degree to which the trial court\u2019s competency determination at trial was influenced by the court\u2019s erroneous pretrial determination. As such, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>we cannot agree that the court independently found the defendant competent at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Because there is a record of the pretrial competency hearing, the trial court on remand should consider whether a retrospective determination based on the application of the correct standard can be made, and, if so, make such a determination. <em>See State v. Stiles, </em>123 N.H. 680, 685 (1983). If such a determination is not possible, a new trial is required. <em>See id. </em>Because the defendant\u2019s remaining argument will likely be raised again if a new trial is required, we next address that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\n<em>II. Jtiry Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his request for a jury instruction on the use of physical force in defense of another. Specifically, he argues that because there was \u201csome evidence\u201d that he struck the victim in defense of his son who had just been engaged in a physical altercation with the victim\u2019s friend, he was entitled to a jury instruction on the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Although the scope and wording of jury instructions is generally within the sound discretion of the trial court, the court \u201cmust grant a defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction on a specific defense if there is some evidence to support a rational finding in favor of that defense.\u201d <em>State v. Jaroma, </em>137 N.H. 143, 153 (1993) (quotation omitted). By \u201csome evidence,\u201d we mean that there must be more than a \u201cminutia or scintilla of evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Cote, </em>143 N.H. 368, 378 (1999) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">On December 30, 1995, the defendant and his son were at a bar in Farmington. Also at the bar were the victim and two of the victim\u2019s friends. While at the bar, the defendant\u2019s son knocked a beer out of one of the victim\u2019s friend\u2019s hands and pushed him. Later, as the men were leaving the bar, the defendant\u2019s son assaulted one of the victim\u2019s friends and an altercation ensued. Although there is some dispute about what happened next, the defendant testified that the victim\u2019s friend put the defendant\u2019s son in a bear hug and the defendant responded by attempting to pry his son from the man\u2019s grasp. As he did so, the victim struck the defendant in the chest and the defendant struck the victim back. The defendant\u2019s contact with the victim forms the basis of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">When asked on direct examination to explain the incident, the defendant testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">I opened the bar door . . . [a]nd I see an altercation over there . . . and I looked over, and I see my son over there arguing with some big guy .... I said, \u201cWhat the hell is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>going on?\u201d By then, this big guy had got him in a bear hug. So first it come to me, boy, he\u2019s going to crush my son, you know, as big as he is. So I started walking over, and when I went to grab [my son] to break it up, by the shoulder, he threw [my son] into me, you know, get him away from him, and when he done that, I had [my son] by the shoulder, and my cane in my other hand, that I walk with in the left. So I went to pull [my son] around, and then [the victim] whacked me in the chest, and I just let go of [my son], and I said, \u201c . . . get the hell home . . . .\u201d So [my son] immediately started walking up the street to go home. I reached down, picked up my cane[.] By then, [the victim] was back over by the doorway ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Defense counsel asked the defendant what he did \u201cright after\u201d the victim hit him in the chest. The defendant responded, \u201cI bent over, like that, because I dropped my cane because it knocked the wind out of me, just about, and I come up with a right as hard as I could, which isn\u2019t very hard, and that was the end of it.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">RSA 627:4, I (1996) provides in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">A person is justified in using non-deadly force upon another person in order to defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the imminent use of unlawful, non-deadly force by such other person, and he may use a degree of such force which he reasonably believes to be necessary for such purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s testimony provides \u201csome evidence\u201d that the defendant assaulted the victim in defense of his son and, as such, the trial court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s request to provide the instruction to the jury. The defendant\u2019s testimony reflects that just prior to striking the victim, the defendant had watched one of the victim\u2019s friends scuffle with and \u201cbear hug\u201d his son. The defendant testified that he was concerned that the victim\u2019s friend would \u201ccrush [his] son.\u201d Moreover, the defendant testified that when he attempted to pry his son loose from the victim\u2019s friend\u2019s grasp, the victim, apparently acting in concert with his friend, struck the defendant. Thus, contrary to the State\u2019s assertion, the jury could have concluded from the defendant\u2019s testimony that he reasonably believed not only that the victim\u2019s friend was a threat to his son, but that the victim, by acting in concert with his friend, posed a threat to his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>The State next argues that the defendant was not entitled to the instruction because he testified that he was not \u201cdefending\u201d his son and that he struck the victim in retaliation for the victim striking him. It is apparent from the record that the defendant testified inconsistently on numerous occasions. It is, however, the province of the jury to reconcile the defendant\u2019s inconsistent trial testimony. Therefore, for our purposes, the sole question is whether the defendant introduced \u201csome evidence\u201d to support a rational finding in favor of the defense, not whether the evidence in support of the defense is uncontradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Finally, the State argues that the jury could not have reasonably found that the defendant\u2019s conduct was for the purpose of preventing harm to his son because the defendant\u2019s son was no longer involved in the altercation when the defendant struck the victim. We disagree. Given the proximity in time between when the defendant extricated his son from the victim\u2019s friend\u2019s hold and when the defendant struck the victim, a jury could have reasonably concluded that the defendant\u2019s motive in assaulting the victim was to prevent further harm to his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b55-6\">THAYER, J., sat for oral argument but resigned prior to the final vote; BRODERICK, j., concurred; HORTON, J., retired, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
