The court ruled that the defendant\u2019s automobile insurance policy covers liability arising from a dog bite sustained by the intervenor, Judy Rigmont, while she was loading brochures into an automobile. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">We briefly review the facts and procedural history. On March 3, 1996, Lebroke\u2019s dog bit Rigmont while she was attempting to load brochures into Lebroke\u2019s automobile. At that time, Lebroke was covered by a personal automobile insurance policy issued by the defendant and a homeowner\u2019s policy issued by Vermont Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-17\">Rigmont sued Lebroke. Vermont Mutual defended Lebroke in that suit, which was eventually settled. Subsequently Vermont Mutual and Lebroke filed this declaratory judgment action, seeking indemnification from the defendant. Both parties moved for sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>mary judgment on whether the defendant\u2019s automobile insurance policy covered the March 3, 1996 incident. After the superior court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">In reviewing the grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits and pleadings in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Weaver v. Royal Ins. Co. of America, </em>140 N.H. 780, 781 (1996). If there is no genuine issue of material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the grant of summary judgment is affirmed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u201cThe interpretation of terms in insurance policies is a question of law for this court to determine.\u201d <em>Akerley v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>136 N.H. 433, 439 (1992). In determining the terms of a policy, \u201cwe take the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy\u2019s words in context, and we construe the terms of the policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Whitcomb v. Peerless Ins. Co., </em>141 N.H. 149, 150 (1996) (quotations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The policy provides: \u201cWe will pay damages for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 for which any \u2018insured\u2019 becomes legally responsible because of an auto accident.\u201d This policy, therefore, only provides coverage if the injury or damage arises from an \u201cauto accident.\u201d \u201cAuto accident\u201d is undefined in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Until now, we have declined to define \u201cauto accident.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Akerley, </em>136 N.H. at 438. In the context of homeowner liability policies, we broadly define \u201caccident\u201d as \u201can undesigned contingency, ... a happening by chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated, and not naturally to be expected.\u201d <em>Vermont Mut. Ins. Co. v. Malcolm, </em>128 N.H. 521, 523 (1986) (quotations omitted). Of course, the modifier \u201cauto\u201d limits this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">One court, applying the test of whether the \u201caverage person\u201d would consider a stabbing that occurred in the insured automobile to be an \u201cautomobile accident,\u201d concluded that \u201cthe average person would probably say only that [the insured] was stabbed while sitting in his automobile\u201d and therefore denied coverage. <em>See Farmers Ins. Co. of Washington v. Grelis, </em>718 P.2d 812, 813 (Wash. Ct. App. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">In a case factually similar to the one at bar, a Texas court narrowed the definition of \u201cauto accident\u201d to require, at the very least, the involvement of an automobile. <em>See State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. v. Peck, </em>900 S.W.2d 910, 913 (Tex. App. 1995); <em>see also Farmers Texas County Mut. Ins. Co. v. Griffin, </em>955 S.W.2d 81, 83 (Tex. 1997). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>That court concluded that a dog biting an automobile passenger while the car was in motion was not an \u201cauto accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find this analysis persuasive and conclude the dog bite in this case cannot be considered an \u201cauto accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b295-6\">BRODERICK and DALIAN1S, JJ., concurred; HORTON, J., retired, and GROFF, j., superior court justice, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
