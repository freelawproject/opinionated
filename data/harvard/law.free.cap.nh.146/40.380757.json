We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-17\">\u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the evidence demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Grossman v. Murray, </em>141 N.H. 265, 269 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-18\">The following facts appear in the record. Sister Pauline Gamache (Sister Pauline), the intervenor, is a Sister of Charity of Providence. On November 7, 1995, while driving a car registered to the Sisters of Charity of Providence (the \u201cSisters\u201d), Sister Pauline struck the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>plaintiff as she was crossing Bridge Street in Manchester. The \u201cmother house\u201d for the Sisters is located in Montreal, Quebec. At the time of the accident, the Community of the Sisters of Charity of Providence (the \u201cCommunity\u201d) had an automobile liability insurance policy with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\">The plaintiff sued Sister Pauline in 1996 and the Sisters in 1997. In May 1998, the plaintiff petitioned for declaratory judgment. Both the plaintiff and the defendant moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion and denied the defendant\u2019s, ruling that the defendant\u2019s policy covered Sister Pauline\u2019s car and that the defendant had a duty to indemnify her because she was driving a covered vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">The defendant\u2019s policy consists of: a cover page (F.EQ. no. 1A), three endorsements (F.A.Q. nos. 2, 21b, and 25), lists identifying fifty-two vehicles, lists of principal drivers, and a standard Quebec Automobile Insurance Policy Form. Because all but the standard Quebec Automobile Insurance Policy Form are written in French, the parties provided the court with English translations of these policy provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The trial court based its ruling, in part, upon its finding that the policy was \u201cat a minimum . . . ambiguous as to the number of vehicles [it] covered.\u201d On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial court erred when it (a) permitted the plaintiff to raise ambiguity even though she was not a party to the insurance contract; (b) found the policy ambiguous; (c) construed the ambiguity against the defendant; and (d) found that the policy covered Sister Pauline\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">While we agree with the defendant that the trial court erred when it found the policy ambiguous, we nonetheless affirm its ruling. <em>See Quinlan v. City of Dover, </em>136 N.H. 226, 230 (1992). Because we conclude that the policy is unambiguous, we consider only whether it covered Sister Pauline\u2019s vehicle and do not reach the defendant\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\"> \u201cThe interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law for this court to decide.\u201d <em>Bianco Prof. Assoc. v. Home Ins. Co., </em>144 N.H. 288, 292 (1999). \u201cIn interpreting an insurance policy, we take the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy\u2019s words in context, and we construe the terms of the policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Federal Bake Shop v. Farmington Cas. Co., </em>144 N.H. 40, 42 (1999) (quotation omitted). The burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>establishing that coverage is not provided is upon the insurer. <em>See Weeks v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>140 N.H. 641, 648 (1996); <em>see also </em>RSA 491:22-a (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\">The defendant contends that the policy does not provide coverage because: (1) the Sisters located in Manchester is not an insured; (2) Sister Pauline is not a named principal driver; (3) Sister Pauline\u2019s car is not one of the fifty-two vehicles on the incorporated lists; (4) Sister Pauline\u2019s car is not \u201cprincipally used\u201d in Canada; and (5) neither Sister Pauline nor the Sisters reasonably expected coverage. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Article 1 of the policy lists the \u201cassured\u201d as the \u201cCommunity of the Sisters of Charity of Providence\u201d in Montreal, Quebec. General Endorsement F.A.Q. no. <em>25 </em>modifies Article 1 and states that the name of the insured is as follows: \u201cTHE COMMUNITY OF SISTERS OF CHARITY OF PROVIDENCE INCLUDING THE SISTERS OF NOTRE-DAME-OF-THE-SEVEN-DOLORS AND ALL ITS . . . INCORPORATED HOUSES.\u201d On its face, then, the policy applies to the entire Community and would include the Sisters located in Manchester as an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion that the policy is limited to the Community\u2019s Canadian houses, F.A.Q. no. 25 contains no such limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The defendant next argues that Sister Pauline is not insured because she is not a named principal driver. At oral argument, however, the defendant conceded that the policy\u2019s coverage is not limited to principal drivers. Section A of the standard Quebec Automobile Insurance Policy requires the defendant to indemnify \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as if named herein as the insured, <em>every . </em>. . <em>person </em>who . . . drives [a covered] automobile.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The defendant next contends that Sister Pauline\u2019s car is not covered because it is not specified on one of the incorporated lists. While the defendant acknowledges that the policy contains a fleet coverage endorsement, it contends that this endorsement extends only to the fifty-two listed vehicles. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">F.A.Q. no. 21b, the fleet coverage endorsement, states in paragraph (a) that the policy covers \u201call automobile ground vehicles of which the Assured is, during the contract, either the real and registered proprietor or the renter.\u201d Paragraph (b) of F.A.Q. no. 21b states that the vehicles designated in paragraph (a) when the parties entered into the insurance contract \u201c[a]re kept in the list <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>given to the Insurer by the Insured.\u201d Rather than limiting coverage as the defendant urges, Paragraph (b) of F.A.Q. no. 21b merely explains that at the time that the parties entered into the insurance contract, the insureds provided a list of their vehicles to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\">The evident purpose of the fleet coverage endorsement is to provide coverage to \u201call\u201d of the insureds\u2019 vehicles, and not to limit coverage only to vehicles appearing on a furnished list. Paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of F.A.Q. no. 21b and General Endorsement F.A.Q. no. 25 further demonstrate this intent. F.A.Q. no. 21b (c) makes the annual premium \u201conly provisional.\u201d F.A.Q. no. 21b (d) states that the premium is adjustable and General Endorsement F.A.Q. no. 25 explains that this adjustment is based upon the insureds\u2019 total number of vehicles during the policy period and that the total number of the insureds\u2019 vehicles during the policy period was eighty-two. FA.Q. no. 21b (e) requires the insureds to permit the defendant to audit their books to determine the number of covered vehicles. If F.A.Q. no. 21b (a) was not intended to cover \u201call\u201d of the insureds\u2019 vehicles, these other policy provisions would be superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">The defendant agrees that General Endorsement F.A.Q. no. 25 refers to a premium based upon eighty-two vehicles and concedes that the policy may have covered thirty more vehicles than the fifty-two listed, but asserts that \u201cnothing within the entire policy, including the premium page would lead a reasonable person in the position of the insured to conclude that coverage was provided for [Sister Pauline\u2019s car].\u201d We disagree. The plain language of the fleet coverage endorsement extends to \u201call\u201d of the insureds\u2019 vehicles, and the defendant failed to prove that Sister Pauline\u2019s car was not one of those vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Finally, the defendant argues that the policy was intended to cover only vehicles \u201cprincipally used\u201d in Canada, and thus did not cover Sister Pauline\u2019s New Hampshire car. The policy\u2019s geographic scope, however, extends to the United States. Section B, Article 1 of the standard Quebec Automobile Insurance Policy states that \u201cinsurance provided by this policy applies only within Canada, the United States of America, or upon a vessel between ports of those countries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Because we find the policy clear, we need not reach the issue of the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations of coverage. \u201cAbsent ambiguity, our search for the parties\u2019 intent ... is limited to the words of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>polic[y].\u201d <em>Concord Hospital v.
