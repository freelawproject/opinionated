INTRODUCTION &amp; SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-15\">In this consolidated class action, Lead Plaintiffs, David K. McKeehan, James A. Syracuse, and Timothy E. Ferguson (collectively the \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) bring suit on behalf of employees of Cardinal Health, Inc. (\u201cCardinal\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) who invested in Cardinal stock through the Company\u2019s 401(k) plan. Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants, certain officers, directors and employees of Cardinal, as well as the Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company (\u201cPutnam\u201d), the former Trustee of Cardinal\u2019s 401(k) plan, violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-16\">Plaintiffs allege that from 1998 through 2002, while Cardinal\u2019s pharmaceutical distribution unit underwent a reorganization, the corporation and those associated with it disseminated materially false and misleading information in analyst reports, press releases, public statements, and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). According to Plaintiffs, over a four-year Class Period, the Company engaged in a series of illegitimate accounting strategies in order to both hide its losses and inflate its reported revenues to meet increasingly unrealistic earnings projections during the pharmaceutical distribution market transition from a \u201cbuy and hold\u201d (B + H) model to a \u201cfee for service\u201d (\u201cFFS\u201d) model. Plaintiffs assert that Cardinal\u2019s accounting manipulations and its purported dissemination of material misrepresentations affected the price of its securities, misled investors as to the Company\u2019s \u201ctrue value,\u201d and caused Plaintiffs to lose money that they had invested in Cardinal\u2019s 401(k) plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-19\">Cardinal, the Cardinal Employee Benefits Policy Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d or \u201cCommittee Defendants\u201d), and the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (\u201cDirector Defendants\u201d) filed a joint motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), alleging that Plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Defendants Putnam and Defendant Richard J. Miller also filed separate motions dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint under Rules 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-20\">This Court holds that: (1) Plaintiffs failed to state a claim for relief under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3); (2) the \u201cprudent person\u201d standard and the liberal notice pleading requirements apply to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims; (3) Defendant Putnam is a \u201cdirected trustee\u201d subject to a different standard from that applied to a traditional Plan fiduciary, and Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim against Putnam under this standard; (4) the <em>Dura </em>loss causation requirement applicable in cases of securities fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>does not apply in the context of an ERISA claim; (5) Defendants\u2019 contention that Plaintiffs have failed to show that the Committee Defendants had any knowledge of the alleged misstatements is inappropriate for decision on a motion to dismiss; (6) without deciding whether \u201cFraud on the Market Theory\u201d is applicable in the context of an ERISA claim, this Court finds that Plaintiffs have adequately pled reliance under the pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a); (7) Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Defendant Cardinal, the Committee Defendants, and the Director Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to monitor; (8) <em>respondeat superior </em>is applicable to ERISA cases, and Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Cardinal may be held liable under a theory of <em>respondeat superior </em>are sufficient to withstand Defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss; (9) Plaintiffs have successfully stated claims that Defendants may be liable as co-fiduciaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">Defendants\u2019 motions are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. The following motions are GRANTED: (1) Defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss Counts I, II, and III brought under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3) due to Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to state a claim for equitable relief; and (2) Defendant Putnam\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Count I. The following motions are DENIED: (1) Defendant Cardinal\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Counts I, II, and III; Director Defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss Counts I, II, and III; (3) Committee Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Counts I, II, and III; and (4) Defendant Richard J. Miller\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Counts I, II, and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">II. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-10\">A. The Plaintiffs and the Putative Class</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-11\">Lead Plaintiffs, David K. McKeehan, James A. Syracuse, and Timothy E. Ferguson (collectively the \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), are or were Participants in the Cardinal Health Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d), which was amended and restated in its entirety, generally effective as of January 1, 2005, and renamed the Cardinal Health 401(k) Savings Plan,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> within the meaning of ERISA \u00a7 3(7).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lead Plaintiffs bring their Complaint on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>behalf of themselves and all other Participants for whose individual accounts the Plan purchased and/or held shares of the Employer Common Stock Fund (the \u201cFund\u201d) at any time from October 24, 2000 through the present (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). Excluded from the Class are Defendants herein, directors of Defendant Cardinal, members of their immediate families, and the heirs, successors or assigns of any of the foregoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">B. The Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">Plaintiffs bring the action against Cardinal, the Committee, and the Director Defendants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Complaint also names Putnam, the Plan\u2019s trustee from the beginning of the Class Period until December 2004, and Richard Miller,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cardinal\u2019s former Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d) as Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-15\">C. The Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-16\">The Plan is an ERISA-regulated \u201cemployee benefit plan.\u201d The Plan is also a \u201cdefined contribution\u201d or \u201cindividual account\u201d plan under ERISA \u00a7 3(84),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> meaning that it \u201cprovides for individual accounts for each Participant and for benefits based solely upon the amount contributed to the Participant\u2019s account.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(34).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>According to its terms, the Plan is funded primarily through participant investments and employer matching. The participants have extensive discretion in allocating their investments among the various alternatives, and they may transfer their investments into or out of the Stock Fund or any other fund whenever it suits them. <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Ex. C. At 12-14; Defs.\u2019 Ex. E. at 4. As for the employers, under the Plan, \u201cany company matching or other employer contributions would be invested in the same funds chosen by the Participant for the Participant\u2019s contributions.\u201d <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Ex. E at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">Cardinal\u2019s voluntary matching contributions vary from time to time. For instance, in 2004, Cardinal matched each participant\u2019s savings with $.50 for every $1 contributed by the participant, up to six percent of the participant\u2019s salary. <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Ex. E at 4. Currently, Cardinal matches each participant\u2019s savings on a \u201cone-to-one\u201d basis, up to 3 percent of the participant\u2019s pay, and $.50 for every $1 the participant contributes above three percent to a maximum of 5 percent of his compensation. <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Ex. D at 6. The various Summary Plan Descriptions (\u201cSPD\u201d) Cardinal distributed during the Class Period provided Plan- participants with information regarding their investment options and associated risks to assist them in making their investment decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">The Plan indicates that Cardinal is the named administrator, and, as the Plan sponsor, Cardinal appointed (and later removed) Putnam as the Plan Trustee. Further, the Plan states that \u201c[t]he Company shall have the sole authority to appoint and remove the Trustee and members of the Committee\u201d and \u201cshall have the final responsibility for the administration of the Plan ... and shall be the \u2018Plan Administrator\u2019 and the named fiduciary.\u201d <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Ex. A \u00a7 10.01; Defs.\u2019 Ex. B \u00a7 10.01.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Plan designates no other entity or person as a Plan \u201cfiduciary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">One of the Plan\u2019s stated purposes is to \u201cprovide Participants with ownership interests in the Company.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Ex. A. \u00a7 8.05; Defs.\u2019 Ex. B \u00a7 8.05. The Plan specifies that the Trustee is \u201c[ajuthorized to maintain the \u2018Employer Common Stock Fund\u2019 as one of the Investment Funds.\u201d <em>See </em>1998 and 2002 Plans \u00a7 8.05, App. Ex. Tabs 1 and 2. As such, the Plan mandates that the \u201cEmployer Common Stock Fund <em>shall </em>consist of stock of the Company and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>cash or cash equivalents needed to meet obligations of such fund or for the purchase of stock of the Company ... To the extent practicable, all available assets of the Employer Common Stock Fund shall be used to purchase Shares,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which shall be held by the Trustee ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">The Plan offers participants several diversified investment options in addition to the Cardinal Stock Fund (the \u201cStock Fund\u201d). These options change over time. For instance, in January 2001, the Plan investment options increased from eight to twelve funds. <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Ex. C at 25. Currently, ten options are available, including, among others, a \u201cstable value fund, a balanced fund, the Fidelity Diversified International fund, and the PIMCO Total Return Investment Fund (Institutional Class).\u201d <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Ex. D at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">D. The Trust Agreements and Service Agreements</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">Until it was removed from the position in 2004, Defendant Putnam served as the Plan\u2019s Trustee pursuant to its trust agreements with Cardinal dated July 1, 1998 (\u201c1998 TA\u201d) and January 2, 2001 (\u201c2001 TA\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cTrust Agreements\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consistent with the Plan, the Trust Agreements provided that Putnam was to be directed by the Administrator in the selecting the investment funds made available to participants. As contemplated by the Trust Agreements, Putnam\u2019s obligations to the Plan were also discussed in Service Agreements effective as of July 1, 1998 (\u201c1998 SA\u201d) and July 1, 2002 (\u201c2002 SA\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cService Agreements\u201d). The Service Agreements contained the \u201cinitial available investment options\u201d selected by Cardinal to be available to the Plan participants. Consistent with the Plan provisions, the first investment option listed in each relevant Service Agreement was the Cardinal Stock Fund (the \u201cFund\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-13\">E. The Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-14\">During the Class Period, Cardinal was undergoing a significant transition from a B + H to a FFS distribution model. As set forth above, Plaintiffs argue that, to maintain its viability as a successful company in the face of its reorganization efforts, Cardinal artificially inflated its stock price by using fraudulent accounting techniques. In 2002, the SEC began an informal investigation of Cardinal, which was later elevated to a formal investigation. In the wake of this investigation, Cardinal was forced to restate some of its past financial reports. After Cardinal made these corrections, its stock price fluctuated signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>cantly. By the end of the Class Period, Cardinal stock had declined by approximately 5 percent from its price at the start of the Class Period. <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Ex. F.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">In the wake of Cardinal\u2019s declining stock price, on April 29, 2005, Plaintiffs filed this three-count complaint pursuant to ERISA sections 502(a)(2) and 502(a)(3).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Complaint alleges that the Cardinal Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by continuing to offer the Company Stock Fund as one of the Plan alternatives when they knew or should have known that Cardinal\u2019s stock price was artificially inflated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">1.Count I \u2014 Breach of Duties of Loyalty and Prudence</p>\n<p id=\"Azgm\">Count I alleges that all the Defendants breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by designating the Fund as an investment option, permitting the Plan to invest in the Fund, and permitting the Fund to invest in Cardinal Stock when the Cardinal stock was an imprudent investment. <em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 77-91. Specifically, Count I alleges that it was inadvisable for the Plan to invest in Cardinal Stock when its price was artificially inflated by \u201cundisclosed materially adverse information,\u201d and Cardinal\u2019s \u201caccounting improprieties in violation of generally accepted accounting principles,\u201d which led to \u201can October 2003 informal inquiry, and a May 6, 2004 formal investigation by the SEC, and eventually required the [Cjompany to restate three years of [past] earnings results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-14\">2.Count II \u2014 Material Misrepresentation and Negligent Omissions</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-15\">Count II alleges that all of the Defendants except Putnam breached their fiduciary duties by both negligently misstating and failing to disclose \u201cmaterial information necessary for Participants to make informed decisions concerning Plan assets and benefits.\u201d <em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 92-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-16\">3.Count III \u2014 Failure to Monitor</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-17\">Count III alleges that Cardinal and the Director Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to appoint fiduciaries with the knowledge and expertise necessary to manage Plan assets, by failing to monitor those fiduciaries properly, and by failing to provide sufficient information to both Plan participants and Plan fiduciaries. <em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 102-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-18\">F. The Dispute</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-19\">This Opinion addresses the various motions to dismiss filed by the Defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>named in the ERISA class action. Among other things, the Defendants contend the following: (1) Plaintiffs\u2019 claims brought under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3) fail because Plaintiffs have demanded monetary damages, not \u201cequitable relief\u2019; (2) as to Count I, Plaintiffs have not alleged an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d by Defendants in offering Cardinal Stock as an investment option; (3) as to all three Counts, Plaintiffs have failed \u25a0 to allege facts showing that the Defendants are \u201cfiduciaries\u201d under ERISA; (4) as to Count II, Plaintiffs have not pled loss causation and have not alleged Plaintiffs\u2019 actual reliance on Defendants\u2019 alleged misstatements; and (5) as to Count III, Plaintiffs\u2019 claim should be dismissed because it is derivative of Plaintiffs\u2019 other claims and because there is no <em>re-spondeat superior </em>liability under ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"As2\">A. Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss, the Court is limited to evaluating whether a plaintiffs complaint sets forth allegations sufficient to make out the elements of a cause of action. <em>Windsor v. The Tennessean, </em>719 F.2d 155, 158 (6th Cir.1983). Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, the complaint need only set forth the basis of the court\u2019s jurisdiction, a short and plain statement of the claim entitling plaintiff to relief and a demand for judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. Rule Civ. Pro. 8(a). Moreover, each averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct, and all pleadings are to be construed in a manner resulting in substantial justice. <em>Id. </em>Finally, \u201cfactual pleading is required only insofar as it is necessary place a defendant on notice as to the type of claim alleged and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Id.; Mountain View Pharm. v. Abbott Labs., </em>630 F.2d 1383, 1388 (10th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-7\">All factual allegations made by a plaintiff are deemed admitted and ambiguous allegations must be construed in his favor. <em>Murphy v.

A complaint should not be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) \u2018\u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that the [pjlaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lillard v.

While the complaint need not specify every detail of a plaintiffs claim, it must give the defendant \u201c\u2018fair notice of what the plaintiffs claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gazette v. City of Pontiac, </em>41 F.3d 1061, 1064 (6th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Conley, </em>355 U.S. at 47, 78 S.Ct. 99).</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-8\">Nonetheless, this liberal standard of review does require more than the bare assertion of legal conclusions. <em>Allard v.

ERISA Pleading Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-10\">Unlike claims of fraud brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which require a heightened standard of pleading, claims brought under ERISA are subject only to the simplified pleading standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. <em>See Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., </em>534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002). Accordingly, to survive this motion to dismiss, the Complaint must include only \u201ca short and plain statement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>Fed. Rule Civ. Pro. 8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">To state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA, a plaintiff must allege that: (1) the defendant was a fiduciary of an ERISA plan who, (2) acting within his capacity as a fiduciary, (3) engaged in conduct constituting a breach of his fiduciary duty. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109; <em>see In re AOL Time Warner, Inc. Sec. &amp; \u201cERISA\u201d Litig., </em>2005 WL 563166, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar.10, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">In considering a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, it is proper for the Court to take into account any relevant plan documents. Courts may consider ERISA plan documents not attached to a complaint where a plaintiffs claims are \u201cbased on rights under the plans which are controlled by the plans\u2019 provisions as described in the plan documents\u201d and where the documents are \u201cincorporated through reference to the plaintiffs rights under the plans, and they are central to plaintiffs claims.\u201d <em>Weiner v. Klais &amp; Co., </em>108 F.3d 86, 89 (6th Cir.1997); <em>see also City of Monroe Employees Retirement Sys. v. Bridgestone Corp., </em>399 F.3d 651, 659 n. 6 (6th Cir.2005) (considering the impact of annual reports referenced in the complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-7\">A. ERISA Background &amp; the Statutory Framework of ERISA</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-8\">Congress enacted ERISA \u201cafter \u2018almost a decade of studying the nation\u2019s Private Pension Plans\u2019 and other employee benefit plans.\u201d <em>See Unaka Co., Inc. v. Newman, </em>2005 WL 1118065, at *13 (E.D.Tenn. Apr.26, 2005); <em>Central States, Southeast &amp; Southivest Areas Pension Fund v. Central Transport, Inc., </em>472 U.S. 559, 569, 105 S.Ct. 2833, 86 L.Ed.2d 447 (1985). ERISA is a \u201ccomprehensive and reticulated statute,\u201d which is designed to protect employee pensions and benefit plans by, among other things, \u201csetting forth certain general fiduciary duties applicable to the management of both pension and nonpension benefit plans.\u201d <em>Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs., </em>508 U.S. 248, 251, 113 S.Ct. 2063, 124 L.Ed.2d 161 (1993); <em>Varity Corp. v. Howe, </em>516 U.S. 489, 496, 116 S.Ct. 1065, 134 L.Ed.2d 130 (1996). Employers are not required to establish employee benefit plans, but if they choose to do so, they must abide by ERISA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-10\">Through ERISA, Congress wanted to ensure that if an employee was promised a benefit, he would receive it. <em>Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, </em>517 U.S. 882, 887, 116 S.Ct. 1783, 135 L.Ed.2d 153 (1996). Thus, ERISA \u201cprotect[s] ... the interest of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries ..., by establishing standards of conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and by providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and access to the federal courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(b)). ERISA accomplishes this goal by mandating that private pension plan assets are to be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of plan participants and beneficiaries. <em>Id. </em>(citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(a)). ERISA requires such plans to name fiduciaries who shall have the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plan. <em>Id. </em>(citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102(a)(2)). These fiduciaries need not be independent parties; the employer or plan sponsor may appoint its own \u201cofficer, employee, agent, or other representative\u201d to serve in a fiduciary capacity. <em>Id. </em>(citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1108(c)(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-13\">1. ERISA Fiduciaries</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-14\">A person or entity is considered an ERISA \u201cnamed fiduciary\u201d if the written instruments governing an ERISA employee benefit plan designate his fiduciary status.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number><footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nonetheless, persons or entities who are <em>not </em>named as fiduciaries in plan documents but who exercise discretionary authority and control that amounts to actual decision-making power may still be considered \u201cfunctional fiduciaries\u201d with respect to the plan. A person is a functional fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent he:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-5\">(i) exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting.management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-6\">(ii) renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan, or has any discretionary authority or responsibility to do so; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-7\">(iii) has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\"><em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102(21)(A). The Sixth Circuit has observed that \u201canyone who exercises authority over an employee benefit plan can properly be held an ERISA fiduciary because that term was intended to be interpreted broadly by Congress ...\u201d <em>See In re AEP ERISA Litig., </em>327 F.Supp.2d 812, 826 (S.D.Ohio 2004) (Marbley, J.) (citing <em>Brock v. Hendershott; </em>840 F.2d 339, 342 (6th Cir.1988)). Courts have clarified, however, that \u201ca person is a fiduciary only with respect to those aspects of the plan over which he exercises authority or control.\u201d <em>See Dynegy, </em>309 F.Supp.2d at 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-10\">a. Fiduciary Duties Under ERISA</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-11\">An ERISA fiduciary \u201cshall discharge his duties ... solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries\u201d and must act \u201cwith the care, skill, prudence and diligence under circumstances then prevailing that a prudent [person] acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(B). The duties charged to an ERISA fiduciary are \u201cthe highest known to the law.\u201d <em>Chao v. Hall Holding Co., Inc., </em>285 F.3d 415, 426 (6th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Howard v. Shay, </em>100 F.3d 1484, 1488 (9th Cir.1996)). The duties of a fiduciary are set forth in ERISA \u00a7 404(a)(1) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-12\">... [a] fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-13\">(A) for the exclusive purpose of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-14\">(i) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-15\">(ii) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-16\">(B) with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-17\">(C) by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the cireum-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>stances it is clearly prudent not to do so; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-4\">(D) in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">The Sixth Circuit has enumerated three general duties of pension plan fiduciaries under Section 1104(a)(1). <em>Kuper v. Iovenko, </em>66 F.3d 1447, 1458 (6th Cir.1995). The first is a \u201cduty of loyalty\u201d pursuant to which \u201call decisions regarding an ERISA plan \u2018must be made with an eye single to the interest of the participants and beneficiaries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The second obligation imposed under ERISA, the \u201cprudent person\u201d obligation, imposes \u201can unwavering duty\u201d to act both \u201cas a prudent person would act in a similar situation\u201d and \u201cwith single minded devotion\u201d to those same plan participants and beneficiaries. <em>Id. </em>Finally, an ERISA fiduciary must \u201cact for the exclusive purpose\u201d of providing benefits to plan beneficiaries. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Berlin v. Michigan Bell Tele. Co., </em>858 F.2d 1154, 1162 (6th Cir.1988) and <em>Donovan v. Bierwirth, </em>680 F.2d 263, 271 (2d Cir.1982)). Indeed, \u201c[a] fiduciary breaches his duty by providing plan participants with materially misleading information, \u2018regardless of whether the fiduciary\u2019s statements or omissions were made negligently or intentionally.\u2019 \u201d <em>See AEP, </em>327 F.Supp.2d at 819 (citing <em>James v.

In <em>Varity Corp., </em>the Court elaborated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-10\">[t]here is more to plan (or trust) administration than simply complying with the specific duties imposed by the plan documents or statutory regime; it also includes the activities that are \u201cordinary and natural means\u201d of achieving the \u201cobjective\u201d of the plan. Indeed, the primary function of the fiduciary duty is to constrain the exercise of discretionary powers which are controlled by no other specific duties imposed by the trust instrument or the legal regime. If the fiduciary duty applied to nothing more than activities already controlled by other specific duties, it would serve no purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1058-11\"><em>Varity Corp., </em>516 U.S. at 504, 116 S.Ct. 1065.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-12\">i. Loyalty</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-13\">ERISA requires fiduciaries to discharge their duties with respect to a plan \u201csolely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1). In other words, \u201cfor the exclusive purpose of (i) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and (ii) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1104(a)(1)(A). In <em>Pe-gram, </em>the Supreme Court explained that the fiduciary responsibilities imposed by this section of ERISA arise from the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>mon law of trusts. <em>See </em>530 U.S. 211, 224, 120 S.Ct. 2143, 147 L.Ed.2d 164 (2000) (quoting <em>Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund, </em>472 U.S. at 559, 105 S.Ct. 2833 (\u201c[R]ather than explicitly enumerating <em>all </em>of the powers and duties of trustees and other fiduciaries, Congress invoked the common law of trusts to define the general scope of their authority and responsibility.\u201d)); <em>see also, Hams Trust &amp; Savs. Bank v. Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., </em>530 U.S. 238, 240, 120 S.Ct. 2180, 147 L.Ed.2d 187 (2000) (\u201cThe common law of trusts ... offers a starting point for analysis of [ERISA] ... [unless] it is inconsistent with the language of the statute, its structure, or its purposes.\u201d). \u201cBeyond the threshold statement of responsibility, however, the analogy between ERISA fiduciary and common law trustee becomes problematic ... because the trustee at common law characteristically wears only his fiduciary hat when he takes action to affect a beneficiary, whereas the trustee under ERISA may wear different hats.\u201d <em>Pegram, </em>530 U.S. at 224, 120 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">(a) \u201cTwo Hat\u201d Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">Comparing a traditional trustee to an ERISA fiduciary, the <em>Pegram </em>Court explained that while a traditional fiduciary \u201cis not permitted to place himself in a position where it would be for his own benefit to violate his duty to the beneficiaries ... [u]nder ERISA ... a fiduciary may have financial interests adverse to beneficiaries.\u201d 530 U.S. at 224, 120 S.Ct. 2143 (citing 2A A. Scott &amp; W. Fratcher, Trusts \u00a7 170, 311 (4th ed.1987)). \u201cEmployers, for example, can be ERISA fiduciaries and still take actions that disadvantage employee beneficiaries when they act as employers <em>(e.g., </em>firing a beneficiary for reasons unrelated to the ERISA plan), or even as plan sponsors <em>{e.g., </em>modifying the terms of a plan as allowed by ERISA to provide less generous benefits).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Pegram </em>court also recognized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiA\">[t]he law does not require employers to establish employee benefit plans. Congress sought to encourage employers to set up plans voluntarily by offering tax incentives, methods to limit fiduciary liability, means to contain administrative costs, and giving employers flexibility and control over matters such as whether or when to establish an employee benefit plan, how to design a plan, how to amend a plan, when to terminate a plan, all of which are generally viewed as business decisions of a settlor, not of a fiduciary, and thus not subject to fiduciary obligations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-9\"><em>See In re Enron Corp. Sec., Derivative &amp; ERISA Litig., </em>284 F.Supp.2d 511, 551 (S.D.Tex.2003) (citing <em>Pegram, </em>530 U.S. at 224, 120 S.Ct. 2143.). Moreover, in <em>Pe-gram, </em>the Supreme Court also recognized that there exists no \u201capparent reason in the ERISA provisions to conclude ... that this tension is permissible only for the employer or plan sponsor, to the exclusion of persons who provide services to an ERISA plan.\u201d <em>See </em>530 U.S. at 224, 120 S.Ct. 2143.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-10\">(b) One Hat at a Time</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-11\">ERISA requires, however, \u201cthat a fiduciary with two hats wear only one at a time, and wear the fiduciary hat when making fiduciary decisions.\u201d <em>Pegram, </em>530 U.S. at 224, 120 S.Ct. 2143 (citing <em>Varity Corp., </em>516 U.S. at 489, 116 S.Ct. 1065). Thus, ERISA does not define \u201cfiduciaries simply as administrators of the plan, or managers or advisers ... [i]nstead, it defines an administrator, for example, as a fiduciary only \u2018to the extent\u2019 that he acts in such a capacity in relation to a plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-12\">As a result, in every case charging a defendant with the breach of an ERISA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>fiduciary duty, the threshold question is not whether the actions of some person employed to provide services under a plan adversely affected a plan beneficiary\u2019s interest, but whether that person was acting as a fiduciary (that is, was performing a fiduciary function) when taking the action subject to the complaint. <em>See Dynegy, </em>309 F.Supp.2d at 861, 874-75 (citing <em>Pegram, </em>120 S.Ct. at 2152-53).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">ii. Prudence</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">Pursuant to the duty of prudence, a fiduciary must act \u201cwith the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent [person] acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.\u201d <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(B). The Fifth Circuit has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqC\">[i]n determining compliance with ERISA\u2019s prudent [person] standard, courts objectively assess whether the fiduciary, at the time of the transaction, utilized proper methods to investigate, evaluate and structure the investment; acted in a manner as would others familiar with such matters; and exercised independent judgment when making investment decisions. [ERISA\u2019s] test of prudence ... is one of conduct, and not a test of the performance of the investment. The focus of the inquiry is how the fiduciary acted in his selection of the investment, and not whether his investments succeeded or failed. Thus, the appropriate inquiry is whether the individuals] ... at the time they engaged in the challenged transactions, employed the appropriate methods to investigate the merits of the investment and to structure the investment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1060-9\"><em>Laborers Nat\u2019l Pension Fund v. N\u2019ern Trust, </em>173 F.3d 313, 317 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-10\">Regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) generally reflect that a fiduciary with investment duties must act as a prudent investment manager under the modern portfolio theory <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> rather than under the common law of trusts standard, which examined each investment with an eye toward its individual riskiness. <em>Id. </em>(citing 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2550.404a-l). Because the \u201cprudent person\u201d standard focuses on whether the fiduciary utilized appropriate methods to investigate and evaluate the merits of a particular investment, what is considered \u201cappropriate\u201d in a particular case depends upon \u201cthe \u2018character\u2019 and \u2018aim\u2019 of the particular plan and decisions at issue and the \u2018circumstances prevailing\u2019 at the time a particular course of action must be investigated and undertaken.\u201d <em>See Dynegy, </em>309 F.Supp.2d at 875 (citing <em>Bussian v. RJR Nabisco, Inc., </em>223 F.3d 286, 299 (5th Cir.2000)). Furthermore, the \u201cprudent person\u201d standard is an objective standard, and good faith is not a defense to a claim of imprudence. <em>Id.; see also, Enron, </em>284 F.Supp.2d at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-11\">iii. Diversification</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-12\">ERISA requires fiduciaries to diversify \u201cthe investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses unless, under the circumstances, it is clearly prudent not to do so.\u201d <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(C). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>The \u25a0 Court in <em>Metzler v. Graham </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1061-4\">The degree of investment concentration that would violate this requirement to diversify cannot be stated as a fixed percentage, because a fiduciary must consider the facts and circumstances of each case. The factors to be considered include[:] (1) the purposes of the plan; (2) the amount of the plan assets; (3) financial and industrial conditions; (4) the type of investment, whether mortgages, bonds or shares of stock or otherwise; (5) distribution as to geographical location; (6) distribution as to industries; (7) dates of maturity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\"><em>Metzler v. Graham, </em>112 F.3d 207, 209 (5th Cir.1997) (citing H.R.Rep. No. 1280 93d Cong., 2d Sess. (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5038, 5084-85 (Conf. Rept. at 304)). The court also noted, \u201c[w]e think it is entirely appropriate for a fiduciary to consider the time horizon over which the plan will be required to pay out benefits in evaluating the risk of large loss from an investment strategy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210. Moreover, the court admonished lower courts that \u201c[i]t is clearly imprudent to evaluate diversification solely in hindsight \u2014 plan fiduciaries can make honest mistakes that do not detracts from a conclusion that their decisions were prudent at the time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">iv. Diversification Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">ERISA, however, has some \u201ccarve-out exceptions\u201d for plans meeting certain qualifications. For instance, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107 permits an employee pension plan to acquire and hold qualifying employer securities provided that the aggregate fair market value of employer securities<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> held by the plan does not exceed 10 percent of the fair market value of the assets of the plan immediately after such acquisition. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-11\">As set forth above, ERISA\u2019s \u201cprudent person\u201d standard of care requires plan fiduciaries to diversify the plan\u2019s investments<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it clearly would not be prudent to do so. <em>See Kuper, </em>66 F.3d at 1458. There exist, however, special ERISA plans defined as \u201celigible independent account plans\u201d (\u201cEIAPs\u201d). A plan is an EIAP when it is an individual account plan which is also a profit sharing, stock bonus, thrift, or savings plan. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1107(d)(3)(A). In the case of an EIAP, however, the diversification requirement and the prudence requirement (to the extent that it requires diversification) are not violated by acquisition of or holding of qualifying employer securities. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(C) and (2). This special rule for EIAPs reflects a \u201cstrong policy and preference in favor of investment in employer stock.\u201d <em>Unaka Co., </em>2005 WL 1118065, at *15 (citing <em>Fink v. Nat\u2019l Savings and Trust Co., </em>772 F.2d 951, 956 (D.C.Cir.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-12\">One special type of EIAP is an employee stock ownership plan (\u201cESOP\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>which is an ERISA plan investing primarily in \u201cqualifying employer securities\u201d\u2014 usually shares of stock in the employer creating to plan. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107(a)(6)(A). Congress envisioned that an ESOP would function both as an employee retirement benefit plan and a technique of corporate finance that would encourage employee ownership. <em>Kuper, </em>66 F.3d at 1457; <em>see Unaka Co., </em>2005 WL 1118065, at *15. Because of these dual purposes, ESOPs are not designed to guarantee retirement benefits, and they place employee retirement assets at much greater risk than the typical diversified ERISA plan. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">In <em>Kuper, </em>the court found that \u201cdespite this recognition that ESOPs place employee assets at a greater risk, the purpose of ESOPs cannot override ERISA\u2019s goal of ensuring the proper management and soundness of employee benefit plans.\u201d <em>Kuper, </em>66 F.3d at 1457. These competing concerns, that is, Congress\u2019 intent to encourage the formation of ESOPs by passing legislation granting such plans special treatment on the one hand and the competing policy of ERISA, that of safeguarding the interest of participants in employee benefit plans on the other, make it more difficult to delineate the responsibilities of ESOP fiduciaries. <em>See Unaka Co., </em>2005 WL 1118065, at *15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">The Sixth and Third Circuits have held that a proper balance between the purpose of ERISA and the nature of ESOPs requires that an ESOP fiduciary\u2019s decision to invest in employer securities be reviewed for an \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Kuper, </em>66 F.3d at 1459; <em>see Moench v. Robertson, </em>62 F.3d 553 (3d Cir.1995). <em>Kuper </em>creates a presumption that a fiduciary\u2019s decision to remain invested in employer securities was reasonable. 66 F.3d at 1459. A plaintiff may then rebut this presumption of reasonableness by showing that a prudent fiduciary acting under similar circumstances would have made a different investment decision.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">Reasonable reliance upon advice received from the plan\u2019s legal and financial advisors may not be a defense to a charge that fiduciaries have not acted prudently. Reliance on the advice of counsel or a financial advisor, however, without more, will not insulate a fiduciary from being found to have breached his fiduciary duties. See <em>Unaka Co., </em>2005 WL 1118065, at *16; <em>Donovan v. Mazzola, </em>716 F.2d 1226, 1234 (9th Cir.1983). \u201cAlthough securing an independent assessment from a financial advisor or legal counsel is evidence of a thorough investigation, it is not a complete defense to a charge of imprudence.\u201d <em>Martin v. Feilen, </em>965 F.2d 660, 670-71 (8th Cir.1992); <em>Howard v. Shay, </em>100 F.3d 1484, 1489 (9th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Mazzola, </em>716 F.2d at 1234). Further, \u201cindependent expert advice is not a whitewash.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Donovan v. Bierwirth, </em>680 F.2d 263, 272 (2d Cir.1982)). Three requirements must be met before a fiduciary may rely upon expert advice. <em>Unaka Co., </em>2005 WL 1118065, at *16. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>fiduciary must: (1) investigate the expert\u2019s qualifications; (2) provide the expert with complete and accurate information; and (3) make certain that reliance on the expert\u2019s advice is reasonably justified under the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Howard, </em>100 F.3d at 1489).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">Under the abuse of discretion standard, plaintiffs have the burden of proving not only that defendants breached their fiduciary duties, but also that such breaches caused a loss to the plan. <em>Kuper, </em>66 F.3d at 1459; <em>Silverman v. Mut Ben. Life Ins. Co., </em>138 F.3d 98 (2d Cir.1998); <em>Willett v. Blue Cross, </em>953 F.2d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.1992); <em>Call v. Sumitomo Bank, </em>881 F.2d 626, 633 (9th Cir.1989). ERISA\u2019s plain language also makes clear that a fiduciary is a person liable to a plan <em>only </em>for losses to the plan resulting from the breach. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109(a). Upon finding a breach of fiduciary duty resulting in loss to the plan, the court may award damages and award prevailing parties their reasonable and necessary fees and costs incurred in pursuing the breach of fiduciary duty claims. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">v. Compliance</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">ERISA requires fiduciaries to discharge their duties \u201cin accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of [ERISA].\u201d <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(D). \u201cIn case of a conflict, the provisions of ERISA policies as set forth in the statute and regulations prevail over those of the Fund guidelines.\u201d <em>See Dynegy, </em>309 F.Supp.2d at 876 (citing <em>Laborers Nat\u2019l, </em>173 F.3d at 322); <em>see also Central States, </em>105 S.Ct. at 2833 (\u201c[T]rust documents cannot excuse trustees from their duties under ERISA, and ... trust documents must generally be construed in light of ERISA\u2019s policies.\u201d); <em>Donovan, </em>716 F.2d at 1467 (\u201cThough freed by Section 408 from the prohibited transaction rules, ESOP fiduciaries remain subject to the general requirements of Section 404.\u201d); <em>Moench, </em>62 F.3d at 567 (where the plan language \u201cconstrains the [a fiduciary\u2019s] ability to act in the best interest of the beneficiaries,\u201d it is inconsistent with ERISA and with the common law of trusts and must not be followed).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-9\">b. Remedies for Breach</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">ERISA makes fiduciaries liable for breach of their duties, and specifies the remedies available against them. <em>See Mertens, </em>508 U.S. at 251, 113 S.Ct. 2063 (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109(a)). The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-11\">Any person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who breaches any of the responsibilities, obligations or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this subchap-ter shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach, and to restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the plan by the fiduciary, and shall be subject to such other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate including removal of such fiduciary....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-12\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109(a). Because \u00a7 1109 does not distinguish between <em>named </em>fiduciaries and <em>functional </em>fiduciaries, it is applicable to both types of ERISA fiduciaries. <em>See Enron, </em>284 F.Supp.2d at 545-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-13\">ERISA allows any plan participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary to bring a civil action \u201cfor appropriate relief under section 1109.\u201d <em>Mertens, </em>508 U.S. at 253, 113 S.Ct. 2063 (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2)). Nevertheless, ERISA does not permit a civil action for legal damages against a non-fiduciary charged with know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>ing participation- in a fiduciary breach. <em>See Dynegy, </em>309 F.Supp.2d at 876-77; <em>Reich v. Rowe, </em>20 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.1994) (citing <em>Mertens, </em>508 U.S. at 253, 113 S.Ct. 2063). As an alternative to fiduciary liability, a non-fiduciary may be liable as a \u201cparty in interest,\u201d but only for \u201cappropriate equitable relief,\u201d including injunctions and equitable restitution, in civil actions brought by plan participants under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3). <em>See Useden v. Acker, </em>947 F.2d 1563, 1581-82 (11th Cir.1991); <em>Useden v. Greenberg, Traurig, Hoffman, Lipoff, Rosen &amp; Quentel, </em>508 U.S. 959, 113 S.Ct. 2927, 124 L.Ed.2d 678 (1993). A party in interest of an employee benefit plan is defined in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(14) and includes, <em>inter alia, </em>any fiduciary (administrator, officer, trustee, custodian, etc.), a person that provides services to the plan (such as an accountant, attorney), an employer of any employees covered by the plan, and an employee organization, including any members covered by the plan. <em>See Dynegy, </em>309 F.Supp.2d at 877. Such non-fiduciaries may be held liable for such \u201cappropriate <em>equitable </em>relief\u2019 if they are \u201cparties in interest\u201d and, if with actual or constructive knowledge, they participate in a fiduciary\u2019s breach of its duties in transactions between the plan and a party in interest that are expressly prohibited under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106(a). <em>See id.; Enron, </em>284 F.Supp.2d at 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">B. Whether Plaintiffs Have Stated a Claim for Relief under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">As a threshold consideration, the Court will consider Defendants\u2019 argument that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for relief under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3). 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3); <em>see </em>Certain Defs.\u2019 Motion to Dismiss at 11. As explained above, all three counts of Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint proceed under both Sections 502(a)(2) and 502(a)(3) of ERISA. <em>See supra </em>Part II.E. Section 502(a)(2) gives a participant a right to sue on behalf of a plan for alleged breach of fiduciary duty where any recovery goes to the plan itself. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2). Section 502(a)(3) creates a right of action for a participant to sue for \u201cother appropriate equitable relief\u2019 to remedy violations of ERISA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">In their Prayer for Relief, Plaintiffs demand: (1) a declaration that Defendants have breached their ERISA fiduciary duties to the participants; (2) an order compelling the Defendants to \u201cmake good\u201d to the Plan all losses to the Plan resulting from Defendants\u2019 breaches of their fiduciary duties, including losses to the Plan resulting from imprudent investment of the Plan\u2019s assets, and to restore to the Plan all profits which the participants would have made if the Defendants had fulfilled their fiduciary obligations; (3) the imposition of a constructive trust on any amounts by which any Defendant was unjustly enriched at the Plan\u2019s expense as the result of breaches of fiduciary duty; (4) an order enjoining Defendants from any further violations of their ERISA fiduciary obligations; (5) actual damages in the amount of any losses the Plan suffered, to be allocated among the participants\u2019 individual accounts in proportion to the accounts\u2019 losses; (6) equitable relief; (7) costs pursuant to 29 U.S.C \u00a7 1132(g)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>; (8) attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>neys\u2019 fees pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g) and the common fund doctrine; and (9) such other relief as the Court may deem equitable and just. <em>See </em>Complaint 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\">Defendants contend that Plaintiffs\u2019 Prayer for Relief is a feeble attempt to disguise money damages as an \u201cequitable remedy.\u201d Accordingly, Defendants argue that all three counts of the claims brought under Section 502(a)(3) should be dismissed because that section does not allow plaintiffs to recover monetary relief. Plaintiffs, however, counter that their requests for statutory costs, attorney\u2019s fees, declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and the imposition of a constructive trust on any amounts by which Defendants were unjustly enriched are all permissible <em>equitable </em>remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">ERISA allows plan beneficiaries, plan administrators, and the Secretary of Labor to enforce its provisions. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(l)-(6). ERISA, however, distinguishes between those parties in the types of relief it makes available to them. <em>See Helfrich, v. PNC Bank, Kentucky, Inc., </em>267 F.3d 477, 481 (6th Cir.2001). Acting on behalf of a benefit plan, the Secretary of Labor and the plan administrator are entitled to seek the full gamut of legal and equitable relief. <em>See id.; see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(l)-(6). In contrast, ERISA restricts plan beneficiaries to equitable relief with no recourse to money damages-. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3); <em>Mertens, </em>508 U.S. at 255, 113 S.Ct. 2063 (holding that ERISA does not authorize suits for money damages against non-fiduciaries who knowingly participate in a fiduciary\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty); <em>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, </em>534 U.S. 204, 122 S.Ct. 708, 151 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001) (finding that ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3) does not authorize petitioners to seek the imposition of personal liability on respondents for a contractual obligation to pay money because it is akin to legal relief); <em>Helfrich, </em>267 F.3d at 481 (dismissing plaintiffs claim under \u00a7 502(a)(3) requesting that defendant bank should compensate him for the losses he suffered because the bank failed to transfer his assets to higher performing mutual funds because it was a claim for <em>money damages, </em>not equitable restitution); <em>Qualchoice, Inc. v. Rowland, </em>367 F.3d 638, 648-50 (6th Cir.2003) (because the source of the claim asserted by plaintiffs was a \u201ccontract to pay money,\u201d and the procedural mechanisms of constructive trust and equitable lien were not proper mechanisms for enforcing this right as, traditionally, they would not have been awarded by a court of equity in a breach of contract action, the court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3) <em>for </em>lack <em>of </em>subject matter jurisdiction). The Supreme Court in <em>Mertens </em>noted that, \u201c[although they often dance around the word, what petitioners in fact seek is nothing other than compensatory <em>damages </em>\u2014 monetary relief for all losses their plan sustained as a result of the alleged breach, of fiduciary duties. Money damages are, of course, the classic form of <em>legal </em>relief.\u201d 508 U.S. at 255, 113 S.Ct. 2063 (citing <em>Curtis v. Loether, </em>415 U.S. 189, 196, 94 S.Ct. 1005, 39 L.Ed.2d 260 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">The Defendants primarily rely on <em>Crosby v. Bowater, Inc. Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees of Great N\u2019em. Paper Inc. See </em>382 F.3d 587 (6th Cir.2004) (finding that because he requested monetary damages, not equitable relief, plaintiff did not have a justiciable claim under \u00a7 502(a)(3)). In <em>Crosby, </em>Mr. Crosby, an employee benefit plan participant who had opted to receive lump-sum cash payment for early retirement benefits brought a class action against the plan and the plan administrator on behalf of himself and similarly situated plan participants alleging that the administrator\u2019s use of a \u201cmortality discount for [the] period before normal retirement age\u201d caused partial forfeiture of his accrued benefit in violation of ERISA. 382 F.3d at 587. In Crosby\u2019s \u201cprayer for relief,\u201d he requested that the court order the defendants to do the following: (1) re-compute any and all lump sum benefits previously paid using the methodology followed in the recomputation of Mr. Crosby\u2019s lump ,sum retirement <em>without </em>using a mortality discount for the period before normal retirement age; and (2) pay all plan participants who previously received a lump sum distribution the difference between the amount so computed and the lump sum amount the participant received from the Plan, plus the pre-judgment and post-judgment interest on this amount; and requested that the court: (3) enjoin defendants from using a mortality discount when computing lump sum distributions from the Plan in the future; (4) order the defendants to pay reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs; (5) impose a constructive trust over the amount of plan assets necessary to pay the amounts determined; and (6) award any other equitable relief the Court deemed appropriate. <em>See id. </em>at 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">The Sixth Circuit, focusing its analysis on Mr. Crosby\u2019s claim for a \u201cconstructive trust,\u201d determined that the foregoing requested relief, though labeled as equitable, was substantively legal. <em>See Crosby, </em>382 F.3d at 595-96. The Sixth Circuit, however, found that, Mr. Crosby was not seeking to have a constructive trust imposed on assets wrongfully conveyed to a third party. <em>Id. </em>The Court reasoned that \u201cMr. Crosby [asked] for imposition of a constructive trust over sufficient assets to assure that his claim [would] be paid, thereby putting him in a better position than he would occupy as a general creditor. But Crosby has no basis for obtaining such a priority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">In this case, Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cPrayer for Relief\u2019 is structured almost identically to that in <em>Crosby. See id. </em>at 591-92; Complaint \u00b6 111. Also, like Mr. Crosby, Plaintiffs ask the Court to refund the difference between the artificially inflated price they paid for their Cardinal stock, and the price the stock price was <em>actually </em>worth. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the Court finds that, though Plaintiffs try to mask them requested relief as equitable, in truth, it is nothing more than \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d: monetary relief for the losses their plan sustained as a result of the alleged breach of fiduciary duties. The Court, therefore, GRANTS Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Counts I, II, and III brought under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3). All claims asserted under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(2), however, remain, and a discussion of these claims follows.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">C. Defendants\u2019 Various Motions to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"Azu\">All the named Defendants have either submitted or joined in a motion to dismiss <em>all </em>of the claims asserted against them. Because Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint does not identify specific Defendants allegedly liable for the alleged breaches, but contains more general allegations asserted against groups of Defendants (i.e. the \u201cDirector Defendants,\u201d or the \u201cCommittee Defendants\u201d), and because Plaintiff has submitted one omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to all but two of the pending motions,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the briefing is replete with overlapping issues and arguments. The Court, therefore, will discuss each claim for relief asserted against <em>each </em>group of Defendant(s). Moreover, where possible, the Court will address any arguments raised in opposition to multiple claims only once.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">1. Defendants\u2019 Fiduciary Obligations</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">With respect to Counts I \u2014 III generally, the following Plan documents set out the fiduciary obligations of the various players (if any) and echo the law established under ERISA discussed in Part IV.A., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">Under \u00a7 10.01, Cardinal is the sole named \u201cPlan Administrator.\u201d <em>See </em>App. Ex. A \u00a7 10.01; App. Ex. B \u00a7 10.01. Under \u00a7 10.02, the Cardinal Board of Directors has the duty to appoint the members of a Committee which will assist Cardinal in the administration of the Plan. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10.02. Accordingly, under \u00a7 8.02, Cardinal must provide the Committee with any information that it determines necessary for the proper administration of the Plan, and to the Trustee, Cardinal must provide any such facts as are deemed necessary for the Trustee to carry out its duties under the Plan. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-11\">Under \u00a7 10.01 Cardinal has sole discretion in appointing, removing and replacing the Trustee. Cardinal is a fiduciary to the Plan to the extent it exercises discretionary control and authority over these specific matters.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10.01. The duties of the Committee appointed by the Cardinal Board of Directors are laid out in \u00a7 10.05 of the Plan and include directing the Trustee \u201cwith respect to the crediting and distributing of the Trust,\u201d \u201cengag[ing] the service of an Investment Manager or Investment Managers ... each of whom shall have full power and authority to manage, acquire or dispose (or direct the Trustee with respect to acquisition or disposition) of any Plan asset under its control.\u201d \u00a7 10.05(D) &amp; (H). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-12\">Further, the Plan vests the Committee with additional obligations. Section 8.05 (\u201cInvestment Fund\u201d-) of the Plan states that the Committee, with the help of the Trustee, is to \u201c[ejstablish certain investment funds (the <em>\u201cInvestment Funds </em>\u201d), rules governing [their] administration ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>and procedures for directing the investment of Participant Accounts among the Investment Funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8.05. Also, under \u00a7 8.05, the Committee and Cardinal are afforded the \u201cright to change the investment options available under the Plan and the rules governing the designations at any time from time to time.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">The Trustee, is vested by \u00a7 10.01 as having \u201cthe sole responsibility for the administration of the Trust and the management of the assets held under the Trust as specifically provided in the Trust.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10.01. The Plan qualifies that responsibility in \u00a7 10.03, however, when the Committee may direct the Trustee with respect to the crediting and distribution of the Trust, and in \u00a7 10.01, which reads,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-5\">[e]ach fiduciary warrants that any directions given, information furnished, or action taken by it shall be in accordance with the provisions of this Plan and the Trust, authorizing or providing for any such direction, information or action. Furthermore, each fiduciary may rely upon any such direction, information or action of another fiduciary as being proper under this Plan and the Trust, and is not required- under this Plan or the Trust to inquiry into the propriety of any such direction, information or action. It is intended under the Plan and the \u2022 Trust that each fiduciary shall be responsible for the proper exercise of its own powers, duties, responsibilities and obligations under this Plan and the Trust and shall not be responsible for any act of another fiduciary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">The Master Trust Agreement, names Putnam Trust as the Plan\u2019s Trustee. Section 8 of the Plan discusses Cardinal\u2019s Trust Agreement with Putnam. <em>See </em>App. Ex. 1 \u00a7 8, App. Ex. 2 \u00a7 8. Section 8.05 of the Plan provides, in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-8\">The Committee and the Trustee shall establish certain investment funds (the <em>\u201cInvestment Funds </em>\u201d), rules governing the administration of the Investment Funds, and procedures for directing the investment of Participant Accounts among the Investment Funds. The Trustee shall invest and reinvest the principal and income of each Account in the Trust Fund as required by ERISA and as directed by Participant. The Committee and the Employer reserve the right to change the investment options available under- the Plan and the rules governing investment designations at any time and from time to time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-9\">The Trustee is authorized to maintain the <em>\u201cEmployer Common Stock Fund\u201d </em>as one of the Investment Funds ... In addition to the Employer Common Stock Fund, all or any portion of the remaining Trust Fund may consist of Shares. The Trustee may acquire or dispose of Shares as necessary to implement Participant directions and may net transactions within the Trust Fund ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-10\">Each Investment Fund (other than the Employer Common Stock Fund) shall be established by the Trustee at the direction or with the concurrence of the Committee ... The Trustee shall hold, manage, administer, invest, reinvest, account for and otherwise deal with the Trust Fund and each separate Investment Fund as Provided in the Trust Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-11\"><em>See id. </em>Further, Section 1 of the Master</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-12\">Trust Agreement reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALu\">1. <em>Trustee Responsibility. </em>The Trustee shall hold the assets of and collect the income and make payments from the Master Trust, all as hereinafter provided.'

The Trustee shall not be responsible for the investment or reinvestment of the assets of the Master Trust, which investment and reinvestment shall be the responsibility of the investment manager as delegated by the Administrator, as provided in Section 4 hereof, and if not so delegated, of the Administrator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\"><em>See </em>App. Ex. 4 at 2 \u00a7 1. Finally, Section 4.E. of the Service Agreement reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-6\">E. PLAN ASSETS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-7\">Putnam has no obligation to monitor, control or in any way exercise any powers or discretion in the handling or disposition of any Plan assets, including the disposition of any funds, securities or other assets under the Plan ... Trustee responsibilities are specified in the Trust.

Whether Plaintiffs Sufficiently Allege Defendants\u2019 Fiduciary Status</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-10\">Plaintiffs can only establish that the Defendants breached fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence if they <em>first </em>establish that each of the Defendants functioned as \u201cfiduciaries\u201d with respect to each of the Plaintiffs\u2019 various allegations. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A) (defining \u201cfunctional fiduciary\u201d). Defendants argue, however, that because none of the conduct on which Plaintiffs base their Complaint was carried out by Defendants in their performance of a fiduciary function, they cannot be held liable under ERISA. <em>See </em>Certain Defs.\u2019 Motion to Dismiss at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-11\">Defendants, relying on the foregoing Plan Documents, argue that because \u201cfiduciary status is not an all-or-nothing proposition under ERISA,\u201d where Defendant Cardinal, the Committee Defendants, and the Director Defendants exercised no discretion in selecting, communicating about, or monitoring the Plan assets, they were not Plan fiduciaries, and, therefore, are not liable. <em>Id. </em>Further, looking beyond the Plan Documents, Defendants argue that precedent establishes that \u201cwhen an ERISA plan names a corporation as a fiduciary, the officers who exercise discretion on behalf of that corporation are not fiduciaries within the meaning of [ERISA] section 3(21)(A)(iii), unless it can be shown that these officers have <em>individual </em>discretionary roles as to the plan administration.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Confer, </em>952 F.2d at 37 (emphasis in original)); <em>Croivley, </em>234 F.Supp.2d at 229 (dismissing complaint where directors exercised no discretion in selecting investment options, communicating with plan participants, or managing plan assets).</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-12\">Guided by its decision in <em>AEP </em>and ERISA\u2019s liberal definition of \u201cfiduciary,\u201d at this stage of the litigation, this Court declines to address Defendants\u2019 arguments that they are not fiduciaries. In <em>AEP, </em>this Court, faced with similar facts and an identical argument by defendants refused to dismiss that case. <em>See </em>327 F.Supp.2d 812. There, the plaintiffs, plan participants, sued defendants AEP, AEPSC (an AEP subsidiary and the alleged sponsor and named fiduciary of the Plan), and two directors of AEPSC under ERISA \u00a7\u00a7 502(a)(2) and (3). <em>Id. </em>Each of the <em>AEP </em>defendants argued that \u201cnone of the conduct complained of was done as a fiduciary, so there [could] be no liability.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 825. Further, they averred that \u201c[plaintiffs attempted] to create fiduciary status by relying on conclusory allegations, coupled with non-related ERISA conduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>or arguing that because the Plan Participants perceived [defendants] as [fiduciaries, they were].\u201d This Court found that, considering the liberal definition of an ERISA fiduciary, \u201cat this early stage of litigation, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations [were] sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">Consistent with its findings in <em>AEP, </em>in this case, this Court adheres to the view that fiduciary status is a \u201cfact-intensive inquiry, making the resolution of that issue inappropriate for a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>See AEP, </em>327 F.Supp.2d at 827; <em>Rankin v. Rots, </em>278 F.Supp.2d 853, 879 (E.D.Mich.2003) (\u201c[T]he manner in which each defendant, which are in the universe of possible decision makers, operated is for now something of a black box. To expect a plaintiff to be able to turn on the light and point to the particular individuals who exercised decision making authority is simply too much to require at this stage of the litigation.\u201d); <em>In re Elec.

Therefore, dismissal is not warranted on any count based on Defendants\u2019 arguments that Plaintiffs have failed to set forth facts establishing that each Defendant qualified as a Plan fiduciary.

Count I \u2014 Whether Defendant Cardinal, the Committee Defendants, the Director Defendants, and Defendant Putnam Breached their Fiduciary Duties of Loyalty and Prudence</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">In Count I, Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants breached the fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence imposed by ERISA by continuing to offer Cardinal stock as an investment alternative under the Plan despite the fact that knew that the Company\u2019s stock price was artificially inflated. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(l)(A)-(B). Count I specifies that, as fiduciaries, the Defendants were required to both investigate and monitor the Plan\u2019s investment, including its investment in Cardinal stock. Plaintiffs allege that, had Defendants done so, they would have discovered that Cardinal stock was no longer a good investment, and they would have been obligated to reassess the merits of allowing Plan participants to invest in it, eventually divesting the Plan of all of its Cardinal holdings. Count I also alleges that because Defendant Putnam knew that Cardinal had potential to be an imprudent investment, it was not entitled to follow the direction of the Plan fiduciaries to invest in Cardinal stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-9\">The Defendants counter that they had no discretion as to whether an investment in Cardinal stock should be offered to employees since the Plan documents advised Cardinal employees that one of their investment options was to invest in Cardinal stock.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> They contend that Plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>claims should be considered under the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard applicable to ERISA plans found to be exempt from the statute\u2019s diversification requirements,</p>\n<p id=\"AWKO\">a. The Applicability of the \u201cAbuse of Discretion\u201d Standard To This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">In this case, the Plan qualifies as an EIAP under ERISA \u00a7 407(d)(3). The Plan meets the requirements of' ERISA \u00a7 407(d)(3)(A)(i) because it is an individual account plan which is \u201ca profit sharing, stock bonus, thrift, or savings plan.\u201d It satisfies ERISA \u00a7 407(d)(3)(B) because Section 8.05 of the Plan document explicitly provides for acquisition and holding of qualifying employer securities.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>See supra </em>Part IV.A.l.a.iv. Before analyzing each Count of the Complaint, therefore, the Court first must determine whether the Plan is exempt from ERISA\u2019s diversification requirements and subject to the more lenient abuse of discretion standard, or whether, in the alternative, it should be analyzed under the traditional prudent person standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">Defendants argue that their decision to remain invested in Cardinal is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard and that the Court must presume that- a fiduciary\u2019s decision to remain invested in employer securities was reasonable. <em>See Kuper, </em>66 F.3d at 1459. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, assert that Defendants\u2019 argument is inapplicable to the instant case because it is an \u201cartificial inflation case,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> not a failure to diversify case.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Opposition at 5. Defendants counter, however, that because the abuse of discretion standard defines a middle path, which reconciles plan fiduciaries\u2019 sometimes contradictory duties, the abuse of discretion standard applies regardless of Plaintiffs\u2019 decision to label their claim an \u201cartificial inflation\u201d claim. Certain Defs.\u2019 Reply at 2-3. Further, they contend that <em>all </em>EIAPs, whether ESOPs or not, are treated the same for the purpose of a fiduciary duty analysis, urging this Court to conclude that all EIAPs are designed primarily for acquisition and holding of qualifying employer securities and not for the primary purpose of providing employee pension benefits. <em>See id. </em>at 3-4. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">Relying on <em>Kuper\u2019s </em>finding that employer stock plans are \u201cnot designed to guarantee retirement benefits and [that] they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>place employee retirement assets at a much greater risk than they typical diversified ERISA plan,\u201d Defendants argue that the <em>Kuper </em>abuse of discretion standard<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> applies to <em>all </em>EIAPs. <em>Kuper, </em>66 F.3d at 1457 (referencing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(2) (creating an exception to the diversification requirement (and the prudence requirement to the extent it requires diversification) for EIAPS that invest in employer stock)). They contend that, without a more deferential standard of review, the risks to EIAP fiduciaries would be intolerable; plans that expressly required the holding of company stock would become unworkable and would cease to exist, contrary to Congress\u2019 goal of encouraging employee ownership of company stock. <em>See, e.g., Steinman v. Hicks, </em>352 F.3d 1101, 1105 (7th Cir.2003) (\u201cIf ESOPs had to be diversified they would fail in their purpose of encouraging employees\u2019 ownership of their employer stock.\u201d). Moreover, Defendants argue that the <em>Kuper </em>considerations are applicable whenever a plan provides for investment in a company stock and a plaintiff claims an EIAP fiduciary should have departed from the plan\u2019s term, a situation identical to the one in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">To support their assertions, Defendants reference a number of cases, arguing that all of them unequivocally declared that EIAPs and ESOPs are exempt from ERISA\u2019s diversification requirement. <em>See In re Calpine Corp. ERISA Litig., </em>2005 WL 1431506, at *4-5 (N.D.Cal.

In <em>LaLonde, </em>plaintiffs, participants in Tex-tron\u2019s ESOP plan, claimed that Textron and the executives who had administered the company\u2019s plan, breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA by continuing to direct 50% of the employer contributions and 100% of employer matching contributions in Textron stock when they knew, or had reason to know, that Textron faced troubles that were certain to cause a decline in the value of its stock. <em>See id. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged, among other things, that Textron had artificially inflated the price of its stock by concealing the company\u2019s internal problems that eventually led to both lost earnings and a shareholder securities action. <em>Id. </em>The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and the court of appeals reversed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">The appellate court held that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Textron had artificially inflated its stock price by concealing the company\u2019s problems and their adverse effect on its financial state satisfied both Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) and the notice requirement under <em>Conley. See </em>355 U.S. at 47, 78 S.Ct. 99. 369 F.3d at 3. With respect to the application of the <em>Moench, Kuper, </em>and <em>Wright </em>cases, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-9\">[bjecause the important and complex area of law implicated by plaintiffs\u2019 claims is neither mature nor uniform ... we believe that we would run a very high risk of error were we to lay down a hard-and-fast rule ... based only on the statute\u2019s text and history, the sparse pleadings, and the few and discordant judicial decisions discussing the issue we face. Under the circumstances, further record development \u2014 and particularly input from those with expertise in the arcane area of the law where ERISA\u2019s ESOP provisions intersect with its fiduciary duty requirements \u2014 seems to us essential to a reasoned elaboration of what constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty in this context.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1073-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-11\">Recently, the <em>JDS </em>court adopted the above reasoning, denying defendants\u2019 mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>tion to dismiss in a factually similar situation. <em>See JDS, </em>2005 WL 1662131, at *8. The court explained that it found <em>La-londe\u2019s </em>reasoning persuasive and held that \u201c[wjhether on a full development of the record the evidence will sustain plaintiffs\u2019 allegations remains to be seen, but on this motion to dismiss we must accept the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint as true.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">Applying the reasoning in <em>Lalonde </em>and <em>JDS </em>to the instant case, the Court will examine whether fiduciaries have breached their duties under the prudent person standard and the liberal notice pleading requirements.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Moreover, in so holding, like the courts in <em>LaLonde </em>and <em>JDS, </em>this Court abstains from deciding whether <em>all </em>EIAPs are subject to a lower intermediate prudence requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-9\">b. Whether Plaintiffs Have Stated a Claim Under the \u201cPrudent Person\u201d Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-10\">Other than arguing that the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim fails because Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendants abused their discretion in offering Cardinal Stock as an investment alternative, Defendants have not provided any other arguments for why Count I of Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint should be dismissed as to Defendant Cardinal or the Committee Defendants. Defendants do provide additional arguments for why Count I fails to state a claim against the Director Defendants and Defendant Putnam. The Court will now consider the merits of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>First, Defendants argue that the Complaint fails to allege that the Director Defendants breached their duties of prudence because they did not function as fiduciaries with respect to \u201cselecting investments and communicating with participants.\u201d <em>See </em>Certain Defs.\u2019 Motion to Dismiss at 32. Because this Court has already established that, under <em>AEP, </em>it will not decide a defendant\u2019s fiduciary status on a motion to dismiss, Defendants\u2019 arguments are irrelevant. <em>See </em>327 F.Supp.2d at 825-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">Second, in their Motion to Dismiss, Defendant Putnam argues that, as a \u201cDirected Trustee,\u201d it is subject to a different standard from a traditional Plan fiduciary and that Plaintiffs have not stated a claim against Putnam under this standard. The Court will now consider Defendant Putnam\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">In Count I, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Putnam was a fiduciary of the Plan and that, \u201c[ujnder the Plan, the Trust Agreement, and ERISA, Defendant Putnam was obligated to prevent or preclude Plan investment in Cardinal Health common stock while Cardinal Health common stock was not a prudent investment.\u201d <em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 77-91. Defendant Putnam, counters that, according to the language of the Plan Documents, it was a \u201cdirected trustee,\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and, as such, had no fiduciary duty related to \u201cpurchasing and holding Cardinal stock and allowing Plan participants to buy and hold interests in the Stock Fund through their Plan accounts.\u201d Putnam\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 8. Consequently, before determining whether to grant Defendant Putnam\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, the Court must determine whether Putnam qualifies as a Plan \u201cfiduciary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">A party\u2019s duties as a \u201cdirected trustee\u201d are prescribed by ERISA \u00a7 403(a), which provides in pertinent part: [A]ll assets of an employee benefit plan shall be held in trust by one or more trustees ... [T]he trustee ... shall have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the assets of the plan, except to the extent that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-10\">(1) the plan expressly provides that the trustee ... [is] subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee, in which case the <em>trustees shall be subject to proper directions of </em>such fiduciary which are made in accordance with the terms of the plan and <em>which are not contrary to this chapter ...</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-11\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(a) (emphasis added). It follows, therefore, that a party\u2019s status as a \u201ctrustee,\u201d directed or otherwise, must be determined by reference to the Plan, the Trust Agreements, and the Service Agreements. <em>See DiFelice, </em>397 F.Supp.2d at 744-45; <em>Beddall v. State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>137 F.3d 12, 19-21 (1st Cir.1998) (\u201cThe starting point for a reasoned analysis of the Bank\u2019s fiduciary status is the Agreement.\u201d); <em>Coleman v. Nationwide Life Ins. Co., </em>969 F.2d 54, 61 (4th Cir.1992) (\u201cThe discretionary authority or responsibility which is pivotal to the statutory definition of \u2018fiduciary\u2019 is allocated by the plan documents themselves.\u201d).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>The Court finds that, read together, the Plan, the Trust Agreement, and the Service Agreements provide evidence that Defendant Putnam is a \u201cdirected trustee\u201d with respect to decisions to include a given instrument option in the Plan. Thus, Section 8.05 of the Plan provides that the Plan Committee is a \u201cnamed fiduciary\u201d and that only the Committee has the authority to select the various investment options from which the participants may choose. While Section 1 of the Trust Agreement grants Putnam certain powers to effectuate investment decisions, these powers are expressly made subject to both the Plan and the Trust' Agreement, providing that Putnam exercise its powers <em>only </em>at the direction of the Committee or the Plan participants. <em>See </em>App. Ex. 4 \u00a7 6 (emphasis added). Specifically, the Trust Agreement provides that the Committee shall direct Defendant Putnam to invest in investment funds of Cardinal\u2019s choosing and that Putnam \u201cshall not be responsible for the investment manager as delegated by the Administrator as provided in Section 4 hereof, and if not so delegated, of the Administrator.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1. Clearly, with respect to the selection of Plan investment options, Defendant Putnam is bound by the terms of the Trust Agreement to follow the Committee\u2019s directions Committee and is, therefore, a \u201cdirected trustee\u201d within the meaning of ERISA \u00a7 403(a). Significantly, other courts presented with essentially similar plans, trust agreements, and service agreements have reached the same conclusion. <em>See, e.g., Beddall, </em>137 F.3d at 19-21 (finding a directed trustee relationship when the plan vested authority in a named fiduciary to direct the trustee); <em>Worldcom, </em>354 F.Supp.2d at 441-43 (same); <em>Koch v. Dwyer, </em>1999 WL 528181, at *6-10, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11101, at *21-32 (S.D.N.Y. July 22, 1999) (same); <em>DiFelice, </em>397 F.Supp.2d at 744-748 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">Plaintiff, in contrast, argues that when Section 8.05 of the Plan states that, \u201c[t]he Committee and the Trustee shall establish <em>certain </em>investment funds,\u201d the use of the word \u201ccertain\u201d does not necessarily refer to \u201ca fund invested primarily or exclusively in Cardinal Health common stock.\u201d PL\u2019s Opposition at 4. Further, Plaintiffs contend that when the Plan says that the \u201cTrustee is <em>authorized </em>to maintain\u201d the Fund, instead of that the \u201cTrustee is <em>required </em>by the Plan\u201d to maintain the Fund, it is clear that Defendant Putnam \u201chad discretion to maintain the Fund as long as it deemed the fund prudent, and had the authority to terminate the Fund when it became imprudent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">Nonetheless, Plaintiffs arguments fail. Plaintiffs place far more weight on \u00a7 8.05 of the Plan than the provision can bear, and, as such, attempt to infer a broad grant of discretionary investment authority from a few arguably \u201cambiguous\u201d terms. Further, Plaintiffs base their conclusions on a single clause \u2014 \u201c[t]he Committee and the Trustee shall establish <em>certain </em>investment funds.\u201d <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Ex. A. \u00a7 8.05; Defs.\u2019 Ex. B \u00a7 8.05. Their reliance on this language omits other relevant language which both reflects the purely procedural nature of this authority and makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>clear that ultimate discretion resides with someone other than Putnam.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">In sum, the Plan, the Trust Agreement, and the Service Agreement,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> taken together, make clear that Putnam is, in common parlance, a \u201cdirected trustee\u201d subject to the directions of the Committee in regards to the selection of investment options for the Plan. This conclusion does not, of course, end the analysis; instead, it begs the further question presented by Defendant Putnam\u2019s dismissal motion, i.e., whether Defendant Putnam, as a directed trustee, had a duty to challenge or remove Cardinal stock as one of the Plan participants\u2019 investment choices because it was artificially inflated by Cardinal\u2019s accounting misstatements. If Defendant Putnam had no such duty to act, it cannot be held liable for failing to act in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">Defendant Putnam\u2019s duties as a \u201cdirected trustee\u201d are prescribed by ERISA \u00a7 403(a), which provides that where a trustee is \u201csubject to the direction of a named fiduciary,\u201d then it must comply with the \u201cproper directions\u201d of such trustee which are made in accordance with the plan and which are not contrary to ERISA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103(a). Further, because Defendant Putnam must comply with all the Committee\u2019s directions that are proper and not contrary to the Plan or ERISA, it follows that Defendant Putnam\u2019s liability is limited to instances in which it either fails to follow such proper direction or complies with directions that are contrary to either the Plan or ERISA. Just as there can be no liability for a breach of duty where no duty exists, nor can Defendant Putnam incur liability for following the Committee\u2019s directions when they are proper and consistent with both the Plan and ERISA. Indeed, Defendant Putnam had no discretion to do otherwise. More particularly, the application of Section 403(a) in this case means that if the Committee\u2019s continuing direction to retain the Cardinal Stock Fund as a Plan investment option was proper and not contrary to the Plan or ERISA, then Defendant Putnam was bound to follow that direction and may incur no liability for having done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-10\">According to <em>DiFelice, </em>a recent case discussing a directed trustee\u2019s fiduciary duties under the defendant company\u2019s Stock Fund plan, \u201c[t]he question of whether ... direction was \u2018proper\u2019 and not contrary to ERISA or the Plan is essentially a question of statutory interpretation requiring a sharp focus on ERISA \u00a7 403(a)\u2019s plain language, as well as its structure and purpose.\u201d <em>See </em>397 F.Supp.2d at 747-48.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> This Court fully embraces the <em>DiFelice </em>analysis agreeing that, despite the many different definitions of \u201cproper,\u201d \u201cit seems clear that Congress, by requiring directions to be \u2018proper,\u2019 intended only to require that a direction from a named fiduciary conform to general formalities that identify a direction as valid or genuine,\u201d and that \u201c[b]y requiring directions to be \u2018proper\u2019 in this sense, Congress meant to exclude from \u00a7 403(a) any communications from the named fiduciary that did not meet certain formal requirements, including that a direction be clear ... and unequivocal and that it issue from a person or entity with authority to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing The Am. Heritage College Dictio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>nary 1096 (3d ed.1993) (defining \u201cproper\u201d as \u201ccalled for by rules or- conventions\u201d)).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> In this case, the Committee\u2019s direction to include the -Stock Fund as a Plan investment option was \u201cproper,\u201d and there is no contention to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">Still remaining is the question of whether this continuing direction was \u201ccontrary\u201d to the Plan or ERISA, or put differently, whether, in light of Cardinal\u2019s falling stock price, Defendant Putnam was obligated through its duty of prudence to countermand the Committee\u2019s direction and remove the Cardinal Stock Fund as a Plan investment option, and whether failing to do so violated the Plan and ERISA. In <em>DiFelice, </em>the court found that the answer \u201clies in whether \u00a7 403(a) should be read as imposing on directed trustees an implicit duty of ordinary care and prudence to second guess the wisdom of the named fiduciary\u2019s directions as to Plan investment options.\u201d <em>See </em>397 F.Supp.2d at 748. The court determined that \u201cproperly read, \u00a7 403(a) includes no such implicit duty of prudence,\u201d and that \u201c[t]o conclude otherwise would effectively eviscerate \u00a7 403(a) by eliminating any distinction between the duty of a directed trustee under \u00a7 403(a) and the duty of the ERISA named fiduciary with investment authority, who has the duty of ordinary care and prudence prescribed by \u00a7 404(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">The <em>DiFelice </em>court\u2019s interpretation also relies upon the DOL\u2019s recent Field Assistance Bulletin<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> discussing a directed trustee\u2019s duty under ERISA \u00a7 403(a)(1) when instructed to invest in publicly traded stock issued by the plan sponsor. <em>See </em>Field Assistance Bulletin No. 2004-03, dated December 17, 2004 (\u201cFAB\u201d).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The FAB addresses two scenarios: where a directed trustee possesses material, nonpublic information about the sponsor, and where its only information is public. Where a directed trustee possesses \u201cmaterial non-public information that is necessary for a prudent decision,\u201d it has a duty to inquire whether the named fiduciary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>knows of and has considered such information. <em>See </em>FAB at 4.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Further, though according to the DOL, directed trustees rarely have an obligation under ERISA to act on public information, \u201cin limited, extraordinary circumstances, where there are clear and compelling public indicators, as evidenced by and 8-K filing with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), a bankruptcy filing or similar public indicator, that call into serious question a company\u2019s viability as a going concern, the directed trustee may have a duty <em>not </em>to follow the named fiduciary\u2019s instruction without further inquiry.\u201d FAB at 6 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">Plaintiffs, on the other hand, do not cite <em>DiFelice </em>in their Opposition. Instead, Plaintiffs rely heavily on <em>Worldcom, AOL, </em>and <em>In re Sprint Corp. ERISA Litig. See </em>263 F.Supp.2d 745, 2005 WL 563166, at *1, 388 F.Supp.2d 1207 (D.Kan.2004). They contend that because the courts in those cases denied directed trustees\u2019 motion to dismiss in similar situations, this Court should follow suit. <em>See </em>PL\u2019s Opposition at 6-7. These cases are distinguishable from the ease sub judice. First, both the <em>Worldcom </em>decision and the <em>Sprint </em>decision were issued \u201cprior to the [drafting of the] FAB and thus did not consider the [DOL]\u2019s -views as to directed trustees,\u201d making them less reliable than the more recent <em>DiFelice </em>decision. <em>See </em>263 F.Supp.2d at 762, 388 F.Supp.2d at 1207. Second, the <em>AOL </em>decision, differs from the instant case in that, while Putnam vehemently argues that it is <em>not </em>a fiduciary, Fidelity, AOL\u2019s directed trustee, actually <em>concedes </em>its fiduciary status.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> <em>See </em>2005 WL 563166, at *7 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-11\">Considering the high threshold set by the FAB and <em>DiFelice </em>as to when a directed trustee must take some action, the Plaintiffs simply do not meet the requirements here. The first prong of the FAB analysis does not apply because there is no allegation that Putnam possessed any material, non-public information about Cardinal, least of all information that would be necessary for a \u201cprudent\u201d decision. Nor is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>the second test met. The Complaint makes no allegation of any clear and compelling public indicator calling into serious question Cardinal\u2019s viability as a going concern. The only public information of any type cited in the Complaint is the October 27, 2004 Fitch Report. <em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6 85. This report, however, is insufficient to trigger a duty under the FAB, which expressly states that a directed trustee\u2019s duty is only triggered by public indicators similar to the issuer\u2019s own 8-K filing with the SEC or its bankruptcy filing \u2014 statements .by the Company itself, and not outsiders\u2019 opinions. In fact, the FAB expressly states that no duty is triggered by analyses about corporate affairs or prospects.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> <em>See </em>FAB at 6 n. 5 (\u201c[a] directed trustee\u2019s actual knowledge of media or other public reports or analyses ... does not, in and of itself, constitute knowledge of clear and compelling evidence\u201d); <em>see also WorldCom, </em>263 F.Supp.2d 745 (\u201cAnalyst recommendations to sell World-Com securities do not represent reliable information regarding the company\u2019s viability.\u201d).<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">Those publicly filed statements by the Company that are to be considered under the DOL\u2019s guidance, the SEC filings, do not show that Cardinal was in danger of imminent collapse. The annual statement for the period ending June 30, 2004 shows that since 2000, Cardinal reported increasing year-over-year revenue, earnings and assets. <em>See </em>App. Ex. J at 26-27. Moreover, Cardinal reported positive earnings through the end of Putnam\u2019s tenure as Trustee in December 2004. <em>See id. </em>at 26. As to cash on hand, a reflection of a company\u2019s liquidity, Cardinal reported an increase from $544 million on December 31, 2003 to $1.27 billion on December 31, 2004. <em>See </em>Cardinal App. Ex. I at 5. These public indicators do not call into serious question Cardinal\u2019s viability as a going concern; indeed, they actually negate any inference of Cardinal\u2019s imminent collapse. Consequently, Section 403(a)\u2019s text and context, the DOL\u2019s FAB, and the <em>DiFelice </em>decision all point to the conclusion that the information available to Putnam was insufficient to have triggered a duty to object to the direction to continue to include the Cardinal Stock Fund as an investment option in the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">As a directed trustee, Defendant Putnam\u2019s primary duty was to follow the directions of the named fiduciary and of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>plan participants, except in extraordinary circumstances not alleged in the Complaint. As an active fund manager, however, Defendant Putnam must decrease its holdings each time it thinks the odds the stock price will decline are greater than the chances the stock price will increase. \u201cTo conflate these two roles is to misunderstand [Defendant Putnam\u2019s] role as a directed trustee and to require [Putnam] to assume responsibilities it was not paid for and had not accepted.\u201d <em>See DiFelice, </em>397 F.Supp.2d at 757. Consequently, the Court GRANTS Defendant Putnam\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">4. Count II \u2014 Whether Defendant Cardinal, the Committee Defendants, and the Director Defendants Breached Their Fiduciary Duties by Making Material Misrepresentations and/or by Failing to Disclose Material Information</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">As discussed above, in Count II, Plaintiffs assert that <em>all </em>Defendants except Putnam breached a fiduciary duty under ERISA \u00a7 404 by negligently misrepresenting and failing to disclose material information to Plan participants and by providing Plaintiffs with SPDs that omitted undisclosed materially adverse information. <em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 92-101. In response, Defendants contend that the allegations in the Complaint are too general to put any Defendant on notice of how he or she may have been acting in a fiduciary capacity or in what way he had purportedly breached his fiduciary duty. <em>See </em>Certain Defs.\u2019 Motion to Dismiss at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">It is well-settled that \u201ca fiduciary may not materially mislead those to whom the duties of loyalty and prudence described in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104 are owed.\u201d <em>See AEP, </em>327 F.Supp.2d at 831 (referencing <em>Berlin, </em>858 F.2d at 1163). To establish a claim for breach of fiduciary duty based on alleged misrepresentations, a plaintiff must show that: (1) defendant was acting in a fiduciary capacity when it made the challenged statements; (2) the statements constituted material misrepresentations; and (3) plaintiff relied on them to his/her detriment. <em>See id. </em>at 832 (citing <em>Pirelli, </em>305 F.3d at 449). Other courts have also deemed it unlawful for a fiduciary to mis-eommunicate affirmatively or to mislead plan participants about material matters regarding the plan. <em>See id. </em>at 831; <em>see, e.g. Enron, </em>284 F.Supp.2d at 555. Furthermore, in <em>Unisys </em>the court held that \u201can ERISA fiduciary has a duty under section 1104(a) to convey complete and accurate information when it speaks to participants and beneficiaries regarding plan benefits.\u201d <em>See </em>74 F.3d at 441. Subsequently, too, the Sixth Circuit stated, in <em>Pirelli, </em>that \u201cwith respect to the situation presented when an employer on its own initiative disseminates false and misleading information about a benefit plan, the position of the Sixth Circuit is aligned with that of the Third Circuit in <em>Unisys.\u201d See AEP, </em>327 F.Supp.2d at 831 (citing <em>Pirelli, </em>305 F.3d at 455).</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">Defendants argue that Count II should be dismissed because, by relying on the fraud on the market (the \u201cFOTM\u201d) theory, which courts only recognize in securities fraud cases, Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently plead proximate causation (also called \u201closs causation\u201d),<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and because Plaintiffs have pled no facts to support the conclusory assertion that any of the Committee Defendants \u201cshould have known\u201d that other unidentified people made mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>takes in Cardinal\u2019s SEC filings. <em>See </em>Certain Defs.\u2019 Motion to Dismiss at 21-25.</p>\n<p id=\"Aiu\">a. Loss Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">The Court will first consider Defendants\u2019 arguments on the subject of \u201closs causation.\u201d Defendants offer that to state an ERISA claim based on a misrepresentation, a plaintiff must plead that he suffered actual damages caused by the defendant\u2019s fiduciary breach, and must show a \u201ccausal link\u201d between the alleged breach and the harm suffered. <em>See id.; Kuper, </em>66 F.3d at 1459-60 (\u201cProof [of] a causal connection ... is required between a breach of fiduciary duty and the loss alleged\u201d; finding that a fiduciary\u2019s failure to investigate an investment decision is <em>not </em>a sufficient causal link to the harm suffered by the plan). They assert that, where, as here, a plaintiffs alleged damages flow from investing in a publicly-traded stock, <em>Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo </em>instructs that merely asserting that a stock\u2019s price was \u201cartificially inflated\u201d at the time of the plaintiffs purchase is not adequate to allege that a misstatement caused loss to the plaintiff. <em>See id.; </em>544 U.S. 336, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 1630-31, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005). Plaintiffs counter that Defendants\u2019 \u201centire argument is based on the flawed premise that ... <em>Dura </em>applies in the ERISA context.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Opposition at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">The threshold inquiry is the applicability of <em>Dura. See </em>544 U.S. 336, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577. In <em>Dura, </em>plaintiffs represented a class of individuals who had bought stock in Dura Pharmaceuticals on the public market between April 15, 1997 and February 24, 1998. <em>Id. </em>at 1629. The plaintiffs alleged that, during the class period, Dura (or its officials) made false statements concerning its profits and prospects for future approval of its products by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). <em>See id. </em>at 1627. On February 24, 1998, Dura disclosed to the market that its earnings would be slower than previously expected (principally due to slow drug sales), and Dura\u2019s stock shares lost almost half of their value, falling from $39 per share to $21 per share. <em>Id. </em>at 1630. Later, in November 1998, Dura announced that the FDA had decided <em>not </em>to approve its new product, prompting even more of a drop in the Company\u2019s stock price. <em>See id. </em>The <em>Dura </em>plaintiffs argued that, \u201c[i]n reliance on the integrity of the market, [they] ... paid artificially inflated prices for Dura securities and ... suffered damage[s] thereby.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">The Supreme Court concluded that this interpretation of loss causation, if applied, would do more harm than good. <em>Id. </em>at 1631. The Court reasoned that \u201cat the moment the transaction takes place,\u201d the plaintiff must have suffered a loss to be able to establish loss causation in a securities fraud causation claim. <em>Id. </em>The most that can be said is that a higher purchase price can <em>sometimes </em>contribute to bringing about a future loss. <em>Id. </em>at 1632 (emphasis added). Thus, <em>Dura </em>held that a plaintiff who merely alleges that a stock\u2019s inflated purchase price caused his loss will not withstand the PSLRA\u2019s pleading requirements. <em>Id. </em>The Court noted that, \u201c[t]o \u2018touch upon\u2019 a loss is not to <em>cause </em>a loss, and it is the latter that the law requires.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(4)). The Court concluded, \u201cit should not prove burdensome for a plaintiff who has suffered an economic loss to provide a defendant with some indication of the loss and [the] causal connection that the plaintiff has in mind. At the same time, allowing a plaintiff to forgo giving any indication of the economic loss and proximate cause that the plaintiff has in mind would bring about\u201d the strike suits the statutes seek to avoid. <em>See id. </em>at 1634.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>Plaintiffs argue that the <em>Dura loss </em>causation rules do not apply here because \u201cbreach of fiduciary duty claims under ERISA are based on the law of trusts, not common law fraud.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Opposition at 17; <em>see, e.g. Varity Corp., </em>516 U.S. at 496, 116 S.Ct. 1065. They assert that not only do pleadings rules based on the law of fraud \u201cnot translate well into the ERISA context\u201d but also that Defendants \u201cfail to cite any authority for the proposition that <em>Dura </em>applies in an ERISA case.\u201d <em>See </em>Pi\u2019s Opposition at 17. Defendants, however, contend that \u201c[i]t does not matter that <em>Dura </em>involved securities claims as opposed to claims under ERISA, because, to recover under ERISA just as under the securities laws, a plaintiff still must plead and prove the fundamental element of proximate causation ... Did the defendant\u2019s alleged nondisclosure proximately cause the actual loss to the plaintiff?\u201d <em>See </em>Certain Defs.\u2019 Motion to Dismiss at 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">Tellingly, Defendants fail to cite any authority that <em>Dura </em>applies in an ERISA case or to provide any authority for the proposition that federal courts have applied similar reasoning in dismissing ERISA claims on causation grounds\u2019 hold nothing of the sort. For instance, many of the decisions upon which Defendants rely were decided on summary judgment motions; therefore, the courts had a more developed record on which to base their decisions than they would have had on a motion to dismiss. <em>See Kuper, </em>66 F.3d at 1459; <em>Henry v. Champlain Enterps., </em>288 F.Supp.2d 202, 230-32 (N.D.N.Y.2003); <em>Kemmerer v. ICI Americas Inc., </em>70 F.3d 281, 290-91 (3d Cir.1995); <em>Armstrong v. Amsted Indus.

United Indep. Union Welfare Fund </em>and <em>Lewis v. Her-mann, </em>two other cases on which Defendants rely, are easily distinguished from the case sub judice. <em>See </em>1997 WL 411208 (E.D.Pa. July 22, 1997); 775 F.Supp. 1137 (N.D.Ill.1991). First, unlike the present case, in <em>Kane, </em>the plaintiffs complaint conceded that there was no present injury to the fund, and pled only that there was a possibility of future injuries. 1997 WL 411208, at *2. Second, while the Court in <em>Lewis v. Hermann </em>did apply the securities law \u201closs causation\u201d standard to an ERISA claim, the court pointedly noted that, while Defendants had <em>failed </em>to cite any \u201cauthority that loss causation is an essential element\u201d of an ERISA claim, the plaintiff \u201ceffectively conceded\u201d that it was, and accordingly, the court was willing to apply it as well. 775 F.Supp. at 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">In addition to the lack of applicable precedent supporting Defendants\u2019 position, the Court finds that pleadings rules based on the law of fraud do not translate well into the ERISA context. <em>See, e.g. Rankin, </em>278 F.Supp.2d at 865-66 (differences between fraud and breaches of fiduciary duty actions create lesser pleading standard for latter type of case). Though Defendants correctly rely on <em>In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. ERISA Litig. </em>as dismissing a plaintiffs ERISA pleading based in part on a theory that, by virtue of the securities laws, there was \u201cno lawful action that could have been taken by the fiduciaries that would have avoided the subsequent loss occurring after public disclosure of the accounting problem\u201d alleged by the plaintiffs, since then, other courts have discredited similar theories. 2002 WL 31431588, at *8 (N.D.Cal. Sept.30, 2002); <em>see Gee v. UnumProvident Corp., </em>2005 WL 534873, at *12 (E.D.Tenn.

Further, though the defendants in <em>AEP </em>argued that they had no duty to investigate these SEC filings, this Court explained that, \u201conce one who is acting in a fiduciary capacity endeavors to discuss the plan, he may \u2018not affirmatively miscommunicate or mislead plan participants about material matters regarding their ERISA plan.\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>327 F.Supp.2d at 832 (citing <em>In re Xcel Energy, Inc., Secs., Derivative, &amp; \u201cERISA\u201d Litig., </em>312 F.Supp.2d 1165, 1176 (D.Minn.2004)).

In effect, Defendants imply that the \u201cfraud on the market\u201d (\u201cFOTM\u201d) presumption does not apply in the context of an ERISA action.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>' Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that in these types of non-disclosure cases, the FOTM theory applies, allowing Plaintiffs to depend on the integrity of the market in relying on Defendants to prudently invest in the Plan on their behalf. Further, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have not cited any precedent that considers \u201cactual reliance\u201d to be an ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(2) pleading requirement, and that, in <em>AEP, </em>this Court denied Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss in an almost identical situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">To date, no appellate courts have declared that the FOTM theory applies outside the context of securities fraud.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Further, in <em>AEP, </em>this Court determined that plaintiffs had adequately pled reliance without ruling on the applicability of FOTM theory to ERISA. <em>See </em>327 F.Supp.2d at 833: In <em>AEP, </em>the language the plaintiffs used to plead reliance was identical to that used by Plaintiffs in the instant case. <em>Id.; </em>Complaint \u00b6 26 (emphasis added) (stating: \u201c[t]he Plan, and the Participants acting on behalf of the Plan, relied upon, <em>and are presumed to have relied upon, </em>Defendants\u2019 representations and nondisclosures to their detriment\u201d). In <em>AEP, </em>this Court held that, under Rule 8, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint sufficiently pled reliance, especially where other courts have found such allegations sufficient under even Rule 9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading requirements. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>FRC Int'l Inc. v. Taifun Feuerloschgeratebau und Vertriebs GmbH, </em>2002 WL 31086104, *12 (N.D.Ohio Sept.4, 2002) (unpublished) (allegation that \u201cPlaintiff justifiably and actually did rely upon defendants\u2019 misrepresentations of fact, and defendants\u2019 concealment and omissions of fact\u201d was sufficient to prevent dismissal of RICO claim)). Accordingly, as it did in AEP, in the case sub judice, the Court declines to decide whether the FOTM presumption applies in an ERISA context, and finds that the issue of reliance is more amenable to resolution on a motion for summary judgment or at trial, after discovery has developed a complete evi-dentiary record. Plaintiffs have, therefore, pled reliance adequately to withstand Defendants\u2019 various motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>5. Count III \u2014 Whether Plaintiffs Have Sufficiently Alleged that Defendant Cardinal, the Committee Defendants, and the Director Defendants Breached Their Fiduciary Duties to Monitor</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">As for Count III, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding failure to monitor, which Defendants profess are insufficient, Plaintiffs aver in Complaint \u00b6 104, <em>inter alia, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1087-6\">Director Defendants had a fiduciary-duty to appoint as members of the Plan Committee persons with sufficient education, knowledge and experience to inform themselves as necessary to perform their duties as Plan Committee members, including the duty to evaluate the merits of investment options under the Plan, and had an ongoing fiduciary duty to ensure that the persons appointed to the Plan Committee were fully informed and performing their duties properly with respect to the selection of investment options under the Plan and the investment of the assets of the Plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">Complaint \u00b6 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">This Court acknowledges that the ERISA statutory scheme imposes upon fiduciaries a duty to monitor when they appoint other individuals to make decisions about the plan. <em>Id. </em>In fact, according to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2509.75-8: \u201c[a]t reasonable intervals the performance of trustees and other fiduciaries should be reviewed by the appointing fiduciary in such manner as may be reasonably expected to ensure that their performance has been in compliance with the terms of the plan and statutory standards, and satisfied the needs of the plan.\u201d Further, many courts have recognized the duty. <em>See, e.g. AEP, </em>327 F.Supp.2d at 832; <em>Xcel Energy, </em>312 F.Supp.2d at 1176 (\u201cA person with discretionary authority to appoint, maintain and remove plan fiduciaries is himself deemed a fiduciary with respect to the exercise of that authority. Implicit in the fiduciary duties attaching to persons empowered to appoint and remove plan fiduciaries is the duty to monitor appointees.\u201d) <em>Elec. Data Sys., </em>305 F.Supp.2d at 670 (\u201cERISA law imposes a duty to monitor appointees on fiduciaries with appointment power.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-10\">\u25a0 In <em>AEP, </em>considering almost identical allegations, this Court reasoned, that \u201c[w]here the duty to monitor is irrefutable, and this litigation is still in its infancy, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are sufficient to meet the requirements of Rule 8(a), especially where further factual development cannot occur without discovery.\u201d <em>See </em>327 F.Supp.2d at 832-33; <em>see also CMS Energy, </em>312 F.Supp.2d at 916-17 (considering arguments by the defendants that the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim for duty to monitor, but deciding, \u201c[b]y virtue of the status of [the] litigation, development of what fiduciary duties were delegated by defendants has not occurred,\u201d and thereby concluding that dismissal was not warranted). The same reasoning applies in this case, and the Court DENIES Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Count III as to the Committee Defendants, and the Director Defendants. Because Plaintiffs also apply the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>specifically to argue that Cardinal Defendants are liable for a failure to monitor through the Director Defendants\u2019 alleged breaches, the Court must independently examine the allegations that Cardinal Defendant failed to monitor the Plan\u2019s investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-11\">a. Cardinal Defendant-Whether Cardinal May Be Liable for the Director Defendants\u2019 Actions Under <em>Respon-deat Superior</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-12\">Plaintiffs invoke the doctrine of <em>respon-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number><em>deat </em>superior<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> in Count III to argue that Cardinal is liable for the Director Defendants\u2019 alleged failure to monitor the Committee. <em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6 109.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Defendants argue, however, that Cardinal cannot be liable for the Directors\u2019 failure to monitor under the doctrine of <em>respon-deat superior </em>because \u201cthere is no <em>re-spondeat superior </em>liability under ERISA.\u201d Certain Defs.\u2019 Motion to Dismiss at 38. On the other hand, Plaintiffs counter that \u201ccontrary to Defendants\u2019 arguments, <em>respondeat superior </em>makes perfect sense in an ERISA context.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Opposition at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">In their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants cite only one case in support of their argument that \u201cthere is no <em>respondeat superior </em>liability under ERISA.\u201d <em>See Tool v.

Plaintiffs concede that, though the Sixth Circuit has yet to do so, other courts have recognized <em>respondeat superior </em>liability under ERISA. <em>See Am. Fed\u2019n of Unions Local 102 Health &amp; Welfare Fund v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of the U.S., </em>841 F.2d 658, 665 (5th Cir.1988) (holding that non-fiduciary <em>respondeat superior </em>liability attached under ERISA when the principal \u201cactively and knowingly\u201d participated in the agent\u2019s breach); <em>Nat\u2019l Football Scouting, Inc. v.

Nevertheless, the Sixth Circuit has yet to rule on the issue. <em>See Hamilton, </em>243 F.3d at 1001-03 (deciding not \u201creach the broader question of whether the doctrine of <em>re-spondeat superior </em>applies in ERISA cases\u201d and affirming the district court\u2019s judgment on this ground).</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-9\"><em>Fling </em>is factually similar to the instant case, and offers a detailed discussion of the court\u2019s reasoning in deciding to adopt <em>re-spondeat superior </em>for ERISA cases. <em>See </em>323 F.Supp.2d at 145. In <em>Fling, </em>Plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>John Kling, an employee of Harnischfeger Industries, Inc. (\u201cHarnischfeger\u201d), sued Fidelity Management Trust Company (\u201cFidelity\u201d), a number of individually-named Harnischfeger directors, officers, and employees, the Harnischfeger Industries Employee\u2019s Savings Plan (\u201cPlan\u201d), the Harnischfeger Industries, Inc. Pension and Investment Committee (\u201cInvestment Committee\u201d) and the Harnischfeger Industries, Inc. Board of Directors Pension Committee (\u201cPension Committee\u201d) for breach of fiduciary duty and prohibited transactions in violation of ERISA. <em>See id. </em>at 135. In addition to alleging fiduciary liability, and co-fiduciary liability, Plaintiff also alleged that Harnischfeger was liable for breaches by the Pension Committee, the Investment Committee, and all the Committee members under the \u201claws of agency, including the principals of vicarious liability and <em>respondeat superior.\u201d See id. </em>at 145. Though Defendants argued that the application of <em>respondeat superior </em>and vicarious liability in ERISA fiduciary duty cases \u201chas been rejected as inconsistent with ERISA\u2019s functional concept of fiduciary responsibility,\u201d the court found that a claim may be stated under ERISA for <em>respondeat superior </em>liability. <em>See id. </em>at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">The <em>Kling </em>court reasoned that, though there was an obvious court split about whether <em>respondeat superior </em>had a place in an ERISA context, more cases argued <em>for it </em>than against it. <em>See id.; Nat\u2019l Football, </em>931 F.2d at 646; <em>McMahon v. McDowell, </em>794 F.2d 100, 109 (3d Cir.1986) (stating that employer could be liable if employees were found to have breached their duties); <em>Stuart Park Assoc. Ltd. P\u2019Ship v. Ameritech Pension Trust, </em>846 F.Supp. 701 (N.D.Ill.1994) (\u201cIt is well-established that an employee\u2019s actions within the scope of employment are imputed to the employer, even in the context of ERISA litigation\u201d); <em>Stanton, </em>631 F.Supp. at 104 (commenting that \u201cthe broad protective purpose of ERISA\u201d calls for <em>re-spondeat superior </em>liability); <em>Am. Fed\u2019n, </em>841 F.2d at 665 (employer can be liable if \u201cactively and knowingly participating\u201d in the employee\u2019s breach of a fiduciary duty). Further, though the <em>Kling </em>court agreed with defendants\u2019 arguments that \u201cERISA imposes a functional definition of fiduciary status ... [and] under the \u2018two hats\u2019 doctrine, courts have held that certain actions of an employer ... fall outside the scope of ERISA fiduciary duty,\u201d it also acknowledged that \u201c[defendants have failed to cite a single authority that evinces an intent within ERISA to eliminate the vicarious liability of a corporation for the acts of its employees or agent.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 146 (citing <em>Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, </em>514 U.S. 73, 78, 115 S.Ct. 1223, 131 L.Ed.2d 94 (1995)). In this case, adopting <em>Kling'''s </em>line of reasoning,, this Court finds that Plaintiffs\u2019 <em>re-spondeat superior </em>claim is applicable to claims brought under ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-7\">Accordingly, to make out a claim for Cardinal\u2019s <em>respondeat superior </em>liability, Plaintiffs must show that the Director Defendants breached their duty to Plaintiffs while acting in the course and scope of their employment. <em>See Hamilton, </em>243 F.3d at 1002. In the Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1089-8\">[t]he Director Defendants had a fiduciary duty to appoint as members of the Plan Committee persons with sufficient education, knowledge and experience to inform themselves as necessary to perform their duties as Plan Committee members, including the duty to evaluate the merits of investment options under the Plan, and had an ongoing fiduciary duty to ensure that the persons appointed to the Plan Committee were fully informed and performing their duties properly with respect to the selection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>investment options under the Plan and the investment of the assets of the Plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av7\"><em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6 104. Then, <em>to </em>assert their claim of that Cardinal is liable for the Director Defendants\u2019 failure <em>to </em>monitor under a theory of <em>respondeat superior, </em>Plaintiffs write, \u201c[t]he Company is liable for the Director Defendants\u2019 breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the Director Defendants\u2019 failures to properly appoint, monitor and inform the fiduciaries whom they appointed under the doctrine of <em>re-spondeat superior.\u201d Id. </em>\u00b6 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations fail to show that Director Defendants\u2019 breach of their duty to monitor occurred in the course of their employment with Cardinal. <em>See </em>Certain Defs.\u2019 Reply at 30. Defendants also contend that it does not make sense, under corporation law, to say that a company \u201ccontrols\u201d its directors. <em>See </em>Certain Defs.\u2019 Motion to Dismiss at 40 (citing <em>Arnold v. Soc\u2019y for Sav. Bancorp, </em>678 A.2d 533, 539-40 (Del.1996) (\u201cDirectors, in the ordinary course of their service as directors, do not act as agents of the corporation ... A board of directors, in fulfilling its fiduciary duty, controls the corporation, not <em>vice versa.\u201d)); see </em>Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 1701.59(A) (\u201call of the authority of a corporation shall be exercised by or under the direction of its directors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">This Court is persuaded by the reasoning in <em>Woods v. S\u2019ern Co. See </em>396 F.Supp.2d 1351, 1373 (N.D.Ga.2005). In <em>Woods, </em>plaintiff initiated a putative ERISA class action against her former employer, the Southern Company (\u201cSouthern\u201d), as well as Southern Company Services, Inc. (\u201cSCS\u201d), the SCS Board of Directors (the \u201cDirector Defendants\u201d), the Southern Company Employee Savings Plan Committee (the \u201cESP Committee\u201d), and the Pension Fund Investment Review Committee (the \u201cPFIRC\u201d). <em>See id. </em>at 1356. The plaintiffs averred that SCS, a Southern subsidiary and the Plan\u2019s Sponsor, exercised responsibility for the management of the Plan\u2019s assets and the appointment of Plan fiduciaries, including the trustee. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs also alleged that defendant directors were responsible for the appointment, supervision and removal of other Plan fiduciaries, and were the actors through which SCS carried out its plan duties. <em>Id. </em>Defendants there argued that, \u201cbecause the [c]omplaint does not allege that the SCS made any fiduciary appointments, only that the SCS Board of Directors did,\u201d SCS had no duty to monitor. <em>See id. </em>at 1373. The court found \u201cthis attempt to exempt a corporation from liability for the acts of its Board [to be] ineffective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Though the court admitted its reluctance to impose ERISA liability under a theory of <em>respondeat superior, </em>it denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the duty to monitor claim against SCS because it was \u201cunable to find any support for the proposition that a meaningful distinction can be drawn between a corporation and the directors through whom it must act.\u201d <em>See id; see also Enron, </em>284 F.Supp.2d at 660 (\u201cas a matter of established law, a corporation acts through its board of directors to effectuate its corporate duties\u201d). Accordingly, in this case, applying <em>Woods, </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Cardinal may be held liable under a theory of <em>respondeat superior </em>are sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. Consequently, this Court DENIES Defendant Cardinal\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">6. Co-Fiduciary Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">Regarding the sufficiency of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of co-fiduciary liability, ERISA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-9\">In addition to any liability which he may have under any other provisions of this part, a fiduciary with respect to the plan shall be liable for breach of fiduciary responsibility of another fiduciary with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>respect to the same plan in the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-5\">(1) if he participates knowingly in, or knowingly undertakes to conceal, an act or omission of such other fiduciary, knowing such act or omission is a breach;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-6\">(2) if, by his failure to comply with section 1104(a)(1) of this title in the administration of his specific responsibilities which give rise to his status as a fiduciary, he has enabled such other fiduciary to commit a breach; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-7\">(3) if he has knowledge of a breach by such other fiduciary, unless he makes reasonable efforts under the circumstances to remedy the breach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1091-8\"><em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-9\">Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot state a claim for \u201cco-fiduciary liability by lumping together the [twenty-five different] defendants into a wrongdoing monolith and making an undifferentiated assertion that each is responsible for all of the actions of all the others over a five-year period.\u201d <em>See </em>Certain Defs.\u2019 Motion to Dismiss at 36. Defendants posit that, \u201cthe basis for the co-fiduciary claims in Count[s] I and II is the recitation that \u201c[e]ach Defendant is liable for the acts of the other Defendant as a co-fiduciary.\u201d\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 90, 100). Defendants argue, therefore, that the Complaint does specify what each of them supposedly knew or concealed about the conduct of any of their co-Defendants, which is the necessary predicate for the co-fiduciary liability. <em>Id. </em>at 37. Conversely, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants \u201cwrongly contend that Plaintiffs must plead the evidence that would be used to prove that claim.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Opposition at 29; <em>In re Polaroid ERISA Litig., </em>362 F.Supp.2d 461, 479-80 (S.D.N.Y.2005) (complaint which \u201cclosely tracks the statutory language\u201d is sufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-11\">Considering the above arguments, this Court adheres to its position in <em>AEP, </em>in which this Court denied a motion to dismiss virtually identical allegations of co-fiduciary liability finding that Plaintiffs had \u201camply put [the] Defendants on notice.\u201d <em>See </em>327 F.Supp.2d at 833. As such, at this early stage of the litigation, the Court GRANTS Defendant Putnam\u2019s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 co-fiduciary liability claims, but DENIES all other Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 co-fiduciary liability claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-12\">Y. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-13\">Based on the foregoing discussion, the Court GRANTS in part, and DENIES in part various Defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss. The Court GRANTS the following motions: (1) Defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss Counts I, II, and III brought under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3); and (2) Defendant Putnam\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Count I. The Court DENIES the following motions: (1) Defendant Cardinal\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Counts I, II and III; (2) Director Defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss Counts I, II and II; (3) Committee Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Counts I, II and III<footnotemark>50</footnotemark>; and (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>Defendant Richard J.

In the event the investment results of the plan do not meet expectations, the employer(s) usually will be required, on the basis of actuarial computations, to make additional contributions to fund the promised benefits.

The DOL bases its opinion on the following considerations: \u201c(1) markets generally are assumed to be efficient so that stock prices reflect publicly available information and known risks; (2) in the case of employer securities, the securities laws impose substantial obligations on the company, its officers, and its accountants to state their financial records accurately; and (3) ERISA section 404 requires the instructing fiduciary to adhere to a stringent standard of care.\u201d FAB at 5. Furthermore, the DOL opines that \"because stock prices fluctuate as a matter of course, even a steep drop in a stock\u2019s price would not, in and of itself, indicate that a named fiduciary\u2019s direction to purchase or hold such stock is imprudent and, therefore, not a proper direction.\" <em>Id. </em>Considering both <em>DiFelice </em>and the FAB, this Court is convinced that, though \u201cdirected trustees\u201d still maintain the fiduciary duty to be a prudent investor, their duty is <em>significantly limited.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b1079-13\">.Defendant Putnam argues only secondarily that, if the Court determines that, as a directed trustee, it owes the Stock Plan a fiduciary duty of prudence, it should be a <em>limited </em>duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">. Even if the Fitch Report were relevant under the DOL\u2019s standard, it does not call into serious question the Company\u2019s viability as a going concern. Fitch rated Cardinal as BBB+/F2, indicating that Cardinal\u2019s debt was believed to be investment grade. Further, the Fitch Report provides a number of observations precluding a likelihood of collapse. For instance, it states that the Company\u2019s \"2005 cash flow should be strong\u201d and that an upcoming scheduled earnings call to discuss first quarter 2005 results \"preclud[ed] any need for bank extensions, thus alleviating short-term liquidity concerns.\u201d App. Ex. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">. Plaintiffs also point to the government's investigations of Cardinal and the Company\u2019s declining stock price, presumably as further indicia of imprudence. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Opposition at 10. These facts, however, are unavailing. First, the Complaint's bare assertion of an SEC inquiry does not indicate whether Putnam <em>knew </em>of such inquiry, and, therefore, is irrelevant as to Putnam. Second, even if Putnam did know of the investigations, the DOL recognizes that \"[njothing in the [FAB] should be read to suggest that a directed trustee would have a heightened duty whenever a regulatory body opens an investigation of a company whose securities are the subject of a direction, merely based on the bare fact of the investigation.\u201d FAB at 6 n. 7. Finally, though Plaintiffs allege that the 5 percent drop in Cardinal's stock price over the course of the Class Period provides evidence of Putnam\u2019s imprudent investing, a drop in stock price alone is insufficient to ground a determination of imprudence. <em>See LaLonde, </em>369 F.3d at 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">. <em>See Campbell </em>v. <em>Shearson/Amer.

Plaintiffs are correct that not only has <em>McKesson HBOC </em>been discredited, but it also dealt with an unusual fact pattern distinguishable from that in the case sub judice. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Opposition at 18 n. 13 (citing 2002 WL 31431588, at *3). In <em>McKesson HBOC, </em>the plaintiffs alleged that, as a result of a merger, stock was deposited into a plan that had already been tainted with fraud by the actions of non-fiduciaries. 2002 WL 31431588, at *3. In this case, however, the improper accounting activities that allegedly caused Cardinal stock and the Fund to become \"imprudent investments\" occurred over a long period of time and on the Defendant fiduciaries' watch.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">. Though Plaintiffs do not list the title and offices of the each Committee Defendant in the original Complaint, in their Opposition, they maintain that \"all are or were senior officers of the company, holding the following positions: Defendant Adloff (Senior Vice President, Finance); Defendant Williams (Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary); Defendant Brandin (Senior Vice President and Treasurer); Defendant Rucci (Executive Vice President, Human Resources); Defendant Bennett (Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary); Defendant Watkins (Senior Vice President, Human Relations).\" <em>See </em>Pi's Opposition at 28 n. 24. Further, without filing a formal request to amend the Complaint, Plaintiffs write \"[i]f the Court believes that these additional facts are significant, the Complaint can be amended to include them.\u201d The Court finds these facts to be significant. Nonetheless, the Court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to provide them in the Complaint is detrimental to their claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b1085-12\">. According to the \"FOTM\u201d theory, a plaintiff claiming securities fraud under \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reliance based on the notion that \"in an open and developed securities market, the price of a company's stock is determined by the available material information.\u201d <em>See Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. BDO Seidman, LLP, </em>222 F.3d 63, 72 n. 5 (citing <em>Basic v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. at 241, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988)) (internal quotation marks omitted).

The Plaintiffs seek to invoke FOTM for a presumption of reliance in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"ANf\">Furthermore, some courts recognize a theory of \"fraud on the regulatory process,\u201d an extension of the FOTM theory applicable in the federal securities context. <em>See BDO Seidman, </em>222 F.3d at 72. Fraud on the regulatory process rests on the notion that in making investment decisions, an investor \"relies, at least indirectly, on the integrity of the regulatory process and the truth of any representations made to the appropriate agencies and investors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(referencing <em>In re Towers Fin. Corp. Noteholders Litig., </em>1995 WL 571888, at *23 (S.D.N.Y. Sept.20, 1995); <em>Mishkin v.

Defendants contend that \"nearly a year after the court in <em>AEP </em>declined to decide whether the FOTM presumption of reliance is applicable in ERISA cases, there is still no support for applying the presumption outside the context of Rule 10b-5.\u201d See Certain Defs.' Reply at 24. Plaintiffs, however, counter that \"[defendants might equally have said ... that nearly a year later no subsequent rulings have <em>denied </em>that the [FOTM] presumption applies in ERISA cases.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Opposition at 20-21. Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' assertions are incorrect because \"in a stock-drop case similar to this one, the <em>EDS </em>court recently rejected the applicability of the theory in an ERISA context.\u201d <em>See </em>Certain Defs.' Reply at 24 (citing <em>In re Elec. Data Sys. Corp \u201cERISA\u201d Litig., </em>305 F.Supp.2d 658 (E.D.Tex.2004)). Despite Defendants' arguments, upon further review, the Court is not convinced that the <em>EDS </em>court declared the FOTM theory wholly inapplicable to ERISA cases. Therefore, though no court has applied the FOTM theory in an ERISA context, no court has <em>denied </em>its applicability either.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b1088-6\"><em>. </em>\"Under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>an employer is liable, despite having no fault whatsoever, for the acts of its employees taken within the scope of their employment.\" <em>See Meyer </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>537 U.S. 280, 123 S.Ct. 824, 154 L.Ed.2d 753 (2003) (finding that, ordinarily, principals or employers are vicariously liable for the acts of their agents or employees in the scope of their authority or employment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">.
