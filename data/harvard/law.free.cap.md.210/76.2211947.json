We deem it unnecessary to consider the second ground, since the Court is unanimously of the opinion that the appeal must be dismissed for failure to appeal within thirty days after a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">The appellants filed a bill in equity to which the appellees demurred, and their demurrers were sustained to the whole bill, without leave to amend, on October 24, 1955. The appellants filed a motion for rehearing on November 9, 1955, which was denied on January 6, 1956. The appeal in this case was entered on January 26, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">The order of October 24, 1955, was a final order. <em>Miller, Equity Procedure, </em>Sec. 136; <em>Young v. Cockman, </em>182 Md. 246, 34 A. 2d 428, and cases therein cited; <em>Columbian Carbon Co. v. Kight, </em>207 Md. 203, 114 A. 2d 28. The filing of a motion for rehearing did not operate to rescind the order of October 24th or to stay or suspend its operation. See <em>Hancock v. Stull, </em>199 Md. 434, 437, 86 A. 2d 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">The appeal was not taken within thirty days from October 24, 1955, and must be dismissed.
