One Snyder was employed by the general contractor under sub-contract to do the brick and masonry work. Snyder purchased brick for the job from the Monumental Brick and Supply Company, performed the sub-contract and died without having paid for the bricks. Monumental, in the role of beneficiary of a bond given for the primary protection of the Board of Education of Cecil County by Kirby and McGuire, Incorporated, as principal, and Indemnity Insurance Company of North America, as surety, sued as equitable plaintiff for judgment against the obligors of the bond for the price of the bricks furnished to Snyder. The declaration, in a separate count, sought to impose liability on Kirby and McGuire, Incorporated, aside from its execution of the bond, because of its agreement, for a valid consideration, to pay Monumental for the bricks, alleged to have been made after Snyder\u2019s death. The defendants prayed oyer of the bond and all contract documents referred to in the bond, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>and after it had been granted, demurred to the declaration. The demurrer was overruled, the defendants indicated that they would not plead and the trial court granted summary judgment against both the general contractor, the principal on the bond, and the bonding company, the surety. We find it unnecessary to pass on the claim of agreement to pay in view of our conclusion that Monumental is entitled to recover on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">The bond recited the execution of a written construction contract between Kirby and McGuire, Incorporated, the contractor and the Board of Education of Cecil County as owner, adding that said contract \u201cis hereby referred to and made a part hereof as fully and to the same extent as if copied at length herein for the purpose of explaining but not of varying or enlarging the obligation.\u201d The condition of the obligation was stated to be: \u201cThat if the above bounden Principal shall well and truly keep, do and perform, each and every, all and singular, the matters and things in said contract set forth and specified to be by the said Principal kept, done and performed at the time and in the manner in said contract specified * * *, then this obligation shall be void; * * *.\u201d The contract in turn incorporated in it by reference the \u201cGeneral Conditions of the Contract\u201d, the \u201cSpecifications\u201d and the \u201cDrawings\u201d, stating that they, together with the basic contract itself, form the whole contract and were \u201cas fully a part of the Contract as if hereto attached or herein repeated.\u201d The enumeration of the Specifications and Drawings shows them to include the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d, the \u201cInstructions to Bidders\u201d, the \u201cForm of Proposal\u201d, and \u201cSpecial Conditions\u201d. It has been settled by the decisions of this Court that a bond of the kind here involved is to be regarded and construed as any other simple written contract. <em>Accident Co. v. Net &amp; Twine Co., </em>150 Md. 40, 45; <em>Women\u2019s Hospital v. U. S. F. &amp; G. Co., 177 </em>Md. 615, 618. It is clear, too, that by virtue of the incorporation by reference of the contract into the bond and of the other documents into the contract, the bond and all of the documents are to be read and construed together, as if set forth in the bond. <em>Lange v. Board </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>of Education, </em>183 Md. 255, 261; <em>Ray v. Eurice, </em>201 Md. 115; <em>Gaybis v. Palm, </em>201 Md. 78. Compare <em>U. S. F. &amp; G. Co. v. Housing Authority, </em>206 Md. 379, 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The general conditions, a part of the basic construction contract, include this provision: \u201cArt. 9. Materials, Appliances, Employees. \u2014 Unless otherwise stipulated, the Contractor shall provide and pay for all materials, labor, water, tools, equipment, light, power, transportation and other facilities necessary for the execution and completion of the work.\u201d The appellees say that this flat requirement of payment for all materials necessary for the completion of the job, read as part of the bond, is one of \u201cthe matters and things in said contract set forth and specified to be by said Principal kept, done and performed\u201d guaranteed by the bond. The appellants counter by saying that the obligations imposed on the contractor by Art. 9 are only as between him and the owner, meaning that the owner thus is not required directly to furnish and pay for anything unless expressly stipulated, and that the generality of the obligation of the contractor is limited by other provisions of the contract documents, which clearly show that the contractor must pay only for such materials and labor as he directly contracts for.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The appellees say the case is controlled by two cases where the materialman was allowed to recover. One is <em>Board of Education v. Lange, </em>182 Md. 132, where the obligation of the bond was that the principal should \u201c \u2018make prompt and faithful payment to any person furnishing labor or material for said work\u2019 * * and the other is <em>U. S. F. &amp; G. Co. v. Housing Authority, </em>206 Md. 379, <em>supra, </em>where the obligation was that the principal should \u201c \u2018make payment to all persons supplying labor and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract.\u2019 \u201d The appellants say that the bond before us is not to be distinguished from that in <em>Mayor &amp; City Council v. Maryland Casualty Co., </em>171 Md. 667, in which the obligation was that the- principal would \u201c \u2018promptly settle, pay * * * all claims * * * against the [general contractor] by any and all persons * * * for all material furnished, installed, erected and incorporated in said structure or work for which the [general contractor] is liable\u2019 \u201d, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>that in <em>Women\u2019s Hospital v. U. S. F. &amp; G. Co., </em>177 Md. 615, where the bond obligated the principal to \u201c \u2018pay all just debts for * * * materials incurred through sub-contract or in any other manner, by or on behalf of the principal\u2019 * * In each of the two latter cases the Court held that the generality of the earlier words was limited and controlled by the phrase \u201cfor which the [general contractor] is liable\u201d, in the first case, and the phrase \u201cby or on behalf of the principal\u201d in the second case.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">We find the obligation in the case before us to be indistinguishable in meaning and effect from those in <em>Board of Education v. Lange </em>and <em>U. S. F. &amp; G. Co. v. Housing Authority. </em>In the latter case, the language of the bond itself was held to be clear and controlling. In dismissing the argument in that case that the generality of the language of the bond was limited and cut down by the provisions of the contract documents, which were not explicitly incorporated in the bond by reference, Judge Henderson for the Court assumed without deciding that a clear limitation in the contract specifications might narrow the scope of the coverage implicit in the language of the bond, but found no such limitation. It was noted that the invitation to bidders required the successful bidder to furnish a \u201csatisfactory\u201d payment bond. It was pointed out further that in the general scope of the work, Section 3, Responsibilities of Contractor, it was specified that \u201c \u2018except as otherwise specifically stated in the Contract, the Contractor shall provide and pay for all materials * * * and all other services and facilities of every nature whatsoever necessary to execute the work\u2019 \u201d and the Court drew the conclusion that \u201cThus the Contractor is charged with the legal responsibility of seeing that all persons supplying materials in the prosecution of the work are paid.\u201d It was held that the clause \u201cexcept as otherwise specifically stated\u201d referred not to the extent of the coverage but to certain work and materials which were stated not to be within the undertaking of the general contractor. Rejected was the argument that the language of a provision of the Instructions to Bidders required the payment bond to be for the protection only of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u201c \u2018* * * all persons, firms or corporations to whom the Contractor may become legally indebted for labor, materials, tools, equipment or services * * * <em>\u2019 \u201d </em>and thus limited the coverage to those with whom the general contractor directly contracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The appellants rely on Art. 24 (16) of the general conditions, whereunder the architect could require the contractor to submit \u201c* * * receipts or other vouchers, showing his payments for materials and labor, including payments to subcontractors * * *\u201d and the provisions of Art. 26 (c) of the general conditions, which authorize the architect to withhold or nullify a certificate for \u201cFailure of the Contractor to make payments properly to subcontractors or for material or labor.\u201d They argue that these provisions show that it was intended that the general contractor should be liable to pay only those with whom he was in privity of contract and with whom he had dealt directly. We think these provisions cannot overcome the flat obligations assumed by the general contractor to provide and <em>pay for </em>all labor and materials necessary for the execution and completion of the work. Undoubtedly, as these provisions indicate, the orderly and generally contemplated course of procedure would be that the general contractor would pay sub-contractors who, in turn, would pay their suppliers, but even the provisions relied on by the appellants are ambiguous to the extent that they do not in terms foreclose direct payments by the contractor to materialmen who furnish material to sub-contractors. To be weighed, also, in the consideration of the coverage given by the bond and contract, read together, is paragraph 7 of the special conditions providing as follows: \u201c(a). The General Contractor shall furnish a performance bond' guaranteeing the completion of the Contract and prompt and faithful payment to those furnishing the labor and materials for the work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">We think that the undertaking of Kirby and McGuire, Incorporated, to \u201cprovide and pay for all materials * * * necessary for the execution and completion of the work\u201d is not different in legal significance and effect from the language of the bond in <em>Board of Education v. Lange, </em>182 Md. 132, <em>supra, </em>which was to \u201c \u2018make prompt and faithful payment to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>person furnishing labor or material for said work\u2019 * * or from the language of the bond in <em>U. S. F. &amp; G. Co. v. Housing Authority, supra, </em>requiring the principal to \u201c \u2018make payment to all persons supplying labor and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract.\u2019 \u201d We find the obligation assumed by the general contractor in the case before us was just what he wrote that it would be, read literally, namely, to <em>pay for </em>all of the materials necessary for the doing of the job. This being so, it follows that Monumental is entitled to be paid for the bricks furnished and the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
