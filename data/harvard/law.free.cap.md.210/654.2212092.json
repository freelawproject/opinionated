We have repeatedly held that the sufficiency of evidence to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>vict can be reviewed only upon direct appeal, and not on <em>habeas corpus. </em>The alleged mistake goes only to the regularity of the trial and not to the point of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
