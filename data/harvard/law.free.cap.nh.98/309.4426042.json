L., c. 122, as amended) extends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the coverage of a \u201cNamed Operator Policy\u201d to include a vehicle owned by the policyholder contrary to an express exclusion in the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\">To comply with the Act (s. 1 VII) a policy of liability insurance must provide: \u201c(a) indemnity for or protection to the insured and any person responsible to him for the operation of <em>the insured\u2019s motor vehicle . . </em>. against loss by reason of the liability to pay damages to others . . . accidentally sustained . . . arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, control, or use ... of suc/i <em>motor vehicle . . </em>. and (b) which further provides indemnity for or protection to the named insured [and certain others] with respect to the presence of any such insured in any <em>other motor vehicle, </em>from liability as a result of accidents which occur in New Hampshire due to the operation of any motor vehicle . . . <em>not owned in whole or in part by such insured </em>. . . .\u201d (italics supplied). In other words such a policy, devoid of its refinements, must provide coverage (1) for the \u201cinsured's motor vehicle\u201d which is to be described in the policy (s. 15); (2) other car coverage, so-called, on cars \u201cnot owned in whole or in part by such insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">It is agreed that at the time this policy was issued to him, Roland A. Roux was required to furnish proof of financial responsibility in order to obtain a license to operate a motor vehicle because he had been involved in an accident without having liability insurance (s. 5 I). Item 4 of the policy entitled \u201cDescription of the automobile\u201d did not describe any automobile. It contained the words \u201cNamed Operator Policy.\u201d The total premium for coverage of $5,000 each person: $10,000 each accident for bodily injury and $5,000 each accident for property damage was $17.26 including a 15% assigned risk surcharge. All of these facts indicate that this policy was not intended to be the usual \u201cMotor Vehicle Liability Policy\u201d required by and issued under the Financial Responsibility Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">However paragraph 2 of its New Hampshire Statutory Motor Vehicle Liability Policy Endorsement reads as follows: \u201cthat the policy as amended by this endorsement is a Motor Vehicle Liability Policy as defined in Chapter 122, Revised Laws . . . and all policy provisions required by said Chapter are hereby expressly incorporated in the policy by reference.\u201d In view of the circumstances described above the \u201cpolicy provisions required by said Chapter [which] are hereby expressly incorporated ... by reference\u201d cannot be those required by s. 1 VII (a) for no \u201cinsured\u2019s motor vehicle\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>is described in the policy. They must necessarily be the provisions required by s. 1 VII (b) which refer to the so-called other car coverage. But by the express language of the Act this coverage is given with respect to liability due \u201cto the presence of any such insured in any other motor vehicle . . . not owned in whole or in part by such insured.\u201d The statutory endorsement does not afford protection in this case. <em>Hardware </em>&amp;c. <em>Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Tobyne, </em>98 N. H. 318. Such coverage not being required by the Act its exclusion in the policy is not the type of exclusion which comes under the provisions of s. 16 III. See <em>Farm Bureau Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>97 N. H. 196, 201; <em>Davy </em>v. <em>Merchants </em>&amp;c. <em>Cas. Co., </em>97 N. H. 236, 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The policy in question was issued to the insured to prevent suspension of his operator\u2019s license following a prior accident. However the fact that it was accepted by the Motor Vehicle Commissioner as proof of \u201cfinancial responsibility in the future\u201d (ss. 5 1, 9), does not establish that it was a \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy\u201d under the Act (s. 1 VII).. A motor vehicle policy may be accepted as such proof (s. 20); but the Act does not make it an exclusive method of proof. Section 6 provides that security required following an accident \u201cshall be in such form ... as the commissioner may require. . . .\u201d Section 5 II (2) provides that the requirement of suspension shall not apply to an \u201coperator, if not the owner of [the] . . . vehicle\u201d involved \u201cif there was in effect at the time of such accident such a policy . . . with respect to his operation of motor vehicles not owned by him,\u201d and by subsection (3), suspension is not required if the operator\u2019s liability \u201cis, in the judgment of the commissioner covered by any other form of insurance policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Under these provisions a policy like the one in question could properly be accepted by the Commissioner under section 6 as security within section 5. Hence it should be satisfactory proof of maintenance of financial responsibility in the future for which purpose the insurance in this case was originally obtained. Since the policy met the requirements of the Act with respect to the operation of motor vehicles not owned by the insured, it was properly accepted by the Commissioner. Consistently with the Act, it could properly exclude from coverage any vehicle of the insured not specifically described in the policy. It was not required to insure the operation of any vehicle which the insured might later acquire. Consequently it afforded no protection against Roux\u2019 liability arising out of the operation of the vehicle involved in this accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Neither the terms of the insurance policy nor the provisions of the Financial Responsibility Act confer any rights on the injured parties under the facts of this case. A judgment should be entered that the petitioner is under no obligation to defend or indemnify the defendant Roland A. Roux with respect to claims presented by the pending actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b347-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
