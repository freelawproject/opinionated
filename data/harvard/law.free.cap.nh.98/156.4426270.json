H. 81; <em>Tufts </em>v. <em>White, </em>92 N. H. 158), and to avoid the accident by using'\u201cthe almost thirty feet of pavement,\u201d presumably to the left of the Smart car before it commenced its turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">In support of this argument reliance is placed on the denial of the defendant\u2019s request number three, that \u201cthere is evidence that the speed of the Vakalis motor vehicle was excessive . . . and that such speed caused or contributed to cause the accident.\u201d The argument is made that by denying the request the Court ruled as a matter of law that negligence on the part of Vakalis could not be found from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>evidence. This contention misinterprets the action of the Trial Court in denying the request. Under the statute (R. L., c. 370, s. 13), the Court is required upon request to state \u201cthe facts found.\u201d <em>Black </em>v. <em>Fiandaca, </em>98 N. H. 33, 38. The Court expressly found that Vakalis\u2019 speed \u201cwas not excessive or unreasonable under all the circumstances.\u201d This was a finding of fact within the meaning of the statute, and the defendant\u2019s third request was properly denied, both because made unnecessary by the express finding, and because it was not a request to state \u201cthe facts found,\u201d within the meaning of the statute. See <em>Pettee </em>v. <em>Chapter, </em>86 N. H. 419, 425, <em>426; Oullette </em>v. <em>Ledoux, </em>92 N. H. 302; see also, <em>Thistle </em>v. <em>Halstead, </em>96 N. H. 192; <em>Bolduc </em>v. <em>Company, </em>97 N. H. 360, 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The evidence did not establish that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. The defendant\u2019s argument, based upon <em>Fine </em>v. <em>Parella, supra, </em>is answered by what was said in <em>Holt </em>v. <em>Grimard, </em>94 N. H. 255, 257. Whether or not the plaintiff was careless under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence in this case was a question of fact. See also, <em>Savoie </em>v. <em>Company, </em>95 N. H. 67, 72. The plaintiff was not required to anticipate that the defendant would turn to his left without warning (see Laws 1949, c. 232) after having indicated by applying his brakes and pulling to the right-hand shoulder of the road that he was about to park.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">There was no error in the finding that the defendant \u201cslowed down almost to a stop.\u201d The defendant testified that he applied his brakes several times but maintained some speed by use of a hand throttle, while the plaintiff testified that the defendant stopped \u201cprobably\u201d for a second or two. The plaintiff also testified that he blew his horn \u201cknowing that he wasn\u2019t going to stop.\u201d The defendant\u2019s conduct as found by the Court was not so far different from the plaintiff\u2019s description of it, as to make recovery by the plaintiff \u201cinconsistent with honesty and good faith.\u201d <em>Bartis </em>v. <em>Warrington, </em>91 N. H. 415, 418. <em>Cf. LaDuke </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>97 N. H. 122, 125. The finding that the defendant did not stop might be thought less prejudicial to him than a contrary finding would have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The issues presented were wholly issues of fact as to which the findings of the Trial Court are conclusive. No error of law appears from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdicts.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b192-9\">Goodnow J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
