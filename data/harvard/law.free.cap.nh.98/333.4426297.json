The declaration alleges that this agreement \u201cwas evidenced by\u201d the uniform express receipt. The receipt however fails to bear out the plaintiff\u2019s allegations. Under its terms the shipment was subject to the defendant\u2019s official express classification No. 33 (I.C.C. No. 4500). This provides by rule 7, \u201cConditions of Delivery, (a) Agreement as to time of delivery of express matter must not be made unless provision for such agreement is contained in lawfully published tariffs.\u201d The tariffs in effect at the date of the shipment contained no provision for any agreement with respect to time of delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">If the \u201cuncontroverted evidence produced by the plaintiff\u201d that special representatives of the defendant \u201crepresented\u201d to the plaintiff that chicks shipped on a Thursday afternoon would arrive the Saturday following between the hours of five and six o\u2019clock in the morning could be taken as evidence of an oral agreement that they would so arrive (see <em>Blodgett </em>v. <em>Abbot, </em>72 Wis. 516), the evidence would be inadmissible to vary the terms of the written contract issued on the day of shipment. <em>Long </em>v. <em>N. </em>Y. <em>C. R. R. Co., </em>50 N. Y. 76; <em>The Jean Jadot, </em>14 F. Supp. 161. Moreover such a contract if proved would be unenforceable. The official express classification containing the defendant\u2019s published tariffs was binding on the parties. \u201cThe contract being for an interstate shipment, their rights and obligations are governed by the Acts of Congress, the uniform express receipt, and the tariffs duly filed with the interstate commerce commission.\u201d <em>Nicholas Zeo, Inc. </em>v. <em>Railway Exp. Agency, Inc., </em>317 Mass. 374, 378. The tariffs could not be \u201cavoided, enlarged, or varied by the shipper and the carrier through express or implied contract.\u201d <em>Am. Ry. Express Co. </em>v. <em>American Trust Co., </em>47 F. (2d.) 16, 18, <em>cert. den. </em>284 U. S. 629. See also, <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Cornwell, </em>264 U. S. 560, 562. In the absence of a published tariff providing therefor, any special agreement for delivery at a particular time would be illegal because a preference and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>violation of requirements of the Interstate Commerce Act. <em>Chicago &amp; Alton R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>225 U. S. 155. See also, <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Cornwell, </em>264 U. S. 560, <em>supra; Clegg </em>v. <em>St. Louis &amp; S. F. R. Co., </em>203 Fed. 971; <em>L. &amp; N. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Warren Co. Strawberry Grow. Asso., </em>206 Ky. 482; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>135 Tenn. 48; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>N. Y., N. H. &amp; H. R. R., </em>111 Me. 263, 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In the absence of an enforceable contract for delivery at a particular time, the defendant\u2019s undertaking was one to deliver within a reasonable time. <em>Chicago &amp; Alton R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Kirby, supra, </em>164; <em>Nicholas Zeo, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ry. Exp. Agency, Inc., supra, </em>381. The evidence contained in the agreed statement of facts fails to establish as a matter of law that the delay which occurred in transporting the decedent\u2019s shipment was unreasonable, or due to the negligence of the defendant. There is no indication that the twenty-minute delay in Connecticut for the purpose of examining a car for fire was negligent. See <em>National Elevator Co. </em>v. <em>Great Northern Ry. Co., </em>141 Minn. 407. So far as appears this and other \u201coperational delays\u201d which caused the train to arrive at New York forty minutes late, were \u201cperils of navigation\u201d (see <em>Walker </em>v. <em>The Transportation Co., </em>3 Wall. 150, 154), to which no negligence of the defendant or its agents contributed; and the affirmative evidence is that after arrival in New York transportation was in every case by means of the first trains available for railway express transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">We cannot say that a delay of fourteen hours in transportation over the considerable distance here involved is unreasonable as a matter of law. If it could be found from the evidence that a reasonable time for carrying the shipment was approximately thirty-nine hours, this \u201chas no tendency to prove that the defendants were to blame for the delay: From all that appears, it is as probable that the delay was not, as that it was, caused by the defendants\u2019 fault.\u201d <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>78 N. H. 207, 209. See also, <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Chicago &amp; Northwestern Ry. Co., </em>262 Ill. App. 580, 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The defendant was not an insurer against delay. <em>Belkin </em>v. <em>N. Y., N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>109 Conn. 466; <em>Saliba </em>v. <em>New York Central R. R. Co., </em>101 Vt. 427, 435. The rule which was controlling in <em>Akerly </em>v. <em>Express Agency, </em>96 N. H. 396, therefore does not apply. The plaintiff has the burden of establishing unreasonable delay. If her evidence, standing by itself, could be said to warrant a finding in her favor, such a finding cannot be made as a matter of law on this record, in the face of the defendant\u2019s evidence explaining the delay. <em>Belkin </em>v. <em>N. Y., N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., supra; Wood v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>Railroad, supra; Mason </em>v. <em>Chicago &amp; Northwestern Ry. Co., </em>262 Ill. App. 580, <em>supra. </em>So far as the plaintiff relies upon authorities dealing with the negligence of a carrier in caring for livestock during a delay, she asserts a claim not open in this action of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Since the evidence fails to establish the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover for breach of contract, it is unnecessary to pass upon the contention that she failed to make her claim in writing within nine months after delivery to the carrier, as required by the uniform express receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b371-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
