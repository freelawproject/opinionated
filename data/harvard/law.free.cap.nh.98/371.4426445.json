The plaintiff testified that the defendants were hard pressed and that he loaned them money at various times, including $190 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>towards paying G\u00e9raldine\u2019s hospital bill. The defendants denied most of the plaintiff\u2019s claims in general and the hospital loan in particular. In the course of the defendant Jerry\u2019s denial of this loan, he further claimed the hospital bill only amounted to $121. As bearing, on this defendant\u2019s credibility, plaintiff\u2019s counsel sought to prove by Mrs. Blanchard that the bill exceeded $121, and the Court permitted cross-examination along this line over the defendants\u2019 exception. An examination of the record convinces us that no prejudice resulted from Mrs. Blanchard\u2019s answers, and furthermore, that there was no abuse of discretion in permitting the questions which tended to discredit the defendant\u2019s claims. <em>Noel </em>v. <em>LaPointe, </em>86 N.
