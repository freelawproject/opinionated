Adams appeals his conviction on the ground that the government failed to produce any evidence that the firearm was operable: After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-16\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-17\">On January 13, 1996, Adams entered the Royal Pawn Shop in Miami, Florida with a Winchester 12 gauge pump shotgun. Adams testified that he went to the pawn shop to sell a VCR, but was approached by a stranger outside the pawn shop who asked Adams to pawn the shotgun. The stranger offered Adams half the proceeds of the sale and Adams agreed. Adams subsequently sold the shotgun to the attendant on duty at the pawn shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-20\">On February 16,1996, Adams was indicted by a federal grand jury and charged with one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial, the government presented two witnesses: (1) Joel Valasquez, the pawn shop attendant; and (2) Detective Gregory George of the Metro-Dade Police Department. Both witnesses testified that Adams sold the firearm in issue, but neither witness testified that the firearm was operable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-21\">At the close of the gov\u00e9mment\u2019s case, Adams moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the government faded to produce any evidence that the firearm in question was operable. The district court denied Adams\u2019s motion, stating \u201c[tjhere is something to what you say, counsel. But I believe the law in this Circuit indicates that you do not have to show that the firearm is tested....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-22\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-23\">Whether the government is required to show that a firearm is operable for purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is an issue of first impression in this circuit. Our starting point is the language of the statute itself. <em>See United States v. Wells, </em>519 U.S. 482, -, 117 S.Ct. 921, 926, 137 L.Ed.2d 107 (1997); <em>United States v. McArthur, </em>108 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. Fern, </em>117 F.3d 1298, 1305-06 (11th Cir.1997). Section 922(g)(1) prohibits a convicted felon from possessing a firearm, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-28\">(g) It shall be unlawful for any person-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-29\">(1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnF\">to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting com-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>meree, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-5\">For purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(1), a firearm is defined to include any weapon which will or is designed to or may be readily converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-6\">(a) As used in this chapter-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-7\">(3) The term \u201cfirearm\u201d means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an .explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device. Such term does not include an antique firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nothing in either \u00a7 922(g)(1) or \u00a7 921(a)(3) requires the government to show that the unlawfully possessed firearm is operable. Further, Adams fails to point to anything in the legislative history of \u00a7 922(g)(1)\" which indicates that the unlawfully possessed firearm must be operable for purposes of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-9\">While this alone is sufficient to lead us to the conclusion that the government need not show that a firearm is operable for . purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(1), we also note that every circuit addressing the issue has reached the same conclusion. <em>See United States v. Maddix, </em>96 F.3d 311, 316 (8th Cir.1996) (\u201cTitle 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3) does not require a firearm to be operable.\u201d); <em>United States v. Yannott, </em>42 F.3d 999, 1006 (6th Cir.1994) (\u201c[T]he law is clear that a weapon does not need to be operable to be a firearm.\u201d); <em>United States v. Morris, </em>904 F.2d 518, 519 (9th Cir.1990) (\u201cThe statute imposes no requirement that the gun be loaded or operable\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>800 F.2d 895, 899 (9th Cir.1986)); <em>United States v. Perez, </em>897 F.2d 751, 754 (5th Cir.1990) (\u201cAn inoperable firearm is nonetheless a firearm.\u201d). We join these circuits and hold that the government was not required to show that the firearm was operable for purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-17\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-18\">For the foregoing reasons, Adams\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1) is</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1381-18\">. The parties stipulated that Adams was convicted of a felony in Florida in October 1986, and that the shotgun was transported in interstate commerce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1382-10\"><em>. </em>Adams also contends that the government failed \"to show that the firearm met the statutory definition of a weapon that \"may readily be converted to expel a projectile____\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3). However, the statute defines a firearm as a weapon <em>\"which will or is designed to </em>or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied). The actual firearm' was in evidence and the pawn shop attendant testified that this firearm was a \"Winchester blue 12 gauge shotgun.\u201d This was sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the firearm was designed to expel a projectile. <em>See United States v. Reed, </em>114 F.3d 1053, 1057 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 118 S.Ct 316, 139 L.Ed.2d 244 (1997); <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>15 F.3d 395, 396 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also United States v. Rouco, </em>765 F.2d 983, 996 (11th Cir.1985) (construing similarly worded Florida statute, the court stated that \"[tjestimony by an experienced federal law en, forcement officer familiar with handguns that the defendant carried a .38 caliber pistol certainly authorized the jury to find that the defendant possessed a firearm, defined as a weapon 'designed to ...\" expel a projectile.\u2019 \u201d). \u25a0</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1382-25\">. Adams relies on <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>15 F.3d 395 (5th Cir.1995), and <em>United States v. Reed, </em>114 F.3d 1053 (10th Cir.1997), but neither case is applicable. <em>Munoz </em>did not address whether the firearm in issue had to be operable, but only whether the firearm met the statutory definition of a firearm. <em>Munoz, </em>15 F.3d at 396. <em>Reed </em>addressed only whether <em>&amp; </em>defendant must know that the firearm.he possesses meets the statutory definition of a firearm. <em>Reed, </em>114 F.3d at 1056-58.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
