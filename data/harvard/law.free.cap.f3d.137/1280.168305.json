Hall Motors, Inc. (Hall Motors). Addressing an issue of first impression concerning Alabama debtors\u2019 and secured creditors\u2019 rights in personal property repossessed prior to the filing of a bankruptcy petition, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-25\">In August 1992, Elgin Lewis purchased a used automobile from Hall Motors. Elgin Lewis agreed to make weekly installment payments and granted to Hall Motors, as collateral, a security interest in the automobile. In October 1992, Elgin Lewis breached the purchase agreement through his nonpayment. Soon thereafter, Elgin Lewis and his spouse, Onetha Lewis, filed a joint petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama, seeking relief under Chapter 13. For reasons unrelated to this appeal, the bankruptcy court dismissed their case on March 28,1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-26\">On June 2, 1993, upon receiving notice of the Chapter 13 dismissal, Hall Motors repossessed the automobile.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Two days later, the Lewises filed a second joint petition for Chapter 13 relief and listed the automobile in their schedule of assets. Also, in their proposed Chapter 13 plan filed with their petition and schedules, the Lewises offered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>pay to Hall Motors sixty-two cents on the dollar for the automobile\u2019s outstanding secured balance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\">After Hall Motors refused to return the automobile, the Lewises initiated the instant adversary proceeding. They sought, among other relief, turnover of the automobile under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After conducting a non-jury trial, the bankruptcy court found in favor of the Lewises, reasoning that under Alabama law, Elgin Lewis had both title and a right of redemption in the repossessed automobile. The bankruptcy court concluded that the automobile was \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d and ordered Hall Motors to return it to the Lewises.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">Hall Motors appealed the judgment to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. <em>See Charles R. Hall Motors, Inc. v. Lewis (In re </em>Lewis), 211 B.R. 970 (N.D.Ala.1997). The district court reversed, holding that under Alabama law, Elgin Lewis had only a right of redemption in the repossessed automobile, which prevented the automobile from being property of the estate. 211 B.R. at 974-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">II.ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">In this appeal, we address whether the district court erred in reversing the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment requiring Hall Motors to return the automobile that it had repossessed prior to the commencement of the Lewises\u2019 second Chapter 13 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-8\">III.CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-9\">The Lewises contend that the repossessed automobile should have been returned because it was \u201cproperty of the estate.\u201d They argue that under Alabama law, particularly the state\u2019s version of the Uniform Commercial Code, Elgin Lewis retained legal title or an equivalent ownership interest in the repossessed automobile, in addition to a statutory right of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-14\">Hall Motors, on the other hand, points to Alabama\u2019s law of conversion and argues that Elgin Lewis lost both title and possession when Hall Motors exercised its contractual right of repossession on June 2, 1993. Hall Motors further maintains that it had no duty to return the automobile because the proposed Chapter 13 plan failed to tender the total outstanding secured balance plus expenses. As a result, Hall Motors contends, Elgin Lewis\u2019s statutory right of redemption did not render the automobile \u201cproperty of the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-15\">IV.DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-16\">Where, as here, the parties contest only issues of law, we review the district court\u2019s and bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions <em>de novo. Levine v. Weissing (In re Levine), </em>134 F.3d 1046, 1049 (11th Cir.1998). Under the Bankruptcy Code, the court may generally order a third party to turn property in its possession over to the debtor\u2019s estate if three primary requirements are met. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 362(d)(1), 363(b)(1), 363(e), 542(a) (West 1993). First, such property must be \u201cproperty of the estate.\u201d <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 363(b)(1), 541, 542(a). Second, at the moment the debtor filed a petition, the debtor must have had a right to use, sell or lease the property. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 301, 302, 323(a), 541(a), 542(a). Finally, upon request, the court must ensure that the third party\u2019s interest in the property is adequately protected. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 323(a), 362(d)(1), 363(e), 542(a); <em>Capital Factors, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number><em>Inc. v. Empire for Him, Inc., </em>1 F.3d 1156, 1160 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">Our first concern, therefore, is whether the repossessed automobile was \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d on June 4, 1993, the date that the Lewises commenced their second Chapter 13 case. \u201cProperty of the estate\u201d is defined broadly to include \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\u201d 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 541(a)(1); <em>cf. United States v. Whiting Pools, Inc., </em>462 U.S. 198, 204, 103 S.Ct. 2309, 2313, 76 L.Ed.2d 515 (1983) (observing in a Chapter 11 case that \u201cCongress intended a broad range of property to be included in the estate\u201d because \u201creorganization ... would have small chance of success ... if property essential to running the business were excluded from the estate\u201d). Readily apparent from the face of the statute, whether a debtor\u2019s interest constitutes \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d is a federal question. <em>Southtrust Bank of Alabama v. Thomas (In re Thomas), </em>883 F.2d 991, 995 (11th Cir.1989), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>497 U.S. 1007, 110 S.Ct. 3245, 111 L.Ed.2d-756 (1990). As the bankruptcy and district courts correctly stated, however, \u201cthe nature and existence of the [debtor\u2019s] right to property is determined by looking at state law.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>883 F.2d at 995.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">The parties vigorously contest the nature and existence of Elgin Lewis\u2019s ownership interest in the automobile after Hall Motors repossessed it. Their dispute is not an isolated one. At least in the Northern District of Alabama, the bankruptcy and district courts are apparently split on this issue. <em>See Charles R. Hall Motors, Inc. v. Lewis (In re Lewis), </em>211 B.R. 970, 974 (N.D.Ala.E.Div.1997) (holding that under Alabama law, a secured creditor has \u201cboth legal title to and right of possession\u201d in a automobile that it repossessed upon the debtor\u2019s default). <em>But see Turner v. DeKalb Bank (In re Turner), </em>209 B.R. 558, 564-68 (Bankr.N.D.Ala.E.Div.1997) (holding that \u201cthe Uniform Commercial Code as adopted by the State of Alabama replaced the common law by providing the creditor with a right to possession only\u201d); <em>Mattheiss v. Title Loan Express (In re Mattheiss), </em>214 B.R. 20, .31-32 (Bankr.N.D.Ala.W.Div.1997) (following <em>Turner </em>).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-8\">We find no indication, however, that Alabama\u2019s state courts are similarly split. In the context of the closely-related law of conversion, the Alabama Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that a plaintiff must have both title to and a right of possession in the allegedly converted property to maintain a claim. <em>See, e.g., Huntsville Golf Development, Inc. v. Ratcliff, Inc., </em>646 So.2d 1334, 1336 (Ala.1994) (plaintiff may prove conversion if he or she can show \u201cthat the defendant destroyed or exercised dominion over property which, at the time of the destruction or exercise of dominion, the plaintiff had a general or specific title and of which the plaintiff was entitled to immediate possession\u201d); <em>Roberson v. Ammons, </em>477 So.2d 957, 962 (Ala.1985) (\u201cLegal title with immediate right of possession by the plaintiffs to the converted property at the time of conversion is a necessary element of the conversion action.\u201d). The court of civil appeals, in turn, has stressed that \u201c[u]pon a debtor\u2019s default, title and right of possession pass to the creditor.\u201d <em>American Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Mobile v. Robertson, </em>384 So.2d 1122, 1123 (Ala.Civ.App.1980) (reversing trial court\u2019s denial of secured creditor\u2019s motion for directed verdict on debtor\u2019s van-conversion claim); <em>Pierce v. Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>373 So.2d 1113, 1115 (Ala.Civ.App.) (affirming trial court\u2019s denial of debtor\u2019s motion for new trial following entry of directed verdict in favor of secured creditor on debtor\u2019s truck-conversion claim), <em>writ denied sub nom., Ex parte Pierce, </em>373 So.2d 1115 (Ala.1979). In a diversity conversion case, the former Fifth Circuit echoed verbatim these common-law principles. <em>See Thompson v. Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>550 F.2d 256, 258 (5th Cir.1977) (reversing jury verdict in favor of debtor on her automobile-conversion elaim because \u201c[u]pon default title and the right to possession pass to the [secured] creditor\u201d under Alabama law).</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-9\">Most of these opinions purport to reconcile their outcomes with Alabama\u2019s version of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>(U.C.C.), which governs \u201cany transaction (regardless of its form) which is intended to create a security interest in personal property.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 7-9-102(a) (1993); <em>see Thompson, </em>550 F.2d at 258 &amp; n. 1; <em>Robertson, </em>384 So.2d at 1123-24; <em>Pierce, </em>373 So.2d at 1115. Being unable to locate any authority to the contrary, we find significant the state courts\u2019 continued reliance on the common law of conversion after the Alabama legislature adopted the U.C.C. in 1965. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 7-9-102(a) note (1993). Indeed, the state judiciary has had ample time and opportunity to reconcile the law in debtors\u2019 favor if it so desired. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 7-9-505(1) (referencing the law of conversion in discussing secured creditors\u2019 duties to dispose timely the repossessed personalty). Both the Lewises and the bankruptcy court in <em>Turner </em>list many logical reasons why a debtor upon default should lose only his or her right to possess the secured personalty. <em>See Turner, </em>209 B.R. at 564-68. Nevertheless, their view as to what Alabama\u2019s law should be simply does not comport with what the law is. Accordingly, we conclude that, at the commencement of the Lewises\u2019 second Chapter 13 case, Elgin Lewis did not retain title, possession or any other functionally equivalent ownership interest in the repossessed automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-4\">Although Elgin Lewis lacked title to or possession of the automobile at the commencement of the second Chapter 13 case, it is undisputed that he retained a right of redemption pursuant to Ala.Code \u00a7 7-9-506.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, our second concern is whether his redemption interest under state law was sufficient to render the automobile \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d under federal law. In the context of real property, a prior panel of this court recently stated that Alabama\u2019s statutory right of redemption is \u201ca right that becomes property of the bankruptcy estate under the broad definition provided in Bankruptcy Code section 541.\u201d <em>Commercial Fed. Mortgage Corp. v. Smith (In re Smith), </em>85 F.3d 1555, 1558 (11th Cir.1996); <em>see also Jim Walter Homes, Inc. v. Saylors (In re Saylors), </em>869 F.2d 1434, 1437 (11th Cir.1989) (citing <em>Wragg v. Federal Land Bank of New Orleans, </em>317 U.S. 325, 63 S.Ct. 273, 87 L.Ed. 300 (1943)). Finding no reason not to extend this principle to personal property, we readily conclude that Elgin Lewis\u2019s statutory right of redemption in the automobile became \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1) at the commencement of the case. As such, the Lewises\u2019 Chapter 13 estate, through the trustee, could exercise or \u201cuse\u201d this right just as Elgin Lewis could have. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 301, 302, 323(a), 541(a), 542(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-8\">We are not convinced, however, that the mere existence of the estate\u2019s ability to redeem the automobile renders the automobile itself \u201cproperty of the estate,\u201d at least to the extent that it should be turned over pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542(a). In accordance with state law, one must take certain affirmative steps to change the otherwise dormant right to redeem repossessed collateral into a meaningful ownership interest. As relevant to this case, the trustee had to \u201ctender[] fulfillment of all [secured] obligations\u201d plus expenses to exercise the estate\u2019s right of redemption. Ala.Code \u00a7 7-9-506; <em>cf. Commercial Federal, </em>85 F.3d at 1557, 1558, 1561 (reversing the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of the mortgagee\u2019s motion for relief from the automatic stay where the debtor filed a Chapter 13 petition after the foreclosure sale and the plan proposed simply to reinstate his mortgage payments, and holding that Alabama\u2019s statutory right of redemption \u201ccannot be modified under a Chapter 13 plan, and ... must be exercised as dictated under Alabama law by making a lump sum payment within one year of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>foreclosure sale that includes the principal, interest and other charges under the mortgage\u201d). <em>But cf. National City Bank v. Elliott (In re Elliott), </em>214 B.R. 148, 150, 152-58 (6th Cir. BAP 1997) (affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order to turn over a automobile where the confirmed Chapter 13 plan provided for \u201cpayments over the life of the plan\u201d to the secured creditor, even though the debtor lacked title or possession and Ohio\u2019s redemption statute mirrored that of Alabama\u2019s). At the time of their adversary proceeding, the Lewises\u2019 proposed Chapter 13 plan merely tendered to Hall Motors sixty-two cents on the dollar in return for Elgin Lewis\u2019s continued use of the automobile. Such proposal offered no indication to Hall Motors that the estate had chosen to exercise its right of redemption, that is, to \u201cfulfill\u201d Elgin Lewis\u2019s secured obligation plus expenses in accordance with Alabama law. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 7-9-506.7 Nor could the Lewises plausibly convince us that the proposal adequately protected Hall Motors\u2019s ownership and possessory interests in the automobile. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 363(e); <em>Capital Factors, </em>1 F.3d at 1160. Accordingly, we hold that the Lewises\u2019 bankruptcy estate\u2019s only interest in the repossessed automobile \u2014 a bare right of redemption \u2014 failed to render the automobile \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1) and subject to turn-over under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 542(a).8</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s reversal of the judgment of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1144-17\">. The parties do not dispute the lawfulness of the repossession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1145-10\">.According to the proposed Chapter 13 plan, the trustee would pay $ 20.76 per week for 60 weeks, totaling $ 1,245.60. The purchase agreement, in contrast, called for a total outstanding secured payment of $ 2,000. In other documents filed contemporaneously with the proposed plan, Elgin Lewis expressed an intent to \"reaffirm\" the debt under 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 524(c) (West 1993 &amp; Supp.1997). He did not express an intent to \"redeem\u201d the automobile under 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 722 (West 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1145-18\">.
