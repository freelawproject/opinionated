To the extent that Butler\u2019s. Fifth and Eighth Amendment claims depend on his speculation that he will be imprisoned because of his indigence, they are premature and not ripe for review; Butler does not assert that he has suffered or is about to suffer such punishment. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>128 F.3d 1239, 1242 (8th Cir.1997) (rejecting Eighth Amendment challenge to MVRA as not ripe). To the extent that Butler claims his sentence\u2014168 months incarceration, a $5,000 fine, and $8,879 in restitution\u2014is disproportionate and excessive in relation to the three bank robberies for which he was convicted, his claim is without merit. <em>See United States v. Dean, </em>949 F.Supp. 782, 786 (D.Or.1996) (\u201cWhere the amount of restitution is geared directly to the amount of the victim\u2019s loss caused by the defendant\u2019s illegal activity, proportionality is already built into the order.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Tencer, </em>107 F.3d 1120, 1135-36 &amp; n. 7 (5th Cir.) (\u201cAn order of restitution must be limited to losses caused by the specific conduct underlying the offense of conviction.\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 118 S.Ct. 390, 139 L.Ed.2d 305 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>Butler\u2019s claim that the mandatory imposition of full restitution violates the separation of powers doctrine is similarly without merit. <em>See United States v. Rasco, </em>123 F.3d 222, 226 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe power to fix sentences rests ultimately with the legislative, not the judicial branch of the government and thus the mandatory nature of the punishment ... does not violate the doctrine of separation of powers.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 868, 139 L.Ed.2d 765 (1998). Accordingly, Butler\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
