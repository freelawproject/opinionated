Counsel for Bowers filed a brief in this court in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether the district court erred in overruling Bowers\u2019 objections to the Pre-sentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) and whether Bowers received ineffective assistance of counsel. Counsel states, however, that he has found no meritorious grounds for appeal. Bowers filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-25\">Bowers\u2019 objections to the PSR are largely factual in nature. At sentencing, the district court individually addressed and rejected Bowers\u2019 objections to the PSR, and adopted the facts in the PSR. This court reviews such factual determinations for clear error. <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>566 F.3d 160, 163 (4th Cir.2009). We have reviewed the district court\u2019s rulings as to each of the claims raised and find no clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-26\">Further, Bowers is not entitled to relief on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We will address a claim of ineffective assistance on direct appeal only if the lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears on the record. <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir. 2006). Otherwise, such claims are more properly raised in a motion filed pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2010). Our review convinces us that ineffective assistance does not conclusively appear on the face of this record, and therefore we decline to address this claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Bowers, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Bowers requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Bowers.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">We affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
