Englert appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Herbert Leon MacDonell<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on Englert\u2019s defamation claims. Englert\u2019s claims against MacDonell are based on 12 documents involving statements purportedly made between July 1993 and February 2006. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-19\">1. As an initial matter, although MacDonell claims that Englert is a limited-purpose public figure, he has not demonstrated any \u201cparticular public controversy\u201d into which Englert has thrust himself in order to influence the issues involved. <em>Time, Inc. v. Firestone, </em>424 U.S. 448, 453, 96 S.Ct. 958, 47 L.Ed.2d 154 (1976). We conclude that Englert is not a public figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-20\">2. Englert\u2019s claim is time-barred with respect to five of the statements\u2014 MacDonell\u2019s July 25, 1993, letter; his January 3, 1994, letter; his January 27, 1998, affidavit; his November 23, 1999, email; and the statements that William Crank averred that MacDonell made to him\u2014 because he was aware of them and their content more than a year before commencing this action. See Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 12.120(2); <em>Holdner v. Oregon Trout, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number><em>Inc., </em>173 Or.App. 344, 22 P.3d 244, 248 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">3. Further, there is no evidence that MacDonell was responsible for two of the statements \u2014 a notice left for jurors at a trial in Idaho and a newspaper article that does directly attribute a quote to MacDonell \u2014 so Englert has not created a genuine issue of material fact that MacDonell has defamed him with respect to those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">4. In addition, MacDonell\u2019s letter of March 27, 2000, as well as the statements that Jim J. Thomas and David J. Castle averred that MacDonell made to them, are statements of opinion that do not imply assertions of objective fact, and are accordingly not actionable. <em>See, e.g., Partington v. Bugliosi, </em>56 F.3d 1147, 1153 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">5. The remaining statements \u2014 MacDo-nell\u2019s emails of June 28, 2003, and October 8, 2003 \u2014 are both capable of defamatory meaning under Oregon law. <em>See, e.g., Rajneesh Found. Int\u2019l v. McGreer, </em>303 Or. 371, 737 P.2d 593, 594 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">6. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court with respect to 10 of the 12 allegedly defamatory statements, but reverse as to the final two statements \u2014 the emails of June 28, 2003, and October 8, 2003 \u2014 and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. Each party shall bear his own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b723-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-21\">. We adopt the spelling of defendant-appellee MacDonell used consistently by the parties in their briefs, although it varies from the name in the caption.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
