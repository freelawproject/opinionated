The district court judge sentenced Tucker to a total of 120 months of imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and $15,219,965.37 in restitution. On direct appeal, Tucker claimed that the district court erred by failing to provide a specific unanimity-of-theory instruction to the jury. <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>345 F.3d 320, 324 (5th Cir.2003). This court, however, affirmed Tucker\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">Subsequently, Tucker sought relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Without holding an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge recommended that Tucker\u2019s motion for relief be denied. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and denied Tucker\u2019s motion for habeas relief and request for a certificate of ap-pealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). This court vacated the district court\u2019s decision and directed it to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding Tucker\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. Following the evidentiary hearing, the district court reached the same conclusion. Tucker now appeals the district court\u2019s decision. Because we find that Tucker\u2019s trial and appellate counsel were not ineffective, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b378-16\">First Fidelity Acceptance Corporation (\u201cFFAC\u201d), a Nevada Corporation, headquartered in Plano, Texas, was founded in 1991 for the purpose of purchasing and selling automobile loans in the form of installment sales contracts. After purchasing the loans, FFAC would \u201cpackage\u201d the loans and sell them to financial institutions and large investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-17\">In April 1992, Tucker joined FFAC as a consultant to assist FFAC in its first private placement of asset-backed securities. Shortly thereafter, the FFAC Board of Directors named Tucker Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. According to Tucker, from 1992-1996, FFAC\u2019s assets totaled $11,672,000.00. The Government, however, contends that FFAC was experiencing a financial crisis during this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-18\">In 1996, FFAC created Automobile Receivables Corporation (\u201cFFAC-ARC\u201d) for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the purpose of establishing three investment trusts. FFAC-ARC established these trusts -with the goal of raising money for FFAC to borrow to make investments in automobile loans. To generate capital, the trusts facilitated the offer and sale of certificates, with a minimum investment of $25,000.00. In order to entice potential investors to purchase the trust certificates, Tucker drafted a Private Placement Memorandum (\u201cPPM\u201d) for each trust which included a description of the investment, the trust, and the trust\u2019s relationship to FFAC. The PPM also contained information regarding how FFAC would handle and use the money invested in the trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In April 1998, FFAC\u2019s Chief Financial Officer reported to FFAC\u2019s Board of Directors that the corporation was insolvent. Thereafter, the Board forced Tucker to resign and brought in a team to review the corporation\u2019s financial records. After a review of FFAC\u2019s records, it was determined that FFAC was bankrupt. This team also examined the financial records of the three trusts. It was determined that the three trusts held very few assets of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">On November 14, 2001, Tucker was indicted on two counts, charging him with one count of securities fraud, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77q(a) and 77x, and one count of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1841. Count one alleged that from January 1996 through March 1998, in the Eastern District of Texas and elsewhere, Tucker offered and sold \u201csecurities by use of means or instruments or transportation or communication in interstate commerce or by use of the mails\u201d and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">(a) employed a device, scheme and artifice to defraud;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">(b) obtained money by means of untrue statements of a material fact and omitted statements of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made not misleading, in the light of the circumstances under which the statements were made; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">(c) engaged in a transaction, practice, and course of business that operated as a fraud and deceit upon the purchasers. The Government alleged that Tucker\u2019s</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aes-dedup-0\">\u201cscheme and artifice to defraud\u201d was evinced by the various statements contained in the three PPMs. Specifically, count one of the indictment averred that Tucker failed to disclose to investors that (1) their investments would be deposited directly into FFAC\u2019s operating accounts, rather than the trusts as promised in the PPMs; (2) the proceeds would be used to pay FFAC\u2019s operating costs; (3) previously invested funds were not used as promised; and (4) the interest paid to some investors came out of the proceeds from the sale of certificates of another trust. The Government also stated that Tucker used the United States mail, interstate telephone services, and commercial interstate couriers to deliver the fraudulent PPMs. In addition, the Government listed thirteen individuals that allegedly had been duped by Tucker, along with the dates and amounts of their investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">Count two of the indictment charged Tucker with mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. Specifically, count two reiterated the allegations of count one, but added that Tucker \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d caused the investors \u201cto place into the United States mails, envelopes addressed to FFAC in Plano, Texas, such envelopes containing checks and money orders as directed by TUCKER ..., for delivery ... to FFAC\u2019s headquarters in Plano, Texas....\u201d Count two also listed the same thirteen investors that were listed in count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">Following a jury trial, Tucker was convicted on both counts. On July 19, 2002, the district court sentenced Tucker to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>total of 120 months imprisonment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> three years of supervised release and ordered Tucker to pay $15,219,965.37 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">On appeal, Tucker argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court failed to include a specific unanimity-of-theory instruction in the jury instructions. We found that Tucker could not demonstrate, under plain error review, that the district court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on a specific unanimity-of-theory amounted to clear error. <em>Tucker, </em>345 F.3d at 338. Therefore, we affirmed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">On January 14, 2005, Tucker sought relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, presenting <em>inter alia </em>multiple claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. Without conducting an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge recommended that Tucker\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion be denied and that a COA be denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following a de novo review, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report, denied Tucker\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, and denied a COA. Tucker appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">On April 28, 2008, our court vacated the district court\u2019s judgment, granted Tucker\u2019s COA application in part and remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether trial and appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. On remand, the magistrate judge conducted an evidentiary hearing and recommended that Tucker\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion be denied. After Tucker filed his objections to the report, the magistrate judge issued a supplemental report and recommendation, recommending that Tucker\u2019s motion for summary judgment and claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel be denied. Tucker again filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. Following a de novo review, the district court overruled Tucker\u2019s objections, adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report, denied Tucker habeas relief and denied a COA. Tucker timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">This court granted Tucker a COA on only two issues. Specifically, this court granted a COA regarding Tucker\u2019s claims that (1) his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request a specific unanimity-of-theory jury instruction and (2) his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately brief the issue of whether the district court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on a specific unanimity-of-theory satisfied the requirements of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">On requests for \u00a7 2255 relief, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and issues of law de novo. <em>Woodfox v. Cain, </em>609 F.3d 774, 788-789 (5th Cir. 2010). The clear error standard applies equally to findings by the district court as it does to proposed findings by a magistrate judge adopted by the district judge. <em>United States v. Cates, </em>952 F.2d 149, 153 (5th Cir.1992). \u201c \u2018An ineffective assistance of counsel claim presents a mixed question of law and fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Richards v. Quarter-man, </em>566 F.3d 553, 561 (5th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Ward v. Dretke, </em>420 F.3d 479, 486 (5th Cir.2005)). \u201cWhen examining mixed questions of law and fact, [we] employ[ ] \u2018a de novo standard by independently applying the law to the facts found by the district court, as long as the district court\u2019s factual determinations are not clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Richards, </em>566 F.3d at 561 (quoting <em>Ramirez v. Dretke, </em>396 F.3d 646, 649 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>(5th Cir.2005)). \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous only if it is implausible in the light of the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Rivera v. Quarterman, </em>505 F.3d 349, 361 (5th Cir.2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Tucker challenges the district court\u2019s determination that his trial counsel was not ineffective when he failed to specifically request a unanimity-of-theory jury instruction. Tucker further challenges the district court\u2019s determination that his appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to adequately brief the issue of whether the district court\u2019s failure to charge the jury with a specific unanimity-of-theory instruction satisfied the requirements of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\n<em>I. Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees a defendant in a criminal prosecution the right to effective assistance of counsel. U.S. Const, amend. VI. In order to make a showing that the defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel, the defendant must meet the two-prong test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under the <em>Strickland </em>test, the defendant must show that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Id. </em>In making its determination, a court must take steps to \u201celiminate the distorting effects of hindsight\u201d and \u201cevaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Under <em>Strickland, </em>this court can look at either prong first; \u201cif either one is found dispositive, it is not necessary to address the other.\u201d <em>United States v. Webster, </em>392 F.3d 787, 794 n. 12 (5th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Buxton v. Lynaugh, </em>879 F.2d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">The first prong of <em>Strickland </em>requires that counsel\u2019s performance fall below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. For counsel\u2019s performance to be objectively unreasonable, counsel\u2019s errors must be so serious that he is not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052. It is not the province of this court, however, to second guess an attorney\u2019s strategic decisions; rather, we \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. With regard to the prejudice prong, the court must determine whether the \u201cerrors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Put simply, to establish the prejudice prong there must be a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the jury would have reached a different conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">On direct appeal, Tucker argued for the first time that the district court erred by failing to include a specific unanimity-of-theory jury instruction. <em>Tucker, </em>345 F.3d at 336. Tucker claimed that each count of the indictment listed thirty mailings, and that each listing could support a separate act of securities fraud or mail fraud. Thus, Tucker argued that his counsel\u2019s failure to request a specific unanimity-of-theory instruction was objectively unreasonable, and that the jury\u2019s guilty verdict might not have been unanimous as to which mailing Tucker <em>caused </em>\u2014 i.e., preju-dicially ineffective. <em>Id. </em>Because Tucker raised this issue for the first time on appeal, our court reviewed for plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 333; <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). Based on Fifth Circuit precedent this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>court concluded that the district court did not commit plain error by omitting a unanimity-of-theory instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 336-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">This court\u2019s precedent supporting its decision on direct appeal is relevant to Tucker\u2019s present \u00a7 2255 appeal. This court primarily relied upon <em>United States v. Gipson, </em>553 F.2d 453 (5th Cir.1977) and <em>United States v. Holley, </em>942 F.2d 916 (5th Cir.1991). While <em>Gipson </em>established that a defendant not only has a right to a unanimous verdict, but also has the right to unanimity in the theory of which actions constituted the crime charged, Tucker\u2019s reliance on <em>Gipson </em>is misplaced. <em>Gipson, </em>553 F.2d at 457. <em>Gipson </em>differed from the present case because the trial judge improperly instructed the jurors that they could convict Gipson as long as each of them found that Gipson had committed one of the six enumerated actions prohibited by the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 458. Furthermore, <em>Gipson </em>explained that in cases where the trial judge does not misinstruct the jury, \u201cabsent competent evidence to the contrary, a court has no reason to assume that an inconsistent or compromise verdict is not unanimous, and therefore has no justification for inquiring into the logic behind the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457 (internal citation omitted). This presumption was repeated in <em>Holley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Like <em>Gipson, Holley </em>found that \u201ca general unanimity instruction will ensure that the jury is unanimous on the factual basis for a conviction, even where the indictment alleges numerous factual bases for criminal liability.\u201d <em>Holley, </em>942 F.2d at 925-26 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). This rule fails only where \u201cthere exists a genuine risk that the jury is confused or that a conviction may occur as the result of different jurors concluding that a defendant committed different acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 926 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Holley, </em>before the instructions were submitted to the jury, Holley objected to the instructions because they did not require all of the jurors to agree \u201cin the knowing falsity of at least one particular statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 929. The <em>Holley </em>court agreed finding the indictment to be duplicitous, and concluded that there was a \u201creasonable possibility that the jury was not unanimous with respect to at least one statement in each count.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, this court ordered a new trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Both <em>Gipson </em>and <em>Holley </em>provide an outline for a defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict, and indicate that a unanimity-of-theory instruction is a constitutional right only when \u201cevidence to the contrary\u201d undermines the expectation that a general unanimity instruction suffices. This is true \u201ceven where an indictment alleges numerous factual bases for criminal liability.\u201d A habeas petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, therefore, must allege more than a duplicitous indictment. He must identify facts and circumstances that raise \u201ca genuine risk\u201d of juror confusion. These circumstances exist, according to <em>Holley, </em>where one count of the indictment includes offenses that would require the government to prove dissimilar facts. <em>Tucker, </em>345 F.3d at 336-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Other than his \u201cbare assertion that the error \u2018was plain and substantially prejudicial to him,\u2019 \u201d Tucker has failed to identify facts and circumstances that juror confusion was likely.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This court has previously stated as much in ruling on Tucker\u2019s direct appeal: \u201cTucker does not corroborate his claim of prejudicial error with a modicum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>of evidence tending to show that the jury was confused or possessed any difficulty reaching a unanimous verdict.\u201d <em>Id.-, see also Gipson, </em>553 F.2d at 457 (no error where appellant does not corroborate claim of prejudicial error with evidence that the jury was confused in reaching unanimous verdict). Because Tucker has failed to make the requisite showing, we find that the district court\u2019s finding that counsel\u2019s performance was not ineffective despite his decision not to request a unanimity-of-theory instruction was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Tucker further contends that the magistrate judge\u2019s proposed findings were clearly erroneous. The magistrate judge\u2019s proposed finding was that the \u201c[mjovant has shown that there could have been a remote possibility that jurors could not have been unanimous in their decision concerning both mailing and materiality, he has wholly failed to show any evidence that they were, in fact, confused, in disagreement, or not unanimous in their decision.\u201d Tucker argues that people other than the investors themselves might have placed the documents in the mail, and therefore no juror could have convicted him for one of the thirty offenses listed in the indictment. This argument fails as a matter of law. \u201cThe test to determine whether the defendant caused the mails to be used is whether the use was reasonably foreseeable.\u201d <em>United States v. Massey, </em>827 F.2d 995, 1002 (5th Cir.1987) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). It is of no consequence that a secretary or broker who was not named in the indictment actually placed the documents or payments in the mail on the investor\u2019s behalf. Criminal liability attaches when a person \u201cknowingly or willfully\u201d causes another to use the United States mail and commercial interstate carriers to deliver checks and negotiable instruments in furtherance of a scheme or artifice to defraud. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. Under <em>Massey, </em>an interpretation that Tucker could foresee his investors using the mails, but not their staff doing so would undoubtedly be unreasonable. Therefore, despite Tucker\u2019s argument for juror confusion, the magistrate judge\u2019s proposed finding that no confusion existed was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Similarly, Tucker\u2019s investor-by-investor argument is also inappropriate to a claim based on the lack of a unanimity-of-theory instruction. In <em>Holley, </em>a unanimity-of-theory instruction was necessary because the Government\u2019s case required proving \u201cdissimilar facts\u201d for each of the offenses contained in a single count of the indictment. 942 F.2d at 928. Without a doubt, Holley\u2019s duplicitous indictment casts doubt on the jury\u2019s ability to reach a unanimous verdict. Here, however, the Government\u2019s case requires proving similar facts for each of the offenses identified in each count of the indictment. To no avail, Tucker attempts to cast doubt on the jury\u2019s verdict by highlighting small differences between the investors <em>(e.g., </em>Mr. Kiyomura relied on his broker to mail his check, while Mr. Ei-chinger might have relied on his secretary). Contrary to Tucker\u2019s assertion, a jury could reach a unanimous verdict that Tucker \u201cset forces in motion that foresee-ably resulted in such use [of the mails].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\u201c[A]bsent competent evidence to the contrary,\u201d courts should not doubt that jurors understood the general unanimity instruction. <em>Gipson, </em>553 F.2d at 457. Thus, even where an indictment includes multiple offenses within a given count, a unanimity-of-theory instruction is not constitutionally necessary. <em>Holley, </em>942 F.2d at 925-26. Tucker\u2019s trial attorney, therefore, did not engage in unreasonable performance by failing to seek an instruction on the unanimity of the jury\u2019s theory. Trial counsel does not fall below an objective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>standard of reasonableness by failing to request a jury instruction to which the defendant is not entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">When presented with an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, this court need not address both stages of the <em>Strickland </em>inquiry if an insufficient showing is made as to one. <em>Scheanette v. Quarterman, </em>482 F.3d 815, 815-20 (5th Cir.2007). As discussed <em>swpra, </em>Tucker has failed to establish that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. Therefore, because Tucker\u2019s trial counsel did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness by failing to seek an instruction on the unanimity of the jury\u2019s theory and, thus, was not ineffective, we need not address the prejudice prong under <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\n<em>II. Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Tucker also contends that his appellate counsel (on direct appeal) was ineffective for failing to persuade this court that the omission of a unanimity-of-theory instruction was plain error. This argument rests on Tucker\u2019s assumption that \u201c[cjlearly, the District Court\u2019s unanimity instruction and mailing instruction were erroneous.... \u201d Tucker argues that this court\u2019s refusal to find plain error must have resulted from appellate counsel\u2019s sub-par performance. <em>See Tucker, </em>345 F.3d at 336-37. As explained above and in this court\u2019s earlier decision, Tucker was not entitled to a unanimity-of-theory instruction. His appellate counsel, therefore, did not engage in unreasonable performance by failing to brief the issue of whether the omission of the instruction was plain error. Even assuming that a unanimity-of-theory instruction would have been appropriate, appellate counsel did not render constitutionally infirm representation by foregoing the instruction. The Supreme Court has recognized \u201cthe importance of having the appellate advocate examine the record with a view to selecting the most promising issues for review.\u201d <em>Jones v. Barnes, </em>463 U.S. 745, 752, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983). In the present case, Tucker\u2019s appellate counsel presented the unanimity argument, and this court rejected it. In this court\u2019s opinion, nothing suggests that appellate counsel\u2019s performance was to blame.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">For the foregoing reasons, Tucker\u2019s trial counsel was not ineffective despite the decision not to request a specific unanimity-of-theory jury instruction. Likewise, Tucker\u2019s appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to persuade this court that the jury instructions were incorrect. Therefore, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
