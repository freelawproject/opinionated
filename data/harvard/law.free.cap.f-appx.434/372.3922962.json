The complaint alleged that Rodrigues was \u201ccharged\u201d and \u201cmaliciously prosecuted\u201d in Potter County in 2005 for aggravated kid-naping (case # 50,335-D) even though he was acquitted by a grand jury of the charge and that he was sent \u201cto prison with a 15 year sentence for aggravated assault, a conviction that doesn\u2019t belong to\u201d him. According to Rodrigues, this aggravated assault conviction (case # 32,784-C) is in the name of Leonard Christopher Cantly. He believes that he is wrongly being held in custody pursuant to Cantly\u2019s aggravated assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">The dismissal of Rodrigues\u2019s claims, as both frivolous and for failure to state a claim, is reviewed de novo, using the same standard of review applicable to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) dismissals. <em>Samford v. Dretke, </em>562 F.3d 674, 678 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Geiger v. lowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). A review of the record reveals that the district court correctly determined that Rodrigues\u2019s claims were foreclosed by <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973), and barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Rodrigues\u2019s attack on Cantly\u2019s conviction, as well as his attack on his own aggravated assault conviction, to the extent he seeks release from confinement, must be raised in a habeas corpus proceeding, not a \u00a7 1983 action, <em>see Preiser, </em>411 U.S. at 499-500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, and to the extent he seeks damages for his illegal imprisonment, his complaint is barred by <em>Heck </em>because, and contrary to his arguments, he can only satisfy the <em>Heck </em>requirements by having a court declare his convictions invalid in a habeas proceeding, which he has not done. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-19\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
