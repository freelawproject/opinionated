Acting as conservator of Freddie Mac pursuant to federal law, the Federal Housing Finance Agency successfully moved in the district court to substitute itself as plaintiff in those actions. The shareholders appeal this ruling. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In 1970, Congress established Freddie Mac to promote homeownership by competing with the Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) in the secondary residential mortgage market. <em>See </em>Fed. Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Act, Pub.L. No. 91-351, \u00a7 301, 84 Stat. 450, 451 (1970) (codified as amended at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1451 et seq.); Fed. Nat\u2019l Mortgage Ass\u2019n Charter Act, ch. 847, \u00a7 301, 48 Stat. 1246, 1252 (1934) (codified as amended at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1716 et seq.). Although both enterprises are structured as private corporations, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are government-sponsored institutions. <em>Id. </em>They \u201chave an affirmative obligation to facilitate the financing of affordable housing for low\u2014 and moderate-income families in a manner consistent with their overall public purposes, while maintaining a strong financial condition and a reasonable economic return.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4501(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">To provide \u201cmore effective Federal regulation\u201d of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, Congress created the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (the \u201cOffice\u201d) in 1992. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 102-550, \u00a7\u00a7 1302, 1311, 106 Stat. 3672, 3941-44 (1992); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4501(2). The Office was responsible for making annual reports to Congress on \u201cthe financial safety and soundness\u201d of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Pub.L. No. 102-550, \u00a7\u00a7 1317, 1319B, 106 Stat. at 3949, 3950. In 2007 and 2008, the Office conveyed positive reports on the fiscal health of both enterprises, describing them as \u201cadequately capitalized.\u201d <em>See In re Fed. Home Mortgage Corp. Derivative Litig., </em>643 F.Supp.2d 790, 792 (E.D.Va. 2009) <em>(\u201cIn re Freddie Mac </em>\u201d). In reality, however, Freddie Mac was poised to report considerable losses: $3.1 billion in 2007 and $50.1 billion in 2008. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">In 2008, amid these extensive losses, Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (the \u201cAct\u201d). The Act abolished the Office and another government entity, the Federal Housing Finance Board, and in their stead created the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the \u201cAgency\u201d). <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 110-289 \u00a7\u00a7 1301-1314, 122 Stat. 2654, 2794-99 (2008). The shareholders allege, and the Agency does not dispute, that the Agency\u2019s leadership and staff is \u201csubstantially unchanged\u201d from that of the Office. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 10. Indeed, the Agency\u2019s director, James Lockhart, is the former director of the Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">The Act grants the Agency\u2019s director the authority to appoint the Agency as conservator or receiver of Freddie Mac in the event the enterprise becomes \u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617. Pursuant to this authority, on September 6, 2008, Lockhart appointed the Agency as conservator of Freddie Mac. <em>See In re Freddie Mac, </em>643 F.Supp.2d at 793. As such, the Agency \u201csucceed[ed] to all rights, titles, powers, and privileges of [Freddie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Mac], and of any stockholder, officer, or director of [Freddie Mac] with respect to [Freddie Mac] and the assets of [Freddie Mac],\u201d and is empowered to \u201ctake over the assets of and operate [Freddie Mac] with all the powers of the shareholders, the directors, and the officers of [Freddie Mac] and conduct all business of [Freddie Mac] \u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(b)(2)(A)(i), (B)(i). The Act further provides that, except under limited circumstances not at issue here, \u201cno court may take any action to restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of the [Agency] as a conservator or a receiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4617(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">After its appointment as conservator, the Agency successfully moved to substitute itself as plaintiff in the consolidated actions in place of the shareholders. Thereafter, upon the Agency\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed the actions without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The district court, interpreting the Act, concluded that \u201cthe plain meaning of the statute is that <em>all </em>rights previously held by Freddie Mac\u2019s stockholders, including the right to sue derivatively, now belong exclusively to the [Agency].\u201d <em>In re Freddie Mac, </em>643 F.Supp.2d at 795 (emphasis in original). The court found support in the Act\u2019s provision explicitly granting conservators and receivers \u201call rights, titles, powers, and privileges\u201d of \u201cany stockholder,\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4 617(b)(2)(A)\u00ae, and the provision barring courts from \u201crestraining] or affect[ing] the exercise of powers or functions of the [Agency] as a conservator or receiver,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4617(f). <em>See In re Freddie Mac, </em>643 F.Supp.2d at 797 (\u201cThis language clearly demonstrates Congressional intent to transfer as much control of Freddie Mac as possible to the [Agency], including any right to sue on behalf of the corporation.\u201d). Further, the district court relied on case law interpreting the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, which has similar provisions transferring stockholders\u2019 \u201crights, titles, powers, and privileges\u201d to federal bank receivers and conservators. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(d)(2)(A)\u00ae, (B)(i); <em>see also Pareto v. FDIC, </em>139 F.3d 696, 700 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201cCongress has transferred everything it could to the FDIC, and that includes a stockholder\u2019s right, power or privilege to demand corporate action or to sue directors or others when action is not forthcoming.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">The shareholders appeal the substitution order, contending that under the Act the appointment of a receiver or conservator does not preclude a shareholder\u2019s derivative action. Our jurisdiction to hear this appeal arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Chao v. Rivendell Woods, Inc., </em>415 F.3d 342, 345 (4th Cir.2005) (explaining voluntary dismissal of entire action without prejudice is a final decision appealable under \u00a7 1291). We review questions of statutory interpretation <em>de novo. United States v. Abuagla, </em>336 F.3d 277, 278 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">Having carefully considered the record, the briefs and arguments of the parties, and the controlling and persuasive authorities, we conclude that the district court\u2019s analysis was correct. Accordingly, we affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s well reasoned opinion. <em>See In re Freddie Mac, </em>643 F.Supp.2d 790.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-23\">.

The Agency moved to dismiss the appeal, contending this court lacked jurisdiction to review the merits of the interlocutory order. Because, during the pendency of this appeal, the district court entered a final order dismissing the action, we deny as moot the Agency's motion to dismiss the appeal. <em>See Digital Equip. Corp. v.
