The district court found that Wiggins failed to comply with a condition of his supervised release-namely, participation in drug testing and an out-patient drug treatment program. Wiggins argues that the district court erred in denying him the opportunity to fully articulate his objections at his revocation hearing. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-20\">Wiggins argues that the district court violated the rule we established in <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097 (11th Cir. 1990), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by United States v. Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136, 1137-38 (11th Cir.1993) (en banc), that after imposing a sentence, \u201cthe district court must give the parties an opportunity ... to object to the district court\u2019s ultimate findings of fact and conclusions of law, and to the manner in which the sentence is pronounced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1102. In <em>Jones, </em>we \u201cinstruct[ed] the district courts to elicit fully articulated objections, following imposition of sentence, to the court\u2019s ultimate findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he objection-elicitation requirement ... is applicable to supervised release revocation proceedings.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number><em>States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir.2007). This Court has held that when the district court merely asks if there is \u201canything further?\u201d or \u201canything else?\u201d and neither party responds with objections, the district court has failed to elicit fully articulated objections as required by <em>Jones. See id. </em>at 1348; <em>see also United States v. Holloway, </em>971 F.2d 675, 681 (11th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Snyder, </em>941 F.2d 1427, 1428 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Wiggins\u2019s argument that the district court failed to elicit objections at his revocation hearing lacks merit. After imposing Wiggins\u2019s within-guideline sentence and revoking his conditional supervised release, the district court asked Wiggins\u2019s counsel if he had \u201cany objections or other matters we need to put on the record.\u201d Wiggins\u2019s counsel responded by saying: \u201cNo, sir.\u201d Unlike the cases in which the district court merely asked if counsel had \u201canything else\u201d or \u201canything further,\u201d here the district court clearly asked Wiggins\u2019s counsel if he had \u201cany objections ... to put on the record.\u201d On this record, we cannot say that the district court failed to elicit fully articulated objections as required by <em>Jones.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM Wiggins\u2019s sentence and the district court\u2019s revocation of his conditional supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-9\">. Because Wiggins challenges solely the district court\u2019s failure to elicit fully articulated objections, he has waived any other claims related to the revocation of his supervised release and imposition of his twelve-month sentence by failing to argue their merits on appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>see also Norelus v. Denny\u2019s Inc., </em>628 F.3d 1270, 1296-97 (11th Cir.2010) (explaining that it is \u201cby now well settled in this Circuit that a legal claim or argument that has not been briefed before the court is deemed abandoned and its merits will not be addressed\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
