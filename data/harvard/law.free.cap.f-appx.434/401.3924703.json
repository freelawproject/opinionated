Weisner alleged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the defendants used excessive force on him during the execution of a search warrant of his home, which caused him physical injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Weisner was appointed counsel, who filed two amended complaints. The first amended complaint listed as defendants Bexar County Sheriffs Office, Deputy Douglas, and three unnamed, or \u201cJohn Doe\u201d deputies, but the second amended complaint dropped the three unnamed deputies as defendants and substituted Bexar County for the Bexar County Sheriffs Office. In addition to alleging that Douglas used excessive force, the amended complaint also alleged state law claims of battery and gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The magistrate judge, who conducted the proceedings by the parties\u2019 consent, granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to the Weisner\u2019s \u00a7 1988 claims against Bexar County but denied summary judgment on the state law claims against Bexar County and denied summary judgment on all of the claims against Douglas. The magistrate judge later granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the state law claims against Bexar County, however, and the remaining claims against Douglas were tried by a jury, which returned a verdict in favor of Douglas. The magistrate judge entered a final judgment in favor of Douglas and against Weisner. Weisner filed a timely notice of appeal and moved to proceed IFP on appeal. The magistrate judge denied Weisner\u2019s motion to proceed IFP, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith because she could not discern what issues Weisner sought to challenge on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Weisner has filed a motions in this court for leave to proceed IFP on appeal and for the appointment of counsel. \u201cAn appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3). Weisner\u2019s IFP motion is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s ruling that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Our inquiry into the litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation omitted). If we uphold the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith, the appellant must pay the filing fee or the appeal will be dismissed for want of prosecution. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Alternatively, we may dismiss the appeal sua sponte under 5th Circuit Rule 42.2 if it is frivolous. <em>Id. </em>at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">In his brief, Weisner does not address or challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s reasons for dismissing the claims against Bexar County. By failing to address the reasons for the dismissal those claims, Weisner has failed to demonstrate that an appeal of the dismissal of the claims against Bexar County involves legal points arguable on their merits. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">Further, although Weisner\u2019s brief could be liberally construed as seeking to appeal the jury verdict against Douglas, his argument in support of his IFP motion, i.e., that the facts alleged in his complaint and affidavit are material and should be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, is relevant to whether summary judgment was appropriate but not to an appeal of the jury\u2019s verdict. Since Weisner\u2019s claims against Douglas were not resolved on summary judgment but were tried by a jury, Weisner has failed to show that an appeal of the jury\u2019s verdict would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>involve legal points arguable on their merits. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Accordingly, Weisner\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24. His motion for the appointment of counsel is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The dismissal of Weisner\u2019s appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Weis-ner is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">IFP DENIED; MOTION FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
