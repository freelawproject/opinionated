At his sentencing hearing, his sister-in-law and mother-in-law gave victim-impact statements. They asked the district court to sentence Case to a maximum term because of his negative character and the negative impact of his crime on the family. The court thereafter sentenced Case to a within-Guidelines term of 100-months\u2019 imprisonment. Case now argues that the court impermissibly considered these statements because neither his sister-in-law nor his mother-in-law were \u201cvictims\u201d of his crime, thus rendering his sentence unreasonable. Even assuming that neither of his in-laws were direct victims of his crime, that fact is irrelevant. Congress expressly provided that a court may consider any \u201cinformation concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense ... for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661. Courts thus have \u201clargely unlimited\u201d discretion to consider whatever information they find relevant to imposing sentence. <em>E.g., Pepper v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1229,1240,179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). So the district court could freely consider these statements in imposing Case\u2019s sentence, regardless of whether the in-laws were properly characterized as \u201cvictims.\u201d And in any event, the district court explained that it limited its consideration of these statements \u201cto how these persons were victimized as opposed to details and facts that are not in evidence and hearsay, and so forth\u201d \u2014 even though the court permissibly could have considered those details and facts. [R.42, at 29-30.]</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">To the extent that Case also challenges his sentence as substantively unreasonable, that challenge also fails. The fact that the court rejected the Government\u2019s recommendation of a lesser sentence cannot by itself rebut the presumption of substantive reasonableness accorded to within-Guidelines sentences, especially where, as here, the sentencing transcript reflects the court\u2019s careful, nonarbitrary consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the defendant\u2019s arguments. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>579 F.3d 672, 677 (6th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
