Williams contends that the district court: imposed a procedurally unreasonable sentence; deprived him of due process by failing to conduct a <em>de novo </em>resentencing following our remand in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>609 F.3d 1168, 1169 (11th Cir.2010); erred in classifying him as a career offender based on his conviction under Florida law for resisting an officer with violence; and imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In 2004 a jury found Williams guilty of possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). At sentencing, his base offense level was enhanced from 30 to 37 because he qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) based on his prior convictions for battery on a law enforcement officer (\u201cBOLEO\u201d) in 1996 and possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine in 1997. Williams had also been convicted of resisting an officer with violence in 1996, but the PSI did not rely on that conviction in classifying him as a career offender. Based on his criminal history category of VI and his adjusted offense level of 37, Williams\u2019 then-mandatory guidelines range was 360 months to life imprisonment, and the district court sentenced Williams to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">On appeal, we affirmed Williams\u2019 conviction but remanded the case for re-sentencing because the district court had failed to state its reasons for imposing a life sentence, which was required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1). <em>United States v. Williams, </em>438 F.3d 1272, 1274 (11th Cir.2006) <em>(\u201cWilliams I\u201d). </em>We rejected the remainder of Williams\u2019 arguments. <em>Williams I, </em>438 F.3d at 1273-74. At his first re-sentencing, Williams objected to being categorized as a career offender based on the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>State v. Hearns, </em>961 So.2d 211 (Fla.2007), which held that BOLEO was not a forcible felony under Florida\u2019s violent career criminal statute. The district court responded by noting that it was proceeding pursuant to a limited remand and that the only intervening change in federal law was <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which had rendered the guidelines advisory. To aid appellate review, however, the district court again determined that Williams\u2019 BOLEO conviction constituted a crime of violence under federal law and that Williams qualified as a career offender under the guidelines. Williams\u2019 advisory guidelines range was calculated to be 360 months to life imprisonment. The district court denied Williams\u2019 request for a downward variance, stated its reasons for imposing its sentence, and re-sentenced Williams to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">Williams appealed his second life sentence, which we affirmed. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>563 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2009) <em>(\u201cWilliams II\u201d). </em>In <em>Williams II, </em>we explained that under <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>528 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2008), whether a conviction under state law constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the guidelines is a question of federal law. <em>Williams II, </em>563 F.3d at 1242-43. Accordingly, the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hearns </em>could not overrule this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Glover, </em>431 F.3d 744 (11th Cir.2005), which held that a BOLEO conviction constitutes a crime of violence under the guidelines. <em>Williams II, </em>563 F.3d at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">The Supreme Court later reversed our decision in <em>Johnson, </em>holding that the Florida felony offense of battery was not cate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>gorically a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1274, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). The Supreme Court also vacated and remanded our decision in <em>Williams II </em>in light of its holding in <em>Johnson. Williams v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1734, 176 L.Ed.2d 209 (2010). On remand, we vacated Williams\u2019 sentence and remanded for another re-sentencing. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>609 F.3d 1168, 1169 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(\u201cWilliams III\u201d). </em>Specifically, we held that in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Johnson, </em>Williams\u2019 BO-LEO conviction standing alone could not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the \u201cphysical force\u201d subdivision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l). <em>Williams III, </em>609 F.3d at 1169-70. We noted, however, that it was unclear under which subdivision of the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d definition the district court had considered Williams\u2019 BOLEO conviction and that Williams had also been convicted of resisting an officer with violence. <em>Id. </em>at 1169-70, n. 1. Accordingly, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-9\">To the extent that the district court believed that Williams\u2019s conviction for [BOLEO] was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because it involved \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\u201d and thus qualified for enhancement, the sentence must be set aside. Accordingly, we vacate Williams\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing consistent with this opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">On remand, the parties filed a joint motion to continue sentencing, requesting that a new PSI be prepared and objections be permitted because the existing PSI had erroneously based Williams\u2019 career offender status on the BOLEO conviction. The district court denied the motion. At Williams\u2019 second re-sentencing the court stated that despite Williams\u2019 insistence that a <em>de novo </em>re-sentencing was required it would only address his career offender status in light of the limited basis for our remand in <em>Williams III. </em>The probation officer asserted at the hearing that Williams still qualified as a career offender based on his conviction for resisting an officer with violence. In support of that position, the probation officer noted that we held that a conviction for resisting an officer with violence constituted a violent felony under the residual clause of the ACCA in an unpublished manuscript opinion that had been issued five days earlier. <em>See United States v. Hayes, </em>No. 09-12024, 2010 WL 3489973, manuscript op. (11th Cir. Sept. 8, 2010), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>2010 WL 5122587 (11th Cir. Dec.16, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-15\">The district court found that the probation officer correctly calculated Williams\u2019 base offense level at 37 in light of his reclassification as a career offender based on his convictions for resisting an officer with violence and possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine. The district court again resentenced Williams to life imprisonment, and Williams objected to the sentence as procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-17\">Williams argues that the district court deprived him of due process and violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>by denying his motion to continue his sentencing and his request to order the preparation of a new PSI, or, alternatively, by failing to allow him to submit written objections because the probation officer raised a new basis for the career offender classification at his second re-sentencing hearing. Williams also argues that the district court failed to give meaningful consideration to his \u00a7 3558(a) arguments despite the fact that our remand in <em>Williams III </em>required a new re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s compliance with a mandate. <em>United States v. Crape, </em>603 F.3d 1237, 1241 (11th Cir. 2010). A district court\u2019s denial of a motion to continue sentencing is reviewed only for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>489 F.3d 1117, 1128 (11th Cir. 2007) (\u201cThe defendant has the burden to demonstrate that the denial was an abuse of discretion and that it produced specific substantial prejudice.\u201d). We review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>586 F.3d 1283, 1284 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">When we vacate a judgment for consideration in light of a particular decision, the effect is \u201cmuch more limited in nature\u201d than a general vacatur, as it does not nullify all prior proceedings in the case. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>329 F.3d 1250, 1252 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). Both the Supreme Court and this Court vacated and remanded the judgment in this case in light of <em>Johnson, </em>which was relevant only as to Williams\u2019 career offender status. The plain language of our decision in <em>Williams III </em>vacated the district court\u2019s sentence only \u201cto the extent\u201d that it was premised on Williams\u2019 classification as a career offender based on the treatment of his BOLEO conviction as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l), and we remanded for \u201cre-sentencing <em>consistent with [that] opinion.\u201d Williams III, </em>609 F.3d at 1170 (emphasis added). Thus, while we did not expressly reaffirm the other components of Williams\u2019 sentence, our mandate in <em>Williams III </em>was limited to the issue of whether Williams had been properly classified as a career offender in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson. Williams III, </em>609 F.3d at 1169. Accordingly, the district court did not err by refusing to conduct a <em>de novo </em>re-sentencing or by failing to consider Williams\u2019 arguments concerning the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before again imposing a life sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">In complying with our mandate in <em>Williams III, </em>the district court did not deprive Williams of due process or impose a procedurally unreasonable sentence. First, Williams cannot show that he was prejudiced by the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to continue sentencing because he was on notice that his conviction for resisting an officer with violence could be used to enhance his sentence based on our remand in <em>Williams III, </em>which specifically identified that conviction as a possible predicate offense for the career offender enhancement. <em>See Williams III, </em>609 F.3d at 1170 n. 1. Furthermore, the district court allowed Williams to object to the use of that conviction as a basis for the career offender enhancement and to argue the merits of <em>Hayes </em>and other relevant cases. The district court also stated on the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>its reasons for imposing a life sentence: \u201cBased on the defendant\u2019s lengthy criminal activity beginning age 13, a [sentence at the] high end of the guideline range would protect the public from further crimes, [and] would act as a deterrent.\u201d The court was not required to \u201cstate on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Williams\u2019 argument that he was improperly classified as a career offender based on his conviction for resisting an officer with violence is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341 (11th Cir.2010), which expressly adopted the reasoning of <em>Hayes </em>and held that a conviction under Florida law for resisting an officer with violence constituted a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cThis court has repeatedly read the definition of a \u2018violent felony\u2019 under \u00a7 924(e) of the Armed Career Criminal Act as \u2018virtually identical\u2019 to the definition of a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-12\">. Rule 32 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-13\">The probation officer must conduct a pre-sentence investigation and submit a report to the court before it imposes sentence unless ... the court finds that the information in the record enables it to meaningfully exercise its sentencing authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, and the court explains its finding on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(l)(A)(ii).

In light of the district court\u2019s compliance with our limited remand, which only required the district court to re-sentence Williams in light of the Supreme Court's holding in <em>Johnson, </em>we likewise decline to address Williams\u2019 contentions concerning the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
