McDade moved for IFP below, but the district court denied McDade\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">This court\u2019s inquiry into a litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). If this court upholds the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith, the appellant must pay the filing fee or the appeal will be dismissed for want of prosecution. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Alternatively, this court may dismiss the appeal sua sponte under 5th Cir. R. 42.2 if it is frivolous. <em>Id. </em>at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">McDade argues that the district court improperly sentenced him as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Relying on <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003), McDade argues that Rule 60(b) is a proper vehicle for bringing his sentencing claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">In <em>Castro, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that a district court intending to recharac-terize a pro se pleading as an initial \u00a7 2255 motion must notify the pro se litigant of the intended recharacterization, inform the litigant of the consequences that the re-characterization will have on subsequent \u00a7 2255 motions, and provide the litigant with an opportunity to withdraw or amend the motion. 540 U.S. at 383, 124 S.Ct. 786. Nothing in <em>Castro </em>suggests that Rule 60(b) may be used to collaterally attack a criminal judgment. This appeal is thus \u201cfrom the denial of a meaningless, unauthorized motion.\u201d <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, McDade\u2019s appeal of the dismissal of this motion is dismissed as frivolous. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">McDade is cautioned that any future frivolous pleadings filed by him in this court or in any court subject to the jurisdiction of this court will subject him to sanctions. To avoid sanctions, McDade should review any pending matters to ensure that they are not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
