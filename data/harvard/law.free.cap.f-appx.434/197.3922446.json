On appeal, he challenges his twenty-eight-month sentence, arguing the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a downward variance and that his sentence, in this regard, is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">By written motion prior to sentencing and again at sentencing, Blackman requested a downward variance on three grounds. First, Blackman requested the district court vary downward based on his policy argument that <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 2A3.5 (2009), as presently constituted, allows only a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility for tier I and tier II offenders whereas tier III offenders may receive as much as a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in, according to Blackman, an unwarranted sentencing disparity among defendants with similar records that have been found guilty of similar conduct. Second, Black-man argued a sentence in the Guidelines range was greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006), because he merely violated a registration provision of a non-punitive statute. Last, Blackman, focusing on the \u201ccharacteristics of the defendant\u201d factor of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), alleged he has \u201congoing problems with substance abuse\u201d and that \u201cthe vast majority of the incidents listed in his presentence report are substance abuse related as charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">At sentencing on September 20, 2010, Blackman made no objections to the pre-sentence report or to the established advisory Guidelines range. The district court first heard lengthy argument on Black-man\u2019s motion for a variance based on his policy argument pertaining to USSG \u00a7 2A3.5. The district court ultimately denied the motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-12\">I\u2019m not prepared to conclude that the Guidelines are flawed. And I am not sure that you are arguing that they are flawed. It is just a question of the Commission giving anybody a little more break \u2014 or an opportunity for a reduction; is that the right way to describe it \u2014 for a higher-tiered defendant and then, therefor [sic], based on your position, the lesser-tiered defendant end up with less off and the higher-tiered defendant who starts at a higher level gets more off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-13\">It might be worthwhile \u2014 and, again, it is up to the Commission \u2014 it is not up to the court-to, at least, consider that circumstance \u2014 and maybe they did, maybe they did, but consider than circumstance \u2014 and see if it requires any change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-14\">But I do not find that the Guidelines are flawed in connection with this nor that it is such an inequity that it would be a basis for me to vary in this case on this basis.... I am not prepared to conclude that the Commission\u2019s policy is flawed because of the decisions that were made, a new [Guideline coming in and allowing for the three levels. But I have considered your position and I do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>not conclude that it is a basis for a variance in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Blackman again posited as his second basis for a downward variance that \u201cfailure to register cases are different than other criminal cases[,] because the purpose of ... SORNA [Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act] ... is not to punish people.\u201d The court denied the motion on this argument, responding that \u201c[t]here is a criminal penalty that comes into play ... in the end, [SORNA] does provide for a criminal punishment that has withstood Ex Post Facto arguments.\u201d With respect to Blackman\u2019s reliance on his substance abuse related offenses, the district court acknowledged that Blackman had some substance abuse treatment problems, but concluded that the record did not support a basis for the district court to vary.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">After hearing from the parties and allowing Blackman an opportunity to allo-cute, the district court analyzed the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) factors, -with due consideration to this Court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009), that district courts should render an individualized sentence in imposing sentence. The district court sentenced Blackman towards the bottom of the Guidelines range to twenty-eight months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">On appeal, Blackman argues the district court erred in denying his motion for a downward variance on the three specified grounds and that the district court\u2019s denial of his motion rendered his sentence proee-durally and substantively unreasonable. A sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This review requires consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Id.; see United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 575 (4th Cir.2010). A sentence imposed within the properly calculated Guidelines range is presumed reasonable by this court. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d 212, 217 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">In determining the procedural reasonableness of a sentence, this court considers whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, analyzed any arguments presented by the parties, and sufficiently explained the selected sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Blackman does not dispute that the district court properly calculated his Guidelines range under the advisory Guidelines. However, he argues his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory. Specifically, he argues, when the district court denied his motion for a downward variance based on his Guideline policy argument, the district court improperly stated it was not up to the court, but rather the Commission, to consider the circumstance and see if it required any change. Blackman argues that this statement indicates that the district court effectively treated the Guidelines as mandatory. Similarly, Blackman claims the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory in rejecting his motion for a downward variance on the ground that he violated the registration provision of a non-punitive statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">Because Blackman requested a sentence below the Guidelines range on the above-cited grounds, his claim was properly preserved, and we review for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard, reversing \u201cunless ... the error was harmless.\u201d <em>Lynn, </em>592 F.3d at 576, 578 (\u201cBy drawing arguments from \u00a7 3553 for a sentence different than the one ultimately imposed, an aggrieved party sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>alerts the district court of its responsibility to render an individualized explanation addressing those arguments, and thus preserves its claim.\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Hernandez, </em>603 F.3d 267, 270 (4th Cir. 2010) (reviewing claim of procedural unreasonableness for plain error because defendant did not argue for a sentence different from the sentence that he received).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">It is now well established that a district court may consider policy objections to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 101-07, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court held that a district court may deviate from the advisory Guidelines range for crack cocaine offenses based on its conclusion that the disparity between ranges for crack and powder cocaine results in a sentence greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 91, 128 S.Ct. 558. The Court has since reinforced the point that \u201cdistrict courts are entitled to reject and vary categorically from the ... Guidelines based on a policy disagreement with those Guidelines.\u201d <em>Spears v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 261, 266, 129 S.Ct. 840, 843-44, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009). In <em>Moore v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 1, 1, 129 S.Ct. 4, 172 L.Ed.2d 1 (2008) (per curiam), the Court held that the sentencing court committed procedural error because it did not believe it had discretion to depart from the Guidelines under <em>Kimbrough, </em>because it stated \u201cCongress is the one who looks at the [Guidelines and decides whether or not they should be put in-in force.... It isn\u2019t the judges.\u201d <em>Id.-, see also United States v. Herder, </em>594 F.3d 352, 362-63 (4th Cir.) (vacating sentence when district court \u201crefused to consider a variation from the Guidelines in light of the 67:1 ratio between crack and powder cocaine at Herder\u2019s offense level\u201d because the district court found that \u201c \u2018Congress has decided that that\u2019s an appropriate ratio to establish\u2019 \u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3440, 177 L.Ed.2d 346 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">While in isolation the district court\u2019s statement that it is up to the Commission to decide whether a change in the Guideline is warranted supports Black-man\u2019s contention, a review of the district court\u2019s entire analysis makes clear that the district court recognized its authority to vary from the Guidelines range in Black-man\u2019s case but simply declined to exercise that authority. Specifically, the court stated: \u201cI do not find that the Guidelines are flawed in connection with this nor that it is such an inequity that it would be a basis for me to vary in this case on this basis.... I am not prepared to conclude that the Commission\u2019s policy is flawed because of the decisions that were made.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">This court has made clear that an appellate court\u2019s analysis should focus on what the district court \u201cactually did,\u201d not on whether it used some forbidden phrase. <em>Mendozar-Mendoza, </em>597 F.3d at 218-19 (instructing appellate courts should not \u201cnitpick\u201d or \u201cflyspeck\u201d every transcript they review, or play \u201cGotcha!\u201d with district court judges). Rather, to afford the appropriate amount of deference to district court judges, this court must look to the \u201cfull context\u201d of the sentencing transcript to determine whether the district court properly understood its rights and responsibilities. <em>Id. </em>We conclude the record reflects that the district court acknowledged its authority to vary from the Guidelines range with regard to the Guideline policy argument, but ultimately disagreed with Blackman\u2019s argument, thereby denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Blackman\u2019s cursory argument that the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory with respect to his assertion that SORNA is not a punitive statute is without merit. Blackman construes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>district court\u2019s words that there is a criminal penalty and a Guideline that come into play as indicative of the district court\u2019s treatment of the Guidelines as mandatory. Such a reading is unsupported. We conclude the district court\u2019s statement merely reflected the court\u2019s acknowledgement that SORNA has a criminal penalty and an attendant Guideline provision for non-compliance with the registration requirements. The district court\u2019s statements therefore did not render Blackman\u2019s sentence procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Blackman also generally challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting the three proffered bases for a downward variance. To the extent Blackman suggests the district court should have adopted his policy argument, <em>Kimbrough </em>does not require appellate courts to discard \u201cthe presumption of reasonableness for sentences based on non-empirically-grounded Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009); <em>see also United States v. Talamantes, </em>620 F.3d 901, 901 (8th Cir.2010) (per curiam). While \u201cdistrict courts certainly may disagree with the Guidelines for policy reasons and may adjust a sentence accordingly[,] ... if they do not, [appellate courts] will not second-guess their decisions under a more lenient standard simply because the particular Guideline is not empirically-based.\u201d <em>Mon-dragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 367. We therefore conclude the presumption of reasonableness applies to this court\u2019s review of Blackman\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Blackman\u2019s arguments on appeal fail to rebut the presumption that his within-Guidelines sentence was reasonable. In this case, the district court heard argument at length from both parties on the motion for a downward variance. Ultimately, the court explicitly rejected Black-man\u2019s argument that the Guideline was flawed and found the other two arguments unpersuasive grounds to vary. We conclude Blackman\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Blackman\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
