Moore appeals from, an order of the district court revoking the.magistrate judge\u2019s pretrial order granting' release on bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">The district court revoked the magistrate judge\u2019s order, determining that there., were no conditions or combination of con-, ditions that would reasonably assure Moore\u2019s presence at trial if Moore were released. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e) &amp; (f). We' review the order issued by the district court, not that of the magistrate judge.* <em>United States v. Westbrook, </em>780 F.2d 1185, 1188 n. 4 (5th Cir.1986). Absent an error-of law, we will uphold a district court\u2019s \u2022 pretrial detention order if it is supported by the proceedings below. <em>United States v. Rueben, </em>974 F.2d 580, 585-86 (5th Cir. : 1992).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Having reviewed the transcript of proceedings and other pertinent portions of the record in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3142(g), we conclude that the district court\u2019s conclusions are supported by the record. <em>See id. </em>at 586; <em>see also United States v. Fortna, </em>769 F.2d 243, 249 (5th Cir.1985). Furthermore, Moore is not entitled to release for any delay on the part of the district court in ruling on the Government\u2019s motion to revoke. <em>See United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, </em>495 U.S. 711, 717-722, 110 S.Ct. 2072, 109 L.Ed.2d 720 (1990); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145(a). Accordingly, we conclude that it is unnecessary to reach the question of whether there was a delay; similarly, we do not reach the question of what other \u201cremedy\u201d would be appropriate for such a delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The pretrial order of detention is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-10\">. Moore challenges this standard of review employed by our court. Under the rule of orderliness, we are bound by our prior precedent except in certain situations not applicable here. <em>French v. Allstate Indem.Co. </em>637 F.3d 571, 589 (5th Cir.2011) In any event, we conclude that, so long as we give some deference to the district court's factual findings, the outcome would be the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
