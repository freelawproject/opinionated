We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-19\">This Court reviews orders granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>determining whether the district court properly concluded \u201cthat there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). In making this determination, \u201cthe court is required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought. The inferences to be drawn from the underlying affidavits, exhibits, interrogatory answers, and depositions must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Nationwide Life Ins. Co. v. Bankers Leasing Ass\u2019n, </em>182 F.3d 157, 160 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Cronin v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>46 F.3d 196, 202 (2d Cir.1995)). \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b58-20\">We have reviewed Butler\u2019s claims under the First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and, like the district court, conclude that the alleged violations do not rise to the level of constitutional deprivations.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-21\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
