We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we dismiss the appeal as waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-22\">Gutierrez contends that he did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into the agreement to plead guilty and to waive his appeal rights in exchange for a sentencing-level reduction. If the agreement was not knowing and voluntary, the waiver of appeal is unenforceable. <em>United States v. Portillo-Cano, </em>192 F.3d 1246, 1250 (9th Cir.1999). On the other hand, if the agreement was knowing and voluntary, the waiver of appeal must be honored and we must dismiss the appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-23\">Gutierrez\u2019s decision to plead guilty at the beginning of his trial represented a voluntary and intelligent choice among the courses of action open to him. <em>See United States v. Kaczynski, </em>239 F.3d 1108, 1114 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cA plea is voluntary if it \u2018represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970))). Nothing in the record suggests that Gutierrez did not knowingly and voluntarily agree to plead guilty. Nor is there any indication that defense counsel\u2019s performance was prejudicially deficient.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Gutierrez knowingly and voluntarily entered the sentencing agreement, which included a waiver of appeal. The scope of the waiver covers the right to appeal on the grounds raised. Accordingly, we dismiss. <em>See United States v. Watson, </em>582 F.3d 974, 985-88 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b628-19\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-20\">. As a general rule, we do not review challenges to the effectiveness of counsel on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Jeronimo, </em>398 F.3d 1149, 1155 (9th Cir.2005), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Jacobo Castillo, </em>496 F.3d 947, 957 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). We leave open the possibility that Gutierrez might pursue an ineffective assistance of counsel claim though a habeas petition, despite language in the waiver of appeal that seems to bar any collateral attack, including petitions brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Because that issue is not presented here, we need not decide \u201cwhether even an express waiver of all \u00a7 2255 rights could be enforced to preclude an ineffective assistance claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>implicating the voluntariness of the waiver itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1156 n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
