McLaughlin, rosemary s. POOLER, REENA RAGGI, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b67-19\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b67-20\">Appellant Anthony Davis, proceeding pro <em>se, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-21\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a court may reduce the term of imprisonment of a \u201cdefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d Conversely, a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c) if the Guidelines \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, Application Note 1(A). The amendment at issue here, Amendment 706, effective November 2007 and was subsequently made retroactive, and reduced by two levels the base offense level associated with crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (2007) (Amendment 706); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c); <em>United States v. Regalado, </em>518 F.3d 143, 150 (2d Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is ineligible \u25a0 for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>572 F.3d 82, 84 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-22\">Here, the district court correctly concluded that Davis is not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), as his sentence was not based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by Amendment 706 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>two reasons. First, the applicable Guidelines range was based on Davis\u2019s status as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and not on the drug quantity table under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Because the career offender Guidelines were not affected by Amendment 706, \u201ca defendant convicted of crack cocaine offenses but sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 is not eligible to be resentenced under [Amendment 706].\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>572 F.3d at 85. Davis\u2019s reliance on our decision in <em>United States v. McGee </em>is misplaced, as there, unlike here, \u201cthe district court explicitly stated that it was departing from the career offender sentencing range to the level that the defendant would have been in absent the career offender status calculation and consideration,\u201d effectively sentencing the defendant under the Guidelines range applicable to crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>553 F.3d 225, 227 (2d Cir.2009)(internal quotation marks omitted). Second, even if there was any ambiguity as to the above conclusion, Amendment 706 was enacted in November 2007, and had already been incorporated into Davis\u2019s non-career offender Guidelines range when he was sentenced in May 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">We have considered Davis\u2019s other arguments on appeal and have found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
