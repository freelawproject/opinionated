While the ALJ may have erred by failing to mention the treatment notes of Drs. Coelho, Parvin, and Saunders, <em>see Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830-31 (9th Cir.1995), any such error was harmless and therefore does not justify reversal. <em>See Tommasetti v. Astrue, </em>533 F.3d 1035, 1038 (9th Cir.2008). The numbness and tingling in Roberts\u2019, hands described in Dr. Coelho\u2019s notes is not a major factor in his application for benefits, which is based more on his reports of debilitating pain and inability to grip. The ALJ did in fact consider Dr. Coelho\u2019s observation that steroid injections did not fully relieve Roberts\u2019 symptoms, and that observation also was directly contradicted by Dr. Parvin\u2019s treatment notes from November 8, 2005. Dr. Parvin\u2019s discussion of Roberts\u2019 capacity is highly equivocal and suggests that he actually believed that Roberts was able to work. Finally, Dr. Saunders\u2019 instructions to rest with no bending or lifting were clearly intended as short-term guidance only.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-22\">2. The ALJ discounted nurse practitioner Guthridge\u2019s opinion because it was contradicted by other medical evidence in the record and appeared to be based largely on Roberts\u2019 own subjective account of his symptoms. These are germane reasons for declining to credit her opinion. <em>See Valentine v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>574 F.3d 685, 694 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-23\">3. The ALJ provided clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Roberts\u2019 statements concerning his symptoms. <em>See id. </em>at 693. Roberts\u2019 statements in September of 2006 that he could lift thirty pounds contradict his other statements about his capacities. His ability to care for himself and two dogs and engage in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>other daily activities also belies his claims about the severity of his symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">4. The ALJ\u2019s failure to mention the report completed by Michael Grogan was harmless. Grogan\u2019s report focused largely on Roberts\u2019 economic condition, not his physical condition, and also appeared to be based largely on Roberts\u2019 own testimony, which the ALJ found not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b679-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Cir.
