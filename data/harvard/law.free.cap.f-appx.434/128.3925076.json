We lack jurisdiction to consider Hossain\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision and will, therefore, dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-20\">Because we write solely for the benefit of the parties, we will only briefly recite the essential facts. Hossain, a forty-five year old native and citizen of Bangladesh, entered the United States on an F-l non-immigrant student visa in 1986 and was granted legal permanent residence approximately four years later. On February 27, 2009, Hossain was issued a Notice to Appear and charged with removability, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C), as an alien convicted of a firearm-related offense after admission. At his removal proceedings Hossain conceded that he was removable as charged, but sought cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) exercised his discretion and granted the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-21\">In reaching this discretionary determination, the IJ noted the following equities weighing in Hossain\u2019s favor: Hossain \u201cfor all accounts, on the one hand, has been rather successful in the United States.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Appendix (\u201cApp\u201d) 6. He has paid all of his taxes since 1988 and has been gainfully employed for most of that time, working as an agricultural worker, taxi driver, real estate agent, construction worker, and, most recently, aspiring entrepreneur. Hossain has an eighteen-year-old son and a fifteen-year-old daughter, both of whom reside in and are citizens of the United States. He pays child support for the care of his minor daughter and he sees his children as often as he is able. He has a loving relationship with his children and would like to remain in the United States in order to be a father to them. Hossain also has a fianc\u00e9, who lives in the United States and whom he plans to marry here. Additionally, his mother is a legal permanent resident of the United States, spending several months each year here, and two of his sisters reside permanently in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The IJ also noted a number of adverse factors, which weighed against a favorable exercise of discretion. Most importantly, the IJ recognized that Hossain \u201cis in the United States Immigration Court [] because of his criminal record.\u201d App. 7. Hossain\u2019s criminal record begins with a 1995 conviction for criminal possession of a weapon, the offense for which he was charged with removability. He also has four convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol \u2014 two in 1995, one in 1998, and one in 2000. For at least two of these alcohol-related offenses, Hossain was not driving a vehicle but was nevertheless charged appropriately under New York law. Hossain also has three convictions, which the IJ characterized as \u201cde mini-mus,\u201d for marijuana possession. Hossain was not sentenced to jail for any of these drug offenses and the latter two were conditionally discharged after he pleaded guilty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Finally, Hossain\u2019s criminal record includes an arrest for assault following an incident of domestic violence with his fian-c\u00e9 that occurred in February 2009. Hos-sain and his fianc\u00e9 initially offered inconsistent testimony regarding this incident. The IJ was particularly concerned by the fact that Hossain \u201ctried to convince the Court that [the assault] was just totally inadvertent and innocent injury where it really was not.\u201d App. 10. After the IJ admonished Hossain that \u201cit is important to come to the Court with clean hands [and] to own up to all failures that an individual causes himself\u2019 when seeking discretionary relief, App. 10, Hossain admitted that he pushed his fianc\u00e9 into a piece of furniture, causing her to sustain an injury for which she received treatment at the hospital. The assault charges were subsequently dropped because Hossain\u2019s fianc\u00e9 decided not to pursue the complaint that she filed with the police. She testified at the removal proceedings that she loved Hossain, did not fear him at all, and looked forward to marrying him.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">In deciding to grant Hossain cancellation of removal, the IJ \u201cfully considered] all of the evidence of record, both pro and con\u201d and determined that \u201cthe pro probably eeks past the con\u201d because \u201cthe positive equities outweigh the criminal record in this case.\u201d App. 12. The IJ highlighted that Hossain \u201cacquitted himself rather well in relation to trying to achieve the American dream[,]\u201d App. 11, and \u201chas done a lot more than most people coming into the court.... He is a successful real estate agent, he received awards for it, he owns real estate in Philadelphia, he has spent a lot of money to open a restaurant in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Atlantic City area, he has 20 employees waiting to go back to work if he gets out.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">As for Hossain\u2019s apparent substance abuse, the IJ accepted Hossain\u2019s representations of continuing sobriety and determined that Hossain had shown clear rehabilitation. The IJ stated that Hossain\u2019s \u201clatest conviction is three years ago, the latest DUI is nine years ago.\u201d App. 12. And though \u201c[g]overnment counsel\u2019s observations are certainly worthy of consideration and [] are not wholly unreasonable, [] the Court believes or wants to believe that the respondent has truly reformed himself.\u201d App. 12. Accordingly, on balance, the IJ concluded that Hossain warranted cancellation of removal, as a matter of discretion, to \u201cgiv[e] him the one last chance to completely reform himself or redeem himself in the United States society.\u201d App. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The Government appealed the IJ\u2019s decision, arguing that the IJ failed to analyze and weigh properly the positive and negative factors in this case. The BIA sustained the Government\u2019s appeal, concluding that the circumstances presented by Hossain\u2019s case did not in fact warrant a favorable exercise of the agency\u2019s discretion. Specifically, the BIA was convinced that, although Hossain indeed had significant equities weighing in his favor, the weight of the adverse factors \u2014 namely, his extensive criminal record \u2014 precluded it from finding that it would be in the best interest of the United States to grant Hos-sain discretionary cancellation of removal. Hossain filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">\u201cRelief in the form of cancellation of removal is within the discretion of the Attorney General[.]\u201d <em>Mendez-Reyes v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>428 F.3d 187, 189 (3d Cir.2005). This Court generally lacks jurisdiction to review such discretionary decisions. <em>Id. </em>(citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)). We retain only \u201cnarrowly circumscribed\u201d jurisdiction to review \u201ccolorable [constitutional] claims or questions of law\u201d raised upon a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision regarding cancellation of removal. <em>Pareja v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>615 F.3d 180, 186 (3d Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Hossain asserts that we may exercise jurisdiction over his petition because he has raised a colorable question of law: whether the BIA conformed with its own regulations mandating that it defer to the factual findings of the IJ, unless they are clearly erroneous, and that it refrain from engaging in independent factfinding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (iv). We agree that a <em>colorable </em>claim that the BIA applied an improper standard of review would present a legal question subject to our review. Nonetheless, we are without jurisdiction to review the merits of Hossain\u2019s petition because he has pointed to little of substance which would indicate that the BIA may have failed to conform with the requirements of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (iv). A comparison of the two opinions makes clear that the BIA did not, as Hos-sain contends, contradict or disturb the IJ\u2019s factual findings. Rather, the BIA balanced the equities and adverse factors and determined that, despite the IJ\u2019s conclusion to the contrary, the weight of the adverse factors precluded a favorable exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>cise of discretion. And, notably, Hossain readily concedes, as he must, that \u201cthe BIA has discretion to balance the equities and negatives in a different manner than an IJ[.]\u201d Hossain\u2019s Reply Br. 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">In short, although Hossain asserts that he is challenging the BIA\u2019s misapplication of a legal standard, in essence, his claim is only that the BIA insufficiently valued those equities upon which the IJ relied in finding that relief was warranted. <em>See, e.g., </em>Hossain\u2019s Br. 18 (\u201cThe equities were substantial in Mr. Hossain\u2019s case and inappropriately downplayed by the BIA and the DHS.\u201d). Hossain\u2019s petition thus challenges a discretionary determination and we are without jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Pareja, </em>615 F.3d at 187 (\u201cIf a claim is frivolous ... we lack jurisdiction to review it, no matter its label.... In other words, a party may not dress up a claim with legal clothing to invoke this Court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-13\">. Section 1229b(a) provides that the Attorney General may cancel the removal of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable if the alien:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-14\">(1) has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than 5 years,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-22\">(2) has resided in the United States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any status, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-23\">(3) has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-5\">. Hossain represented that he has not consumed alcohol since 2000 and that he stopped using marijuana, which he took to control pain, in 2007 and \"is now under the care of a physician for pain management.\u201d App. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\">. We summarily dispose of Hossain\u2019s claim that the BIA violated his right to due process by \u201cfailing] to act as a neutral fact finder and instead adopting] the DHS brief,\u201d Hossain's Br. 21, because \"an alien seeking discretionary relief from removal has no cognizable liberty or property interest.\u201d <em>Jean-Louis v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>582 F.3d 462, 465 n. 4 (3d Cir. 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
