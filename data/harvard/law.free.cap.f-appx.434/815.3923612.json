After a thorough review of the record, we conclude Willis\u2019s sentence is reasonable and thus affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-15\">Willis was indicted for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count 1), possession with intent to distribute at least 500 grams of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count 2), and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i) (Count 3), after a cooperating individual informed authorities that Willis was her methamphetamine supplier. The informant made several controlled purchases from Willis. Following the second purchase, Willis was stopped by state troopers and a search revealed a handgun in the car and two ounces of methamphetamine on Willis\u2019s person. During a subsequent search of Willis\u2019s home, police found one and a half pounds of methamphetamine and $11,000. Willis pleaded guilty to all three counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-16\">The probation officer determined the applicable guideline range for Counts 1 and 2 was 87 to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment, but there was a statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Count 3 carried a mandatory minimum of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, to run consecutively to Counts 1 and 2. The government moved for a reduction in sentence based on substantial assistance, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, which permitted the court to impose a sentence below the mandatory minimum, and proposed a downward departure of thirty percent on Counts 1 and 2. The government specified that its motion did not apply to Count 3. Willis requested a downward variance based on the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>granted a variance<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and sentenced Willis to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts 1 and 2, with a consecutive 60-month term on Count 3. The court noted Willis\u2019s family support and the fact that his arrest was a likely deterrent to future criminal conduct. The court then explained that it had taken into consideration the sentence given to the confidential informant, the government\u2019s suggested sentence, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and had determined that the sentence imposed was a reasonable one. This is Willis\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court is required to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). Willis has the burden of establishing that the sentence was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Reversal is only proper if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). The weight to be given any particular factor is left to the sound discretion of the district court absent a clear error of judgment. <em>Id. </em>The district court\u2019s sentence does not have to be the most appropriate sentence, but rather \u201cneed only be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1191 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">In this case, we conclude that Willis\u2019s 120-month total sentence is substantively reasonable. The district court imposed a 60-month sentence for Counts 1 and 2, which was below the applicable guideline range of 87 to 108 months, well below the maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and below the mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months. Although we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the guideline range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). Additionally, we have previously found a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>tence well below the maximum sentence available for the offense to be substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Although Willis argues that a lower sentence would be sufficient under \u00a7 3553(a)(2), he has not demonstrated that his sentence was outside the range of reasonable sentences. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. The record shows that in reaching its sentencing decision, the court noted that it had sentenced Willis to 10 months less than the sentence the confidential informant received. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). With regard to Count 3, the court ordered Willis to serve the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months, which the court was required to do. <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>228 F.3d 1294, 1303, 1304 (11th Cir.2000). The record also indicates that the court did not rely on the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities \u201csingle-mindedly\u201d to the detriment of all the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir.2006). Rather, the court listened to the arguments of both sides in making its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Because Willis has not met his burden to show an abuse of discretion, we affirm the sentence as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-6\">. In response to the government\u2019s question, the court clarified that the reduction was a downward variance rather than a downward departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-13\">. Willis does not argue that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
