The dismissal was based on his failure to comply with an order to pay an initial partial filing fee within thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-23\">Upon careful review, we conclude that the dismissal of Mr. Bailey\u2019s action was an abuse of discretion because \u2014 based on his certified inmate account statements \u2014 it appears that his failure to make an initial partial payment on time was due to a lack of available funds, and because the court neither inquired as to whether Mr. Bailey had attempted to comply with the court\u2019s order nor provided him an opportunity to explain his failure to make a timely initial payment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(1) (stating that court shall collect initial partial filing fee \u201cwhen funds exist\u201d), (b)(4) (providing that prisoner shall not be prohibited from bringing civil action because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>he lacks assets and means to pay initial partial filing fee); <em>Taylor v. Delatoore, </em>281 F.3d 844, 850 (9th Cir.2002) (for prisoners whose prior account balances resulted in assessment of initial fee, but who do not have funds available when payment is ordered, \u00a7 1915(b)(4) should protect them from having their cases dismissed for nonpayment); <em>Hatchet v. Nettles, </em>201 F.3d 651, 652-53 (5th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (holding that it was abuse of discretion for district court to dismiss action for failure to comply with initial partial filing fee order, without making some inquiry regarding whether prisoner had complied with order by submitting required consent form within time allowed for compliance); <em>see also Boyle v. Am. Auto. Serv., Inc., </em>571 F.3d 734, 742 (8th Cir.2009) (standard of review). In addition, it appears that the district court received and accepted Mr. Bailey\u2019s initial partial filing fee after the court dismissed his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s Rule 41(b) dismissal, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We also deny all pending motions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
