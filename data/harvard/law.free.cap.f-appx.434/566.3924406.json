The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 72 months in prison. On appeal, his counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the court erred by not varying downward and by imposing a sentence greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In a pro se brief, Thomas argues that counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-26\">We conclude that the sentence was not unreasonable: the record reflects that the district court carefully considered the section 3553(a) factors, explained why it chose not to vary downward, and imposed a sentence at the low end of the undisputed Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Bauer, </em>626 F.3d 1004, 1010 (8th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 460-61 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc). We decline to review Thomas\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim in this direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Looking Cloud, </em>419 F.3d 781, 788-89 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-27\">Having reviewed the record under <em>Pen-son v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfriv-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>olous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel leave to withdraw, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-18\">. The Honorable Ortrie D.
