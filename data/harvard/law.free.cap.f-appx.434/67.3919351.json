We affirmed the conviction and sentence, <em>United States v. Rhines, </em>143 Fed.Appx. 478 (3d Cir.2005), and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari, <em>Rhines v. United States, </em>546 U.S. 1210, 126 S.Ct. 1422, 164 L.Ed.2d 118 (2006). Since then, Rhines has continued to challenge his conviction and sentence. His motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was denied in 2007, and we denied a certificate of appealability. In 2010, we denied Rhines\u2019 application to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion (C.A. No. 10-2438), as well as a mandamus petition seeking the dismissal of his indictment (C.A. No. 10-2990). Recently, we denied his petition for a writ of error coram nobis. <em>United States v. Rhines, </em>640 F.3d 69 (3d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">Rhines filed a pro se habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the District Court in October 2010. He alleged that certain information in his pre-sen-tence report was erroneous, specifically that a prior state conviction should not have been used as a predicate offense to enhance his federal sentence because his counsel failed to file an appeal from that conviction. Rhines claimed that his custody level and eligibility for certain programs were adversely affected by the erroneous information and that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the enhanced sentence due to counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance. He sought to have the information removed from his file. The District Court construed Rhines\u2019 request for removal of the information as an action under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, and denied it, concluding that the Bureau of Prisons had taken reasonable steps to ensure that Rhines\u2019 prison record was accurate. In addition, and to the extent Rhines was attempting to challenge his sentence, the District Court held that he could not proceed in a habeas petition under \u00a7 2241, but rather must bring the claim in a \u00a7 2255 motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. If no substantial question is presented, we may summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order on any ground supported by the record. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6; <em>Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-15\">Rhines relied upon <em>Sellers v. Bureau of Prisons, </em>959 F.2d 307 (D.C.Cir.1992), to argue that he was entitled to have the allegedly erroneous prior conviction re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>moved from his prison record. In <em>Sellers, </em>an inmate sought damages from the Bureau of Prisons under the Privacy Act for failing to maintain accurate records and for making decisions adverse to him based on the inaccurate information. <em>Sellers, </em>959 F.2d at 310. The court held in pertinent part that the Bureau of Prisons was required under the Privacy Act to take reasonable steps to maintain accurate information in inmate records, so long as the information was capable of being verified. <em>Id. </em>at 312. In this case, Rhines\u2019 objection to the information in his pre-sentence report was reviewed by a Supervising U.S. Probation. Officer, who addressed his claims and confirmed that the challenged offense met the requirements to trigger an enhanced sentence. Although it is not clear that a claim seeking correction of a prison record can be brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2241, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the record shows that Rhines\u2019 claim lacks merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">We also agree that, to the extent Rhines is attempting to challenge his sentence, he cannot proceed in a \u00a7 2241 petition. \u201cMotions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences that are allegedly in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). A petitioner may, however, challenge a conviction or sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2241 where a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d i.e., \u201conly where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim.\u201d <em>Cradle v. United States, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Rhines has not made such a showing. He states in his habeas petition that the \u201cinformation\u201d regarding his prior state conviction \u201cwas not available during petitioner [sic] 2255 stage.\u201d Habeas Pet. at 4. Rhines apparently bases this assertion on a letter he received in 2010 from his lawyer in response to his request for the \u201ctranscripts\u201d of his 1995 and 1996 state cases. But this correspondence does not explain how Rhines could not have previously discovered that appeals had not been filed many years ago in his state cases, or that those convictions had been used to enhance his federal sentence. Rhines could have raised his claim as to his sentence on direct appeal. The \u201csafety valve\u201d provided by \u00a7 2255(e) is a narrow one that applies only in rare situations, such as when a prisoner has had no prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime later deemed not criminal due to a change in the law. <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997). Rhines has not demonstrated that his is such a rare situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">There being no substantial question presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-6\">. Rhines' action may also be foreclosed by regulation. <em>See Skinner v. United States Dep't of Justice, </em>584 F.3d 1093, 1096-97 (D.C.Cir. 2009), <em>White v. United States Prob. Office, </em>148 F.3d 1124, 1125 (D.C.Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
