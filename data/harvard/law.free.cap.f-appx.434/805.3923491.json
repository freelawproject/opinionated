They raise four arguments on appeal: (1) they had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a package delivered to 7635 Praver Drive East (\u201cPraver house\u201d), and thus had standing to challenge the search of that package; (2) the search of the package by an employee of United Parcel Service (\u201cUPS\u201d) violated the Fourth Amendment; (3) they had standing to challenge the search of the Praver house; and (4) there was insufficient evidence that the conspiracy involved more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana, thus requiring the reversal of their convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">In this same consolidated appeal, Sonia Antionette Dodd (\u201cDodd\u201d) appeals her 175-month sentence for conspiracy to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), and 846. On appeal, Dodd raises four arguments: (1) the government breached her plea agreement; (2) the district court was biased against her, which violated her due process rights; (3) her sentence was substantively unreasonable; and (4) the court erred by failing to provide a written statement of reasons justifying its sentence. After thorough review, we affirm in part, dismiss in part, and reverse and remand in part, for the district court to correct a clerical error in the judgments pertaining to Frederick and Alex.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its \u201capplication of the law to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Segura-Baltazar, </em>448 F.3d 1281, 1285 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s application of the [Sentencing [Guidelines <em>de novo,\u201d </em>and a district court\u2019s drug quantity calculation <em>for </em>clear error. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1253 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(de novo </em>review); <em>United States v. Mertilus, </em>111 F.3d 870, 873 (11th Cir.1997) (clear error review). We review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether the government breached a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>381 F.3d 1101, 1104 (11th Cir.2004). We also review the validity of a sentence appeal waiver <em>de novo. United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1352 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">However, when a claim \u2014 like a motion to suppress \u2014 has been waived before the district court, we decline to review it. <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>492 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2007) <em>(en banc). </em>Unlike waived claims, unpreserved arguments are reviewed <em>for </em>plain error. <em>Id. </em>Plain error review requires a defendant to show (1) an error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) that \u201cseriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Hasson, </em>333 F.3d 1264, 1276 (11th Cir.2003). An error is plain if it is \u201cclear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute.\u201d <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Plain error review in the context of a sufficiency argument requires us to affirm a conviction \u201cunless there is a manifest miscarriage of justice [because] the evidence on a key element of the offense is so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u201d <em>See United States v. Schier, </em>438 F.3d 1104, 1107 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). A sufficiency argument is only properly preserved where the defendant\u2019s argument in support of a judgment of acquittal is based on the same grounds as the defendant\u2019s argument on appeal. See <em>United States v. Straub, </em>508 F.3d 1003, 1010-11 (11th Cir.2007). In the context of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>an alleged plea agreement breach, the question of whether the defendant\u2019s substantial rights were affected is not whether the defendant would have entered into the plea, but rather, whether her sentence was affected by the government\u2019s breach. <em>Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1482-38, 1433 n. 4. A codefendant\u2019s objection is insufficient to preserve a defendant\u2019s argument where the defendant fails to object to the alleged rror himself. <em>See United States v. Gray, </em>626 F.2d 494, 501 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">First, we reject the Campbells\u2019s argument that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a package delivered to the Praver house, and thus had standing to challenge the search of that package. In challenging a search under the Fourth Amendment, the defendant bears the burden of establishing \u201cboth a subjective and an objective expectation of privacy\u201d in the area or object searched. <em>Segura-Baltazar, </em>448 F.3d at 1286. \u201cThe subjective component requires that a person exhibit an actual expectation of privacy, while the objective component requires that the privacy expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Although possession or ownership is one factor courts may consider when determining whether a defendant has a legitimate expectation of privacy in an object, it \u201cis not a proxy for determining whether the owner had a Fourth amendment interest, for it does not invariably represent the protected Fourth Amendment interest.\u201d <em>United States v. Salvucci, </em>448 U.S. 83, 91, 100 S.Ct. 2547, 65 L.Ed.2d 619 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">A defendant may have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a package even where the package is not addressed in the defendant\u2019s name, provided that he establishes a connection between himself and the addressee. <em>United States v. Richards, </em>638 F.2d 765, 767, 770 (5th Cir.1981) (holding that a defendant who opened a post office box for \u201cMehling Arts &amp; Crafts\u201d had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a package addressed to Mehling).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">Here, the district court correctly found that the Campbells did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the package delivered to the Praver house such that they could challenge the search of the package. Although Frederick accepted the package from an undercover officer, and the package was found in the backseat of a ear that Alex was driving, possession alone is insufficient to establish a Fourth Amendment interest in an object. <em>See Salvucci, </em>448 U.S. at 91, 100 S.Ct. 2547. Furthermore, while Alex\u2019s name was on the lease to the Praver house, the Campbells were not the sender or named addressee on the package, nor did they establish a connection to the named addressee or show that they used the name on the package as an alias. <em>Compare Richards, </em>638 F.2d at 770. Additionally, when Frederick spoke to the police, he attempted to distance himself from the package\u2019s addressee. Therefore, the Campbells did not have standing to challenge the search of the package, and we need not address whether the search violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">Second, we find no merit in the claim that they had standing to challenge the search of the Praver house. We review the evidence from a motion to suppress \u201cin the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Baron-Mantilla, </em>743 F.2d 868, 870 (11th Cir.1984). We may consider evidence presented at trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>when reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress. <em>United States v. Villabona-Gamica, </em>68 F.3d 1051, 1056 (11th Cir.1995). A defendant may have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a home that he does not own or rent if he shows \u201can unrestricted right of occupancy or custody and control of the premises as distinguished from occasional presence on the premises as a mere guest or invitee.\u201d <em>Baron-Mantilla, </em>743 F.2d at 870 (quotations omitted). Where there was testimony that a defendant did not live in a searched apartment, as well as testimony that someone other than the defendant had leased the apartment, the defendant had not shown that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the apartment. <em>United States v. Brazel, </em>102 F.3d 1120, 1148 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">At trial, Frederick testified that he did not live in the Praver house, and at the suppression hearing, the evidence showed that Frederick did not lease the house. Accordingly, since he did not establish that he was more than a mere guest at the Praver house, he did not have standing to challenge the search of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">As for Alex, we need not address his claim that he had standing to challenge the search of the Praver house. A motion to suppress evidence must be made before the deadline set by the court, or the suppression issue is waived. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(C), (c), (e). Alex did not address his expectation of privacy in the Praver house or the constitutionality of the search of the house until well after the court\u2019s deadline to file suppression motions had passed. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(c). Therefore, Alex has waived this claim, and we will not review it. <em>See Lewis, </em>492 F.3d at 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Third, we find no merit in the Camp-bells\u2019s argument that there was insufficient evidence that the conspiracy involved more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana, thus requiring the reversal of their convictions and sentences. To prove that a defendant violated 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cthat the defendant possessed a controlled substance knowingly and willfully and that he did so with the intent to distribute it.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1233. For sentencing purposes, any fact, other than a prior conviction, \u201cthat increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 301, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (quotation omitted). The statutory maximum \u201cis the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (emphasis omitted). Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), the statutory maximum is life imprisonment if the jury finds the defendant guilty of possessing with the intent to distribute 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(vii).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">For purposes of determining the base offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines, \u201c[t]he government must establish the drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Mertilus, </em>111 F.3d at 873. A defendant may be held responsible for \u201call drugs foreseeably distributed pursuant to\u201d a conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Here, the evidence showed that Frederick obtained marijuana through the mail and sold it to a number of customers. Based on shipping labels found in one of Frederick\u2019s storage units, shipping labels and receipts found in Alex\u2019s pocket when he was arrested, and the actual marijuana recovered by the officers, the jury could reasonably conclude that the conspiracy involved more than 1,000 kilograms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>marijuana. As a result, their convictions were, therefore, not shocking, and there was no plain error. <em>See Schier, </em>438 F.3d at 1107.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">There was also no sentencing error in this case. Because the jury explicitly found that both Frederick and Alex had conspired to distribute more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana, their maximum sentences were life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Based on the shipping labels and the actual marijuana recovered, the government sufficiently proved the drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence, and the district court correctly calculated Frederick\u2019s and Alex\u2019s base offense levels using that drug quantity. Accordingly, there has been no error, plain or otherwise, as to Frederick\u2019s or Alex\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Fourth, turning to Dodd\u2019s arguments on appeal, we reject her claim that the government breached her plea agreement. A defendant may appeal her sentence based on an alleged plea agreement breach even if the plea agreement contains a sentence appeal waiver. <em>Copeland, </em>381 F.3d at 1105. In determining whether the government breached a plea agreement, we apply an objective standard to determine whether the government acted consistently with the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding of the agreement when she pleaded guilty. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Under the terms of Dodd\u2019s plea agreement, the parties stipulated to a base offense level of 30. However, the probation officer calculated a higher base offense level of 32 based on previously suppressed evidence. In explaining the discrepancy, the prosecutor stated that it did not \u201creally disagree with [the] probation\u201d officer\u2019s calculation because reliable suppressed evidence could be taken into account for sentencing purposes. Thus, even if this statement breached the plea agreement, it was not a \u201cclear or obvious\u201d error because the government did not clearly argue for a position contrary to the plea agreement. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As for Dodd\u2019s argument that the government breached the plea agreement by asking for a mid-to-high end guideline range sentence, this request was not a breach because the plea agreement did not restrict the government from asking for a specific sentence. And finally, even assuming that the government plainly breached the plea agreement, the breach did not affect Dodd\u2019s substantial rights because it did not affect her sentence. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1432-33, 1433 n. 4. The district court explicitly stated that, even if it used the recommended base offense level of 30, it still would have sentenced Dodd to 175 months\u2019 imprisonment because any shorter sentence would have been insufficient given Dodd\u2019s role in the conspiracy, the scope of the conspiracy, and Dodd\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">Lastly, we dismiss Dodd\u2019s claims regarding her sentence that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>court was biased against her, that her sentence was substantively unreasonable, and that the court erred by failing to provide a written statement of reasons justifying its sentence. A sentence appeal waiver contained in a plea agreement is enforceable if it was made knowingly and voluntarily. <em>Bushert, </em>997 F.2d at 1350-51. To enforce a sentence appeal waiver, \u201c[t]he government must show that either (1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant concerning the sentence appeal waiver during the Rule 11 colloquy, or (2) it is manifestly clear from the record that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">In this case, the district court specifically questioned Dodd about her sentence appeal waiver during the plea colloquy, and she indicated that she understood the waiver and was voluntarily waiving her right to appeal her sentence. Therefore, Dodd knowingly and voluntarily entered into her sentence appeal waiver. Because no exceptions to her sentence appeal waiver apply, we dismiss all of her challenges to her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">:|: * *</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Based on the above, we affirm Frederick\u2019s and Alex\u2019s convictions and sentences. However, we remand to the district court to correct a clerical error in their judgments. In both Frederick\u2019s and Alex\u2019s judgments, Count 2 erroneously includes 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, which only applies to Count 1 of their convictions. As for Dodd, we reject her argument that the government breached the plea agreement, and we dismiss her appeal as to her challenges to her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REMANDED IN PART, AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-7\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) <em>(en banc), </em>we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit issued before October I, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\">.
