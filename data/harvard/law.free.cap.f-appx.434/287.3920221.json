On appeal, Miller contends that his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process was abridged by the district court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">This case involves a robbery at Tobacco House # 3, a convenience store located in Lumberton, North Carolina. At approximately 10:45 p.m., on October 28, 2008, George William Blackwell entered the store, purchased a drink, and left. Approximately five minutes later, he reentered the store, this time accompanied by Miller. As the pair entered the store, Blackwell pointed a gun at one of the store\u2019s employees, Yosef Gazali, who was standing behind the counter near the cash register. The pair repeatedly instructed Gazali to give them all of the money in the cash register. Initially, Gazali turned over only the $20 bills in the cash register. In response, Miller told Gazali to hand over all of the \u201cf* * *ing money.\u201d After Gazali delivered all of the money (approximately $800.00) from the cash register, Blackwell went behind the counter looking for the cash drawer that contained the state lottery receipts. As he moved toward the drawer, Blackwell passed a loaded shotgun that was stored behind the counter. From the drawer, Blackwell retrieved approximately $70.00. Meanwhile, Miller walked to a cooler in the store and grabbed a twelve-pack of beer. As the pair was leaving the store, Gazali grabbed the shotgun, pointed it at Miller and Blackwell, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>pulled the trigger, but the safety was on, preventing the shotgun from discharging.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">After Miller and Blackwell left the store, Gazali followed them, shotgun in hand, with the safety off. Gazali pursued the pair to the side of the store, where a red Mustang was parked. A shot was fired at Gazali, so he retreated, positioning himself near one of the doors to the store. Gazali then approached the Mustang and fired a shot at the car. As the car sped off, another shot was fired at Gazali, so he returned fire, hitting the back of the Mustang.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Shortly after the robbery, Detective Timothy Wilkins of the Lumberton Police Department was dispatched to the scene. Detective Wilkins interviewed Gazali and another store employee, Nasr Alnagger, and collected evidence outside of the store, including a shotgun shell casing and the twelve-pack of beer that Miller had taken from the store, but had left in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Within a day of the Tobacco House # 3 robbery, law enforcement officers began to suspect that Blackwell and his friend and associate, Dixie Lynn Oxendine, were involved in the robbery, because Blackwell was a suspect in two October 2008 bank robberies and Dixie Oxendine\u2019s red Mustang fit the description of the car described by Gazali as leaving the scene of the robbery at Tobacco House # 3. By this time, a state warrant had been issued for the arrest of Blackwell in one of those bank robberies. Suspecting that Blackwell and Dixie Oxendine might be staying together, law enforcement officers investigated their whereabouts and discovered that Dixie Oxendine was staying at a Howard Johnson\u2019s hotel in Lumberton.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">On the morning of October 31, 2008, law enforcement officers arrived at the Howard Johnson\u2019s. The law enforcement officers received information that Dixie Oxen-dine was sharing a room registered in her name with two adult males, later identified as Miller and Blackwell, and an adult female, later identified as Dawn Oxendine. Because of the threat of a shootout, the arrest plan involved getting one of the room\u2019s occupants to answer the door. Two detectives from the Lumberton Police Department and FBI Special Agent Frank Brostrom approached the room. After knocking on the door a couple of times, Blackwell answered the door and was promptly arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Following Blackwell\u2019s arrest, a protective sweep of the room was conducted. During the sweep, law enforcement officers recovered an AMT Automag II .22 Caliber Rimfire gun. A hat and jacket worn by Blackwell during the Tobacco House #3 robbery were also recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">Miller, Blackwell, and Dixie Oxendine were interviewed later that morning at the Lumberton Police Department. During her interview, Dixie Oxendine admitted that, on the night of the Tobacco House # 3 robbery, she drove Blackwell and Miller in her red Mustang to the store to get cigarettes and beer. After they arrived, Blackwell \u201csuddenly exited the car[,] ... pulled out a gun ... and walked towards the gas station with Mr. Miller.\u201d A short time later, Blackwell ran back to the car yelling: \u201cGo, Dixie, go.\u201d Dixie Oxendine also recalled the exchange of shots between Blackwell and Gazali, leaving Miller at the scene, and picking him up later on while he was walking along a local highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">During his interview, Miller initially denied knowing that Blackwell had robbed a bank. He also indicated that he neither saw Blackwell with a gun, nor knew he owned one. As his interview progressed, Miller\u2019s story changed. He admitted that he had lied about Blackwell because he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>not want to tell on him; that he knew Blackwell owned a gun, having seen it about a month before in Blackwell\u2019s back pocket; that he knew Blackwell had robbed a bank because the two had discussed it; and that he knew that Blackwell was wanted for bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">When asked about the Tobacco House # 3 robbery, Miller initially said that he went into the store with Blackwell to buy beer and cigarettes, and, once inside the store, Blackwell suddenly pulled out a gun and \u201cdoes this robbery.\u201d Miller said he then dropped his beer and ran out of the store, catching up later with Blackwell. However, after Miller was shown the video of the robbery,, \u201che shut down,\u201d refusing to answer any further questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">On January 8, 2009, Miller, Blackwell, and Dixie Oxendine were charged in an eight-count indictment. Counts One and Two charged Blackwell with bank robbery, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2113(a), stemming from two October 2008 bank robberies, one on October 9, 2008, the other on October 21, 2008. Counts Three through Five related to the robbery of a BP Sun-Do convenience store in Lumberton on October 13, 2008.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Counts Six through Eight related to the Tobacco House #3 robbery. Count Six charged Miller, Blackwell, and Dixie Oxen-dine with interference with commerce by robbery, and aiding and abetting the same, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1951 and 2, and Count Seven charged Miller, Blackwell, and Dixie Oxen-dine with using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, and aiding and abetting the same, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and 2. Count Eight charged Blackwell with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">Prior to Miller\u2019s trial, Blackwell pled guilty to Counts One, Six, and Seven pursuant to a plea agreement, and Dixie Ox-endine pled guilty to Counts Six and Seven, also pursuant to a plea agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 1, 2009, Miller and the government each filed their respective proposed witness list, and each list included Blackwell as a possible witness. On the same day, Miller\u2019s two-day jury trial began.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">The government presented six witnesses in its case-in-chief, and none in rebuttal. The government\u2019s case rested on, among other things, statements made to law enforcement officers by Miller and his co-defendants, the testimony of the six witnesses called by the government, and certain physical evidence recovered at the scene, including a video of the robbery, the twelve-pack of beer left at the scene by Miller, and the shotgun shell casing fired from the shotgun used by Gazali.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">At the beginning of the second day of trial, just before the government called its last witness, Blackwell\u2019s counsel notified the district court that Miller intended to call Blackwell as a witness and that he instructed Blackwell not to testify. In response, the district court engaged in an extensive colloquy with Blackwell\u2019s counsel, Miller\u2019s counsel, and the Assistant United States Attorney. Blackwell\u2019s counsel was concerned that, by testifying, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Blackwell would place in jeopardy the application of an acceptance of responsibility downward adjustment at his sentencing, and, far worse, would result in the application of an obstruction of justice enhancement. Blackwell\u2019s counsel also was concerned about Blackwell\u2019s recollection of the events, considering \u201csome of the things that were in his system at that time,\u201d namely, alcohol and Xanaxes. Miller\u2019s counsel stressed that all the defense wanted was for Blackwell to testify truthfully, reasoning that truthful testimony would have no impact on Blackwell\u2019s sentencing. Although Miller\u2019s counsel was not exactly clear about how that truthful testimony would be favorable to Miller, the record suggests that Miller\u2019s counsel believed that Blackwell would testify that it was his idea to rob the Tobacco House # 3 and not Miller\u2019s, and that Blackwell would say that Miller had no idea that a gun would be used in the robbery. At the conclusion of its colloquy with counsel, the district court decided that Blackwell would testify outside the presence of the jury with his attorney by his side, thus, allowing the district court to decide which questions Miller\u2019s counsel later could ask Blackwell in the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">At the beginning of the <em>voir dire </em>examination by Miller\u2019s counsel, Blackwell answered a series of questions concerning the contents of his plea agreement and the clothing he wore on the night of the Tobacco House # 3 robbery. At this point, the district court remarked that, \u201cso far ... there is no basis for the Fifth Amendment by the testifying witness.\u201d Blackwell also identified the AMT Automag II .22 Caliber Rimfire gun and a clip for the gun, and admitted the gun was used during the robbery. He answered questions concerning the red Mustang and who was, and who was not, present in the car leaving the scene of the robbery. The district court did, however, allow Blackwell, with the assistance of his counsel, to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination to questions concerning Miller\u2019s involvement in the robbery, including whether it was Miller\u2019s idea to rob the store, whether Miller was with Blackwell when the store was robbed, whether Miller touched the gun, and whether Miller was in the car as it left the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">At the conclusion of Blackwell\u2019s testimony, the district court recessed court to allow it and counsel to further research the Fifth/Sixth Amendment issue. The district court discussed the issue with counsel in chambers, and, later, in open court, but outside the presence of the jury, ruled that: (1) Miller could call Blackwell to testify; (2) Blackwell could testify with his attorney at his side; and (3) it would listen to the \u201cquestions and make rulings if [ it] believe[d] there is a basis for a Fifth Amendment issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Blackwell was the only witness called by the defense. Consistent with the district court\u2019s ruling, he testified with his attorney at his side. During his testimony, Blackwell acknowledged his plea agreement and identified the hat and jacket he wore during the Tobacco House # 3 robbery. As allowed by the district court, Blackwell asserted the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in response to only one question, whether he was \u201ccarrying or using [the] gun when [he] entered the store on October 29.\u201d Blackwell did acknowledge, in response to Miller\u2019s counsel\u2019s next question, that he pleaded guilty to brandishing a firearm during the robbery. He also acknowledged that the hat and gun recovered from the Howard Johnson\u2019s hotel were used during the robbery. Blackwell identified the red Mustang and acknowledged that Miller was not in the car as it sped away from the scene. In response to the question of whether Miller knew that he was going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>rob the store, Blackwell replied: \u201cI don\u2019t remember nothing much about that night that would hardly help anybody.\u201d In response to a similar question, \u201cyou didn\u2019t tell [Miller] that you were going to rob the store before you robbed it,\u201d Blackwell replied: \u201cI might have did. I don\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Following closing arguments by counsel and the district court\u2019s jury instructions, the case went to the jury. The jury convicted Miller on both counts. He was sentenced to a total of 324 months\u2019 imprisonment, and this timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Miller contends that his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process was violated by the district court. In particular, he contends that the district court did not conduct a sufficient inquiry into the validity of Blackwell\u2019s assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and thus violated his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process. Alternatively, Miller suggests that, to avoid the Sixth Amendment violation, the district court was required to order the government to grant Blackwell immunity. We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The Supreme Court has \u201cbroadly construed\u201d the protection afforded by the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Maness v. Meyers, </em>419 U.S. 449, 461, 95 S.Ct. 584, 42 L.Ed.2d 574 (1975); <em>see also Hoffman v. United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S.Ct. 814, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951) (instructing lower courts to</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">give the privilege a \u201cliberal construction\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the privilege \u201cnot only extends to answers that would in themselves support a conviction under a federal criminal statute but likewise embraces those which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a federal crime.\u201d <em>Hoffman, </em>341 U.S. at 486, 71 S.Ct. 814. A defense witness\u2019s invocation of the privilege is proper unless it is \u201cperfectly clear, from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case,\u201d that the defense witness \u201cis mistaken\u201d and his answers could not \u201cpossibly have\u201d a \u201ctendency to incriminate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 71 S.Ct. 814 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 191 (4th Cir.2007) (\u201cBecause requiring a witness to prove the necessity of the privilege would often vitiate the privilege itself, \u2018it need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Hoffman, </em>341 U.S. at 486-87, 71 S.Ct. 814). Moreover, a defense witness retains the privilege even after pleading guilty, and a sentencing court may not draw adverse inferences from a pleading defendant\u2019s silence. <em>Mitchell v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 314, 329-30, 119 S.Ct. 1307, 143 L.Ed.2d 424 (1999); <em>see also id. </em>at 326, 119 S.Ct. 1307 (noting that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination generally remains available, absent a valid waiver, until a defendant\u2019s \u201csentence has been fixed and the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>conviction has become final\u201d). And it is the responsibility of the district court to determine whether the privilege should be invoked. <em>Hoffman, </em>341 U.S. at 486, 71 S.Ct. 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">A witness\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination often can rub up against a defendant\u2019s right under the Sixth Amendment to compulsory process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, if a defense witness refuses to testify on the basis of the privilege, the district court \u201cmust make a proper and particularized inquiry into the legitimacy and scope of the witnesses] assertion of the privilege.\u201d <em>Gaskins v. McKellar, </em>916 F.2d 941, 950 (4th Cir.1990). The privilege operates on a question-by-question basis, <em>United States v. Castro, </em>129 F.3d 226, 229 (1st Cir.1997), but a \u201cwitness may be totally excused ... if the court finds that he could legitimately refuse to answer any and all relevant questions.\u201d <em>Gaskins, </em>916 F.2d at 950.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In this case, the district court proceeded with commendable caution. It prohibited Blackwell from invoking the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination on a wholesale basis. In an attempt to narrow the assertion of the privilege, the district court conducted a thorough <em>voir dire </em>hearing to ascertain the questions Miller\u2019s counsel sought to pose and the scope of the privilege sought by Blackwell. When Blackwell eventually testified before the jury, the district court allowed Blackwell\u2019s counsel to stand by his client to confer, and the procedure correctly allowed Blackwell, as opposed to his attorney, to assert the privilege, and allowed the district court to rule on a question-by-question basis. Understandably, Blackwell\u2019s counsel sought to prevent Miller\u2019s counsel from eliciting testimony concerning Miller\u2019s involvement in the crime, considering Blackwell\u2019s inability to recall specifics and the effect such vague testimony would have on Blackwell\u2019s ability to receive favorable treatment at sentencing. Clearly, when one considers the video evidence before the jury and Miller\u2019s knowledge of the gun, testimony from Blackwell tending to exculpate Miller would have subjected Blackwell to the charge of perjury. Moreover, testimony from Blackwell exculpating Miller would have jeopardized Blackwell\u2019s ability to receive an acceptance of responsibility downward adjustment at his sentencing, and perhaps resulted in an enhancement for obstruction of justice as well. Thus, Blackwell\u2019s counsel prudently sought to protect Blackwell from further charges and increased penalties. Accordingly, we reject Miller\u2019s argument that the district court did not conduct a sufficient inquiry into the validity of Blackwell\u2019s assertion of the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">We also find no merit to Miller\u2019s contention that the district court was required to order the government to grant Blackwell immunity. It is well-settled that a district court does not have the authority to grant immunity, even where the grant of immunity would allow a defendant to present material, favorable evidence. <em>United States v. Moussaoui, </em>382 F.3d 453, 467 (4th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Abbas, </em>74 F.3d 506, 511-12 (4th Cir.1996). However, a district court can compel the government to \u201cgrant immunity when (1) the defendant makes a decisive showing of prosecutorial misconduct or overreaching and (2) the proffered evidence would be material, exculpatory and unavailable from all other sources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>In this case, there is no evidence of misconduct or overreaching by the government. Indeed, there is no suggestion that the government delayed Blackwell\u2019s sentencing to preserve his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination or did anything to gain an unfair tactical advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">We also note that, assuming there was a Sixth Amendment error in this case, such assumed error would be harmless. <em>See United States v. Sayles, </em>296 F.3d 219, 223 (4th Cir.2002) (noting that a Sixth Amendment compulsory process claim is subject to harmless error analysis). A Sixth Amendment compulsory process error is \u201charmless if it is \u2018clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 18, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In this case, the evidence of Miller\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. Gazali testified that Miller and Blackwell entered the Tobacco House # 3, with Blackwell pointing a gun at him. Both Miller and Blackwell approached the counter and demanded money. Gazali confirmed his testimony with the video of the robbery, which showed Miller and Blackwell together entering the store with a gun drawn and pointed at Gazali, repeatedly threatening Gazali, and demanding money. Dixie Ox-endine admitted to driving Miller and Blackwell to the store where Blackwell pulled out a gun, and, together with Miller, went into the store. In his statement, Miller admitted that he knew Blackwell owned a gun, having seen it a month prior to the robbery, and that he knew Blackwell had robbed a bank. Miller also lied concerning his knowledge of, and participation in, the robbery. Moreover, any testimony from Blackwell was suspect, because he testified that he could not \u201cremember ... much about that night that would hardly help anybody.\u201d Given the evidence at trial, the result would not have been any different had Blackwell been willing to testify favorably (albeit falsely) for the defense. Unquestionably, a rational jury presented with such testimony would have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Miller was guilty of the charges contained in Counts Six and Seven of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-6\">.
