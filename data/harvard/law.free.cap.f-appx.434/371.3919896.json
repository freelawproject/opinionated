Eighth Amendment violations, however, do not arise \u201cuntil after [the State] has secured a formal adjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of law. Where the State seeks to impose punishment without such an adjudication, the pertinent constitutional guarantee is the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Ingraham v. Wright, </em>430 U.S. 651, 671 n. 40, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977). Because Stiles merely terminated Reid\u2019s employment, the Eighth Amendment\u2019s protections are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
