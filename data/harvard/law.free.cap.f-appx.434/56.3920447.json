For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-22\">Because we write primarily for the parties, we need not repeat the facts and procedural history of this case. Moreover, the district court has ably summarized the relevant background. <em>See Reinert v. LSI Corp., </em>2010 WL 2730756 (E.D.Pa. July 9, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-23\">On appeal, Reinert contends that the district court improperly granted summary judgment based on its erroneous conclusion that Reinert failed to establish a pri-ma facie case under \u00a7 510 of ERISA and, that even if she had done so, she could not establish that LSI\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>employment was pretextual.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In his detailed and thoughtful opinion filed in this case, Judge Gardner carefully and clearly explained his reasons for holding that Reinert could not establish a \u00a7 510 claim. <em>See id. </em>We can add little to his discussion or analysis and we will therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of LSI for substantially the same reasons as set forth in that opinion without further elaboration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-18\">. Additionally, Reinert argues that the district court should not have granted LSI summary judgment on her \u00a7 510 claim because LSI continued to employ her after October 24, 2007 and therefore she was entitled to her full service pension. Pursuant to \u00a7 510, it is unlawful \"for any person to discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary ... for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant <em>may become entitled </em>under the plan, this subchapter, or the Welfare Pension Plans Disclosure Act.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140 (emphasis added). Section 510 does not provide a cause of action for wrongful denial of pension benefits already accrued. Thus, Reinert\u2019s alleged continued employment with LSI is inapposite to her \u00a7 510 claim, the only ERISA claim she has pursued.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
