Yarbrough appeals, and his counsel has moved to withdraw, submitting a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to vary downward based on Yarbrough\u2019s youth and newfound desire for positive change.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-24\">We conclude Yarbrough has failed to rebut the presumption that his sentence, which falls at the bottom of the advisory Guidelines range, is not substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc). Additionally, having conducted careful review of the proceedings under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivo-lous issues for appeal. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-17\">. The Honorable Richard E.
