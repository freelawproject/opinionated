Following careful review, we conclude the district court\u2019s finding that Honarmand\u2019s attorney had authority to settle the case was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Mueller v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., </em>148 F.3d 414, 415-16 (8th Cir. 1998) (holding that court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous in light of credibility determinations to which appellate court deferred, evidence in record supporting court\u2019s findings, and reasonable inferences drawn by court from evidence); <em>see also Harris v. Ark. State Highway &amp; Transp. Dep\u2019t, </em>437 F.3d 749, 750-51 (8th Cir.2006) (party who denies that attorney was authorized to enter into settlement bears \u201cheavy burden\u201d to prove that authorization was not given; express authority can be created by, inter alia, written words of principal which cause agent to believe that principal desires him to act in particular manner). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-18\">. The Honorable James M.
